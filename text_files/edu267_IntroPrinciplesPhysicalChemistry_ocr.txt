PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 
In preparing the second edition the author has adhered to the 
general plan and arrangement of subject matter adopted in the 
first edition. While some changes and additions have been made 
to practically every chapter in the book, the revision has con- 
sisted chiefly in the incorporation of new material representing 
the scientific advances which have been made during the past 
six years.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 
As indicated by the title, the purpose of this book is to present 
the principles of modern physical chemistry in the form of a sys- 
tematic course of instruction and training. While designed pri- 
marily for classes composed of students who purpose to become 
professional chemists or physicists, it is hoped that it will serve as 
a suitable foundational course for any class of students who wish 
to obtain a usable knowledge of the subject. To the student or 
reader who wishes merely a general or cultural familiarity with the 
field covered by physical chemistry the book will probably not 
appeal very strongly, since the subject is designedly presented in 
such a manner as to require the student to do a large part of the 
reasoning, and many portions of the book can scarcely be pursued 
to advantage by most beginners in the subject except under the 
direction of a competent instructor. 
The method of presentation adopted presupposes on the part 
of the student a collegiate training in general or elementary chem- 
istry and in general physics, and a training in mathematics 
which includes the elements of the differential and integral 
calculus. The author is aware that in many elementary text- 
books of Physical Chemistry it is customary to avoid the use of 
the calculus as far as possible, frequently even with the sacrifice 
of accuracy and at the risk of conveying erroneous impressions 
concerning some of the most fundamental relationships; and in 
those cases where the use of the calculus seems to be unavoidable 
some authors have felt it incumbent upon themselves to assume 
a somewhat apologetic attitude and to explain that the student 
must take on faith “these few derivations” but that he should 
not allow this fact to worry him, since with the aid of the ac- 
companying explanations and illustrations he will still be able to 
understand the relationships and to apply them, even though he 
is not in a position to appreciate clearly what is involved in their 
derivation. With this dilettant attitude the writer finds himself 
entirely out of sympathy and the literature of chemistry unfor- 
tunately abounds in illustrations of the dangers of inculeating 
vii
-P-A-G-E-8
  
  ‘viii PREFACE 
such an attitude in the mind of the student. In the following 
pages the calculus has been freely employed, and while pains 
have been taken to explain, illustrate and emphasize the signifi- 
cance and physical meaning of the derived relationships, the 
student who is unfamiliar with the calculus will probably realize 
that his grasp of the subject must in many particulars be very 
inadequate and if he hopes to employ the laws and principles of 
Physical Chemistry in an intelligent and confident manner, he is 
strongly advised to acquire the elements of the calculus before 
attempting to secure any special training in Physical Chemistry. 
For a well-rounded introductory course in Physical Chemistry 
the present book will be found lacking in one very essential fea- 
ture. As implied by the title, no attempt has been made to 
deal with the laboratory side of the subject and in the few in- 
stances where special apparatus is figured, the figure is usually 
merely a diagrammatic one and the discussion of the method of 
measurement is restricted to making clear the nature of the quan- 
tity or phenomenon under consideration. It is assumed therefore 
that the instructor who makes use of the present text will accom- 
pany the class-room instruction in the principles of the subject 
with a closely correlated laboratory course dealing with the 
application of these principles to specific cases and familiarizing 
the student with some of the more important methods of phys- 
ico-chemical measurements. Some of the peculiarities in the 
arrangement of the text are the result of an effort to make it 
easier to correlate the laboratory work with the class-room work 
and at the same time adapt it to the exigencies of semester 
class schedules and the necessity sometimes of making one set 
of apparatus serve a number of students in succession. It is for 
this reason, for example, that the subject of solutions is taken up 
before Chapters XIX and XX, which might otherwise more log- 
ically follow Chapter X. The arrangement is one which the 
author has found to work well with his own classes. 
Perhaps the most radical departure from the custom which 
under the leadership of Ostwald has prevailed heretofore in most 
text-books of Physical Chemistry is in connection with the 
manner in which atomistics and molecular kinetics are treated. 
Instead of considering these systems in a special chapter as in-
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE ix 
teresting but unnecessary hypothetical explanations of observed 
facts, they are themselves in their most essential features treated 
as facts already established beyond the possibility of reasonable 
doubt, and together with thermodynamics, are made to serve as 
the framework for the development of the whole subject. Even 
in the case of thermodynamics an attempt has been made in 
Chapter X to convey to the mind of the beginning student some 
idea of that fundamental relationship between atomistics and 
thermodynamics which was brought to light by the labors of 
Boltzmann. 
In institutions where the time available for class-room work in 
Physical Chemistry is equivalent to five semester hours, it will 
usually be possible to take up in detail some of the more im- 
portant thermodynamic derivations, and to facilitate this the 
derivations of practically all the thermodynamic equations em- 
ployed in this book are given in the Appendix with the proper 
cross references in the body of the text. In many institutions, 
however, the short time available for the introductory course in 
Physical Chemistry makes it necessary to postpone most of the 
thermodynamics to more advanced courses. The arrangement 
of the text has been made with this state of affairs in mind and 
the discussion and use of the Second Law in the body of the text 
is largely restricted to making clear the purely energetic char- 
acter of thermodynamic reasoning, so that when a relation is 
given as a purely thermodynamic one the student may have a 
proper appreciation of the very dependable character of its foun- 
dation, even though the details of all the derivations cannot be 
taken up in the class room. It is hoped also that the Appendix 
will be found useful as a convenient reference for the occasional 
inquiring mind which is not satisfied to take the thermodynamic 
equations on faith. 
In many cases the development of the principles and in all 
cases their applications are presented in the form of problems, of 
which the book will be found to contain a considerable number. 
For some of these the author is indebted to friends and col- 
leagues, and to other texts, especially to Noyes and Sherrill’s 
General Principles of Chemistry which was made accessible to the 
writer through the kindness of its authors. Most of the prob-
-P-A-G-E-10
  x PREFACE 
lems, however, have been expressly prepared for this book and un- 
less otherwise stated the numerical data given are the results of 
actual experiments. It is not expected that any one group of 
students will work all of the problems in the book. Some of them 
are too difficult for the beginner to solve alone and are intended 
to be worked out in the class room by the instructor with what- 
ever assistance he is able to secure from the members of the class; 
others (such as problem 4, Chapter XX) will be found more use- 
ful in connection with advanced courses, but it is hoped that the 
number and variety is sufficient to make them adaptable to any 
class. The author will esteem it a favor if users of the text will 
call his attention to errors in any of these problems or in any 
other part of the book. 
During the preparation of this book the author has sought the 
suggestions and criticisms of his friends in regard to many points 
and is glad of this opportunity to acknowledge his indebtedness 
to them. For permission to make use of important material 
before its regular publication he is indebted to the kindness of 
Professors R. A. Millikan, 8. J. Bates, C. A. Kraus and W. D. 
Harkins. He has also profited by valuable criticisms received 
from Professors A. A. Noyes, R. C. Tolman, and R. A. Millikan, 
and from his colleagues and former students, Doctors D. A. 
MacInnes, 8. J. Bates, E. B. Millard, and others. To Dr. 
Millard he is also indebted for valued assistance in the reading of 
proof. 
The first 14 chapters of the book were written in 1913 and a pre- 
liminary edition of this part of the book was published in 1914. 
Much of the remainder of the book has also been in type since the 
early part of the present year and has been in use in the author’s 
classes. This opportunity to test the book in actual class use 
previous to its formal publication was accorded by the publishers 
and has contributed materially to the detection and elimination 
of errors.

INTRODUCTION 
Derinitions AND Units oF MrAsuREMENT 
1. Physical Chemistry.—Physical chemistry, sometimes called 
also theoretical or general chemistry, treats of the fundamental 
laws and principles and the important theories and systems of 
classification which have been formulated in order to give scien- 
tific expression to our knowledge of the physical and chemical 
behavior of material substances. 
2. Physical Quantities and Units.—Physical quantities and 
units not specifically or inferentially defined in the pages of this 
book are assumed to be familiar to the student from his previous 
study of chemistry and physics. For convenience in reference, 
however, the definitions of the three fundamental c.g.s. units and 
of a few other quantities are given below. For a more complete 
list the student will find Guthe’s Definitions in Physics con- 
venient for reference. 
3. The Centimeter.—The unit of length in the c.g.s. system is 
defined as zy part of a standard meter. The standard meter 
is a length equivalent to the distance between the defining lines 
on the international prototype meter at the International Bureau 
of Weights and Measures (at Sévres, France) when this standard 
is at 0°C. This standard of length has been protected against all 
possibility of loss through an accurate comparison with the wave 
length of the red line of the cadmium spectrum which showed that 
the standard meter was equal to 15,531,634.1 of these wave 
lengths. 
4, The Gram.—The unit of mass in the c.g.s. system is defined 
as ivoo part of the standard kilogram. The standard kilo- 
gram is a mass equivalent to the mass of the international proto- 
type kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and 
Measures. 
5. The Second.—The unit of time in the ¢.g.s. system is defined 
as equal to ya-ro0 part of a mean solar day. 
xi  
-P-A-G-E-12
xii INTRODUCTION 
6. Dimensional Formule.—The dimensional formula of any 
quantity is an expression showing which of the three fundamental 
¢.g.s. units enter into its own unit, and the dimensions, as indi- 
cated by exponents, with which they appear. Thus the dimen- 
sional equation for viscosity is 
[n] = [ml-4-"] 
7. The Liter.—The liter is a unit of capacity equivalent to the 
volume occupied by 1 kilogram of pure water at its maximum 
density and under a pressure of one atmosphere. It is equivalent 
to 1000.027 ¢.c. The yyv part of a liter is also frequently called 
a “cubic centimeter” by chemists, although this terminology is, 
strictly speaking, incorrect, as the milli-liter is 0.0027 per cent. 
larger than the cubic centimeter. 
8. Units of Electricity—The electrostatic unit of electricity is 
that quantity of electricity which repels an equal quantity, at a 
distance of 1 cm. in vacuo, with a force of 1 dyne. Its dimen- 
sions are 
Lae] = [mite] 
The electromagnetic unit of electricity is 3X10! electrostatic 
units, 310° cm. per sec. being the velocity of light in a vac- 
uum. Its dimensions are 
[am] = [mile] 
The absolute coulomb is a practical unit of electricity defined as 
one-tenth of the c.g.s. electromagnetic unit. The international 
coulomb is a technical unit which, as defined by the last Interna- 
tional Conference on Electrical Units and Standards, is the 
quantity of electricity required to yield a deposit of 0.00111800 
gram ina silver coulometer (XVI, 5) constructed and handled in 
a certain specified manner. According to the most recent deter- 
minations at the National Bureau of Standards the international 
coulomb is about 0.004 per cent. less than the absolute coulomb. 
9. Units of Electrical Resistance.—The c.g.s. unit of electrical 
resistance in the electromagnetic system is that resistance in 
which heat equivalent to 1 erg is produced when one unit of 
electricity passes through the resistance as a steady current for 
1second. Its dimensions are 
[R] = [mle] 
the same as those of velocity.
-P-A-G-E-13
INTRODUCTION xiii 
The absolute ohm is a practical unit of electrical resistance 
defined as 10° c.g.s. electromagnetic units. “The international 
ohm is the resistance offered to an unvarying electric current by a 
column of mercury at the temperature of melting ice, 14.4521 
grams in mass, of a constant cross-sectional area, and of length 
of 106.300 cm.” 
The other electrical units are defined in terms of the two given 
above. 
10. Dielectric Constant—The dielectric constant or specific 
inductive capacity of a substance is the reciprocal of the propor- 
tionality constant in Coulomb’s* Law 
1 ue faty 
f being the electric force acting between two charges (q; and qe) 
of electricity 1 cm. apart. Its unit of measurement is the di- 
electric constant of a vacuum and its dimensions are accordingly 
[K] = [mlt?] 
System or Notation AND REFERENCES 
11. Notation—A consistent system of notation is used 
throughout this book. It follows very closely the system adopted 
by the International Commission for the Unification of Physico- 
chemical Symbols, with the addition of descriptive subscripts. 
Letters and symbols denoting physical quantities and constants 
are in most instances in Italics, and letters denoting chemical 
substances, in Roman capitals. 
12, References.—Literature references are collected at the 
end of each chapter and are numbered to accord with reference 
numbers in the text. These references are intended to cover 
only the most recent literature but by consulting this literature 
the student will find further references which will open up to 
him the complete literature of any topic on which he desires 
further information. 
Cross references throughout the book are to chapter and section 
instead of to page. Thus (XVI, 2) signifies Chapter XVI, sec- 
tion 2; and equation (5, XX) refers to equation number 5 of 
Chapter XX. The student should consult the cross references 
whenever they occur.

PRINCIPLES OF 
PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
CHAPTERI 
THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER AND THE COMPOSITION 
OF SUBSTANCES 
1. The Rise of the Atomic Theory.?— The problem of the consti- 
tution of material bodies is one which has interested philosophers 
since the dawn of history. Some time prior to 500 B. C., the 
Hindu philosopher Kanada held the theory that material bodies 
are not continuous but are made up of very small indivisible 
particles, which are in a constant state of motion, flying about in 
all directions. This theory, known as tlie atomic theory, was also 
advanced about 500 B. C. by Leucippus, the founder of the Greek 
atomistic school, and was further developed by his pupil Democ- 
ritus to whose writings we owe all of our knowledge of the begin- 
nings of the atomistic philosophy of the Greeks. These ancient 
atomic theories were, however, entirely the result of purely meta- 
physical speculation without any experimental basis and until the 
birth of experimental science no further progress in this direction 
was possible. 
The first noteworthy attempt to interpret the known behavior 
of material bodies in terms of the atomic theory was made in 
1743 by Lomonossoff,* a Russian physical chemist, but his work 
@ Michael Vassilievitch Lomonossoff (1711-1765), born of peasant parents 
in a little village near Archangel, became professor of chemistry in the 
Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg and in 1748 built the first chemical 
laboratory for instruction and research. His publications stamp him as one 
of the greatest of physical chemists. His ideas of elements, molecules, 
atoms, heat, and light were essentially the same as those held today and in 
many ways he was so much ahead of his time that his work was ridiculed 
and forgotten until resurrected by Menschutkin in 1904 (See Alexander 
Smith, Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc., 34, 109 (1912)).

  2 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. I 
unfortunately remained unknown outside of Russia until’ 1904. 
Meanwhile in 1803, John Dalton,” in England, had given to the 
world the modern atomic theory, which has played such an im- 
portant réle in the development of the science of chemistry. 
Although this theory proved of the greatest assistance in the inter- 
pretation and correlation of the known facts of chemistry as well 
as in pointing the way toward new discoveries, it was nevertheless 
merely a theory, for however useful atoms and molecules, as 
concepts, might be in interpreting the data of science, they have, 
until recent years, been regarded merely as convenient hypothe- 
ses, not as actualities. 
During recent years, however, a flood of new and more refined 
methods of investigation has thrown a powerful light upon the old 
question of the structure of matter. This new evidence is, more- 
over, of such a striking and convincing character and comes from 
such a great variety of different sources that chemists and physi- 
cists of the present day may now accept the atomic and molecular 
structure of matter as a fact established beyond the possibility of 
reasonable doubt. Some of the more important pieces of evi- 
dence which have led to this result will be presented during the 
development of our subject. 
2. The Structure of Matter.—Our present qualitative knowl- 
edge concerning the structure of matter and the composition of 
chemical substances may be briefly summed up as follows: 
(a) Atoms.—Every elementary substance is made up of 
exceedingly small particles called atoms which are all alike and 
which cannot be further subdivided or broken up by chemical 
processes. It will be noted that this statement is virtually a 
definition of the term elementary substance and a limitation of 
the term chemical process. ‘There are as many different classes 
or families of atoms as there are chemical elements. 
(b) Molecules.—Two or more atoms, either of the same kind 
or of different kinds, are, in the case of most elements, capable 
of uniting with one another in a definite manner to form a higher 
order of distinct particles called molecules. If the molecules of 
which any given material is composed are all exactly alike, the 
¢ John Dalton (1766-1844), Tutor in Mathematics and Natural Phil- 
osophy in the New College, Manchester. His New System of Chemical 
Philosophy appeared in 1808, 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  Suc. 2] THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER 3 
material is a pure substance. If they are not all alike, the 
material is a mixture. 
(c) Elementary Substances.—If the atoms which compose 
the molecules of any pure substance are all of the same kind, the 
substance is, as already stated, an elementary substance. It is 
evident, however, that different elementary substances may be 
formed from the atoms of the same element according as the mole- 
cules which these atoms form are composed of one (monatomic 
molecules), two (diatomic molecules), three (triatomic molecules), 
or more (polyatomic molecules) atoms per molecule and even in 
the case of molecules composed of the same number of atoms all of 
the same kind, substances of different physical properties may be 
produced, if the atoms within the molecule or within a crystal are 
differently arranged with respect to one another. Hence the 
same element may exist as various different (allotropic) elementary 
substances. Thus there are several perfectly distinct substances 
known, each of which when allowed to unite with oxygen will 
produce 2 grams of pure sulphur dioxide for each gram of the sub- 
stance taken. This proves that the atoms of all of these sub- 
stances are sulphur atoms and the substances are all known as 
different forms of the element sulphur. Their different physical 
properties are due to differences in internal structure. 
It may also happen that a given material will display nearly 
all of the chemical and physical properties characteristic of an 
element and still be composed of more than one kind of atom. 
This situation exists, for example, in the case of the element lead. 
Richards ¢ found that the atomic weight of the lead obtained from 
radioactive minerals is quite appreciably different (0.36 per cent.) 
from that of ordinary lead, as is also its density. The spectra of 
the two materials were nevertheless found to be almost? identical, 
line for line, and in their chemical behavior the two “leads” were 
indistinguishable from each other. No separation of either 
material into two or more different substances could be effected 
and when once mixed together not the slightest separation of one 
from the other could be effected by any of the customary 
methods of purification.? The only way in which the two 
materials could be distinguished from each other at all was 
« Theodore W. Richards (1868— ), Professor of Chemistry and Director 
of the Wolcott Gibbs Memorial Laboratory, Harvard University.
-P-A-G-E-32
    4 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. 
through their different atomic weights and densities, through the 
fact that one material was radioactive (I, 2f), thus showing the 
presence of atoms in an unstable condition, and through the very 
slight displacement (0.005A) of line \ 4058 in the are spectrum’, 
It may be mentioned here that theories’ advanced by Soddy* and® 
by Fajans? predict the existence of groups of radioactive elements 
which are chemically nonseparable from one another and which 
differ only in the different atomic weights of the members of the 
group and in the different degrees of stability of their atoms. 
Several such groups have been studied by Soddy. It has been 
proposed to call the members of such a group nonseparables or 
isotopes. They will receive a more detailed treatment in a later 
chapter. 
More recently it has been found that such elementsas chlorine, 
mercury, krypton, and magnesium are also isotopic mixtures. 
Neon, for example, has been shown by Aston’ to be composed of 
90 per cent. of atoms of atomic weight 20.00, and about 10 per cent. 
of atoms of atomic weight 22.00 with less than 1 per cent. of atoms 
of atomic weight 21.00. It seems probable that many of our 
common elements will be found to consist of such isotopic 
mixtures. The characteristic feature of an atom which seems 
to determine its chemical properties is the magnitude of its 
nuclear charge and all the atoms of a given elementary substance 
therefore have the same nuclear charge even though they may 
have different masses. There will thus be as many chemical 
elements as there are classes of atoms having different nuclear 
charges, but two atoms having the same nuclear charge, 
and therefore being atoms of the same chemical element, need

represents an atomic family, all of whose members have identical 
nuclear charges.

kind, the substance is a compound substance. Just as in the 
case of elementary substances there may be several different 
compound substances, all composed of molecules having the same 
atomic composition and owing their different properties to the 
different ways in which the atoms composing the molecule are 
arranged with respect to one another. Thus two different sub- 
stances are known whose molecules are each composed of two 
atoms of carbon, six atoms of hydrogen, and one atom of oxygen, 
that is, the molecules of both substances have the composition 
represented by the empirical formula, C.HsO. The molecules 
of one of these substances have the structure which is represented 
by the formula 
H oH 
H—C—C—0—-H 
evel 
This substance is ordinary ethyl alcohol. 
The structure of the molecules of the second substance is 
represented by the formula, 
H H 
H—C—0—C—H 
H 4H 
and this substance is called methyl ether. Compound substances 
whose molecules are identical in composition but different in 
structure are called isomeric substances or isomers. 
It is obvious that the more nearly two molecular species resem- 
ble each other both in composition and in structure, the more 
closely will the two substances composed of these molecules re- 
semble each other in all of their physical and chemical properties. 
In some cases this resemblance is exceedingly close. Thus there 
are two distinct substances known, both of which are called amyl 
alcohol and both of whose molecules have the structure repre- 
sented by the formula 
CH; 4H 
Se Vee 
C2Hs CH,0H

  6 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. I 
In nearly all of their physical and chemical properties the two 
substances are identical. They both have thesame melting point, 
the same boiling point, the same heat of combustion and the same 
solubility in water. The chief difference between them lies in 
their behavior toward polarized light and this behavior serves 
as a means of distinguishing one from the other. If a beam of 
polarized light is allowed to pass through a layer of the substance 
in the liquid or the gaseous state, the plane of polarization is 
rotated to the left by one substance while the other rotates it 
to the right to an exactly equal degree. The first substance is 
called laevo-amyl alcohol and the second substance dextro-amyl 
alcohol for this reason. The difference in molecular structure 
which is the cause of this behavior is, according to the theory of 
van’t Hoff*-LeBel,” simply a difference in the order in which the 
four different groups are arranged in space about the central 
carbon atom, the arrangements in the two cases being such that 
one molecule has the same arrangement as the mirror image of 
the other. Such isomers as these are called optical isomers and 
occur whenever a molecule is made up of four different atoms or 
groups all attached to the same central atom. The central atom 
under these conditions is said to be asymmetric. 
(e) Electrons.— We have seen that the molecule of a substance 
is an individual composed of one or more atoms and its structure 
may be a very complex one, if it happens to be made up of a large 
number of different atoms. Modern research has demonstrated 
that the structure of the atom is likewise very complex. It has 
been shown that every atom contains a third and lower order of 
distinct particles called electrons or corpuscles. These particles 
seem to be nothing but free charges of negative electricity. They 
all seem to be exactly alike, regardless of what atom they 
may come from, and each constitutes the smallest quantity of 
electricity capable of existence. In other words electricity, like

the University of Amsterdam (1877-1896) and in the University of Berlin

Medecine in Paris in 1874 and his paper on the asymmetry of the carbon 
atom appeared in September of that year. Van’t Hoff is especially re- 
nowned for his contributions to the modern theory of solutions.

matter, is atomic in structure and the electron is the “atom” of 
electricity. The inertia mass of the electron in metals is accord- 
ing”? to Tolman,’ about 14600 of the mass of the hydrogen 
atom, the lightest of all the atoms. Its diameter has been cal- 
culated to be 10-'? em., that of the hydrogen atom being 10-8 em. 
The electromagnetic mass of an electron is known to be only 4 g00 
as large as the mass of the hydrogen atom. The electron is 
thus the smallest particle of which we have any knowledge. 
(f) Radioactivity.*—In addition to these electrons, which are 
part of the composition of every atom, there is also a core or 
nucleus composed of units or “atoms” of positive electricity. 
Thus positive electricity like negative is atomic in structure 
and the “atom” of positive electricity seems to be identical with 
the nucleus of the hydrogen atom. According to this theory the 
hydrogen atom consists of one “atom” of positive electricity 
which constitutes the nucleus, together with one “atom” of 
negative electricity, an electron rotating about it. The atoms of 
all the other elements are built up from these two units. Their 
probable constitution is discussed in detail in Chapter X XVII, 
which may be taken up before proceeding to Chapter II, if desired. 
All of these components are held together by the intra- 
atomic forces to form the complex individual system which we 
call the atom. The atoms of most elements are exceedingly 
stable and practically indestructible systems, but in some 
instances, especially in the case of the larger and hence probably 
more complex atoms such as those of the elements radium, 
uranium and thorium, the atomic systems, from time to time, 
reach a condition of instability which results in a complete break- 
ing up of the atom. The various components of the original 
atom then rearrange themselves into new atomic systems, that 
is, new elements are produced. This atomic disintegration may 
be accompanied by the violent expulsion of a stream of electrons 
known as 6-rays or it may be accompanied by the expulsion of a 
stream of helium atoms each carrying two unit charges of 
positive electricity and known as a-particles. Such disintegra- 
tions are known as radioactive changes and are evidently quite 
distinct from chemical reactions, which involve only rearrange-

  8 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. I 
ments of atoms or molecules. All spontaneous radioactive 
disintegrations, thus far known, appear to be unaffected by any 
external influence which can be brought to bearuponthem. They 
seem to be entirely determined by conditions within the core of 
the atom. 
Within recent years attempts to bring about a decomposition 
of certain atoms, by subjecting them to powerful electric 
discharges or to a bombardment by the rays given out by radium, 
seem to have met with some measure of success, notably in the 
case of Rutherford’s* bombardment of nitrogen with rapid 
a-particles which resulted in the disintegration of the nitrogen 
atom and the production of hydrogen as one of the disintegration 
products, while other experiments'® both with nitrogen and 
oxygen showed that the atoms of both of these elements gave 
on disintegration particles of atomic weight 3 which were 
apparently isotopes of helium. By similar means it may be possi- 
ble to break up other elements into the simpler constituents of 
which their atoms are composed. There is certainly nothing 
in our present knowledge of the elements to justify the view that 
such a decomposition is impossible although it will undoubtedly 
be very difficult and will require the use of agencies which twenty- 
five years ago were entirely unknown to science. 
(g) The Surface of the Atom .“—In addition to the violent expul- 
sion of electrons which is characteristic of the 6-ray disintegration 
in the case of radioactive elements, the atoms of all elements are 
able to lose temporarily or under certain special conditions a 
limited number of electrons without breaking up or becoming in 
any way unstable. In describing some of the various circum- 
stances under which this has been observed to occur we will at 
the same time interpret the known facts in terms of a theory 
which is the outgrowth of an hypothesis initially suggested 
by Sir J. J. Thomson.? 
According to this theory the nuclei of some of the more

-P-A-G-E-37
Sec. 2] THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER 9) 
complex atoms contain electrons (called cementing electrons 
or nuclear electrons) which are very firmly held and whose loss 
would result in the disintegration of the atom. The remaining 
electrons are distributed around the nucleus in an orderly ar- 
rangement characteristic of the atom in question. The outer- 
most of these electrons constitute the valence electrons and 
their number, which can be increased or diminished without im- 
pairing the stability of the atom, determines the valency of the 
element. 
When one atom unites with another to form a molecule, the 
two atoms are supposed to be held together by an electrical 
attraction due either to the passage of one or more valence 
electrons from one atom to the other, thereby producing a polar- 
ized molecule with one atom charged positively and the other 
negatively; or due to the movements of valence electrons to or 
about certain positions in or near their own atoms, such that there 
is a resulting electrical attraction between the two atoms although 
they may both remain electrically neutral since neither has gained 
or lost any electricity. The molecule of potassium chloride is, 
according to Sir J. J. Thomson’s hypothesis, an example of a polar- 
ized molecule formed by the first method. Whether this 
hypothesis of the constitution of the potassium chloride molecule 
be correct or not, we know that when the potassium chloride 
is dissolved in water the molecule is split up in such a way that 
the valence electron of the potassium atom remains attached to 
the chlorine atom, which is therefore negatively charged, while 
the potassium atom which has lost the electron becomes thereby 
positively charged. Any atom or molecule which carries a 
charge of electricity is called an ion and the process of the 
production of ions is known as ionization. In the case cited, the 
ionization of the potassium chloride when dissolved in water is 
spontaneous and is known as electrolytic ionization or electrolytic 
dissociation. Any substance which ionizes in this manner, 
that is, by solution in a suitable solvent, is called an electrolyte. 
(h) Ionization by Collision and by Radiant Energy.— Another 
type of ionization occurs when a gas is subjected to the action 
of the radiations given off by radium or to the action of cathode 
rays or various other similar agencies. The rapidly moving 
a- and -particles when they collide with the atoms of the gas 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  10 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. I 
cause them to lose temporarily one or more of their electrons 
and thus to become ions. In order that the electrons given 
out by the cathode in a cathode ray tube (i.e., the “cathode 
rays’’) (See Fig. 3) shall be capable of ionizing the gas in their 
path, they must first acquire a certain minimum velocity, that 
is, they must first fall through a minimum potential difference. 
The potential difference necessary to give the electrons of 
the cathode ray a sufficiently high velocity to enable them to 
ionize the atoms with which they collide is a characteristic 
property of each gas and is called its ionizing potential. The 
ionizing potentials of the metallic vapors vary from 1.39 volts 
for cesium up to 4.9 volts for mercury, the order of the metals 
being apparently the same as that of the electromotive series 
(page 241). 
Again, when ultraviolet light is allowed to fall upon a metal it 
causes the metal to emit electrons and thus to acquire a positive 
charge, the velocity of the emitted electrons being exactly propor- 
tional to the frequency of the incident light. (The “ Photo- 
electric Effect.”’) Furthermore, the electrical behavior of metals 
indicates that some of the electrons are able to move about 
from atom to atom within the body of the metal with comparative 
ease so that when an electromotive force is applied to the ends 
of a piece of metal a stream of these electrons through the metal 
is immediately set up. These moving electrons constitute 
the electric current in the metal. 
(j) Polar and Non-Polar Molecules.!’—When chemical com- 
bination between two atoms is accompanied by a transfer of 
one or more electrons from one atom to the other we have, as 
explained above, a polar or polarized molecule, and a substance 
composed of such molecules is termed a polar substance. (Ex. 
water, ammonia, alcohol, acids, bases and salts.) If on the other 
hand the chemical combination involves no such transfer of 
electrons but instead results from an equal sharing of two or 
more electrons by the respective atoms then a non-polar molecule 
and a non-polar substance is produced (Ex., hydrocarbons). Be- 
tween these two extremes we find all degrees of polarity de- 
pending upon the extent of the displacement of the uniting 
electrons with respect to the two atoms which are held together. 
Roughly speaking, inorganic substances tend to be polar and
-P-A-G-E-39
Sec, 3] THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER 11 
organic substances, non-polar in nature. Mixed types can also 
occur, as for’example, in a molecule composed of a non-polar 
hydrocarbon chain attached to a polar carboxyl group. 
Strongly polar substances are to a high degree reactive, tend 
to ionize readily and to form molecular complexes. Non-polar 
substances on the other hand are relatively inert, are non-ionizing 
and non-ionized and do not tend to form molecular complexes. 
Polar substances are as a rule characterized by high dielectric 
constants and non-polar by low dielectric constants. 
(k) Molecular Motion.—The molecules of every substance, 
the atoms within the molecules and the electrons within the atoms 
are in constant motion. The heat content of any body consists 
of the kinetic and potential energy possessed by its moving 
molecules and atoms. The motions of the atoms and electrons 
also give rise to radiant energy, including light, radiant heat 
and Réntgen rays. 
3. Hypothesis, Theory, Law and Principle.—In the preceding 
section the value and purpose of hypothesis was illustrated in 
connection with the discussion of the structure of the atom. The 
terms hypothesis and theory are frequently used more or less 
synonymously but the latter term is more properly employed to 
designate a system which includes perhaps several related hy- 
potheses together with all the logical consequences to which they 
lead, the whole serving to correlate and interpret the data of 
experiment in some particular field of knowledge. Thus the 
hypothesis that gases are composed of a large number of very 
small particles, together with certain auxiliary hypotheses 
regarding the shape, motion and energy of these particles and the 
forces acting between them, leads to a logical system by means of 
which we can interpret successfully (7.e., “explain”) many of the 
known facts concerning the behavior of gases. ‘This system is 
called the kinetic theory of gases. As to the basic hypothesis 
that gases are composed of these individual particles or molecules, 
it has already been stated (I, 1) that the evidence supporting it 
has recently become so convincing that the scientific world no 
longer entertains a reasonable doubt of the correctness of the 
hypothesis. When such a condition is reached the hypothesis is 
considered as definitely established and is called a fact. There 
is evidently no sharp line of distinction between hypothesis and
-P-A-G-E-40
  12 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. I 
fact. It is simply a question of degree of probability. When the 
degree of probability of the correctness of a hypothesis becomes 
sufficiently high it may be regarded as a fact. 
The term law of nature is applied to a relation, the evidence in 
support of which is so strong as to compel a general belief in its 
validity. If the relation is a very general one supported by a 
large and varied experience so that the chance of its ever being 
abandoned is extremely small it may be called a principle. 
4. The Principle of the Conservation of Matter.—This princi- 
ple states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. 
The total amount of matter in the universe remains constant. 
The most exact experimental test of this principle for a particular 
process was made in 1908, by Landolt, who showed, in the case 
of 15 different chemical reactions, that the quantity of matter 
(as measured by its weight) before and after the occurrence of 
the reaction was in every case constant to within one part in a 
million, which was the limit of accuracy of the experiments. 
The exact significance of this principle obviously depends upon 
the meaning of the term amount or quantity of matter in the 
universe. If by this term we mean the total nwmber of “atoms” 
of electricity, both positive (hydrogen nuclei) and negative 
(electrons), the principle is probably of universal validity. If, on 
the other hand, we imply mass as our measure of quantity of 
matter, the principle is for all practical purposes of universal 
validity with respect to all types of processes which can occur, with 
the exception of those processes involving the disintegration 
or formation of an atom of matter.'® 
5. The Law of Combining Weights.—If n, atoms, each of 
mass, m,, of the element A are united with n, atoms each of 
mass, ms, of the element B to form the molecule of a compound 
and if in any given quantity, M, of this compound there are n’ 
molecules, then the total mass of the element A in the M grams of 
the compound will evidently be nx X m, X n’, that of the ele- 
ment B will be ns X my, X n’ and the ratio of the two masses will

which is called the combining weight ratio for the two elements, 
A and B, in this compound. If we arbitrarily agree upon some 
number to represent the combining weight, n, X m4, of the ele- 
ment A in the above compound, then a value for the combining 
weight, nm, X ms, of the element B can evidently be readily 
calculated. Then by determining the combining weight ratio 
for a compound of a third element C with either A or B a value 
for the combining weight of this third element can also be caleu- 
lated. Proceeding in this way we can build up a table of com- 
bining weights of all the elements capable of forming compounds 
and since, with the exception of the complicated molecules of 
certain organic compounds, the number of atoms (n,, mp, ete.) 
in any molecule is comparatively small, it is evident that the set 
of combining weights thus obtained will express accurately the 
relative masses of the elements which enter into chemical com- 
bination with one another in chemical reactions. 
If we arbitrarily adopt the number 8 as the combining weight of 
oxygen, then the combining weight of any other substance may 
be defined as that weight (in grams) of it which combines with 8 
grams of oxygen; or, if the substance does not combine with 
oxygen, then that weight of it which combines or reacts with one 
combining weight of any other substance will be its combining 
weight. With this definition of the term, combining weight, we 
may state the Law of Combining Weights in the following terms: 
Pure chemical substances react with one another only in the 
proportions of their combining weights. If an element forms 
several compounds with oxygen it may have several combining 
weights. Thus in the following compounds, N20, NO, N2Os, 
NO, and N.O;, the number of grams of nitrogen combined 
with 8 grams of oxygen is 14, 7, 424, 314, and 25¢ grams respec- 
tively. Of these numbers we may, if we wish, choose any one 
and call it the combining weight of nitrogen. Thus if we choose 
the number 7, then the other numbers are respectively 2, 2, 14 
and 2 times the combining weight of nitrogen, as is required by 
the law of combining weights. ascertain very exactly the numerical value of the ratio, 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
14 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Crar. I 
This law, which we have here shown to be a necessary corollary 
of the atomic and molecular structure of matter, was discovered 
by Richter* before the atomic theory was proposed by Dalton in 
1808. In fact in the case of most of the laws and principles which 
in the following pages we shall show to be direct consequences of 
the atomic and molecular structure of matter, the law or principle 
in question was discovered empirically before the structure of 
matter was known and in some instances even before the modern 
atomic and molecular theories had been proposed. One of the 
triumphs of these theories was their ability to interpret all of 
these empirical laws from a single point of view. 
Problem 1.—The following. problem will illustrate the degree of accuracy 
with which the law of combining weights has been established: The follow- 
ing two sets of combining weight ratios have been determined by chemical 
analysis and synthesis: 
  Ae ‘ees mcI0s ae 5097 ees Lich

coe = 2.5446 
Calculate from each set of data a value for the combining weight of silver, 
taking 16 as the combining weight of oxygen. (Cf. Sec. 8 below.) 
6. Atomic Weights.—It is evident from the preceding that if 
the weight of a single atom of any element is known, then the 
weight of an atom of any other element which combines with 
this one can be calculated, provided the number of atoms of each 
element in the molecule of the compound is known and provided 
the combining weight ratio of the two elements in this compound 
has been determined. For example, the weight of an atom of 
oxygen is known to be 26.39 X 104 grams. The molecule of 
water is known to consist of two atoms of hydrogen combined 
with one of oxygen and the combining weight ratio, a Mo   
, has 
been found by chemical synthesis to be 0.12594. We have,

-P-A-G-E-43
  Sxc. 6] THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER 15 
weight of an atom of hydrogen, must be 16.6 X 10-*> grams. 
Proceeding in this way we could compute a table of the weights 
of the atoms of all elements capable of forming compounds. The 
practical objection to such a table is that while the relative 
weights of the atoms can be very accurately determined (to 0.01 
per cent. in many cases) by chemical analysis and synthesis, the 
actual weight of any atom has not yet been determined to better 
than 0.1 per cent. and consequently all the values of such a table 
would be subject to frequent revision as our knowledge of the 
weight of the atom of some element became more exact. This 
objection can be avoided by arbitrarily adopting any desired 
number as the atomic weight of some one element and then com- 
puting the relative atomic weights of the others from their ex- 
perimentally determined combining weights and a knowledge of 
the formula of the compound in question. Chemists have 
agreed to adopt the number 16 as the atomic weight of the ele- 
ment, oxygen, and as the basis of the atomic weight table.! In 
order to compute the actual weight of any atom from the atomic 
weight of the element it is only necessary to divide the latter 
number by 
wees, = 00:62ix 108 26.39 X 10-%4 ‘ co 
the number of atoms in one atomic weight of any element. 
‘This quantity is one of the universal constants of nature and 
is known as Avogadro’s number. We shall represent it by the 
symbol, N. 
1The modern atomic weight table was formerly based upon the value 
unity which was arbitrarily taken as the atomic weight of hydrogen. On 
this basis the atomic weight of oxygen was found to be slightly less than 16. 
The atomic weights of many of the other elements were based upon combin- 
ing weight ratios which involved either directly or indirectly a knowledge 
of the atomic weight of oxygen and this in turn was based upon the experi- 
mentally determined value of the combining weight ratio of oxygen to hydro- 
gen. The result was that whenever new determinations resulted in a 
change or a more accurate knowledge of this latter ratio, it became necessary 
to recalculate a large part of the atomic weight table. In order to avoid 
this it was decided to arbitrarily adopt 16 as the atomic weight of oxygen 
and to employ the combining weight ratio of oxygen to hydrogen simply 
to determine the atomic weight of hydrogen. The atomic weights of the 
other elements are thus not affected by changes in the value of this ratio,  
-P-A-G-E-44
  16 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. I 
We have seen that if an element forms several compounds with 
oxygen it may have several combining weights. One of these 
combining weights or some submultiple of one of them will also 
be the atomic weight. It must evidently be that one which 
expressed in grams contains the same number of atoms as 16 
grams of oxygen. Methods for deciding which of several com- 
bining weights is the atomic weight of an element will be discussed 
later (II, 12). 
The International Committee on Atomic Weights computes 
each year a table of atomic weights based upon the most reliable 
determinations. This table is published each year in all of the 
leading chemical journals of the world. The International 
Atomic Weight Table for 1920-21 is given on the opposite page. 
It is evident that neither the relative atomic weights nor the 
absolute weights of the atoms calculated in the above manner will 
in general correspond to the true mass of any given atom. This 
could be the case only fora ‘‘pure” element. For all other elements 
the atomic weights obtained as above can represent only an 
average value for the atomic family denoted by the name of the 
element. Thus in the case of lead not all of the atomic families 
designated by this name have the same atomic composition and it 
is thus necessary to be more specific when using the term “atomic 
weight of lead.” The value given in Table I for this element is 
the value for the non-radioactive atomic lead family which is 
found in nature, as there appears to be only one such. 
In order to determine the true atomic weight of each of the 
different isotopes composing a given elementary atomic family, 
recourse must be had to the method of positive-ray analysis‘ 
described in the next section. 
7. The Determination of the Mass of an Atom by the Positive- 
Ray Method.—This method, devised by Sir J. J. Thomson, 
depends upon the fact that in the cathode-ray tube (See Fig. 3), 
the electrons, which are shot out from the cathode under the in- 
fluence of the high potential, ionize the gas in their path, that is, 
by collision with the atoms of the gas they dislodge one or more 
electrons from these atoms, thus leaving them positively charged. 
These positively charged atoms are immediately subjected to a 
powerful attraction by the negatively charged cathode and move 
toward it with a high velocity. If now the cathode be perforated,

streams of these positively charged atoms, known as positive-rays, 
will pass through the cathode into the region behind it, where 
they may be subjected to experiment.

they will produce an image at a position corresponding to the

The most recent apparatus of this kind, is the positive-ray 
spectrograph of Aston, which is shown in Fig. 1. The positive 
rays first pass through the parallel slits, S: and S2 which allow 
a thin narrow ribbon of rays to emerge and pass between the 
charged plates, P; and Ps, where the electric field spreads them 
out into an electric spectrum, in accordance with the different

deflected through the angle 6, is picked out by the diaphragm, 
D, and passed between the circular poles of a powerful electri¢ 
magnet, O, so arranged as to bend the rays back again through an 
angle ¢ more than twice as great as 6. The result is that all the 
rays having a given mass, or more exactly a given ratio of charge 
to mass, will converge to a focus, F, and if a photographic plate 
be placed at GF, as indicated, there will be obtained a separate 
image for each different class of charged particles. In other 
words, a mass spectrum will be obtained. If now the gas contains 
atoms of unknown atomic weights, one may, by measuring the 
displacement of the image of a particle of unknown mass as com- 
pared with the displacement of one of known mass, determine the

Elements listed as having one isotope are pure elements, that 
is only one atomic species can be recognized. The proportion 
of a given isotope in an element can be approximately estimated 
from the intensity of its spectrum line in the mass spectrum.

rays, X-rays, gaseous ionization, etc., which are used frequently

8. Chemical Formulas, Formula Weights, Equivalent Weights 
and Molecular Weights.—The formula of any pure chemical 
substance is a succession of the symbols of the elements it con- 
tains, each symbol being provided with such integers as subscripts

as will make the resulting formula express the atomic proportions 
of the elements in the compound. In addition the symbol of 
each element represents one atomic weight in grams of that 
element and the whole formula represents a weight in grams of 
the substance which is equal to the sum of all the atomic weights 
each multiplied by its subscript. This weight is called the gram- 
formula weight of the substance. Thus the formula, HNOs,

grams of arsenic trioxide. That weight in grams of any substance 
which reacts chemically with one gram-atomic weight of 
hydrogen, or with that amount of any other substance which 
itself reacts with one gram-atomic weight of hydrogen, is called 
the equivalent weight or one equivalent of the substance. Thus 
the equivalent weight of each of the following substances is 
the gram-formula weight indicated: }4Cle, }40x, Ag, }2Zn, }4Bi, -
-P-A-G-E-50
  22 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. I 
14Ba(OH)s2, 14H2SOu, 1$H3POu, 1AICl;, 14KiFe(CN). The 
same substance may have more than one equivalent weight de- 
pending on whether the reaction with hydrogen is one of metathesis 
or of oxidation and reduction. Thus the metathetical equiva- 
lent of ferric chloride is 14 FeCls, but its oxidation equivalent 
(when reduced to ferrous chloride) is FeCl; and the metathetical 
equivalent of potassium chlorate is KClO;, while its oxidation 
equivalent (when reduced to KCl) is 14¢KCIO3. 
The molecular formula of a substance is the formula which 
expresses the atomic composition of the molecule and the molecu- 
lar weight (more properly, the gram-molecular weight or the 
molal weight) is the weight in grams indicated by the molecular 
formula. Thus the molecular formula of gaseous hydrogen, 
whose molecules are diatomic, is Hz and its gram-molecular weight 
is 2X1.008=2.016 grams. The molecular formulas of some of 
the other elements in the gaseous state are as follows: No, Fe, 
Ch, Bre, Iz, Pu, Asi, He, A, Hg, Cd, Zn. The molecular weight 
evidently bears the same relation to the weight of the molecule 
that the atomic weight does to the weight of the atom, that is, 
the former is in each instance N-times the latter. One gram 
molecular weight of a substance is frequently called one mole. 
9. States of Aggregation and Phases.—Matter occurs in differ- 
ent states or conditions known as states of aggregation. The 
three principal states of aggregation are the gaseous state, the 
liquid state and the crystalline state. A body is said to be 
isotropic when it displays the same physical properties in all 
directions through it. All gases, most liquids, and the so-called 
amorphous solids when not under stress areisotropic. Anisotropic 
bodies display different physical properties in different direc- 
tions. They comprise all crystalline substances. Another dis- 
tinction between these two classes appears when we consider the 
passage of a substance from one state of aggregation to another. 
The passage from one isotropic state to another may be either 
continuous or discontinuous while the passage from the aniso- 
tropic to the isotropic state, or vice versa, has thus far been found 
to be always a discontinuous process. 
Any portion of the universe which we choose to separate in 
thought from the rest of the universe for the purpose of consider- 
ing and discussing the various changes which may occur within 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
Src. 9] THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER 23 
it under various conditions is called a system and the rest of the 
universe becomes for the time being the surroundings of the 
system. ‘Thus, if we wish to consider the changes whch occur 
when salt and water are brought together under various condi- 
tions of temperature, pressure, etc., then the two substances 
salt and water constitute our system and they are called the 
components of the system. The physically homogencous but 
mechanically separable portions of a system are called its phases. 
Thus a system containing crystals of benzene, liquid benzene, 
and benzene vapor contains three phases, one crystalline phase, 
one liquid phase and one gaseous phase. If we add salt to this 
system we may have four phases, 7.e., two crystalline phases 
(usually called solid phases), namely, the salt crystals and the 
benzene crystals, one liquid phase composed of a solution of salt 
in benzene and one gaseous phase composed chiefly of benzene 
vapor. Each phase is distinguishable from the others by being 
separated from them by definite and sharp bounding surfaces 
and by being itself homogeneous throughout its own interior. 
By homogeneous is meant of uniform chemical composition 
throughout and having the same physical properties in all re- 
gions within itself. A system composed of only one phase is, 
therefore, a homogeneous system, while one composed of more 
than one phase is called a heterogeneous system. The dis- 
tinction between phase and state of aggregation should be clearly 
understood. A system composed of liquid water and liquid 
mercury has two phases but only one state of aggregation, the 
liquid state. Since all gases are miscible with one another in 
all proportions there can never be more than one gaseous phase 
in any system. There may, however, be several crystalline 
and several liquid phases present, if the system contains a suffi- 
cient number of components. The condition, Z, of any phase of 
a system which has reached a state of equilibrium is ordinarily 
completely determined if its pressure, p, temperature, 7, and 
composition, x, are fixed, or in mathematical language, 
4 =p, T, x) (1) 
For every heterogeneous system which has reached a state of 
equilibrium under a given set of conditions, there exists a rela- 
tion, known as the Phase Rule, which connects the number (P) 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
24, PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap, I 
of phases present in the system, with the number (c) of its com- 
ponents and with the number (F) of variables (temperature, 
pressure and percentage composition of the phases) whose values 
must be known before the condition of the system becomes com- 
pletely determined. This relation is expressed by the equation 
P+r=c+2 (2) 
By c, the number of components, is meant the smallest number 
of substances in terms of which the percentage composition of 
each phase in the system can be expressed. The derivation of the 
Phase Rule and a more precise definition of the quantities in- 
volved in it will be given in a later chapter. 
10. Chemical Equilibrium.—When a system contains molecu- 
lar species which are reacting chemically with one another to 
produce other molecular species which in turn are similarly con- 
stantly reacting with one another to reproduce the first ones 
again, so that the rates of reaction in the two directions are equal 
and hence the relative amounts of the different molecular species 
concerned remain constant, a chemical equilibrium is said to exist 
within the system. The general method for representing a 
chemical equilibrium will be by means of the following equation: 
aA+0B+...2mM+nN+.... (3) 
which represents a reaction in which a molecules of the substance 
A, react with b molecules of the substance, B, etc., to form m 
molecules of the substance, M, and n molecules of the substance, 
N, ete., and vice versa.

CHAPTER IT 
THE GASEOUS STATE OF AGGREGATION}? 
1. Definition and Structure of a Gas.—A substance is in the 
gaseous state, if it remains homogeneous and its volume increases 
without limit when the pressure upon it is continuously decreased 
and its temperature is kept constant. In gases under low pres- 
sures the molecules are so far apart and occupy such a small 
fraction of the total volume of the containing vessel that they are 
nearly independent of one another. They are in constant and 
very rapid motion in all directions, moving in nearly straight 
lines and colliding frequently with one another and with the walls 
of the containing vessel. They, therefore, describe zig-zag paths 
of such complicated and uncertain characters owing to the numer- 
ous collisions which they experience, that it is not possible to 
predict where a given molecule will be after an interval of time. 
Motion of this character is called unordered or random motion. 
The collisions between the molecules of a given gas will evidently 
be more frequent the greater the number of molecules in a given 
volume of the gas, that is, the greater the density of the gas. The 
average distance through which a molecule travels between two 
successive collisions is called the mean free path of the molecule. 
The collisons between molecules and between a molecule and the 
wall of the containing vessel take place without loss of energy, 
that is, they are perfectly elastic collisions. The mean kinetic 
energy, 1/2 mu’, of the molecules of a perfect gas has been shown 
experimentally to depend only upon the temperature and to be 
independent of the nature of the gas. (IX, 4.) 
2. Boyle’s Law.—The pressure (7.e., the force per unit surface) 
exerted by a gas upon the walls of the containing vessel is due 
to the impacts of the rapidly moving molecules and since by 
definition

Suc. 2] THE GASEOUS STATE OF AGGREGATION 27 
where ¢ signifies time, this pressure will be determined by the 
time rate of change of momentum, mu, which the molecules 
experience on striking the walls. 
In order to calculate this pressure we may assume that the 
molecules (which in reality are constantly changing their actual 
velocities after cach impact) are all moving with the same veloc- 
ity, u, whose square is equal to the mean of the squares of the 
actual velocities.* In other words, the velocity, u, has such a 
value that if all the molecules possessed it, the mean molecular 
kinetic energy 14mu? would be unchanged. It is evident that 
the pressure would also be unchanged. This assumption is 
made for the purpose of simplifying our calculation which may, 
however, be carried through to the same conclusion without 
making this simplifying assumption. Since the pressure exerted 
by the gas is evidently independent of the shape of the vessel 
containing it, we shall assume for convenience that it is con- 
tained in a cube of side, 1, and we shall consider the three com- 
ponents of the velocity, uw, which are respectively perpendicular 
to the faces of the cube and are, therefore, connected with the 
velocity, u, by the relation, 
Ur? + Us? + Us? = u® (2) 
A molecule of mass, m, approaches face, 1, with the momen- 
tum, mu, perpendicular to this face and after the impact it 
recedes from it with the momentum, —mwu, the change in 
momentum being, therefore, 2mu. a number of impacts on 
face 1 in unit time will evidently be 5) 3, and the total change of 
momentum per unit time will be the eons of the number of 
impacts into the change of momentum per impact, or 2mu: X =

temperature rate of change of the pressure-volume product 
is the same for all gases whose molecular complexity does 
not change with the temperature. This law was discovered

4, The Law of Avogadro.—Equation (6) may be written 
n= WP (12) 
from which it follows that if p, v, and 14 mu, and hence also 6 
are all constants, 7 is likewise a constant and has the same value 
for all gases; or in other words that equal volumes of all gases 
at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number 
of molecules. This statement, advanced as a hypothesis in 
1811 by the Italian physicist Avogadro,* is of great importance 
in the determination of the molecular weights of gases. The 
molecule of oxygen is known to have the formula Oz and hence 
the molecular weight, 2X16=32. Avogadro’s number, the 
number of molecules in 32 grams of oxygen, is N= 60.6210” 
as stated in the first chapter. According to Avogadro’s law 
this is also evidently the number of molecules in one gram- 
molecular weight of any gas and the gram-molecular weight of any 
gas must, therefore, be, according to Avogadro’s law, that mass 
in grams of the gas which occupies the same volume as do 32 
grams of oxygen at the same temperature and pressure. 
If in equation 10 of the preceding section we agree always to 
take one gram-molecular weight of a gas, then by Avogadro’s law 
we have for every gas 
A(pv.) _ R da (18) 
where v, is the volume of one mole of the gas and R 
is a constant whose value is the same for all gases. The 
product, pv., has the dimentions of force X distance and hence 
of work or energy. (Problem: Demonstrate this.) It repre- 
sents the work required to produce the volume, », against the 
constant pressure, p, and may be called the molal volume

published in 1811 began to find acceptance among chemists only after 1860, 
and as late as 1885, French chemists still refused to accept it as the logical 
basis for determining molecular formulas,

expressed in the following words: The temperature rate of 
change of the molal volume energy has the same value for all 
pure gases. 
5. Definition of the Centigrade Degree and of Absolute Tem- 
perature.—The centigrade degree is arbitrarily defined as 400 
part of the temperature interval between the temperature of 
ice, melting under the pressure of one atmosphere, and the tem- 
perature of the vapor of water, boiling under the pressure of 
one atmosphere. The size of this degree will depend somewhat 
upon the nature of the material composing the thermometer 
employed in measuring this temperature interval. Thus on 
the international hydrogen scale the centigrade degree is defined 
as that difference in temperature which produces in the pressure 
of a quantity of hydrogen gas 1409 part of the change in pressure 
which is produced when the volume of the gas is kept constant 
and its temperature is changed from that of ice melting under a 
pressure of one atmosphere to that of the vapor of water boiling 
under a pressure of one atmosphere, it being further stipulated 
that the hydrogen shall be under a pressure of 1 meter of mercury 
when it is at the temperature of melting ice. If nitrogen be 
employed instead of hydrogen, the centigrade degree defined in 
a similar manner is almost identical with that of the hydrogen 
scale and as the initial pressure of the gas employed is decreased, 
the size of the degree as defined above reaches a limiting value 
which is entirely independent of the nature of the gas employed 
in the thermometer. This degree defines a temperature scale 
known as the Kelvin* or Thermodynamic Scale and may be re- 
garded as the degree given by a thermometer filled with a perfect 
gas (II, 7and9). The degree on the Kelvin scale differs from that 
on the international hydrogen scale by less than 0.1 per cent. 
so that in nearly all cases the two scales may be regarded as iden- 
tical for practical purposes. Strictly, however, we shall under-

Equation (10) may be written, d(pv) = kdé and on integration 
gives 
pv = k6 + kk! = k(6 + k’) (14) 
where kk’ is the integration constant. In other words this equa- 
tion implies that the pressure-volume product of a given mass of 
gas is proportional to the temperature-plus-a-constant, k’. The 
numerical value of this constant depends upon the size of the 
degree on our temperature scale. If we adopt the centigrade 
degree as defined above, then we find by experiment with dif- 
ferent gases that the constant k’ has the value 273.1 centigrade 
degrees. Equation (14) may, therefore, be written 
po = k(t + 273.1) (15) 
and the symbol, t, will henceforth be understood to signify tem- 
perature on the centigrade scale. 
The quantity, ¢ + 273.1, is called the absolute temperature 
and is represented by the letter 7. The absolute scale evidently 
differs from the centigrade scale only in having its zero point 
273.1° below the centigrade zero. Equation (15) may now be 
written 
p= kT (16) 
or in words, the pressure volume product of a given mass of 
any gas is proportional to its absolute temperature. If we 
differentiate this equation with respect to 7’ and divide the 
result by the original equation, we have

or stated in words, the pressure volume product (or the pressure 
at constant volume or the volume at constant pressure) of any 
gas increases by one 7'th part of itself for each rise of one degree 
in its temperature, 7’ being the initial absolute temperature of 
the gas; or, since p, v and J in the above equation may have 
any values, this equation also states that the increase in the 
pressure-volume product of a given mass of any gas per degree 
rise in temperature is equal to 1473.1 of its value at 0°C. These

statements comprise what is frequently referred to as the law 
of Charles.* 
All of these statements are evidently much more elegantly 
and concisely expressed by equation (11) from which we have 
deduced them. In fact one of the great advantages of the 
language of the mathematician is the clear, concise, complete 
and exact character of its statements. The simple statement 
that

conveys to the mind of the mathematician nearly everything 
which we have employed three pages in explaining. Because 
of these manifest advantages of the language and methods of 
the mathematician we shall use them freely throughout this 
book at the same time translating them, wherever desirable, 
into more familiar forms of statement. It is hoped that this 
dual method of treatment will aid the student in gaining a clearer 
insight into the general laws and principles of his science as well 
as giving him a better appreciation of the value of higher mathe- 
matics to the chemist than he may perhaps have obtained in 
his college courses in mathematics. 
6. Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures.—In a mixture of gases 
we have more than one species of molecule and the total pressure 
exerted by the mixture upon the walls of the containing vessel 
may be considered as the sum of all the separate partial pressures 
due to the impacts of the molecules of the different gases. That is

By employing the same method of reasoning used in section 2

expressed by an equation of the same form as equation (4), thus =0 (18)

or stated in words: In a mixture of gases each gas exerts the 
same pressure as it would exert if it were alone present in the 
volume occupied by the mixture. This statement is known as 
Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures. 
Problem 1.—Show that the partial pressure, pa, of any constituent A 
of a gaseous mixture is given by the relation 
Ns 
Dae (23) 
where nx is the number of molecules of A and 7 is the total number of all 
molecules present, p being the total pressure of the mixture. Show also that 
the molecular fraction, = must also be equal to the number of gram mo- 
lecular weights of the constituent, A, divided by the sum of the numbers of 
gram molecular weights of all the gases present in the mixture. 
This latter ratio is called the mole-fraction of the constituent 
in question and is represented by the letter, z. Equation (23) 
may, therefore, be written, 
Px = Up (24) 
and similarly for another constituent of the mixture 
Ds = Upp (25) 
and so on for each gas present in the mixture. Stated in words: 
The partial pressure of any gas in a mixture is equal to its mole- 
fraction in the mixture multiplied by the total pressure of the 
mixture. 
If a closed palladium vessel or tube connected with a man- 
ometer be evacuated and then placed in a gaseous mixture at 
high temperature containing hydrogen, the hydrogen will diffuse 
through the palladium wall into the vessel and will register on 
the manometer its partial pressure in the mixture. The palla- 
dium is impermeable to the other gases but easily permeable to 
hydrogen which passes through it, until its partial pressures on 
the two sides of the wall become the same. This device gives 
us a means of demonstrating by direct experiment and of measur- 
ing the partial pressure exerted by the molecules of one gas in a 
mixture of several gases. 
7. The Equation of State of a Perfect Gas.—The laws which 
we have just derived, known as the perfect gas laws, may be

Sxc. 8] THE GASEOUS STATE OF AGGREGATION 35 
conveniently combined into a single expression. To do this we 
have only to modify slightly equation (16) above. The numeri- 
cal value of the proportionality constant, k, of this expression 
depends both upon the mass of gas taken and upon the nature of 
the gas, but if we agree that the mass taken shall always be one gram 
molecular weight (called also one mole) in every instance, then 
by Avogadro’s law (II, 4) the value of = is the same for all gases, 
that is, 
Pro po R (26) 
where R is a universal constant which is independent of the nature 
of the gas and », is by our agreement the volume of one gram 
molecular weight or one mole of the gas. It is called the molal 
volume of the gas. If we wish to extend this equation to apply 
to any quantity of a gas, we have only to multiply both sides by 
N, the number of moles taken and we have 
pv = NRT (27) 
where 2, the total volume occupied by the N moles of gas, is writ- 
ten for Nv.. This expression is the equation of state of a perfect 
gas or more briefly the perfect gas law. In this equation p, », 
and 7 denote respectively the pressure, volume and absolute 
temperature of the gas while NV, the number of moles present, is 
evidently equal to ie where m is the mass of the gas and M its   molecular weight. & is a constant, the same for all gases, and 
equal to the value of r for one mole of any perfect gas. Its 
numerical value obviously depends upon the units in which pv 
is expressed. If p is expressed in atmospheres and v in liters, R 
has the value 0.08207 liter-atmospheres per degree; if p is ex- 
pressed in dynes per square centimeter and v in cubic centimeters, 
then F has the value 8.3162 x 10’ ergs or 8.3162 joules per degree; 
_ while if pv is expressed in calories, then R has the value 1.9852 
calories per degree. 
8. Temperature and Molecular Kinetic Energy.—It has al- 
ready been stated (II, 1) that experiments have shown that the 
mean kinetic energy of the molecules of a perfect gas is dependent
-P-A-G-E-64
36 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuap. IL 
only upon the temperature. The nature of the dependence can 
be deduced by combining equation (4) with equation (27) so 
as to eliminate pv. This gives 
lgnmu? = NRT (28) 
or Momut = 36% pe = 368? - op (29) 
where N is Avogadro’s number and « is evidently a constant. 
Stated in words: The mean kinetic energy of the molecules of a 
perfect gas is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas 
and the proportionality constant is equal to 3¢ z. 
Problem 2.—From the value of R and the atomic weights required calcu- 
late the molecular velocity, u, in miles per second for the following gases: 
Hz at 0°; He at 3000°; O2 at 0°; CoH. at 0°; Hg at 0°. (First eliminate N 
and m from equation (29) by introducing the molecular weight, M, of the 
gas.) 
An apparatus for directly measuring the value of u has been 
devised by Stern,® and the measured value for the vapor of 
metallic silver was found to agree with that calculated from 
equation (29). 
9. The Validity of the Perfect Gas Laws.—It will be remem- 
bered that the derivation given above for the perfect gas law is 
based upon equation (4) which was itself derived on the assump- 
tions (1) that the molecules of a gas are so far apart that they 
exert no attraction upon one another; and (2) that the space 
which they themselves actually occupy is negligibly small in 
comparison with the volume of the containing vessel. No real 
gas exactly fulfills either of these conditions, but it is evident 
that all gases should approach these conditions more closely the 
lower the pressure, that is, the farther apart the molecules be- 
come. The perfect gas law, therefore, is, strictly speaking, only 
a limiting law which may be considered as holding exactly only 
for an imaginary gas, called a perfect gas, but which all real gases 
should obey more and more closely the lower the pressure. Ex- 
periment shows that this is actually the case. The magnitude 
of the divergence of real gases from the requirements of the perfect 
gas law varies with the nature of the gas and its temperature, 
but for pressures not greatly in excess of one atmosphere the

divergence is small (less than 1 per cent.) for gases at tempera- 
tures far removed from their maximum condensation tempera- 
ture. This is illustrated by the data in the first half of Tables 
II and III. The figures given in the third column are the critical 
temperatures of the gases. The critical temperature, or the 
maximum condensation temperature of a gas, is the highest 
temperature at which the gas can be liquified by increase of 
pressure. 
At higher pressures and at lower temperatures all gases deviate 
more and more from the requirements of the perfect gas law. 
The behavior of carbon dioxide (t, = 31.35°) toward Boyle’s 
law at various temperatures is shown graphically in Fig. 4. The 
way in which the pv-product varies with the pressure at the 
temperatures indicated is shown by the curves. Fig. b is on a 
larger scale than Fig. a. The general behavior of carbon dioxide 
as indicated by these diagrams is characteristic of all gases. 
10. The Equations of van der Waals and of Berthelot. (a) 
The Equation of van der Waals.—In order to take into account 
the attractive forces between the molecules of real gases as well as 
the volume which the molecules themselves actually fill and thus 
to obtain an equation of state which would hold more accurately 
than the perfect gas law, especially for gases at high pressures, 
van der Waals? reasoned as follows: Consider a sphere of volume, 
vo, filled with one mole of a gas at the pressure, p, and the tem- 
perature, 7. Consider the layer of molecules which at any mo- 
ment are just about to strike the inner surface of the sphere. The 
force of their impacts and therefore the pressure exerted by them 
will be diminished owing to the attractive force exerted by all the 
other molecules of the gas behind them. This force of attrac- 
tion, f, will be proportional to the number of molecules at the 
surface and also proportional to the number in the interior of 
the gas and each of these in turn will be proportional to the 
density of the gas, or inversely proportional to the volume of 
the sphere. The force of attraction will, therefore, be propor- 
tional to the square of the density or inversely proportional to 
the square of the volume, or in mathematical language 
f=apr=4 (30) Vo

  Suc. 10] THE GASEOUS STATE OF AGGREGATION 39 
where a is the proportionality constant and f is expressed in 
pressure units. Between the actual pressure, p, exerted by the 
gas molecules and the “perfect gas pressure,’ pp, that is, the 
pressure which would be exerted if the force of attraction between 
the molecules were absent, there will evidently exist the relation, 
a Pela 2 alice (31) 
Again the actual volume, vo, of the sphere is not the volume vp 
which the molecules have to move freely about in, but is greater 
than this by an amount, b, a quantity which is a function? of the 
total volume occupied by the molecules themselves. We have 
therefore, 
vp = (00 — 2) bi Now on substituting this corrected pressure and volume in 
equation (26) derived above, we have 
(p+ 2 (vo— b) = RT (33) 
which is van der Waals’ equation of state for one mole of a gas, 
a and b being constants characteristic of the gas in question. 
Experiments show that the general behavior of gases as dis- 
played graphically by Figs. 4a and 4b is very well expressed 
mathematically by the equation of van der Waals. But although 
the equation of van der Waals correctly describes the general be- 
havior of gases (and likewise of many liquids) throughout the whole 
range of pressures and temperatures, it fails to represent quantita- 
tively the actual experimental data in many instances. Various 
modifications (over 100 in all) of the equation have been proposed 
from time to time by different physicists with the purpose of 
diminishing this objection. One of the more recent ones proposed 
by Keyes? and shown to have a wide range of applicability is

(6) Berthelot’s Equation.—The characteristic constants, a and 
6, of van der Waals’ equation have been found to bear a definite re- 
lation to the critical constants of the gas, from which in fact 
they may be computed. With the aid of this empirical relation 
Berthelot modified the equation of van der Waals by sub- 
stituting in place of a and 6 their values expressed in terms of 
the critical constants of the gas. The resulting equation after 
an algebraic rearrangement may be expressed as follows: 
  
meme htE-B)] 0 or is ae r 
iis a a 128 p.7 (1 = one) | (35) 
where p,, the critical pressure, is the pressure required to con- 
dense the gas at its critical temperature, T., and the other quan- 
tities have the significance previously given to them. The 
numerical constants are empirical ones. It is evident that this 
expression approaches the perfect gas law as p decreases or as 
T increases. 
The equation of Berthelot not only expresses the general be- 
havior of all pure gases thus far investigated but it does so with 
a high degree of accuracy, even for comparatively high pressures 
in some instances. This is well illustrated by problems 4, 5, and 
6, below and also by the data shown in Table II where the values 
of calculated by means of this equation agree within the ex- 
perimental errors with the values found by direct measurement. 
Even in the case of saturated vapors the results of experiment 
can be fairly well represented by Berthelot’s equation, as shown 
by the data in Table III. 
In using the Berthelot equation of state it should be remem- 
bered that it is applicable only to a pure gas, that is, to a gas in 
which at all temperatures and pressures up to the critical tem- 
perature and pressure, there is only one species of molecule. 
Moreover, in deriving his equation Berthelot explicitly assumes

that the gas is not at or near its critical temperature and pres- 
sure and the equation is, therefore, only applicable to cases where 
this condition is also fulfilled. In other words the equation must 
not be applied to mixtures of gases, or to partially associated or 
dissociated gases, or to gases in the neighborhood of the critical 
point. Berthelot’s equation has found its most important 
application in the exact determination of molecular and atomic 
weights as will be further explained in a following section. 
Problem 4.—The measured value of a for hydrogen at 0° is 1.006 for 
p = 10 atmospheres and 1.032 for p = 50 atmospheres. Compute the 
values by means of Berthelot’s equation of state and compare with the 
measured values. (See Table XII for data required.) 
Problem 5.—Make similar calculations for hydrogen at 100°. The ob- 
served values are 1.005 for 10 atmos. and 1.025 for 50 atmos. 
Problem 6.—Make similar calculations for hydrogen at —104°. The 
observed values are 1.007 at 10 atmos. and 1.039 at 50 atmos. 
Problem 7.—Make a similar calculation for CO2 at 0° and 50 atmos. 
The observed value is 0.098. Note that 0° and 50 atmospheres are close 
to the critical values for this gas and that Berthelot’s equation cannot be 
employed under these conditions, as the result of your calculation indicates. 
11. The Boyle Point.—From the observed values of a given 
in Table II it is evident that at 0° the deviation from unity is 
positive in the case of hydrogen and helium and negative in the 
case of all the other gases. At lower temperatures, however, the 
deviation becomes negative in the case of hydrogen also, while 
at higher temperatures the deviation in the case of the other 
gases changes from negative to positive. In other words, there 
is for each gas a certain temperature, called the Boyle point, at 
which the gas obeys the laws of Boyle and Avogadro exactly. 
Above this temperature the deviation from this law is positive 
while below this temperature it is negative. 
Problem 8.—By means of Berthelot’s equation of state show that the 
Boyle point, 7'z, of a gas is connected with its critical temperature by the re- 
lation, 77 = 2.44 T.. Compute the Boyle point for H2, In, N2,CO., CHa 
and NHs.

from which the molecular weight of a gas can be calculated if its 
density, D, is known at some temperature, 7’, and pressure, p. 
It is frequently customary to refer the densities of gases to that 
of some. gas employed as a standard. ‘Thus the density referred 
to oxygen for any gas signifies the ratio of its density, D, to that 
of oxygen, Do, at the same temperature and pressure. By 
dividing equation (36) by the corresponding equation for oxygen 
(ie, 32 = oat P   
(36) 
  
) we have 
D M = 32 De (37) 
or in words, the molecular weight of any gas is equal to 32 times 
its density referred to oxygen. Similarly if we choose to employ 
air as the reference gas, the above equation would read 
D M = 28.97 D, (38) 
where D, is the density of air at the same temperature and pres- 
sure and 28.97, the so-called ‘‘molecular weight” of air, is simply 
the value which experiment gives for the quantity, M, in equa- 
tion (36) when experimental data for air are substituted on the 
right-hand side of this equation. 
Since real gases do not obey the perfect gas law exactly, except 
in the limiting case of very low pressures, equation (37) will give 
accurate values for the molecular weight of a gas only if we 
D : : employ for Ds the value approached by this ratio as the pressure 
approaches zero. It is quite possible, as we shall see in the 
second part of this section, to determine this limiting value with 
a high degree of accuracy so that this equation can be and is em- 
ployed for the accurate determination of molecular and atomic 
weights. In the case of most gases, however, it is sufficient 
to determine the molecular weight approximately by means of 
equation (36) or (37) for the exact molecular weight can then be 
obtained simply by multiplying the combining weight of the

substance by the small whole number (or whole number ratio) 
which gives a product most nearly equal to the approximate 
molecular weight. 
Problem 9.—Calculate the approximate density of oxygen under standard 
conditions, that is, at 0° C. and a pressure of one atmosphere. (Its actually 
measured density under standard conditions is 1.4292 grams per liter.) 
Under the same conditions nitrogen weighs 1.2514 grams per liter. What is 
its density referred to oxygen? From the above data calculate the approxi- 
mate value of its molecular weight. ‘The analysis by Guye* and Drouginin 
of one of the oxides of nitrogen gave the composition 1 part of oxygen and 
0.43781 part of nitrogen. What is the combining weight of nitrogen in this 
compound? From this result and the approximate value for the molecular 
weight obtained above calculate a more exact value for the molecular weight 
of nitrogen. 
(b) Exact Molecular Weights from Gas Densities.*—If we 
apply the reasoning of the preceding paragraphs to Berthelot’s 
equation instead of to the perfect gas law, it will be easily seen 
that we shall obtain, in place of equation (36), the more exact

where A is written in place of the expression in the braces. From 
this relation the molecular weight of a gas can be very accurately 
calculated as will be understood from the solution of the following 
problems: 
Problem 10.—From the data given in Table XII calculate exact values 
for the molecular weights of Ox, Nz, Ar, N2O and CHsg, with the aid of 
Berthelot’s equation of state. 
Problem 11.—At 0° and 0.5 atmosphere the density of neon is 0.44986 
and that of sulphur dioxide is 1.4460 grams per liter. From these values 
and the densities under standard conditions (Table XII) compute the exact 
atomic weights of neon and of sulphur, without making any use of the crit- 
ical data in either instance. 
Problem 11 shows that Berthelot’s method can be employed 
to determine molecular weights accurately without the necessity

of knowing the critical constants. Measurement of the density 
of the gas at two different pressures is all that is required. This 
method of making the calculation is usually known as the method 
of limiting densities and is in general more reliable than the 
method of critical constants, illustrated by problem 10, because 
accurate values for the critical constants are rather difficult to 
obtain. 
_ If as above in our treatment of the perfect gas equation we 
choose to make use of densities referred to oxygen instead of 
absolute densities, we have only to apply the same reasoning, 
that is, we divide equation (40) by the corresponding equation 
for oxygen, 
  
2-2 hs + Aop) (41) 
and thus obtain in place of equation (37) the more exact relation, 
Delia A M = 32———— > 42, Do 1+ Aop (42) 
which, since at moderate pressures Ap and A,p are small in 
comparison with unity, may also be written 
Mo pe? 4+ ie dp) - 322 +p). De Do   
  
  
Problem 12.—Under standard conditions N2O is 1.38450 times as dense 
as oxygen. Calculate its molecular weight by the method of critical con- 
stants employing equation (43) and taking the necessary critical data from 
Table XII. 
Problem 13.—Under standard conditions the density of argon referred 
to oxygen is 1.24626. At the same temperature but at a pressure of 0.5 
atmosphere it is 1.24482. Calculate the molecular weight of argon by 
the method of limiting densities employing equation (43). 
Problem 14.—At 0° and a pressure of 0.5 atmosphere the density of oxy- 
gen is 0.71485 gram per liter and at 1 atmosphere it is 1.4290 grams per liter. 
From these two data calculate the numerical value of the gas constant, R. 
Berthelot’s methods of calculating exact molecular weights 
from gas densities are of particular value in connection with the 
inert gases of the argon group for since these gases have no com- 
bining weights their molecular and atomic weights: cannot be 
accurately obtained by the ordinary method. In Table IV 
below, atomic weights obtained from gas densities are compared

advantages would helium have over hydrogen? 
Problem 19.—A Bessemer converter is charged with 1000 kg’s. of iron

25 per cent., by weight, of oxygen) at 27° and 1 atm. are needed for the 
combustion of all the carbon, assuming }§ to burn to CO, and 34 to CO? 
What will be the partial pressures of all of the gases evolved by the converter? 
Problem 20.—10 grams of solid iodine, I:, are placed in a flask of one 
liter capacity and the flask is then filled with nitrogen at 20° and 750 mm.

Suc. 12] THE GASEOUS STATE OF AGGREGATION 47 
by the rise in temperature? What per cent. would be expelled from a 
block twice as large? When the block has reached a temperature of 100° 
the hot water is replaced by cold water at a temperature of 25° and the 
block after attaining this temperature is removed, dried superficially and 
weighed. How much does it weigh? The original weight of the block was 
130 grams and the specific gravity of the material composing it is 2.4. 
Problem 22.—In order to determine the porosity of the block described 
in problem 21, it is placed in an air tight vessel, evacuated to a manometer 
reading of p cm., and air-free cold water then admitted to cover the block.

calories of heat are used in heating up the excess air? ‘The specific heat of 
air is 0.24 cal. / deg. 
Problem 26.—A porcelain crucible containing 25 grams of clear glass and 
wound with platinum wire is placed in a hard glass tube. The tube is then 
evacuated, the crucible being heated sufficiently to drive out all of the 
adsorbed moisture. On cooling to 27° the pressure inside of the glass tube 
is 0.1 mm. The connection with the pump is closed and the glass is melted 
by passing a current through the heating coil. When the glass reaches a 
temperature of 1400° C. the current is cut off and the tube allowed to cool 
to 27° C. The manometer then reads 6 mm. The internal volume of the 
glass tube is 575 cc. The volume occupied by the crucible and heating wire 
is 100 ce. The density of the glass is 3.51. On analysis the evolved gas is 
found to consist of 24 per cent. COs, and 76 per cent. O2 by volume. What

CHAPTER III 
THE LIQUID STATE OF AGGREGATION 
1. Liquefaction of a Gas or Vapor.—Consider any pure sub- 
stance in the gaseous state enclosed in a transparent cylinder 
provided with a movable piston (Fig. 5). Let the cylinder be 
surrounded by some suitable bath by means of which its tem- 
perature can be kept constant at some point which may be any- 
where between the critical temperature and the melting point 
of the substance. Now let the pressure upon the gas be gradu- 
ally increased by forcing down the piston. The volume of the 
gas will be observed to gradually decrease as the pressure rises 
and after the pressure has been increased to a certain value (de- 
pending upon the nature of the substance and the temperature), 
a second phase, the liquid phase, will begin to appear. This 
phase usually appears first in the form of a fine mist which gradu- 
ally settles to the bottom of the cylinder where it collects to a 
mass of liquid which is seen to be separated from the gaseous 
phase remaining in the upper part of the cylinder by a sharp 
bounding surface (Fig. 6). As soon as the liquid phase has ap- 
peared in the system no further increase of pressure can be pro- 
duced as long as any of the gaseous phase remains. Any at- 
tempt to increase the pressure, ever so slightly, will result in the 
complete condensation (liquefaction) of all.of the gas (Fig. 7). 
This constant pressure, which always prevails in every system 
composed of a gas and a liquid in equilibrium with each other at 
a given temperature is called the vapor pressure or vapor tension 
of the liquid at that temperature and is a characteristic property 
of the liquid. When all the gas has been liquefied (Fig. 7) the 
pressure on the liquid can then be increased indefinitely. When 
the pressure on a liquid is increased, however, the corresponding 
decrease in volume is ordinarily very much smaller than is the 
case with a gas. In other words the compressibility of liquids, 
except in the neighborhood of the critical temperature, is com- 
paratively small.

If we were to carry out the reverse of the above process, start- 
ing with a liquid under high pressure and gradually decreasing 
the pressure, we should observe, after the pressure had reached 
a value equal to the vapor tension of the liquid, that some of 
the liquid would evaporate and the system would again become 
heterogeneous owing to the appearance of the gaseous phase, 
This behavior serves as a definite distinction between a liquid 
anda gas. (Cf. II, 1.)

2. General Characteristics of the Liquid State. Surface Ten- 
sion—The molecular condition in the interior of a body of 
liquid differs from that within the body of a gas in degree rather 
than in kind. The molecules of a liquid possess the same un- 
ordered or random motion characteristic of gas molecules, and 
experiments show that in a given liquid the mean kinetic energy, 
14mu?, of the moving molecules depends only upon the tempera- 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
Sxc. 2] THE LIQUID STATE OF AGGREGATION 51 
ture, being independent of the mass of the molecules and the 
same for all molecules within a given liquid phase. The mole- 
cules of a liquid are, however, much closer together than those 
of a gas under low pressure and hence the mean free path (II, 
1) of a liquid molecule is very short compared with that of a 
gaseous molecule. Moreover, the close proximity of the mole- 
cules to one another makes the effects of their mutual attractions 
and repulsions very pronounced and gives rise to the phenomenon 
of surface tension. Consider, for example, any molecule within 
the body of aliquid. It is very powerfully attracted by the other 
molecules which closely surround it but since it is surrounded on 
all sides by them it is on the average attracted to a like degree 
in all directions so that the attractive forces balance one an- 
other.1 The molecules in the surface layer of the liquid, how- 
ever, are attracted only downward and sideways, not upward, 
since there are no liquid molecules above them. As a result 
of these attractions the surface molecules act as though they 
formed a tightly stretched but elastic ‘‘skin’’ over the surface 
of the liquid and as a result of this surface tension, as it is called, 
every liquid when freed from the influence of external forces 
(such as gravitation, for example) always assumes a spherical 
shape since of all possible shapes the sphere is the one having 
the smallest surface. The surface tension always acts so as to 
make the total surface of the liquid as small as possible. The 
molecules in the surface film are also orientated, being arranged 
so that the “‘least active’’ portion of the molecule is presented to 
the vapor phase.* 
A liquid in a vessel under the influence of the attraction of the 
earth assumes the shape of the vessel and has a level surface. 
This is because the earth’s attraction largely overcomes the effect 
of the surface tension. At the point of contact between the 
surface of the liquid and the wall of the vessel, however, the 
surface is not level but always bends either upward or downward 
according to whether the liquid “wets” or does not ‘“‘wet” 
1 This attractive force is the same as that which is present in gases under 
high pressure and which was represented by the quantity, 3 (called the 
“internal pressure’’), in van der Waals’ equation (II, 10). In fact the 
equation of van der Waals will express very closely the variation of the 
yolume of a liquid with changes in its pressure and temperature.

  52 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. III 
the wall of the vessel. Thus water in glass always gives a 
meniscus which is concave upward while mercury which does 
not wet glass gives a meniscus which is concave downward. 
This effect of surface tension which is seen at the boundary be- 
tween the surface of the liquid and the enclosing wall is much 
more pronounced in the case of a liquid surface enclosed in a 
small tube or pore. If, for example, a capillary tube of glass is 
dipped into water, the water inside the capillary rises above the 
level of that outside (Fig. 8a), while if such a tube is dipped into 
mercury, the level in the tube is depressed below the level out- 
   Fic. 8b. 
side. (Fig. 8b). In each case the result is a smaller total surface 
for the liquid. By total surface in this case is meant the surface 
of contact between the liquid and some other phase which it 
does not wet. The phenomenon of the rise (or depression) of 
liquids in capillaries or small pores of any description is known 
as capillarity and is due to the surface tension of the liquid. 
Many other familiar phenomena such as the behavior of soap- 
bubble films, and the absorption of water by a sponge, are the 
result of surface tension. 
3. The Measurement of Surface Tension.—The unit of sur- 
face force, which is also called the surface tension, and is repre-
-P-A-G-E-81
Sxc. 3] THE LIQUID STATE OF AGGREGATION 53 
sented by the Greek letter gamma, 7, is defined as the force 
which acts upon a unit line, located within the surface. For 
example if an attempt were made to increase the surface of a 
liquid by pulling upon an imaginary line 1 cm. long, located 
within the surface, the force tending to oppose the increase in 
surface is called the surface tension, y, of the liquid. The mag- 
nitude of the surface tension is a characteristic property of the 
liquid. Of the various methods which are employed in its 
measurement we shall consider here only two of the most im- 
portant ones. 
(a) The Capillary Tube Method.—When a liquid rises in a 
capillary tube of radius, 7, the height, h, to which it will rise 
must evidently be such that the surface force, f,, which is hold- 
ing it up is just balanced by the force of gravity, f,, which is 
pulling it down, that is, 
fe =f qd) 
Now the surface force is acting upon a line of length, 1, which 
is equal to the inner circumference of the capillary tube and hence 
fo = ly = 2ary (2) 
The force of gravity acting upon the volume, V, (=zr?h) of 
raised liquid is 
to = mg = VDg = rr*hDg (3) 
where m is the mass and D the density of the liquid and g is 
the acceleration due to gravity. Hence 
fe = fg = 2ary = wr’hDg (4) 
and the surface tension, 
¥ = MgrhD (6) Problem 1.—The surface tension of water at 0° is 73.21 dynes per centi- 
meter. How high will water at this temperature rise in a glass capillary 
0.1 mm. in diameter? What will be the magnitude of the capillary pressure? 
What pressure would be required in order to prevent water from entering 
a capillary pore 0.0001 mm. in radius? 
(b) The Drop-weight Method.—When a drop of liquid forms 
slowly at a capillary tip (the tip of a pipette, for example), the 
size attained by the drop just before it breaks away from the tip 
will evidently depend upon the surface tension of the liquid,
-P-A-G-E-82
————LLLLL eee 
54 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY |Cuar. III 
Lohnstein? has shown that for a properly constructed tip the 
weight, w, of the drop which falls from it under the above condi- 
tions is given by the expression, 
if 
w = Qnrvf (x) (6) 
where r is the internal radius of the tip and V is the volume of the 
drop. For a series of liquids it may be possible to choose a 
value for r such that the function, i(Fa), will be practically 
constant for all the liquids in the series and under these circum- 
stances the above expression becomes, approximately, 
w= ky (7) 
that is, the drop-weights of these liquids from this particular 
tip will be directly proportional to their surface tensions. Since 
drop-weights can usually be more easily and accurately measured 
than the capillary rise, the drop-weight method has been shown* 
by Morgan? to be especially valuable for determining the relative 
surface tensions of liquids. In order to determine the absolute 
value of the surface tension by the drop-weight method the 
capillary tip employed should be standardized by measurements 
with a liquid whose absolute surface tension is known. This 
standardization consists in determining the value of k in equa- 
tion (7), or better still,4 in determining the values of r and of 
the function f ( ) in equation (6) as described by Harkins and 
Brown. 
4, The Equations of Eétvés and of Ramsay and Shields.—The 
smallest surface which one molal weight of a liquid can have is its 
surface when in the form of a sphere. This surface, which is 
called the molal surface, and is represented by So, is evidently 
expressed by the relation, 
3 
Som Vo = aH) (8) 
where Vo is the molal volume of the liquid, M its molal weight, 
and D its density. The product of the surface tension into 
the molal surface, ySo, evidently has the dimensions of work

or energy and is called the molal surface energy. It represents 
the work involved in producing the surface, So, against the 
surface tension, y. It is analogous to the molal volume energy, 
pvo, in the case of a gas (II, 4). 
Between the molal surface energy of pure (7.e., non-asso- 
ciated) liquids and the temperature there exists a relation, dis- 
covered by Eétvés* in 1886, which is perfectly analogous to 
equation (13, II) for gases. It is expressed mathematically by 
the equatior, 
SSO al” 6) " oo, ub (5) " 
dt di " dt 
where K, is a constant which has the same value for all pure 
liquids. Expressed in words this equation states that: The 
temperature rate of change of the molal surface energy of 
a pure liquid is independent of the temperature and of the 
nature of the liquid. The independence with respect to the 
temperature is illustrated by the data given in Table V.

where é, is the critical temporature of the substance in each case. 
Equation (10), therefore, becomes 
7(M)* = Ku - 1-6) (12) 
which is known as the Equation of Ramsay and Shields. As a 
tule, this relation does not hold unless ¢. — ¢ is greater than 35°, 
that is, in the neighborhood of the critical temperature the rela- 
tion fails. The constant, K,, has the average value 2.1 ergs 
per degree, when y is expressed in dynes. This value is based 
upon the assumption that the substance in the liquid state has 
the same molecular weight as it has in the gaseous state. 
Equation (12) may also be written, ySo = k0@, where @ repre- 
sents the temperature counted downward from a point 6° below 
the critical temperature of the liquid. This form of writing 
the equation brings out its resemblance to equation (16, II) for 
gases. 
In Table VI are shown the values of this constant for a variety 
of different liquids. The data given in the first four sections of 
this table show that the value of this constant is close to 2.1 in 
the case of nearly all of the liquids given. These liquids are

however, have values of K, which are considerably higher than

very high molecular weight-have values of K, which are decid-

edly larger than 2.1. In fact Walden? and Swinne find® that this 
constant can be approximately calculated from the expression, 
K,=1.90+0.011 (2n/A) (13) 
where 2nv/A is the sum of the square roots of the atomic weights 
of the elements in the compound, each square root being multi- 
plied by the corresponding subscript as shown by the formula 
of the compound. Thus for tristearine, Cs;Hi1006, we have 
DnWV A =57 V/124-1104/1 +6 +16 = 327 and K, = 1.90-+0.011X 
327=5.5 as against the observed value 5.7 given in the table. 
For closely related substances the agreement of the K,-values 
with one another is sometimes a very exact one, as shown by the 
figures given in Table VII, which are based upon relative surface 
tensions determined by the drop-weight method.

5. Molecular Weights of Liquids.—All of the K.-values given 
in Tables V, VI, and VII, were calculated on the assumption 
that the molecular weight in the liquid is the same as that in the 
gaseous state in the case of every substance and the agreement 
between the K,-values obtained with different liquids shows that 
for a great variety of substances and especially for related sub- 
stances, equation (9) holds with considerable exactness. It 
should be noted, however, that just as good agreement would be 
obtained, if in each instance the molecular weight of the liquid 
were assumed to be two or three or any other multiple of its 
molecular weight in the gaseous state. In other words, the agree- 
ment of the K,-values obtained with different liquids does not 
necessarily show that they have the same molecular weight in 
the liquid and gaseous states. It does, however, indicate that

  Sxc. 5] THE LIQUID STATE OF AGGREGATION 59 
if the molecular weight in the liquid state is not the same as in the 
gaseous state, then it must be some multiple of the latter, which 
multiple is independent both of the nature of the liquid and of its 
temperature. It would be rather remarkable if such a condition 
were true for any other multiple than unity. Moreover we have 
additional evidence of quite another character that this multiple 
is, in fact, unity and that all substances which obey the Eétvés 
equation have the same molecular formulas in both the liquid 
and the gaseous states of aggregation. The Eétvés equation 
can, therefore, be employed for calculating the approximate value 
of the molecular weight of a pure substance in the liquid state 
from measurements of its surface tension at two temperatures. 
The calculation is most conveniently made from the relation, 
n(p) |» (5,)" b—- ty =K, (14) 
and the temperature difference, t2—¢, should be fairly large. 
Returning now to section 5 of Table VI, it is evident that the 
liquids included in this section have K,-values which are much 
smaller than those of the other liquids. Moreover, the K.- 
values of these liquids are not constant with respect to varia- 
tions in the temperature, that is, these liquids do not obey the 
equation of Eétvés. This is clearly shown by the K,.-values for 
water given in Table VIII. It is evident, therefore, that since 
the Eétvés equation is not obeyed by these liquids it cannot be 
logically employed in calculating their molecular weights.® If 
it is so employed, the molecular weights thus calculated are found 
to vary with the temperature and to be from two to three times

as large as the molecular weights in the gaseous state. The most 
probable explanation of the behavior of these liquids is that they 
are not pure substances in the sense in which we have defined 
the term (I, 2), that is, they do not consist of a single species of 
molecule but of a mixture of two or more species in equilibrium 
with one another. Indeed there is abundant evidence from other 
sources that liquid water is a mixture of the following species of 
molecules, HzO, (H20)2, (H2O)s and perhaps higher polymers, 
all in chemical equilibrium with one another. Equilibrium 
mixtures, of this character which in many respects behave like 
pure substances are usually called associated substances, to 
distinguish them from pure substances in the true sense of the 
term which are non-associated and contain but one species of 
molecule. Substances of the latter class in the liquid state are 
also sometimes called “normal liquids” for the same reason. 
Problem 2.—From a certain capillary tip the drop-weight of benzene at 
11.4° is 35.239 milligrams and at 68.5° it is 26.530 milligrams. Its densities 
at the same temperatures are 0.888 and 0.827 grams per cubic centimeter 
respectively. Calculate the critical temperature of benzene. 
Problem 3.—From the same tip as in problem (2) the drop-weight of chlor- 
benzene is 41.082 milligrams at 8.2° (D = 1.120) and 32.054 milligrams at 
72.2° (D = 1.0498). Calculate its molecular weight in the liquid state. 
Calculate also its critical temperature [/, observed = 360°]. 
Problem 4.—From the same tip the drop-weight of aniline, CcsHsNHa, at 
51.7° is 45.903 milligrams (D = 0.9944). Calculate the critical temperature 
of aniline [¢. observed = 426°]. 
6. Viscosity and Fluidity (The resistance experienced by the 
molecules in moving around in the interior of a body is termed its 
viscosity. ) The viscosity of gases is very low, that of solids very 
high, while that of liquids includes a wide range of variation. 
Some liquids, like ether, are very mobile, while others such as 
pitch and tar are very viscous. The unit of viscosity, called the 
coefficient of viscosity or simply the viscosity, is represented by 
the Greek letter eta, 7 and is defined by the equation: 
7 ldu 
1 fdr eis where u is the velocity with which two horizontal planes of the 
fluid, of unit area andr centimeters apart, move with respect to 
each other when acted upon by the tangental force, f. The unit 
of viscosity in the c.g.s. system is called the poise. The viscosity
-P-A-G-E-89
Szc. 7] THE LIQUID STATE OF AGGREGATION 61 
of fluids is commonly measured by determining the time of flow 
of a measured volume of the fluid through a standardized capil- 
lary tube, under a definite difference of pressure. The more 
viscous a liquid, the more slowly it flows. 
The reciprocal of viscosity is called fluidity, ¢, (6 = ;) and is 
sometimes a more convenient quantity to employ than the vis- 
cosity itself. (The fluidity is evidently a measure of the ten- 
dency of substances to flow, while its reciprocal, the viscosity, is 
a measure of the resistance to flow.) The property of flowing 
when subjected to a shearing force, no matter how small, is pos- 
sessed by all gases and by most liquids and they are commonly 
classed as fluids for this reason. 
7. The Flow of Fluids through Capillary Tubes.°—For a liquid 
of viscosity » moving with uniform velocity through a capillary 
tube of length / and radius 7, the volume of flow in the time ¢ is 
given by Poiseuille’s* law

(16) 
where P is the driving pressure. 
If a liquid which wets the capillary and has a surface tension 
y, enters one end of an empty capillary of indefinite length under 
the driving pressure, P, its rate of progress along the capillary 
will, according to Poiseuille’s law, be

Problem 5.—Derive equation (17) from (16). 
In addition to any external driving pressure which may be 
acting (e.g., atmospheric pressure, hydrostatic pressure, etc.) to (17) 
drive the liquid into the capillary, the capillary pressure = isalso 
effective and must be added in, in calculating the total driving 
pressure. If the capillary is very fine, the capillary pressure may 
reach a large magnitude (cf. Problem 1). When the capillary

which on integration gives, for horizontal capillaries or for short - 
capillaries in any position, 
ee 6 *) rt (19) 
or stated in words, when a liquid enters a capillary under its own 
capillary pressure the distance of penetration is proportional to 
the square root of the time of penetration. (18) 
The quantity, 4 a measures the penetrating power of the 
liquid and is called the coefficient of penetrance or the penetrativity 
z. Stated in words, the penetrativity of a liquid is equal to the 
distance (squared) which the liquid will penetrate a cylindrical 
capillary of unit radius in unit time when flowing under its 
own capillary pressure. The penetrativity is independent of the 
nature of the material composing the capillary provided the 
liquid wets this material. 
Problem 6.—The viscosity of water at 0° is 0.018 poise. Calculate its 
coefficient of penetrance. In what time would water at 0° penetrate 5 cms. 
into a capillary pore 0.0001 mm. in radius. (Cf. Prob. 1.) 
Problem 7.—An evacuated vessel containing a porous body is opened 
under a liquid. Assuming the body to be made up of very fine capillaries 
whose radii do not vary with their lengths show that the degree of satura- 
tion of the porous body at the end of the time ¢ is given by the expression 
7 4 
mer = (B)” (20) Vid 2n 
where k is a constant characteristic of the body, V is the volume of liquid in 
the body at the end of the time #, and V = is the total volume of the pores. 
If the degree of saturation of such a body by water at 0° is 98 per cent. at 
the end of 2 minutes, how long would be required for vaseline at 50° to give 
the same degree of saturation. The coefficient of penetrance of the vaseline 
may be assumed to be 0.01 of that of the water. 
For capillaries with diameters approaching in magnitude that 
of the molecules of the liquid, Poiseuille’s law and the conclusions 
drawn from it no longer apply, the velocity of flow being probably 
much smaller than that given by Poiseuille’s law. Furthermore 
if the radius of a capillary changes with its length, particularly
-P-A-G-E-91
  
  Suc. 8] THE LIQUID STATE OF AGGREGATION 63 
if it contains an enlargement or ends in a pocket, the time required 
to fill it would be very much longer than the values calculated 
from the foregoing equations. These considerations limit the 
application of the theory in practice. 
8. Plastic Flow.’—Poiseuille’s law for a given capillary tube 
and a given fluid may be written, 
velocity of flow = y = K,P (21) 
that is, viscous flow, as it is called, is characterized by a velocity 
which is directly proportional to the driving pressure. There is 
also another type of flow known as plastic flow, exhibited by 
plastic solids and obeying a different law. The relation between 
the two types of flow will be clear from the following considerations. 
If we add to a mobile liquid such as water, some finely divided 
material, such as clay, which is wetted by the liquid, we will 
obtain a suspension of the solid in the liquid. If we measure the 
fluidity ¢, of such a suspension with the aid of a capillary-flow 
viscosimeter we find that the following relation exists 
$= (1- a $ (22) © 
where ¢ is the fluidity of the water, b is the per cent., by volume, 
of the clay in the mixture and c is the particular value of b at 
which ¢, becomes zero. 
As we continue to add clay to the water, the fluidity of the 
suspension decreases, but it still obeys Poiseuille’s law, that is, 
exhibits viscous flow, until finally a volume concentration is 
reached at which 6 = c, when viscous flow ceases. This cor- 
responds to the point at which the small particles of clay no 
longer roll over one another when they happen to collide in the 
capillary, but instead form bridges across it, and since a certain 
pressure is required to break such bridges and keep the mass 
moving, viscous flow ceases and plastic flow begins. 
' Plastic flow is distinguished from viscous flow by requiring an 
initial pressure P, of a certain magnitude in order to start it, 
the velocity of flow being proportional to the difference between 
the pressure applied and this initial starting pressure or ‘‘yield 
value,” z.e., Vv 
7 = KP — P,) (23) 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
64 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. III 
This relation fails for very low values of P — Po and also for 
very high values owing to a slipping of the mass as a whole 
through the tube, but in the absence of slippage the relation 
has been shown by Bingham‘ to represent the data of experiment 
satisfactorily. 
If we substitute P — P, in Poiseuille’s law in place of P, the 
law will then hold for plastic flow and the quantity » which will 
take the place of 1/7 in the equation is defined by the equation 
and is called the mobility of the material. It is evidently analo- 
gous to the fluidity of a fluid. 
Problem 8.—Show that the amount of material which must be added to 
water in order to establish plastic flow will be smaller the smaller the par- 
ticles in the resulting suspension. 
The ‘‘yield value” P, has been found by experiment® to depend 
not only upon the nature of the material but also upon the length 
and radius of the capillary. A quantity characteristic of the 
material only may, however, be obtained by multiplying the 
yield value by a certain known empirical function of the length 
and radius of the capillary, this function being approximately 
equal to r The “yield-value-factor,” Y, thus obtained, together 
with the mobility, u, of the material are necessary and sufficient 
for the complete quantitative description of plastic flow and of 
“plasticity.”” The “plasticity” of a material may indeed be 
quantitatively defined and measured by the value of the product, 
nY, but a knowledge of the separate values of » and of Y, rather 
than merely their product, is what is really needed in judging 
the value of a plastic material for a given purpose.

CHAPTER IV 
LIQUID-GAS SYSTEMS 
1. The Molecular Kinetics of Vaporization—The molecules 
of a liquid are in a state of constant unordered motion like those 
of a gas but they collide with one another much more frequently 
owing to the greater number of them in a given volume. These 
collisions take place without loss of energy and although the 
velocities of the different molecules vary all the way from zero 
to very large values there is a certain mean velocity corresponding 
to the mean kinetic energy (!4mu?) which for a given liquid 
depends only upon the temperature. This mean velocity is too 
small to allow the molecules possessing it to escape from a free 
surface of the liquid. There are always present, however, some 
molecules possessing a much higher velocity than this mean ve- 
locity, so that if the liquid is brought into contact with a vacuous 
space, some of these rapidly moving molecules will escape through 
the surface of the liquid into the space above it. In other words, 
some of the liquid will evaporate. This evaporation will con- 
tinue until the vapor above the liquid reaches a certain definite 
pressure, determined only by the temperature and by the nature 
of the liquid. This pressure is the vapor pressure or vapor ten- 
sion of the liquid. It is evidently that pressure at which the 
rate of escape into the gas phase of the more rapidly moving liquid 
molecules is exactly balanced by the return into the liquid phase 
of the gaseous molecules. ‘Thus while a vapor which is not in 
contact with its liquid may have any pressure from zero up to a 
value somewhat exceeding the vapor pressure, a vapor in contact 
with its liquid can have only one pressure at a given temperature, 
namely, the vapor pressure of the liquid at the temperature. 
If a liquid is brought in contact with a space containing some 
other gas at a moderate pressure (say not exceeding one atmos- 
phere), then if this other gas is nearly insoluble in the liquid, 
it follows from Dalton’s law of partial pressures (II, 6) that 
approximately the same amount of liquid will evaporate into 
5 65

the space as would if the second gas were not present, provided of 
course that the molecules of the liquid do not react chemically 
with those of the gas. Thus the vapor tension of water in con- 
tact with air is approximately the same as its vapor pressure in a 
space containing no second gas. If the pressure of the second 
gas is large or if it is appreciably soluble in the liquid, this princi- 
ple is no longer valid. In other words, it is strictly valid only 
for the limiting case of an insoluble gas at a very small pressure 
and in any actual case it holds more exactly the more nearly these 
two conditions are fulfilled. 
In Table IX the vapor pressures of a number of liquids at 20° 
are given.

2. Heat of Vaporization—Since only those molecules can 
escape from the liquid phase which possess kinetic energies con- 
siderably greater than the mean kinetic energy, it is clear that 
the mean kinetic energy of the remaining molecules must have 
a lower value after the escape of the more rapidly moving ones. 
In other words the temperature of the liquid tends to fall during 
evaporation and in order to maintain it at a constant value, 
heat must be added to the liquid from some external source. 
This heat is called the latent heat of vaporization. The mo- 
lal heat of vaporization, L,, of a liquid under constant pres- 
sure, P, at any temperature, 7’, is the quantity of heat which it 
is necessary to add to the liquid in order to maintain its tempera- 
ture at 7’ while one gram molecular weight of the liquid evapo- 
rates. The heat of vaporization varies with the nature of the 
liquid, with its temperature, and (to a very slight extent) with 
the pressure upon it.
-P-A-G-E-95
Suc. 3] LIQUID-GAS SYSTEMS 67 
3. Boiling Point.—When a liquid is heated under a definite 
external pressure (water under the pressure of the atmosphere, 
for example), its vapor pressure increases with rise in tempera- 
ture until finally a temperature is reached at which bubbles of 
vapor form and rise from within the body of the liquid and es- 
cape into the space above it. The liquid is then said to boil. 
The boiling point is defined as the temperature at which a liquid 
is in equilibrium with its vapor, when the vapor pressure is 
equal to the total pressure upon the liquid. The temperature 
indicated by a thermometer placed in a boiling liquid is usually 
not its boiling point, for unless special precautions are taken a 
liquid does not boil under equilibrium conditions. In order to 
secure equilibrium and to measure the temperature correspond- 
ing to it, it is necessary to bring an intimate mixture of vapor 
and liquid both under the same total pressure, into contact with 
the thermometer under certain conditions,‘ the details of which 
belong to the subject of methods of physical measurements, 
with which it is not the purpose of this book to deal. 
Since the vapor pressure of a liquid always increases with in- 
crease of temperature, it follows from the definition of boiling 
point that it also must increase with the external pressure upon 
the liquid.. The boiling point of a liquid under a pressure of 
one atmosphere (76 cm. of Hg) is called the normal boiling 
point and, unless otherwise specified, it is this temperature which 
is meant when the term boiling point is used. 
4. The Rule of Ramsay and Young.—If 7’, and 7's are the 
absolute boiling points of two related, pure (non-associated) 
substances at the pressure, p; and 7”, and 7’x their boiling points 
at some other pressure, p’, Ramsay and Young? found that these 
temperatures were connected by the following relation, applicable

5. Correction of Boiling Points to Normal Pressure. The 
Rule of Crafts.—In practice the boiling point of a liquid is usu- 
ally determined at the atmospheric pressure prevailing at the 
time the measurement is made. For purposes of record and of 
comparison, it is desirable to know the normal boiling point. 
The necessary correction which must be applied in order to re- 
duce the observed boiling point to the normal pressure can be 
conveniently calculated by means of a rule, proposed by Crafts,* 
which is based upon that of Ramsay and Young. The cortec- 
tion, At, to be added to a boiling point, ‘7',, on the absolute scale, 
determined at a pressure of P mm, in order to reduce it to 760 
mm. is given by the relation,

liquids is about 0.00012 but it varies somewhat with the nature 
of the liquid and in practice the value for some liquid which is

be employed in calculating the correction. Table XI gives the 
values of c X 164 for a variety of different liquids. The con- |

6. Trouton’s Rule.2—This rule states that for closely related 
substances the molal heat of vaporization at the normal boiling 
point, divided by the normal boiling point on the absolute scale 
is a constant, that is, 
  
  ” = const. = 22 (3) T Bo 
A modified Trouton’s* rule proposed by Nernst? is the following, 
Ly = 9.5 logio Tz. — 0.0077 2, (4) 
T Bo 
which is more accurate and includes a large variety of substances. 
Problem 2.—Calculate the heats of vaporization of six of the substances 
given in Table XII. Look up the experimentally determined values for 
the same substances and compare. Use the Landolt-Bérnstein Physikal- 
isch-Chemische Tabellen (4th ed., 1912) and the “Annual Tables of Phys- 
ical and Chemical Constants” in looking for the experimental values. 
According to Hildebrand¢ Trouton’s rule holds more accurately 
: 7 . Le and for a wider range of substances, if the ratios, 7, for the vari- 
ous liquids are compared at such temperatures 7',, that the 
saturated vapors have the same concentration. Thus if this con- 
centration be taken as 0.00507 moles per liter the quantity ps 
has the value 13.7 for non-metals and 13.2 for metals?. 
7. The Critical Phenomena.—The significance of the terms 
critical temperature and critical pressure has already been 
briefly explained at the point where they were first employed in 
our treatment of the properties of gases. We shall now take up 
in considerable detail the phenomena which one observes when a 
pure liquid is gradually heated in a closed vessel in contact with 
its vapor. For this purpose we will imagine our liquid enclosed 
in a transparent cylinder provided with a movable piston. To 
take a concrete case suppose we start with liquid isopentane, a 
substance which has been very fully investigated by Young.

Starting with 1 gram of the liquid under an initial pressure of 
about 42 meters of mercury (Fig. 7) and at a temperature of 160°, 
we will gradually decrease the pressure, keeping the tempera- 
ture constant, and in order to see clearly the relation between the 
volume of the isopentane and the pressure upon it we will con- 
struct a diagram in which the pressures will be plotted as ordinates 
and the corresponding volumes as abscisse. Such a diagram is 
shown in Fig. 9, the small circles representing observed values. 
Starting at the point, A, therefore, (p= 25.2, v= 2.3) we gradually 
decrease the pressure which follows the line, AB. When the 
point, B, is reached where the pressure is 16.3 meters of mercury 
the vapor phase appears, since 16.3 is the vapor pressure of iso- 
pentane at 160°. The abscissa of this point, 2.38 cc, is evidently 
the specific volume of liquid isopentane at 160° when under its 
own vapor pressure. It is called the orthobaric specific volume 
of the liquid. As we continue to raise the piston the liquid con- 
tinues to evaporate (Fig. 6) and the total volume consequently in- 
_ creases along the line, BC, while the pressure remains perfectly 
constant. When the point, C, is reached all of the liquid has 
evaporated and the abscissa of this point, 13.72 cc, is therefore 
the specific volume of the saturated vapor at this temperature. 
It is called the orthobaric specific volume of the vapor. If we 
now continue to raise the piston (Fig. 5) the pressure falls and the 
volume increases as shown by the curve CD, and this curve 
would continue in this direction until the pressure falls to zero 
and the volume becomes infinite. Along the portion, AB, there- 
fore, we have only liquid isopentane and, as is characteristic of 
the liquid state, the volume is seen to change but slightly with 
change in pressure. Along the portion, BC, we have both liquid 
and vapor in equilibrium at the constant pressure, 16.3, which is 
the vapor pressure of the liquid at this temperature. Finally 
along the portion, CD, we have only the vapor, and its volume 
decreases approximately in inverse proportion to the pressure, as 
required by the perfect gas law. The whole curve, ABCD, is 
called the isothermal for 160°. f 
If we now raise the temperature to 170° and repeat the above 
process, we obtain the isothermal labeled 170°, which differs 
from the previous one chiefly in the respect that the horizontal 
portion, BC, is shorter, that is, the orthobaric specific volumes 
 
-P-A-G-E-100

and, therefore, the orthobaric densities of liquid and vapor are 
much nearer together than at 160°. Passing then to the iso- 
thermal for 180° we see the two orthobaric specific volumes ap-

identical and the distinction between gas and liquid disappears.

tension of the liquid gradually decreases and finally becomes 
zero at the critical point. The temperature of the critical iso- 
therm is called the critical temperature, ¢., of the substance. 
The corresponding pressure, which is evidently the vapor pres- 
sure of the liquid at the critical temperature as well as the maxi- 
mum vapor pressure which the liquid can have, since it ceases 
to exist at this point, is called the critical pressure, p., of the 
substance. The density of the substance at the critical point is 
called the critical density, D., and the reciprocal of the density 
or the specific volume is called the critical volume, v».. The 
critical constants of a number of substances are given in Table 
XII. Above its critical temperature no gas can be caused to 
liquify no matter how great a pressure is put upon it. In Fig. 
9 the isothermals above the critical point show at first a flatten- 
ing in the neighborhood of the critical volume. With increasing 
temperature, however, this flattening gradually disappears and 
the isothermals smooth out into the hyperbolas of a perfect gas, 
hyperbolas which, in other words, are graphs of the equation,

This is illustrated graphically in Fig. 10 which is self explanatory.

of the critical density of a substance, as it is usually not possible 
to measure this density directly. The method of applying the 
rule to such cases is illustrated by problem 5. As a rule the re-

critical point than it does at lower temperatures.

attractive forces between the molecules of a liquid, which are 
responsible for the phenomenon of surface tension, are also the 
cause of the relatively small volume occupied by liquids as 
compared with gases. In the absence of such attractive forces, 
it would obviously require very large pressures in order to com- 
press the molecules into the small space which they occupy in the 
liquid state. 
The pressure which would be required for such a compression 
in the case of a given liquid is called the internal pressure, P;, of 
the liquid. 
According to the theory of van der Waals, the quantity = in his 
equation of state (II, 10a) evidently represents this internal 
pressure due to molecular attraction and its value may therefore 
be calculated from the value of a, Other methods of calculating

the internal pressure have been suggested and while the various 
methods do not agree very well as regards the absolute values 
which they give, the same relative values for different liquids are 
usually obtained.. A critical discussion of these methods may 
be found in a paper by Hildebrand on which the accompanying 
table of relative internal pressures is based. 
10. Superheating and Supercooling.—When a body of liquid is 
gradually heated from the outside it is frequently possible to raise 
its temperature considerably above its boiling point—as much as 
200° in the case of water. Such a liquid is said to be superheated. 
When a liquid is heated in a vessel by the application of heat to 
the bottom of the vessel, the lower layers of the liquid become 
superheated and from time to time portions of these superheated 
layers change into vapor with explosive violence causing the 
phenomenon known as “bumping.’’ Superheating and hence 
bumping can be prevented or greatly reduced by having some of 
the vapor phase in contact with the liquid at the point where 
heat is applied. In practice this is usually attained by intro- 
ducing pieces of capillary tubing or of porous porcelain plate. 
The small capillaries become filled with vapor and the presence 
of the vapor tends to prevent superheating of the liquid which 
thus boils quietly, the bubbles of vapor forming and rising from 
the point of contact of the liquid with the vapor held in the 
capillaries. * 
The reverse of superheating, that is supercooling, is fre- 
quently observed when a gas or vapor is cooled. It may be 
cooled considerably below the temperature at which its pressure 
becomes equal to the vapor pressure of the liquid, without the 
appearance of any liquid phase in the system. If a single drop 
of liquid be introduced, however, condensation immediately oc- 
curs. In fact as a general rule when any phase, whether liquid, 
gas, or solid, reaches a condition where it ought normally to 
change over into another state of aggregation or another phase, this 
change frequently does not take place at once but supercooling or 
superheating occurs instead. The introduction of a trace of the 
second phase, however, is usually sufficient to bring about the 
change and to prevent any great degree of supercooling or super- 
heating. Mechanical agitation or the presence of small particles, 
such as dust, frequently has a similar effect.*

  CHAPTER V 
THE CRYSTALLINE STATE OF AGGREGATION 
1. General Characteristics of the Crystalline State——-When a 
substance in the gaseous state at any temperature below its melt- 
ing point is subjected to gradually increasing pressures, or when 
a substance in the liquid state is gradually cooled, a point will 
usually be reached where a third state of aggregation, the crys- 
talline state, appears in the system. This state of aggregation 
is characterized by a very slight compressibility, usually much 
smaller even than that of the liquid state. Examination of any 
substance in the crystalline state shows that it is made up of an 
aggregation of individuals having a definite geometric form, which 
form is one of the characteristic properties of the substance. 
These geometric forms are called crystals and the physical prop- 
erties of these crystals bear a close connection to the crystalline 
form. A crystal may, in fact, be defined as a homogeneous body 
possessing definite and characteristic vector properties, that is, 
properties which are different in different directions through the 
crystal. Such a body is called an anisotropic body (I, 9). Thus, 
for example, the conductivity for heat or for electricity measured 
in one direction through a crystal may be different from that 
measured in a direction at right angles to the first, and the index 
of refraction for light usually depends upon the direction in which 
the light is sent through the crystal. The systematic descrip- 
tion and classification of the different geometric forms displayed 
by crystals and the relation of these forms to the physical prop- 
erties of the crystals belongs to the subject of crystallography, 
which will not be entered upon in this book. 
In the case of most crystalline substances the crystals possess 
rigidity, that is, they offer a resistance to deformation by mechan- 
ical force. For this reason they are called solid substances and 
because the property of solidity is common to the large majority 
of crystalline substances, the crystalline state is commonly 
spoken of as the solid state. The property of solidity is by no 
means restricted to crystals, however, but is possessed to a very 
pronounced degree by some liquids. Moreover, there are some 
79
-P-A-G-E-108
  80 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. V 
crystals which possess scarcely any appreciable solidity. The 
term crystalline state is, therefore, a better name for this state 
of aggregation than the more customary one of “‘solid state.” 
When a crystalline substance is gradually heated under 
constant pressure (that of the atmosphere, for example) it either 
completely evaporates, thus changing into a gas or vapor, or 
else, if the pressure upon it be sufficiently great, it loses its 
crystalline form and changes into the liquid state, as soon as a 
definite temperature is reached. This temperature, which de- 
pends to a slight extent upon the pressure, is called the melting 
point of the substance and is one of its most characteristic prop- 
erties. The molecular kinetics of the melting process and the 
probable molecular condition within a crystal will be considered 
in the next chapter. 
2. Liquid Crystals—Most crystals are rigid and will fracture 
when subjected to pressure, but many substances are known to 
form crystals in which the crystal forces are so weak that the 
crystals can be easily distorted and will even flow, form drops 
and rise in capillary tubes under the influence of the surface ten- 
sion forces. They are called liquid crystals? (more properly 
fluid crystals) or crystalline liquids. In common with solid crys- 
tals, however, they possess a definite melting point and the 
optical properties characteristic of the crystalline state. The 
property of flowing under pressure is not confined to substances 
usually called liquid crystals, however, but is probably possessed 
to some extent by all crystals. Thus ice, which will fracture if 
struck, will gradually flow, if subjected to great pressure. This 
gradual flow is probably at least partially responsible for the 
movement of glaciers down mountain sides and through valleys. 
3. Polymorphism and Transition Point—When a crystalline 
substance is gradually heated (or subjected to increased pressure) 
we find in most cases that when a certain temperature (or 
pressure) is reached a change occurs in which this crystal form 
disappears and a second crystal form appears. That is, the 
substance has the property of existing in more than one form of 
crystals. This property is known as polymorphism. The 
transition of one form into the other is usually attended by a 
pronounced volume change and an appreciable evolution or 
absorption of heat. The two forms of crystals are perfectly
-P-A-G-E-109
Sec. 4] THE CRYSTALLINE STATE OF AGGREGATION 81 
distinct and must be regarded as different crystalline phases. At 
a certain temperature under a given pressure called the transition 
or inversion temperature for that pressure these two phases can 
exist in equilibrium with each other. Above this temperature 
one form only is stable and below this temperature the other 
form only is stable. The quantity of heat absorbed when one 
mole of a substance in the crystalline form A, changes to the 
form, B, at the transition temperature is called the molal heat 
of transition from the form, A, to the form, B, at this tempera- 
ture. The transition temperature varies but slightly with the 
pressure. 
The nature of the molecular kinetics of the process of transi- 
tion may be inferred from that of the process of fusion which 
will be described in the next chapter. Owing to the restricted 
character of the atomic and molecular motion in a crystal (see 
VII, 1), the process of transition from one form to the other is fre- 
quently a very slow one and if the transition temperature happens 
to be rather high, both forms can be kept for practically an indefi- 
nite period at ordinary temperatures although only one of these 
forms is strictly stable under these conditions. The unstable 
form has still the tendency to change over to the other even though 
no change can be observed over long periods of time. (Cf. Super- 
cooling of Liquids, VII, 3.) Thus two crystalline modifications 
of calcium carbonate, calcite and aragonite, are found in nature 
although only the former is “stable” at ordinary temperatures 
and pressures. 
4. Isomorphism and the Rule of Mitscherlich.—It frequently 
happens that two substances of analogous composition such as 
arsenic acid, HzAsO,, and phosphoric acid, HsPO,, form crystals 
which resemble each other very closely, so closely in fact that 
when a crystal of one is placed in a solution of the other the 
second will crystallize out upon the first and from a solution 
containing both substances mixed crystals, that is, homogenous 
erystals containing both substances, can be frequently obtained. 
Such substances are said to be isomorphous. On the basis of this 
behavior Mitscherlich* proposed a rule which was once of con- 
¢ Hilhardt Mitscherlich (1794-1863). The son of a preacher. He de- 
voted himself first to the study of history, philology and oriental languages. 
In 1821 he became Professor of Chemistry in the University of Berlin.

82 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. V 
siderable importance in deciding which multiple of the combining 
weight of an element was its atomic weight. This rule may be 
stated as follows: T'wo isomorphous substances have analogous 
chemical constitutions. Thus, in the case cited above, if the for- 
mula of phosphoric acid were known to be H3POx, then we could 
infer that that of arsenic acid was H;AsO, and not HeAs:Os, 
for example, and, therefore, if the per cent. of arsenic in the 
compound were determined, its atomic weight could be calcu- 
lated. The rule of Mitscherlich was used quite extensively 
by Berzelius* for fixing atomic weights but is seldom employed 
to-day because we now have much more satisfactory methods 
which can be used for the same purpose. When, however, two 
isomorphous substances exhibit a closely similar behavior toward 
pressure and temperature changes over a wide range (7.e., possess 
similar phase rule diagrams, Cf. I, 9) as is the case, for example, 
with the nitrates of rubidium, cesium and thallium, there is every 
reason for inferring a very far reaching similarity of atomic ar- 
rangement within the crystal and of chemical behavior in general.4 
The most successful correlation of chemical structure with crystal 
form is that based upon the octet theory of valence as described 
by Langmuir.* 
5. The Internal Structure of Crystals—A powerful stimulus 
has recently been given to the old question of the arrangement 
of the atoms and molecules within the crystal network, by the 
results obtained from the study of the reflection and refraction 
of X-rays by crystals. X-rays are now recognized to be of the 
same nature as ordinary light rays but to have extremely short 
wave lengths. It occurred to Laue,’ that if this were the case 
the successive rows of molecules in a crystal ought to behave 
toward these very short waves in the same way as a grating spec- 
troscope does to ordinary light rays, that is, diffraction effects 
and X-ray spectra ought to be obtained. Experiment fully

confirmed this conclusion and is not only yielding important 
information regarding the X-rays themselves but is also giving 
us pictures of the internal structure of crystals. 
In employing X-rays for the study of crystal structure, 
three experimental methods have been developed. In the 
original or Laue method a beam of X-rays is passed through a thin 
section of the crystal and then allowed to impinge upon a photo- 
graphic plate where a diffraction pattern of the crystal lattice is 
produced. Knowing the position of the crystal, its distance from 
the photographic plate and its crystallographic measurements, a 
model of its space lattice can be worked out. Laue photographs 
of sodium nitrate are shown in Fig. 11.

In the X-ray spectrometer of Bragg and Bragg? the crystal 
is mounted so that it can be used as a reflection grating, its 
various faces being successively employed. The positions and 
intensities of the lines in the X-ray spectra thus obtained in- 
dicate the relative positions of the various atoms in the space 
lattice of the crystal. 
Both the Laue and the Bragg methods require a single crystal 
of sufficient size to be manipulated. A method® devised by Hull’

and independently by Debye and Scherrer employs the substance 
in the form of fine powder. A narrow beam of monochromatic 
X-rays is passed through the powdered material to be analyzed 
and produces on a photographic plate a pattern of fine lines. 
These lines are due to the reflection of the X-rays from the faces 
of the tiny crystals, one line for each kind of face. From the 
positions and intensities of the lines the crystal structure can be 
calculated. (See Fig. 12.)

substance, and are diffracted to points pi, pz, etc. on the photographic plate. 
Below is shown a photograph of the X-ray spectrum of NaF obtained with 
this apparatus. 
The nature of some of the results obtained by the X-ray 
study of crystals is shown in Figs. 18 to 17. One of the most 
important facts brought out by these results is the apparent 
absence of any molecule in crystals of strongly polar substances 
such as NaCl (Fig. 14). The units of the space lattice of NaCl are 
sodium atoms and chlorine atoms or more exactly, fixed sodium 
ions and fixed chlorine ions, since there is but little doubt that 
the shell of the chlorine atom contains an extra electron taken

such a plane being arranged at the corners of regular hexagons, having sides 
= 145 X 1078 cm. The distance apart of the cleavage planes is 3.41 X 1078 
em., and consequently the carbon atoms in the same cleavage plane are much 
closer to one another than they are to the atoms in the neighboring cleavage 
planes. In other words carbon apparently behaves as though it were trivalent 
in the graphite crystal and tetravalent in the diamond crystal. So-called 
amorphous carbon gives the same X-ray spectrum as graphite.

within such a crystal, rather the whole crystal must itself be 
regarded as a single large molecule. 
In a crystal such as calcite the group CO; appears asastructural 
unit’ and similarly the structural units MgO and Al,0; respectively 
are recognizable in crystals of spinel, MgO.Al,03; and the units 
SiO. and ZrO, in crystals of zircon, SiO2.ZrO2. In the less polar 
compounds on the other hand the molecules which are recognizable 
in the gaseous and liquid states also appear as units in the crystal 
structure. Thus in ice crystals the structural units (H20). 
have been found, while in quartz the molecules SiOz can be 
recognized as units of the crystal lattice. 
6. Atomic Diameters in the Crystal Lattice—W. L. Bragg® 
has found that the distances between atoms in a crystal lattice can 
be expressed in a simple manner by regarding the atoms in a 
crystal as an assemblage of spheres packed tightly together, the 
centers of the spheres coinciding with those of the atoms. Each 
sphere is thus held in place by touching several neighbors. 
Within certain limits, it is possible to assign to the spheres 
representing an atom of any element a constant diameter 
characteristic of that element. The distance between the centers 
of two neighboring atoms may be expressed as the sum of two 
constants, represented by the radii of the corresponding spheres. 
The molecular volume of a compound is in general very far 
from being equal to the sum of the molecular volumes of the 
elements composing it. On the other hand, if the distances 
between the atoms are taken as a measure of the space they 
occupy, Bragg has found that an additive law holds with con- 
siderable accuracy. 
The diameter of the sphere representing an atom is, for the 
sake of brevity, called the diameter of the atom and is conveniently 
expressed in Angstrém units (A= 10-8 cm). 
The atomic diameters of the various elements as obtained from 
crystal measurements in accordance with the above hypothesis 
are shown in Fig. 18.. The ordinates represent the diameters 
in Angstrém units. The figure summarizes the empirical rela- 
tion which has been found to hold, namely, that the distance 
between neighboring atom centers in a crystal is the sum of two 
constants characteristic of the atoms and the crystal may be 
imagined as an assemblage of spheres packed together, the

constants then representing the radii of the spheres. This con- 
ception of the atomic structure of the crystal is useful in con- 
structing models of crystals. A number of such models are 
shown in Fig. 16.

  CHAPTER VI 
CRYSTAL-GAS SYSTEMS 
1. Vapor Pressure of Crystals.—If the pressure upon a crystal 
at constant temperature is gradually reduced, a point will even- 
tually be reached where the gaseous phase appears in the system, 
that is, the crystal begins to evaporate in much the same way as 
a liquid does under similar circumstances. The pressure at 
which the gaseous phase and the crystalline phase are in equilib- 
  
r i i r r I   
          
  rium with each other at any temperature is called the vapor 
pressure or sublimation pressure of the crystals at that tempera- 
ture. If the processes described in section 7 of Chapter IV be 
carried out with a crystalline substance, starting at a temperature 
considerably below its melting point, the character of the isother- 
mals obtained will at first resemble very closely those of a liquid 
92

as shown in Fig. 9. With rising temperature the densities of 
the two phases, crystalline and gas, gradually approach each 
other. Long before a temperature is reached where they come 
very near together, however, the crystalline phase usually melts 
and thus disappears from the system. We might imagine a 
case, however, in which the melting point lay at such a high tem- 
perature that before it was reached the densities of the two 
phases became identical. The isothermal for this temperature 
would then have the same general form as the one marked AOA’ 
in Fig. 19. Identity with respect to density does not, however, 
necessarily imply that all the other physical properties of the 
two phases are identical. The temperature at which the densi- 
ties become equal would not, therefore, necessarily be a critical 
temperature, above which the crystalline state of aggregation 
could not exist. In fact the isothermals above this temperature 
in the crystal-gas system would not resemble those for the liquid- 
gas system, as shown in Fig. 9, but would instead probably be 
somewhat of the general character of those shown in Fig. 19. 
2. Sublimation Point.—The temperature at which the vapor 
pressure of a crystal becomes equal to the external pressure is 
evidently perfectly analogous to the boiling point of a liquid and 
may be called the “sublimation point” of the crystal. In the 
case of most crystalline substances the “normal sublimation 
point,” or the sublimation point under atmospheric pressure, 
lies above the melting point of the substance and is consequently 
never reached in practice. With some substances, such as arsenic 
trioxide, however, the melting point is the higher of the two 
temperatures and hence these substances when heated simply 
sublime or “boil”? away completely without melting. They 
cannot be melted except at pressures higher than that of the 
atmosphere or by superheating them. 
3. Heat of Sublimation.—The process of vaporization of a 
erystal, like that of a liquid, is attended by an absorption of heat 
and the amount of heat absorbed when one mole of the crystals 
vaporizes at a given temperature and pressure is called the 
molal heat of vaporization or of sublimation, Ls, of the crystals at 
that temperature and pressure.

Surfaces.—The following theoretical picture of the nature of the

condensation of vapor molecules upon a solid surface has been 
given recently! by Langmuir.* 
In the vapor surrounding the solid, the average distance which 
the molecules travel between collisions (the mean free path) 
is of the order of magnitude of 10-* em. if the pressure is atmos- 
pheric while it is correspondingly greater if the pressure is less. 
When a vapor molecule approaching the surface comes within a 
distance of about 2 X 107-8 cm. of the surface layer of atoms it 
experiences a force attracting: it towards the surface. As it 
moves closer to the surface the attractive force rapidly increases, 
reaches a maximum intensity and then rapidly decreases to zero 
when the molecule has traveled a distance only about 0.6 < 10.-8 
em. beyond the point at which the force was a maximum. The 
point at which the force falls to zero may be regarded as an 
equilibrium position. When the molecule reaches this position 
its kinetic energy will be very high for a relatively large amount of 
work has been done upon it by the attractive forces. It will, 
therefore, not remain in the equilibrium position, but will move 
still closer to the atoms of the solid, and will thus enter a region 
in which it is subjected to very strong and rapidly increasing 
repulsive forces. If the molecule had lost no energy to adjacent 
atoms it would probably travel a distance 0.2 — 0.3 X 10-8 cm. 
against these repulsive forces before being brought to rest. It 
would then pass again through the equilibrium position and 
finally out through the region of attractive forces, and might thus 
again escape from the surface forces, in other words, be reflected. 
But the improbability of such a reflection is evident when we 
consider the ease with which energy is dissipated to adjacent 
atoms. This energy loss occurs in two ways. In the first place, 
when the molecule is approaching the surface, the attractive 
force will be exerted by several adjacent atoms on the surface. 
These atoms are thus all accelerated towards the incident 
molecule, and thus acquire some of its energy. A little later 
when the molecule is in the region of repulsive forces, these 
forces will be exerted principally by a single atom of the solid. 
The energy used in accelerating the surface atoms can, therefore, 
only partially be delivered back to the incident molecule. This 
«Irving Langmuir (1881-__), Physical Chemist for the General Electric 
Co., Schenectady, N. Y,
-P-A-G-E-123
  Src. 4] CRYSTAL-GAS SYSTEMS 95 
dissipation in energy, even if only relatively small, will usually 
make it impossible for the molecule to pass out through the region 
of attractive forces. Moreover, the energy delivered to the 
incident molecule by the attractive forces, is practically wholly 
dissipated to the adjacent atoms by the time the molecule first 
reaches the equilibrium position. It, therefore, has not sufficient 
kinetic energy to enable it to penetrate far into the region of 
repulsive forces, and certainly not sufficient to allow it to work 
against the attractive forces and thus escape from the surface. 
The condensation of a vapor on a solid surface thus takes place 
independently of the temperature of the surface. The rate of 
evaporation on the other hand varies extremely rapidly with the 
temperature. If practically every molecule of vapor which strikes 
against the surface of the solid condenses, it is not at first evident 
how the molecules, especially if they are complex, are able to 
arrange themselves to form a crystalline mass. In analyzing the 
mechanism of condensation we must distinguish two extreme sets 
of conditions that may occur. These may be termed irreversible 
and reversible sublimation respectively. 
By irreversible sublimation is meant the type which occurs 
for instance when a tungsten filament is heated to a high tem- 
perature in a well evacuated bulb. Under these conditions there 
can be no equilibrium, for the surface of the bulb is at a tempera- 
ture thousands of degrees lower than that at which the vapor is 
given off. The vapor is thus enormously superheated with 
respect to the surface on which it condenses. Such conditions 
as this can be realized in practice only when the vapor is at very 
low pressure, for, otherwise, the amount of vapor condensed per 
unit area per second would be so great that the heat liberated by 
the condensation could not be removed rapidly enough to 
maintain a low temperature on the condensing surface. 
By the term reversible sublimation we may designate that 
which takes place for example, when iodine or naphthalene 
is sublimed slowly at ordinary temperatures. In this case we 
are dealing with small differences of temperature, and under 
these conditions condensation and evaporation are going on 
simultaneously at nearly equal rates over every portion of the 
surface where condensation occurs. 
In the irreversible sublimation the vapor molecules remain 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
96 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuap. VI 
where they first strike the surface, since they can neither be 
reflected nor re-evaporated. The deposit formed by the con- 
densed vapor is, therefore, homogeneous (when gaseous impurities 
are absent) amorphous and of uniform thickness. With the 
condensing surface at higher temperatures, however, a sintering 
or crystallizing process may go on within the deposit even when 
the temperature is below that at which perceptible vaporization 
occurs. By means of irreversible sublimation it is thus possible 
to obtain any volatile body in a non-crystalline form. * 
In the case of reversible sublimation the deposit formed from 
the condensed vapor is ordinarily crystalline, frequently consist- 
ing of groups of separate crystals. In the formation of these 
crystals every molecule of vapor which strikes the surface 
condenses just as in the case of irreversible condensation, but 
most of these molecules re-evaporate again. The tendency of 
different molecules to re-evaporate will depend entirely on how 
firmly they are held by the atoms of the crystal. Thus the 
molecules which strike the surface in such a way as to forma 
continuation of the space lattice already present, will evaporate 
much less frequently than molecules which are not in positions 
where they can fit in with the crystal structure. The continual 
evaporation and condensation going on over the whole surface of 
the crystal allows the atoms to arrange themselves in the most 
stable positions. The smaller the differences in temperature and 
the more nearly equal the rates of condensation and evaporation, 
the more perfect will be the development of the crystals. 
Since evaporation and condensation are in general equilibrium 
phenomena, the mechanism of evaporation must be the exact 
reverse of that of condensation, even down to the smallest 
detail. Thus in the evaporation of an atom of a metal, for 
example, the atom must acquire energy from adjacent ones and 
thus be accelerated outward. As it moves it must receive a 
large number of successive increments of energy from its neigh- 
bors until finally it passes out of the region of attractive forces. 
The very small probability of such a sequence of favorable 
impulses is the reason that so few atoms evaporate at lower 
temperatures.

layer of saturated vapor in contact with a solid having a low

vapor pressure. If ua is the average velocity of the molecules of 
the vapor, then the component of this velocity, normal to and 
directed toward the surface, will be 14 ua, that is, whereas the 
molecules are actually approaching and receding from the surface 
at all sorts of angles between 0° and 90° the net result as far as it 
concerns the number which strike the surface in unit time would 
be the same if all the molecules above any section of the surface 
were approaching it perpendicularly with a velocity of 14 ta 
Under these conditions the number of molecules which will arrive 
at the surface at the end of z seconds is evidently the number 
contained in a cylinder having the volume 14 u,zS and hence the 
mass of gas which will strike against the surface will be 
my = % DuaS (1) 
where D is the density of the gas, and S the surface area. 
Problem 1.—With the aid of the perfect gas law and the equations of the 
kinetic theory given in Chapter II show that equation (1) may be written 
M = p.2. nae 2 Mg = p.2.S RT (2) 
where p is the vapor pressure. 
If the theory of condensation outlined in the preceding section 
is correct it is obvious that the rate of evaporation from a solid 
surface at low pressures is also given by equation (2). 
Problem 2.—The filament of a tungsten vacuum lamp operated con- 
tinuously at 3000° absolute has been found to lose in weight at the rate of 
5.23-10~® grams per sq. em. per sec. while at 3500° absolute the corresponding 
rate was 769-10-6. Calculate the vapor pressure of tungsten at each of the 
above temperatures.

CHAPTER VII 
CRYSTAL-LIQUID SYSTEMS 
1. The Molecular Kinetics of Crystallization and Fusion.— 
The following hypothetical picture of the mechanism of crys- 
tallization and fusion in the case of a non-polar substance is in 
accordance with the known facts concerning the process and will 
help the student to appreciate the probable difference in the molec- 
ular condition of the two states of aggregation. 
We have already seen (IV, 1) that the molecules of a liquid 
which have velocities considerably higher than the velocity 
corresponding to the mean kinetic energy are able to escape from 
the field of attraction of the other molecules and to enter the 
vapor phase. There are also present in the liquid numbers of 
molecules having velocities considerably smaller than this mean 
velocity. When several of these slowly moving molecules come 
together the crystal forces, that is, the forces which hold the mole- 
cules together in the crystalline state, may be strong enough to 
prevent the molecules from flying apart again after the impact. 
These molecules under the influence of the crystal forces may 
then arrange themselves into the form of a minute crystal which 
thereafter moves as a unit until it collides with some rapidly 
moving molecule and is broken up by the impact or else meets 
with other slowly moving molecules which it attracts and holds, 
thus growing in size. If heat be gradually and continuously 
abstracted from the liquid, the temperature falls and the mean 
kinetic energy of the molecules decreases. This will evidently 
increase the chances of formation of these minute crystals, called 
crystal nuclei, and will increase their average life and chances of 
growth. Finally a temperature will be reached at which the 
mean kinetic energy of the liquid molecules becomes so small 
that the chances of formation and growth of the crystal nuclei 
are just equal to their chances of destruction. Thatis, the chance 
that any crystal nucleus taken at random will continue to grow 
by the addition to it of the more slowly moving molecules with 
which it collides is just equal to the chance that it will be broken 
up by collision with more rapidly moving molecules, 
98
-P-A-G-E-127
  Szc. 1] CRYSTAL-LIQUID SYSTEMS 99 
If the temperature be then further reduced, it is evident that 
the chances of growth will be greater than the chances of de- 
struction and if a crystal of the substance be now introduced into 
the liquid and the abstraction of heat be continued, this crystal 
will be observed to increase in size at the expense of the liquid. 
In other words the liquid is said to crystallize or to freeze. If 
we do not introduce a crystal into the liquid, the crystalline phase 
may eventually form spontaneously at several points within the 
liquid. In either case as soon as the crystalline phase appears, 
it will be noticed that the further withdrawal of heat from the 
system fails to produce any corresponding decrease in its tem- 
perature. It tends to cause a lowering in the mean kinetic energy 
of the molecules of the liquid, it is true, but if the liquid is in con- 
tact with the crystalline phase, the slower moving molecules of 
the liquid are attracted and held by the crystals which thus grow 
in size at the expense of the liquid phase, the mean kinetic energy 
in the latter phase and hence also its temperature remaining 
perfectly constant even though heat be continuously abstracted 
from it. 
Problem 1.—Compare this process with the mechanism by which the 
temperature of a liquid boiling under constant pressure remains perfectly 
constant even though heat be continuously added to it. 
This constant temperature at which the liquid and crystalline 
phases are in equilibrium with each other is called the freezing 
point of the liquid and for pure substances is also the melting 
point of the crystals. 
Let us now consider the reverse process where we start with the 
crystal at a low temperature and gradually add heat to it. The 
molecules of the crystal are held in the crystal network by the ac- 
tion of the crystal forces. They are not at rest, however, but 
oscillate or vibrate about a certain mean position. The plane 
of oscillation and the amplitude may vary from molecule to mole- 
cule but there is probably a mean amplitude of oscillation which 
like the mean kinetic energy of liquid or gas molecules is depend- 
ent upon the temperature. The molecular motion within the 
crystal is, therefore, unordered, being in all sorts of directions 
and having all amplitude values on both sides of that average 
amplitude which corresponds to the temperature of the crystal. 
The motion is not “free random motion” like that in a gas or
-P-A-G-E-128
  100 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuapr. VII 
a liquid, however, but is instead ‘‘restrained random motion” 
since a molecule cannot move freely about among the other 
molecules, but can only oscillate about a more or less definite 
center in the crystal network. From time to time, however, 
some of the molecules will attain amplitudes of oscillation so 
great that they will get far enough from the crystal network 
to escape from the crystal forces and to enter the vapor phase 
as gaseous molecules. That is, every crystal is able to evaporate 
and has at each temperature a definite vapor pressure which is 
the pressure at which the rate of escape of the molecules from the 
crystal forces is just balanced by the rate at which the gas mole- 
cules which are constantly colliding with the crystal are in turn 
caught and held again by these same forces, thus producing the 
condition of dynamic equilibrium described in the previous 
chapter. 
If we gradually impart heat to the crystal, its temperature 
rises and the rate at which molecules escape from the influence 
of the crystal forces increases. Finally a temperature will be 
reached where the crystal breaks up by the above process faster 
than it can reform and, if the pressure is great enough, the liquid 
phase appears, that is, the crystal is said to melt or to fuse. The 
temperature at which this occurs is the melting point of the 
substance. It is evident that if the addition of heat is now con- 
tinued, no further rise in temperature will occur until all the 
crystalline phase has disappeared since the more violently oscil- 
lating molecules in the crystal escape to form liquid molecules 
and thus the average amplitude of those remaining, and hence 
also the temperature of the crystal, remains constant, the heat 
being absorbed by the process of fusion. 
2. Heat of Fusion.—The heat absorbed in the process of fusion 
evidently goes to increase the amplitude of oscillation of the mole- 
cules in the crystal to such a value that they can escape from the 
field of action of the crystal forces. In other words, energy is 
required to separate them against the action of these forces. A 
partial mechanical analogy to this process occurs when we whirl 
a ball at the end of an elastic cord. As we increase its energy of 
rotation, and hence its angular velocity, the cord stretches and 
finally when a certain velocity is attained the cord breaks and 
the ball flies off in a straight line. The heat absorbed in the
-P-A-G-E-129
Suc. 3] CRYSTAL-LIQUID SYSTEMS 101 
process of fusion is called the latent heat of fusion of the sub- 
stance and the molal heat of fusion, Ly, of any substance at 
the temperature, 7’, is defined as the quantity of heat which is 
absorbed when one mole of the substance changes from the 
crystalline state at the temperature, 7’, to the liquid state at 
the same temperature. It is exactly equal to the quantity of 
heat evolved when the reverse process (crystallization) occurs 
at the same temperature. 
Problem 2.—Suppose we start with a crystal at a low temperature, and 
at constant pressure gradually add heat to it, measuring the quantity of 
heat added for each degree rise in temperature which it produces, and con- 
tinuing the process until we have our substance in the form of vapor at a 
temperature 100° above its boiling point. If we construct a diagram in 
which quantities of heat are plotted as abscisse and corresponding rises in 
temperature as ordinates, two different diagrams will be obtained according 
to whether the melting point of the substance is above or below its subli- 
mation point at the pressure employed in the experiment. Draw two 
figures illustrating the character of the diagrams obtained in the two cases. 
For simplicity it may be assumed that the substance is not polymorphic. 
Problem 3.—If the substance is polymorphic with a transition tempera- 
ture a few degrees below the melting point, what will be the characters of 
the above curves? 
3. Supercooled Liquids and Amorphous Solids.'—The growth 
of crystal nuclei in a liquid which has been cooled below its 
freezing point is facilitated by the presence of fine dust particles, 
by mechanical agitation, and by other factors. In the absence of 
these aids it is frequently possible to cool a liquid considerably 
below its freezing point before crystallization occurs. In fact 
supercooling, as it is called, is the usual phenomenon. A super- 
cooled liquid can usually be caused to crystallize by adding some 
of its own crystals to it. As soon as crystallization begins the 
temperature very quickly rises to the freezing point owing to the 
heat evolved by the process of crystallization. 
In all cases a decrease in the temperature of a liquid is accom- 
panied by an increase in its viscosity and with some liquids the 
viscosity at the freezing point is very large. As the liquid is 
supercooled the viscosity increases still further. Now high 
viscosity means decreased freedom of molecular motion within 
the liquid and molecular motion is necessary for the formation 
and growth of the crystal nuclei. If this is prevented by a high 
and steadily increasing viscosity, the liquid may be cooled any  
-P-A-G-E-130
  102 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. VII 
distance below its freezing point without any crystallization 
occurring and the viscosity may finally become so great that the 
liquid becomes a solid glass. It is still in the liquid state of 
aggregation, however, for no second phase has appeared during 
the process of cooling. Ordinary glass is a liquid of this char- 
acter. These supercooled liquids are sometimes called amor- 
phous solids and are distinguished from crystalline solids by the 
absence both of crystalline structure and of a definite melting 
point. On heating they gradually soften until they become quite 
fluid, but there is no one temperature above which they may be 
called liquid and below, solid, the change in fluidity being a 
perfectly gradual one. Sometimes old glass gradually and slowly 
crystallizes. This process is known as devitrification. 
Theoretically any liquid could be cooled to a solid glass with- 
out crystallization occurring but practically we have only been 
able to bring this about with the more viscous liquids. Water 
has been supercooled as much as 80° but was still quite fluid so 
that when crystallization began it proceeded quite rapidly. If 
the viscosity of water be increased, however, by dissolving sugar 
in it, the syrup can be supercooled until it becomes solid and rigid 
like glass, without the formation of any ice. 
When a solid is formed by a chemical reaction in a liquid or 
gas which is at a temperature far below the melting point of the 
solid thus produced, the latter frequently appears in the form of 
a precipitate which under the microscope shows no evidence of 
erystalline structure. For this reason these precipitates are 
called amorphous precipitates. It is certain, however, that in 
many instances these solids really belong to the crystalline state 
of aggregation but that the individual crystals are too small to 
be seen even with the highest powers of the microscope. In the 
preceding chapter we have seen how amorphous solids may also 
be prepared by the process of irreversible condensation of a vapor. 
The reduction of a metallic oxide by hydrogen will also leave a 
solid residue of the metal which in many cases will be entirely 
amorphous. 
Problem 4.—Describe an experiment which might be made to determine 
whether an apparently amorphous precipitate were a ‘crystalline solid or a 
supercooled liquid. (Cf. Problem 2.)

RELATIONS BETWEEN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND 
CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION 
1. Nature of the Subject.—Considerable attention has been 
devoted by investigators to the question of the connection be- 
tween the physical properties of a substance and its chemical 
constitution and a large number of relationships have been 
proposed for expressing quantitatively this connection. Some 
of the physical properties which have been the subject of investi- 
gation in this field are the following: surface tension, viscosity 
and fluidity, atomic and molecular volume, atomic and molecu- 
lar heat capacity, heats of fusion, of vaporization and of combus- 
tion, melting and boiling points, critical constants, refractivity, 
dispersive powers, absorption spectra, dielectric constant, mag- 
netic susceptibility and permeability, ionization constants, and 
penetrating power of the characteristic Réntgen radiations. It 
would not be possible within the scope of this book to attempt 
to discuss or even to present more than a very small fraction of 
the large number of relationships which have been put forward by 
the different investigators in this field, but the general character 
of our present knowledge of this subject can be well illustrated 
by considering two or three typical physical properties and the 
manner in which they depend upon the chemical constitution 
of the substance. For this purpose the properties, optical rota- 
tory power, molecular refractivity, and penetrating power of 
the characteristic Réntgen radiation have been chosen. The 
consideration of atomic and molecular heat capacities will be 
taken up later in a special chapter devoted to these properties. 
2. Optical Rotatory Power.—When monochromatic light of 
any wave length is allowed to pass through a Nichol’s prism 
(a special prism made from Iceland spar) the light which emerges 
from the prism is plane polarized, that is, the light vibrations 
instead of occurring in all planes are confined to a single plane. 
If this light is now examined through a second Nichol’s prism 
(called the analyser, the first prism being known as the polarizer), 
103  
-P-A-G-E-132
  104 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. VIII 
with its axis parallel to that of the first prism, the light is 
apparently not affected. If, however, one of the prisms is now 
gradually rotated about its axis, the observer notes a gradual 
decreasé in the intensity of the light as seen through the analyser. 
This decrease continues until complete extinction is reached when 
the prism has been rotated through an angle of 90° from its first 
position. If now a solution of some substance such as sugar 
be placed between the two prisms so that the light passes through 
the solution, the field of view in the analyser will become illu- 
minated again and in order to produce extinction once more the 
analyser must be turned through an angle, a, whose magnitude 
is a measure of the optical rotatory power of the sugar solution. 
If it is found that the analyser must be turned to the left in order 
to produce extinction, the optically active substance in the solu- 
tion is said to be levo-rotatory, while if the rotation of the 
analyser is to the right, the substance is said to be dextro-rota- 
tory. The magnitude of the rotation depends upon (1) the 
wave length of the light employed, being larger the shorter the 
wave length; (2) the length of the layer of the solution through 
which the light passes; (3) the nature of the optically active 
substance and its concentration in the solution, and (4) the 
temperature. f 
The specific rotatory power, [a], of a substance is defined by the 
equation, 
lal” = 5 a) 
where a is the angular rotation observed when a solution contain- 
ing p per cent. of the substance and having the density, D, is 
examined through a tube of length, J, at the temperature, ¢. 
The nature of the monochromatic light employed is usually 
indicated by a subscript. Thus [a]s” indicates that the value 
is for 20°C. and that the D-line of the sodium spectrum was 
employed as the monochromatic light. The specific rotatory 
power of a substance is in general a function both of the tem- 
perature and of the nature of the solvent in which it is dissolved. 
The property of optical activity is closely and uniquely con- 
nected with the chemical structure of the molecule of the optic- 
ally active substance. It occurs in the case of every substance
-P-A-G-E-133
Suc. 3] PHYSICAL PROPERTIES 105 
whose molecule contains an asymmetric central atom (see I, 2d, 
which should be re-read in this connection) and also in nearly 
all cases in which the tetrahedral space model of the molecule 
possesses no plane of symmetry. The quantitative side of the 
relation between optical activity and molecular structure is not 
very well developed at present although the measurement 
of the specific rotatory power-of a substance can in certain cases 
be employed to determine the structure of its molecule or to de- 
cide which of two possible structures is the correct one.” 
3. Molecular Refractivity—When a ray of light passes from 
one medium into another (from air into water, for example) the 
    Fic. 20. 
ray undergoes a change in direction, that is, it is refracted. The 
angle made by the incident ray (AB, Fig. 20) with a perpendicu- 
lar at the point of incidence is termed the angle of incidence, 
i, while that, r, made by the refracted ray (BC in the figure) is 
termed the angle of refraction. The index of refraction, n, of 
a substance is defined by the equation

being wu; and that in the substance being we. In practical 
work air may usually be employed instead of a vacuum. For 
i A a dd 5 a given substance the relation, ae x D’ where D is the den- 
sity, has been found to be a constant independent of the tempera-

cular weight, has been found to be an additive property in the 
case of many organic liquids; that is, to each element a definite 
atomic refractivity can be assigned and from these values the 
refractivity of a compound of the elements may be calculated. 
More extensive studies, however, show that not only the nature 
of the elements in the compound but the arrangement of the 
atoms in the molecule must also be taken into account. Thus 
the molecular refractivities of the two compounds, M 
The molecular refractivity, x * where M is the mole-

and i i 
eo H H 
will not be the same even though they have the same atomic com- 
position. Account must be taken of the fact that one molecule 
contains single and triple bonded carbon atoms while the other 
contains only single and double bonded carbon. Further in- 
vestigations have shown that the positions of the atoms in the 
molecule with respect to one another and to double or triple 
bonds also exert an influence upon their atomic refractivities, 
so that the whole question becomes a very complicated one. 
When employed with care, however, the measurement of the 
refractive index of an organic liquid may be and frequently has 
been of considerable value in determining its chemical constitu-

tion. This same statement holds in varying degrees with 
reference to many other physical properties. 
The extent to which a given physical property of an element 
in a compound is affected by the natures of the other elements 
with which it is combined and by the manner in which its atoms 
are united with those of the other elements to form the molecule 
of the compound will obviously depend upon what character- 
istic of the element is chiefly operative in determining the magni- 
tude of the property in question. Thus, if the property is one 
whose magnitude depends upon the shape or the size of the 
atom or upon the nature of its motion in space, or if it depends 
upon the positions, number, or movements of the electrons in 
or near the surface of the atom, then it is not difficult to under- 
stand why the property in question will be affected by chemical 
constitution, for each of the factors mentioned might easily be 
affected by the influences of the neighboring atoms in the mole- 
cule. Only in the case of physical properties which are practi- 
cally entirely determined by conditions within the core of the 
atom and thus removed from the influence of external condi- 
tions surrounding the atom, might we expect to find properties 
which are not affected by such factors as chemical constitution, 
pressure, temperature and state of aggregation. Mass is, of 
course, the principal and almost the only strictly additive prop- 
erty, that is, the total mass of any compound is always the sum 
of the masses of the elements which entered into reaction to form 
the compound, irrespective of the structure or composition of this 
compound. Nearly all other physical properties are constitu- 
tive properties to a greater or less degree depending upon the 
nature of the property. The so-called characteristic X-ray 
radiation of an element, however, seems to resemble mass in 
being unaffected by any external conditions surrounding the 
atom. We shall consider this property briefly. 
4. Penetrating Power of the Characteristic Réntgen Radia- 
tion of an Element.—When Réntgen® rays (X-rays) are allowed 
to fall upon a substance the substance in turn is caused to emit 
secondary Réntgen rays whose penetrating power seems to be   « William Conrad Réntgen, F. R. 8. (1845- ). Professor of Experi-

evidently appears to be quite unaffected by the chemical or phys- 
ical condition of the element. Similar measurements with the 
element iron show that its characteristic Réntgen radiation is 
the same at room temperature as it is at red heat and is identical 
from ferrous and from ferric compounds. The penetrating 
power of this characteristic radiation increases gradually and con- 
tinuously with increasing atomic weight of the emitting elements 
being too small to be measured in the case of the elements with 
small atomic weights. Unlike most of the properties of the 
elements this property is, therefore, not a periodic function of 
the atomic weights. Its complete independence of external 
conditions surrounding the atoms indicates strongly that it is 
closely connected with the nature of the cores of the atoms giving 
rise to it. 
The more exact study of the nature of characteristic Réngten 
radiations made possible through the employment of crystals as 
spectrometer gratings, (V, 5) has shown’ that the spectrum of the 
characteristic radiations is extremely simple, being composed 
of very few lines. 'The frequencies corresponding to these lines, 
moreover, are closely connected with the positions of the elements 
in the periodic system and investigations in this field have given 
us a new insight into the significance of the periodic system and

ships will receive detailed consideration in a later chapter.

CHAPTER IX 
THE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT AND MOLECULAR 
MAGNITUDES 
1. The Brownian Movement.—In order to account for the 
known behavior of material bodies, they were early assumed 
(I, 1) to be made up of very small particles called molecules 
which were in a state of very rapid and constant unordered 
motion. The examination of a pure substance, a drop of liquid 
for example, with the highest powers of the best modern micro- 
scope fails to reveal the presence of any such rapidly moving 
particles, however, and hence, if the liquid is made up of such 
particles, they must be so small as to be beyond the range of our 
most powerful microscopes. How could the presence of these 
rapidly moving molecules be rendered visible? 
Suppose we were to stir into a liquid some insoluble substance 
in an exceedingly fine state of division, the particles of which were 
in fact so small that their presence in the liquid could barely be 
detected with the microscope. Now if the liquid is in reality 
composed of molecules moving to and fro in all directions with 
the enormous velocities assigned to them by the molecular theory 
(see II, prob. 2), then it is clear that the collisions of the rapidly 
moving molecules with these small visible particles (called col- 
loidal particles) ought to set the latter into motion also and 
through a properly arranged microscopic system one should be 
able to observe and study the motion of these colloidal par- 
ticles. The presence of visible particles possessing an irregular 
motion was noticed in 1827 by Robert Brown, an English bot- 
anist while examining with the microscope a liquid containing 
some pollen grains. The cause of this irregular motion, called 
from its discoverer the Brownian Movement, was not suspected 
until a number of years later, however. The researches? of 
Wiener (1863), Ramsay (1876), Delsaulx and Carbonelle (1880), 
Gouy (1888), and others demonstrated that the movement could 
not be due to convection currents in the liquid, that it was nearly 
independent of the nature of the colloidal particles, that it was 
110
-P-A-G-E-139
Sxc. 2] THE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT 111 
more rapid the smaller the particles and the less viscous the liquid, 
and that it was persistent and never changing, continuing day 
and night, month after month. It has, in fact, been observed in 
small quantities of liquid found in little pockets in granite and 
other rocks where it must have been shut up for millions of years. 
All of these facts pointed to the theory first suggested by Wiener 
that the Brownian Movement is the result of molecular motion 
within the liquid. In other words the small visible colloidal 
particles are knocked about by colliding with the invisible mole- 
cules like foot balls in the midst of a crowd of invisible players. 
2. The Distribution of Colloidal Particles under the Influence 
of Gravity—A liquid containing colloidal particles is called a 
‘colloidal solution”? and if such a solution is kept undisturbed 
at a constant temperature for some time, the colloidal particles 
are found to be distributed so that the density of their distribu- 
tion is greatest near the bottom of the vessel and decreases with 
height. This is a similar behavior to that shown by the atmos- 
phere as one rises above the surface of the earth and Einstein? 
showed that, if the Brownian Movement is caused by molecular 
motion, the distribution of the particles with height must follow 
quantitatively the law which governs the decrease in density 
of the atmosphere with height. This law can be readily derived 
from the perfect gas law and may be expressed as follows: 
Di _ Mg(ha — Iu) (1) “De re : 
where D,; and Dz are the densities of air at the heights hi and he 
respectively, M is the molecular weight of air (II, 12), g the 
acceleration due to gravity, R the gas constant, and T' the abso- 
lute temperature. log 
Problem 1.—Derive the above equation from the perfect gas law 
assuming 7’ to be independent of h. 
For the molecular weight M we can put 
M = mN (2) 
where m is the mass of one molecule (or colloidal particle) and

where V is the volume of the colloidal

is suspended. We thus obtain the

where mi and nz are the average

Perrin? was able to determine the 
numbers, m; and me, by photography 
(see Fig. 21) and by direct count, and 
the difference in level, he — hi, could 
be read directly from the micrometer 
screw of the microscope. Since for a 
given colloidal solution the other 
quantities in equation (4) are con- 
stants, Perrin was thus able to make 
a quantitative test of the equation. 
In this way he found in one experi- 
ment? that the numbers of particles 
at four different levels were in the 
ratios, 116, 146, 170 and 200, while 
the values calculated from equation 
(4) for the same levels were 119, 142, 
169 and 201. Numerous other experi- 
ments give similar results thus confirming quantitatively the 
theory that the Brownian Movement is the result of molecular 
impacts.

But Perrin was able to go further than this. By means ot 
fractional centrifugation he was able to prepare uniform colloidal” — 
particles of gamboge and of mastic of any desired size. He was 
also able to measure the diameter and hence the volume of the 
individual particles by several different methods which gave 
concordant results. Knowing the volume of the particles it is 
clear that equation (4) can be employed to calculate a value for 
N, Avogadro’s number. For this purpose Perrin conducted a 
set of experiments in which the volume of the particles employed 
was varied fifty-fold, the density of the suspending liquid fifteen- 
fold, and its viscosity 250 fold in the different experiments. From 
all of these experiments, however, substantially the same value, 
6 — 7 X 10,78 was obtained for N and this is the value which is 
found for this constant by a number of entirely different methods, 
again furnishing a strong quantitative confirmation of the theory 
of the cause of the Brownian Movement. Using the same method 
but working with solutions of colloidal gold Westgren* in 1915 
found? the value (60 + 3)-10.” 
3. The Law of the Brownian Movement.—If a given colloidal 
particle be watched under the microscope it will be found to move 
through a very irregular and complicated path. Fig. 22 shows 
the horizontal projection of the path of a colloidal particle which 
occupied the position A at the beginning of the observation and 
which had reached the position B, t minutes later, having mean- 
while occupied successively all the positions indicated by the 
small dots. The distance from A to B in a direct line is called the 
horizontal displacement, X, of the particle in the time Jt, and is 
determined by the energy of agitation of the particle and the 
resistance offered to its motion by the viscosity of the suspending 
liquid. Tinstein was the first to derive the quantitative expres- 
sion for the displacement of a colloidal particle. On the assump- 
tion that the Brownian Movement was the result of the impacts 
of the molecules of the liquid with the colloidal particles he 
showed! that for a large number of observations the average 
value of the square of the horizontal displacement (X?) of a spher- 
ical colloidal particle in the time t ought to be

of N by means of Hinstein’s equation with the following very

matically upon a moving photographic film, thus eliminating any 
errors due to personal judgment concerning the path of the par- 
ticle under observation. Nordlund’s experiments showed that 
the value of X? was directly proportional to the time, as required 
by Einstein’s equation (see Fig. 23) and he also found by inde- 
pendent experiments that the tiny spheres of mercury obeyed 
Stokes’ law. Nordlund’s experiments are probably the most 
trustworthy ones upon which to base a calculation of N from the 
Brownian Movement in liquids. He found® as amean value from 
twelve experiments N = 5.9 < 10?%, the average deviation of 
the individual values from this mean being 10 per cent. Itseems

therefore safe to conclude that from the study of the Brownian 
Movement in liquids, we find the value of Avogadro’s Number 
to be N = (6.0-10?5 + 5 per cent.). 
4, The Brownian Movement in Gases.—Owing to the compara-

liquids. Because of the greater distances separating the mole- 
cules of a gas, the collisions between the colloidal particles and 
the molecules are less frequent and the mean free paths (III, 2) 
of the colloidal particles are, therefore, much longer than in 
liquids. Thus the average displacement of a given colloidal 
particle in a given time is increased 130-fold by transferring the 
particle from water to air at 1 mm. pressure. 
The most accurate study of the Brownian Movement in gases 
has been carried out by Millikan and Fletcher at the University 
of Chicago. They employed a tiny drop of oil as the colloidal 
particle. Such a drop when watched through a telescope is 
seen to dart rapidly about to and fro in all directions and forms 
a very vivid picture of the motion of the invisible gas molecules

through collision with which it is knocked about in this rapid and 
irregular fashion. From a large number (5900) of measurements? 
of the displacements along one axis of 12 such particles, Fletcher 
obtained the value, N = (6.03 X 10%? + 1.2 per cent.) for 
Avogadro’s constant. 
The accurate value (6.062-10?* + 0.1 per cent.) for N given 
ie Chapter I was obtained by Millikan? by an entirely different 
experimental method which will be described in Chapter XVI, 6. 
It will be noticed that the two most reliable values for N yielded 
by the Brownian Movement method agree with the above more 
exact value within the experimental error of their own deter- 
mination. 
Problem 2.—The smallest colloidal particle which can be detected under 
the ultramicroscope has a diameter of about 3 uu. How many atoms are 
there in a spherical colloidal particle of gold having this diameter? How 
many in one of benzene? Densities 19.5 and 0.9. : 
Problem 3.—Assuming the colloidal particles of gold 3 uu in diameter 
to be the ‘‘molecules” of a gas, what would the “molecular weight” of this 
gas be? What would be the molecular velocity, in miles per second, of 
these molecules at 0°? Thespecific gravity of gold is 19.5. (Cf. II, prob. 2.) 
Problem 4.—Calculate the number of mercury molecules in one cubic 
centimeter of a Torricellian vacuum at 20°. (See Table IX, Chap. IV.) 
Problem 5.—Calculate the vapor pressure of a substance whose saturated 
vapor contains only one billion molecules per cubic centimeter at 20°. 
Problem 6.—If a mercury droplet falls 50 cms. in 0.80 second through 
water at 25° (D = 0.9971, » = 0.8937 centipoise) what is its mass? Its 
density at 25° is 13.53. 
If the same drop falls the same distance through a sugar solution (D = 
1.331) in 240 seconds what is the viscosity of the sugar solution?

CHAPTER X 
SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 
1. Energy.—Energy as a concept may be defined as the agency 
postulated by science as the underlying cause of all changes which 
we observe in the properties. or condition of any portion of the 
material universe. In accordance with the conditions under 
which it manifests its presence, energy is usually classified under 
the following forms: kinetic energy, gravitation energy, cohesion 
energy, disgregation energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, 
chemical energy, radioactive energy, heat energy, radiant energy, 
etc. We shall not stop at this point to explain just what is meant 
by each of these terms as the explanations can be more conveni- 
ently given from time to time as we shall have occasion to employ 
the terms. A word of explanation is necessary, however, with 
regard to the term potential energy which we shall have occa- 
sion to employ in connection with the kinetic energy of molecular 
motion. 
Potential energy is usually defined as the energy which an 
elastic body or system possesses by virtue of its configuration, 
that is, by virtue of the relative positions of its component parts. 
Thus, if we apply a force to any system in such a way as to 
gradually and continuously change its configuration, using only 
the force necessary to bring about the desired change, we are 
said to do work upon the system. If the system is a perfectly 
elastic one, that is, if it will of itself on removal of the impressed 
force return completely to a configuration which as far as its 
energy is-concerned is identical with its original configuration, 
then it is capable, in so returning of doing an amount of work 
exactly equal to that expended in changing it from its first to its 
second configuration. In the second configuration, therefore, 
it is said to possess potential energy because it has a tendency 
of itself to change to another configuration as soon as the re- 
straint upon it is removed, and in so changing is capable of per- 
forming a definite amount of work. Its potential energy in 
118

Suc. 2] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 119 
configuration 2 is quantitatively defined as equal to the work | 
which the system is capable of performing in changing from 
configuration 2 to configuration 1. 
A steel rod bent or twisted under tension, a stretched rubber 
string, and a compressed fluid, are all examples of systems 
possessing potential energy. A system composed of the earth 
and a stone held at any position above the surface of the earth 
also possesses potential energy, for, if the stone is allowed to fall, 
it is capable of doing a definite amount of work before it reaches 
the surface of the earth. If a stone of mass, m, be thrown directly 
upward by the action of some force, it starts with an initial 
velocity wi, and, therefore, possesses an initial kinetic energy, 
lgmu. As it rises its velocity steadily decreases until it 
finally becomes zero. Its kinetic energy also becomes zero at the 
same time. The system composed of the stone and the earth is, 
however, now said to possess an amount of potential energy 
exactly equal to the initial kinetic energy of the stone, for in 
falling to the earth the stone will again acquire the kinetic energy, 
1 mux. Loss of kinetic energy in this case is accompanied 
by the gain of an exactly equivalent quantity of potential energy, 
the sum of the two remaining always the same. More generally 
stated, the capacity of the system for performing work is always 
the same whatever be the position of the stone, until it has 
returned once more to the surface of the earth and its kinetic 
energy has been converted into heat. 
2. The Nature of Heat Energy.—If two perfectly elastic bodies, 
two molecules of a monatomic perfect gas such as helium for 
example, collide with each other, the total kinetic energy pos- 
sessed by the two bodies is not changed by the collision. When 
a monatomic perfect gas is heated, therefore, the heat which it 
absorbs should all be used up in increasing the kinetic energy of 
translatory motion of the molecules of the gas. This conclusion 
is in perfect accord with the experimental facts concerning the 
specific heat of monatomic gases. The total heat content of a 
mass of a monatomic perfect gas containing n molecules would, 
therefore, be 14 nmu*, where 14 mu* is the mean translatory 
kinetic energy of the molecules. 
If the gas is di-, tri-, or polyatomic, however, this would not 
necessarily be the case, for in a collision between two such mole- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
120 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. X 
cules some of the energy of the collision might go to increasing 
the distances separating the atoms within the molecule and 
would thus be doing work against the forces holding the atoms 
in their positions or orbits. The corresponding increase in the 
intra-molecular energy would be classed as an increase in intra- 
molecular potential energy because it is regarded as existing by 
virtue of the new configuration of the molecule. An increase in 
intra-molecular kinetic energy might also occur because some of 
the energy of the collision would probably go to increasing the 
vibration or oscillation of the atoms within the molecule. Simi- 
larly when heat is absorbed by a liquid, a crystal, or a com- 
pressed gas, part of the energy may be used up in doing work 
against internal forces acting between molecules or between 
atoms within molecules. It therefore becomes inter- or intra- 
molecular potential energy. When heat is abstracted from such 
a body by thermal conduction this inter- and intra-molecular 
potential energy is first transformed into unordered molecular 
kinetic energy and is then given up to the surroundings. Hence 
as far as our purposes are concerned this molecular potential 
energy acts like a reservoir of molecular kinetic energy since it 
is not accessible to us except by previous transformation into 
unordered molecular kinetic energy.* Viewed from the stand- 
point of its availability for purposes of doing useful work, there- 
fore, any form of energy may be, and in fact must be, classed 
with heat energy if it is of such a nature that we are not able, 
even in principle, to abstract it from a system until it has first 
been converted into unordered molecular kinetic energy or 
unordered vibratory radiant energy. 
The quantity of heat energy which must be imparted to one 
gram of any pure substance in order to raise its temperature 
one degree without change of state is called the specific heat 
capacity of the substance and the product of the specific heat into 
the molecular or atomic weight is called the molal (or molecular) 
heat capacity or the atomic heat capacity. The specific (¢p) or 
molal (Cy) heat capacity of a substance heated under constant 
pressure is different from its specific (c,) or molal (C,) heat 
capacity when heated at constant volume and the method of 
* Or unordered vibratory motion in the ether in case it is transmitted from 
the body by radiation.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
Suc. 3] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 121 
heating must therefore be specified. The subject of specific 
heats will be considered in more detail in a later chapter. 
3. The First Law of Thermodynamics.—We have just seen 
that the heat content of a body or system of bodies arises from 
the kinetic and potential energy possessed by its moving atoms 
and molecules. In addition to its content of heat energy a sys- 
tem may, of course, contain energy in other forms (chemical or 
electrical, for example) and the total amount of all forms of 
energy which any system contains is called its total energy or 
its internal energy and is represented by the letter U. We 
know nothing as to the magnitude of the total energy of any 
system but when any change takes place in a system there is 
usually a corresponding change in its total energy, either a 
decrease due to its giving up some of its energy to the surround- 
ings or an increase through receiving energy from the surround- 
ings. These changes in the total energy of a system we are able 
to study and to measure, and experience has shown that they 
obey the following law, known as the law of the conservation of 
energy or the First Law of Thermodynamics: When a quan- 
tity of energy disappears at any place a precisely equivalent 
quantity appears at some other place or places; and when 
a quantity of energy disappears in any form a precisely equiva- 
lent quantity simultaneously appears in some other form or 
forms. In other words energy can neither be created nor de- 
stroyed. Two quantities of energy are said to be equivalent if, 
when converted into the same form (heat, for example), they yield 
identical amounts of that form. Thus if a certain amount of 
radiant energy be entirely absorbed by 1 gram of water with the 
result that the temperature of the water rises 1°, the amount of 
radiant energy is equivalent to 1 calorie of heat energy. If a 
certain quantity of electricity flows through a coil of wire im- 
mersed in one gram of water and thereby produces a rise of one 
degree in the temperature of the water, the electrical energy is 
equivalent to one calorie of heat energy, and the quantities of 
radiant energy and of electrical energy involved in these two 
experiments are, therefore, equivalent to each other. 
It has been found convenient to divide the change in total 
energy which accompanies any process taking place within a 
system into two classes, designated as heat, Q, and work, W, 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  122 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. X 
respectively. The reason for this division lies in a practical 
difference between heat energy, on the one hand, and all other 
forms of energy on the other hand, which difference is the cause 
of a certain restriction upon our ability to transform heat energy 
into other forms of energy. This difference is due to the fact 
that in the case of heat energy (and in this class are included 
certain forms of radiant energy) the motion of the moving parts 
is unordered, or random motion, while in the case of all other 
forms of energy involved in any process of energy transformation 
or transference the movement of the parts whose motion gives 
rise to the energy, in question is ordered motion, that is, it is 
directed in one or two or at most a few definite directions, 
instead of having the random character of molecular motion. 
On the basis of the above classification of energy it follows 
from the conservation law that when any process takes place 
within a system, the corresponding change in the total energy 
of the system must be made up of the work of the process and 
the heat of the process, or more exactly stated, the increase, 
AU, in the total energy, U, of any system, which occurs when any 
process or change takes place within the system, is equal to the 
quantity of heat, Q, absorbed by the system from the surround- 
ings, diminished by the quantity of work, W, done by the system 
upon the surroundings, or in mathematical language, 
AU =Q-W (1) 
This equation is the mathematical formulation of the First Law 
of Thermodynamics. 
The following example is an illustration of its application to 
a specific process: If a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in a 
cylinder provided with a weighted piston is exploded, the force 
of the explosion will raise the weighted piston through a certain 
distance against the force of gravity and there will be a simul- 
taneous evolution of heat which will be gradually taken up by 
the surroundings. Suppose the weight lifted to be 10,000 grams 
and that it is raised 10 meters. The work done upon it would 
be 10,000 < 1000 X 980 ergs, where 980 (dynes) is the accelera- 
tion due to gravity. This is 9,800,000,000 ergs or 980 joules 
and is evidently work done upon the surroundings by the sys- 
tem since it is done against a force, gravitation, exerted by the
-P-A-G-E-151
    
Suc. 4] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 123 
surroundings upon the weighted piston. Since one calorie is 
equivalent to 4.2 joules, the above quantity of work is equivalent 
980 ‘ to Fo = 233 calories. Suppose that the heat evolved by the 
explosion is 1000 calories. The quantity, Q, therefore, in equa- 
tion (1) would be — 1000 calories, since Q has been so defined as 
to be positive when heat is absorbed by the system from the 
surroundings. For the increase, AU, in the total energy of the 
system which results from the above process we have, therefore, 
AU =Q— W = — 1000 — 233 ='— 1233 cal. 
or, in words, the total energy of the system has decreased by 
1233 calories, since the value of AU comes out with a negative 
sign. The above example of the application of the equation of 
the First Law brings out the fact, which the student should 
always keep in mind, that before two energy quantities can be 
employed together in an equation they must first be expressed in 
terms of the same energy unit. 
4. Corollaries of the First Law.—A little consideration will 
show that the following two statements are necessary conse- 
quences of the First Law of Thermodynamics: 
1. The total energy of any system in a given state or condition 
is, for the system in question, a definite characteristic of that 
state and is independent of the manner in which the system 
reached that state. 
2. When a system changes from a state, A, where its total 
energy is U4, to some other state, B, where its total energy is 
Us, the increase in total energy, AU = Uz — U4, which accom- 
panies this change is independent of the process by which the 
change is brought about. 
For example, one gram of the substance, water, in the form of 
ice at a temperature of —10° and a pressure of one atmosphere 
contains a definite amount of energy which is the same for every 
gram of water in this condition irrespective of the previous his- 
tory of the water, provided it has been in this condition for 
sufficient time to reach a state of equilibrium. If we wished to - 
convert a gram of water in the above condition into one gram of 
water vapor at a temperature of 200° and a pressure of one-tenth 
of an atmosphere, we could do so in a variety of different ways.  
-P-A-G-E-152
  124 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. X 
For example, we might first reduce the pressure upon the ice 
until it had all evaporated and then the vapor could be heated 
to 200° and the pressure brought to one-tenth of an atmosphere; 
or, we might first melt the ice, heat the resulting water to boil- 
ing, boil it all away and then heat the steam to 200° and bring 
the pressure to one-tenth of an atmosphere; or, we could dissolve 
the ice in an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid and pass a current 
of electricity through this solution between platinum electrodes, 
until one gram of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases were 
evolved. This mixture could then be exploded and the water 
vapor formed could be cooled to 200° and the pressure upon it 
brought to one-tenth of an atmosphere. By whatever process 
the above change is brought about, however, we should find that 
the total energy change accompanying the process is always the 
same irrespective of the nature of the process. 
5. Work and Energy Units.—The work associated with any 
process may always be regarded as ordered motion taking place 
under the influence of a force, f, and when so regarded, is quan- 
titatively defined as the product of the force into the distance 
through which it acts. On the basis of this definition it can be 
readily shown that in the case of a change in the volume of a 
system against a pressure, the work done by the system is equal 
to the product of the increase in volume, Av, and the pressure, p, 
under which it takes place or, for an infinitesimal volume increase, 
we have 
dW = pdv (2) 
If the pressure is constant during the change in volume, the in- 
tegral of this expression is 
W = pive— 01) = pAv (8) 
where »; and 2 are the initial and final volumes, respectively. 
If the pressure is expressed in atmospheres and the volumes in 
liters, the corresponding energy unit is called the liter-atmos- 
phere, one liter-atmosphere being defined as the work done when 
a volume increase of one liter occurs against a constant pressure 
of one atmosphere. 
Problem 1.—How much work is done by n moles of a perfect gas in 
expanding from 2; to v2?
-P-A-G-E-153
Src. 6] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 125 
In the case of electrical work our definitions of electrical 
quantities are such that the electrical work done when a current 
of electricity flows under a difference of potential is equal to the 
quantity, g, of electricity multiplied by the difference of poten- 
tial, E, under which it flows. If the quantity of electricity is 
expressed in coulombs and the potential difference in volts, the 
product will be volt-coulombs or joules. 
Work, heat, or any form of energy may, of course, be expressed 
in any one of the various energy units, ergs, joules, calories, or 
liter-atmospheres. The definitions of the various units have 
already been given in the Introduction. They are related to 
one another quantitatively by the following equations: 
1 liter-atmosphere = 24.207 cal. 
1 cal. = 4.184 joules 
1 joule (by definition) = 107 ergs. 
6. The Relation Connecting Heat of Fusion, Heat of Vapori- 
zation, and Heat of Sublimation. 
Problem 2.—Prove that the First Law of Thermodynamics requires that 
the molal heat of fusion (Lr), of vaporization—of the liquid—(Ly), and of 
sublimation (Ls), in the case of any substance shall be connected by the 
equation, 
L,=Lr+Ly (4) 
provided all of the processes mentioned occur at the same constant tempera- 
ture, 7, and pressure, P. 
Problem 3.—In order to melt one gram of ice at 0° and a pressure of one 
atmosphere 79.60 calories of heat are required. To convert 1 gram of water 
under the same conditions into saturated vapor requires 2494.6 joules of 
energy. How many calories of heat will be evolved during the deposition 
of 18 grams of hoar frost from saturated air at 0°? 
7. The Second Law of Thermodynamics.—With respect to 
the transformation of work into heat (that is, of ordered or 
directed motion into unordered or random molecular motion) 
our experience teaches us that there is no restriction except that 
contained in the First Law of Thermodynamics which merely 
requires that in such a transformation the amount of heat pro- 
duced shall be exactly equivalent to the work expended, or in 
other words that there shall be neither destruction of energy nor 
creation of energy out of nothing. But with respect to the
-P-A-G-E-154
126 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. X 
reverse transformation of heat into work (of random molecular 
motion into directed motion of some kind), our experience teaches 
us that there are certain practical restrictions imposed by nature 
in addition to those contained in the statement of the First Law. 
The complete statement and description of the nature of these 
restrictions comprises what is known as the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics. 
That some additional restriction is perhaps to be expected, 
knowing as we do the random nature of the motion which gives 
rise to heat energy, will be appreciated from the following con- 
siderations: In the case of a moving mass large enough for us 
to control it as an individual we can theoretically convert all 
or any part of its kinetic energy into some other form of useful 
energy, or in other words, can make it do any desired form of work. 
In the case of a moving molecule, however, the moving body is 
too small for us to control its motion as an individual. We 
can see, therefore, at once that, as far as we are concerned, the 
kinetic energy of such a small particle as a molecule is not avail- 
able for our uses in the same sense as that of a body large enough 
for us to control as an individual. Suppose, however, that we 
have a very large number of small particles all moving in the 
same direction, or of whose motion there is a sufficiently large 
component in some one direction. We have such a situation, 
for example, in a metallic wire through which a current of elec- 
tricity is passing. ‘The current consists of a stream of electrons 
(I, 2h) which at any moment are all moving in one direction 
through a given cross section of the wire, or at least the motion 
of every electron has a positive component in this direction. In 
such a case the particles are likewise too small to be controlled 
as individuals but they have a resultant kinetic energy in one 
direction which is large enough for us to control and we are thus 
able to transform this energy into some desired form of useful work. 
In the case of heat energy, however, we are dealing with a very 
large number of particles, too small to be controlled as indi- 
viduals, and whose motion is perfectly at random; that is, if we 
were to resolve the motion of all the molecules of a gas or a liquid 
in any direction whatever, the resultant motion and hence also 
the resultant kinetic energy in this direction for any finite inter- 
val of time would be zero, as far as our purposes are concerned,
-P-A-G-E-155
Sec.7] | SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 127 
In order, therefore, to convert unordered molecular kinetic 
energy into ordered kinetic energy, that is, in order to trans- 
from heat into work, we are obliged to slow up all of the moving 
molecules, or in other words, to reduce their average kinetic 
energy and hence to lower the temperature of the body from which 
we wish to take the heat energy. 
For example, when a gas expands and raises a weight it does 
work, but in doing so it always cools off, that is, the average 
kinetic energy of its molecules decreases, the total decrease in 
the molecular and atomic kinetic and potential energy being 
exactly equivalent to the work done. If the gas is kept in a 
large heat reservoir during its expansion, it will take up heat from 
the reservoir which in turn will cool down. That is, the heat 
energy necessary for performing the desired work will come from 
the reservoir instead of from the gas itself, and, if the heat reser- 
voir is large enough in comparison with the amount of gas em- 
ployed, the amount by which it is cooled down will be infinite- 
simal, since the decrease in molecular energy will be distributed 
over such an enormous number of molecules that the average 
kinetic energy of each molecule and hence the temperature of the 
reservoir would remain practically unaltered. For practical pur- 
poses, therefore, we may regard a compressed gas in good thermal 
contact with a sufficiently large heat reservoir (such as the ocean, 
for example) as a device for converting the heat energy of the 
reservoir into useful work at practically constant temperature 
and as long as our supply of compressed gas lasted we might go 
on converting heat into work in this manner. Large supplies of 
compressed gas are not available, however, and if we attempted 
to compress the gas after expansion with the idea of using it over 
again, we would find that, even under the most theoretically 
perfect conditions, it could not be compressed to its original 
pressure except by the expenditure of at least as much work as 
could be obtained from it during the expansion described above. 
Practically we would always find that more work would be 
required. In other words the operation could not be worked in 
a cycle for the purpose of transforming heat into work. In fact 
all of our experience leads to the conclusion that: 
A system or arrangement of matter operating in a cycle can- 
not transform heat into work in surroundings of constant tem-
-P-A-G-E-156
128 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuav. X 
perature. This statement evidently constitutes a restriction 
upon the transformation of heat into work and is part of the 
Second Law of Thermodynamics. The rest of the law has to do 
with the transformation of heat into work by a machine operating 
between two temperatures. 
If we place a body having the temperature, 7'1, in thermal con- 
tact with a colder body having the temperature, 7’2, we invariably 
find that heat flows from the hot body to the cold body and never 
in the reverse direction. That is, heat energy. will never of itself 
flow from a lower to a higher temperature but only in the reverse 
direction. This result can be shown to be a necessary conse- 
quence of the laws of statistical mechanics applied to a mechanical 
system composed of moving masses such as the molecules of a 
body and from the kinetic point of view is equivalent to the state- 
ment that, if a system composed of a large number of moving 
masses, such as the molecules of a perfect gas, having the average 
kinetic energy, 14 mu;*, is brought into contact with a second 
similar system having the average kinetic energy, 14 muz?, in such 
a manner that a distribution of momentum and of kinetic energy 
can occur, the resultant transfer of kinetic energy will necessarily 
be in the direction of the system having initially the smaller value 
of 144 mu*. Whenever, therefore, two bodies of matter at differ- 
ent temperatures are brought into thermal contact in any way 
there will occur a transfer of molecular kinetic energy (7.e., a flow 
of heat) from the hotter to the colder body. In this flow of heat 
just as in the case of the moving electrons described above, we 
recognize once more, the transfer of a finite amount of ordered or 
directed kinetic energy in one direction and there exists, therefore, 
just as in the case of the electric current, the possibility of 
transforming this directed energy into some form of useful work.’ 
+ The statement that heat will, of itself, flow only from a higher to a lower 
temperature and never in the reverse direction is one of the several methods 
of expressing the basic principle upon which the Second Law of Thermody- 
namics rests. This basic principle regarding the uni-directional autogenous, 
flow of heat is, moreover, usually regarded as essentially a new principle, 
that is, one which cannot be derived from the law of conservation of energy 
and the principles of statistical mechanics. This view, however, becomes 
unnecessary if we accept the kinetic interpretation of the meaning of heat 
energy. That is, if we regard the heat energy of a material body or system 
as the energy which it possesses by virtue of the unordered motion of its
-P-A-G-E-157
  Suc. 7] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 129 
This being the case, the question naturally arises as to how 
much ordered or directed kinetic energy is associated with the pas- 
sage of a quantity of heat from a higher to a lower temperature, 
for it is this ordered energy only which is available for transforma- 
tion into useful work.° In order to discover this we will carry 
out a couple of “imaginary experiments”’ which will lead us to the 
formulation of a relationship whereby if we interpret work as 
ordered energy, we shall arrive at a mathematical formulation 
of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The classical derivation 
of the Second Law with the aid of the Carnot Cycle can be found 
in any work dealing with the subject of thermodynamics. The 
following derivation is employed here because it enables us to 
obtain a conception of why the Second Law must exist for us. 
A more rigorous derivation with the same purpose in mind was 
first given by Boltzmann‘ in terms of the Theory of Probability.* 
Suppose we have two large heat reservoirs each of practically 
  
atoms and molecules, then it follows from the principles of statistical mech- 
anics that the transfer of heat energy can take place only from a higher to a 
lower temperature. The criterion by which we determine which of two 
bodies or systems has the higher temperature then becomes the following: 
Let a quantity of a perfect gas be placed in thermal contact with the first 
system for a sufficient time for thermal equilibrium to establish itself. Call 
the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas under these conditions, 
144 mu. Now take the gas and place it in thermal contact with the second 
system until thermal equilibrium is established. Its average molecular 
kinetic energy is now 14 mu,?. If 14 mu? = 14 muz2?, the two systems are 
said to have the same temperature. If the two kinetic energies are not 
equal then the system in which 14 mu? has the greater value is at the higher 
temperature. 
¢ The amount of ordered kinetic energy involved in the transfer of a given 
quantity of heat, Q, from 7 to 7. in a cyclical process is a definite char- 
acteristic of the quantity Q and the two temperatures 7, and 72 and is 
independent of the manner in which the transfer occurs. For, if this were 
not the case, that is, if the amount of ordered kinetic energy associated 
with the passage of Q calories of heat from 7, to 7’, by one process of 
transfer were different from that by some other process of transfer, it can be 
readily proved that the two processes could be combined in such a way as 
to yield a result which would amount simply to an autogenous flow of heat 
from a lower to a higher temperature, 2 result which has been shown above 
to be impossible.

infinite heat capacity. Let the first reservoir have the tempera- 
ture, 71, and the second, the temperature, 7’, and let the two 
reservoirs be very close together but insulated from each other so 
that no transfer of heat from one to the other occurs. We will 
suppose, further, that in the interior of the first reservoir we have 
a quantity of some monatomic, perfect gas, such as helium under 
low pressure, for example. 
Let the following imaginary experiments be carried out; (1) 
Place the two reservoirs in thermal contact for such a length of 
time that a finite quantity, Qi, cf heat passes from the first reser- 
voir to the second. The passage of this heat may be assumed to 
take place either by radiation, or by conduction (along a metallic 
connecting rod, for example), or by any other mechanism what- 
soever. After the passage of this quantity of heat the two reser- 
voirs are again completely insulated from each other. 
Now as far as the transfer of energy is concerned, the net result 
of the above experiment can be exactly duplicated by the follow- 
ing process; (2) Take from the first reservoir such a number, n, 
of molecules of helium gas that the total kinetic energy, 14 nmuz?, 
possessed by them shall be the exact equivalent of the quantity 
of heat, Q1, which flowed from the first reservoir to the second, in 
the process just described. Transfer this quantity of gas bodily 
to the second reservoir and allow it to come into equilibrium with 
the reservoir keeping its volume constant. The gas will give up 
some of its energy to the second reservoir and will thus attain the 
temperature, T», of this reservoir, at which temperature its mole- 
cules will have the total kinetic energy, 144 nmuz?. If the gas be 
now returned to the first reservoir again, the physical system will 
be in the same position as at the beginning of the experiment, 
that is, a cycle will have been completed. 
It is clear that the net result of our second experiment consists 
simply in the transfer of the quantity of kinetic energy, 144 nmu.? 
— 14 nmu,?, in a definite direction; that is, from the first to the 
second reservoir, from 7’; to 72, but it has been accomplished by 
a cyclical process, that is, our working system has been returned 
to its original state and the operation could therefore be repeated 
as often as desired. During each such operation it is clear that 
the quantity of heat, Q = 14 nmu,?, drops from the higher to the 
lower temperature but part of it, namely Q2 = 14 nmuz?, has to
-P-A-G-E-159
Suc. 8] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 131 
be returned to the first reservoir along with the helium gas in 
whose molecules it resides in the form of unordered kinetic energy, 
and from which we have no way of removing it since there is no 
heat reservoir at absolute zero available. Evidently, therefore, 
only that part of its original heat energy which is left behind in 
the second reservoir after the helium has been returned to the 
first, represents ordered energy, that is, the net energy which 
passes from the reservoir 1 to reservoir 2 in the above cyclical 
process. Only this amount of energy is, therefore, available for 
conversion into useful work with the aid of some suitable mechan- 
ism whose nature we are not at present concerned with. Since, 
as explained in footnote c page 129, the quantity of ordered or 
directed kinetic energy involved in such a cycle is independent 
of the mechanism employed the relation 
ng mu — 1% mus?) = W (5) 
is a perfectly general expression for the available work of such a 
cycle. In this expression n represents that number of mole- 
cules of a monatomic perfect gas which at the temperature, 71, 
have a total kinetic energy 14 nmu?, equivalent to Q; and which 
at the temperature T. have the total kinetic energy, 44 nmuz?. 
8. Carnot’s Equation.—Equation (5) really represents the es- 
sence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is customary, 
however, to express the Second Law equation in terms of quantity 
of heat and temperature rather than in terms of molecular kinetic 
energy. Before translating equation (5) into these terms, how- 
ever, we will first define the terms engine, heat engine, and per- 
fect engine. 
Any system or arrangement of matter which works in a cycle 
and converts any form of energy into some desired form of me- 
chanical work will be called an engine. The expression, “ work- 
ing in a cycle,’’ means that the working system periodically 
returns to its initial condition. An engine which works between 
two different temperatures and converts heat into work will be 
called a heat engine. In all real heat engines the efficiency is 
usually very low owing to losses caused by friction and by radia- 
tion and conduction, and owing also to the fact that in actual 
practice it is not energy which is desired so much as power, that is, 
energy per second. As a result we do not operate our engines in  
-P-A-G-E-160
132 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY — [Cuar. X 
practice in such a way as to obtain the maximum amount of work 
which they are capable of yielding, for that would mean that the 
rate of production of work would be exceedingly low. Instead, 
we sacrifice some of the possible work for the purpose of getting 
what we do obtain, at a higher speed. 
We can, however, imagine an engine in which all the parts 
work so smoothly that there are no friction losses; in which heat 
insulation is so perfect that there are no energy losses due to 
radiation or conduction of heat; and which is operated so slowly 
that at every moment it is performing all the work it is capable 
of; that is, it acts always against an external force practically 
equal to the internal forces which are driving it. Such an 
imaginary engine will be called a perfect engine. It evidently 
represents a limiting condition approached by all real engines as 
the losses mentioned above are reduced to a minimum. 
In the case of a perfect heat engine operating between the two 
temperatures, 7; and T2, in such a way that it takes up Qi 
calories of heat from a reservoir at the temperature, 71, and trans- 
forms part of it into work, the question naturally arises as to 
what fraction of the Q: calories of heat such an engine is able to 
transform into work. This is the question which occurred to a 
young French engineer, Sadi Carnot,* about 1824, and his answer 
to it constitutes one of the common forms of stating the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics. 
In order to obtain Carnot’s equation from our nevis (8) 
we will first multiply and divide the left hand member by }gnmu2, 
and obtain 
n(dgmur? — emus?) (Lonmay*) 
n(}9mu*) 
Now it will be recalled that 1¢nmu;? is the quantity of heat energy 
possessed by the n molecules of helium gas at the temperature 7 
and represents therefore the quantity of heat, Qi, which was a (6)

man of remarkably brilliant mind; a profound and original thinker; the 
founder of modern thermo-dynamics. His only published work, Reflexions

puissance, appeared in 1824 when he was 28 years of age. He died of the 
cholera in Paris at the age of 36.

transferred from the first to the second reservoir (from 7’; to 72), 
in the first stage of the process described above. Equation (6) 
may, therefore, be written 
Cama? — +gmtus*) domuy?   
Qa=W (7) 
and since according to equation (29,I1), the mean kinetic energy of 
the molecules of a perfect gas is proportional to the absolute 
temperature of the gas, our equation becomes 
eT, — eT, ae 
“, Q=W (8)   
  
or ae a=W (9) 
which represents Carnot’s method of expressing what is now 
called the Second Law of Thermodynamics. 
From our method of deriving this relation it is evident that the 
set Dr Tots : F fraction ries is that part of the Q; units of heat which repre- 1 
sents the amount of ordered or directed kinetic energy which is 
transferred from 7; to J’, and which is, therefore, available for 
performing useful work. Stated in other words, equation (9) 
signifies that any heat engine which operates between two tem- 
peratures, 7’; and 7's, in such a manner that it takes up Q; units 
of heat at the temperature, 71, and converts part of it into work 
can never, even under the most favorable conditions imaginable 
(i.e, those attained with a perfect heat engine), convert more than 
. T™,-T ! ; 3 : the fraction, eee of this heat into work, for this fraction, 1 
as we have just seen, represents the total amount of ordered 
kinetic energy which is involved in the passage of Q: units of heat 
from 7, to T2 in a cyclical process. 
Only when T2 equals zero would it be theoretically possible to 
convert all of the Q; units of heat into work. In other words, if 
surroundings at a temperature of absolute zero were available 
for our use, a perfect heat engine could convert into work all of 
the heat energy which is absorbed at any temperature. This, of 
course, merely means that in order to convert all of the molecular 
kinetic energy of any body into some form of useful work it 
would be necessary to bring all the molecules of the body to rest.  
-P-A-G-E-162
  134 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY — [Cuar. X 
Since we have no surroundings available at a temperature of 
absolute zero we have to content ourselves with slowing up the 
molecules of our working system as much as possible and to this 
end the temperature 7’; should always be made as low as feasible 
and the difference, 7':—T%, as large as feasible. 
The most common form of heat engine employed in practice 
is the steam engine. The working system is water vapor 
enclosed in a cylinder provided with a movable piston and the 
heat energy is converted directly into mechanical work. The 
two temperatures between which the steam engine operates are 
the boiler temperature, 71, and the temperature of the exhaust, 
T.. The boiler temperature is usually maintained by the com- 
bustion of some kind of fuel. The temperature of the exhaust 
is not lower than the temperature of the surroundings. 
In practice considerable quantities of heat energy escape 
from the boiler to the surroundings by radiation and conduction 
instead of being taken up by the engine and employed in doing 
useful work. Part of the work done by the engine is also con- 
verted back into heat again by the friction of the moving parts of 
the engine and is, therefore, not available. Moreover, as stated 
above, engines are not operated in practice so as to perform at all 
times the maximum work which they are capable of doing. As 
a result of all these losses the efficiency of steam engines 
employed in practice is much lower than that of a perfect heat 
engine. Thus, a perfect heat engine taking superheated steam at 
a temperature of 206.4° and delivering it to a water-cooled exhaust 
at a temperature of 43.1° would convert, pies Ne Ty Me = ae an we + 
=34 per cent. of the heat energy of the steam into mechanical 
work. The most efficient 1000-H.P. steam engine which has 
ever been constructed, when working under substantially the 
same conditions converts only 25 per cent. of the heat energy it 
receives into useful work, while for most steam engines as em- 
ployed in practice this figure will average only about 8-10 per 
cent. 
When figured on the basis of the total available energy obtain-

tive heating system. For the tests on this engine see Hood, Trans. Amer.

able from the coal, the efficiency is much smaller even. It can 
be shown that every gram of carbon which is burned to CO 
should theoretically be capable of yielding about 34,000 joules 
of energy (at ordinary temperatures) in the form of useful work. 
This amount of carbon, if burned under conditions analogous to 
those under which coal is burned in the best modern boiler prac- 
tice, will deliver to the engine about 27,000 joules of energy in 
the form of heat and 25 per cent. or 6800 joules of this would be 
converted into useful work by the 1000-H.P. engine mentioned 
above. That is, the most efficient modern engineering methods 
: 6800 + can obtain from coal only about, 34000 O° 20 per cent. of its 
theoretical work producing power. The remaining 80 per cent. 
is lost. Under average working conditions only 5-7 per cent. of 
the energy of the coal is obtained in the form of useful work. It 
is evident, therefore, that modern methods of converting the 
energy of coal into useful work are really exceedingly wasteful. 
9. Free Energy and the Principle of the Degradation of Energy. 
In addition to the energy which is obtainable from the chemical 
reaction, C + O2 = COs, which represents the combustion of car- 
bon, many other chemical reactions are also capable of yielding 
energy which can be made available for the production of work. 
In fact, in the case of every process whether chemical or physical, 
which tends to take place of itself, a portion of the total energy 
decrease, —AU, which accompanies the process can always be 
obtained in the form of useful work, if the process is allowed to 
take place in a suitable manner. The maximum amount of work 
which the process is theoretically capable of yielding when 
carried out in such a way as to operate a perfect engine of some 
character is called the “free energy,” A, of the process. The 
free energy of a chemical reaction is an important and charac- 
teristic property of the reaction. 
> By employing mercury vapor instead of water vapor as the working 
medium, the efficiency of a vapor heat engine could be increased, because 
the boiling point of mercury (357°) is 257° higher than that of water and a 
higher initial temperature (71) could, therefore, be employed. Experiments 
by Emmet (Proc. Amer. Inst. Elec. Eng., 33, 473 (1914)) indicate that 
a mercury vapor engine connected in tandem with a steam engine would 
show a 45 per cent. increase in efficiency (per Ib. of fuel) over the steam 
engine alone,
-P-A-G-E-164
  136 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. X 
In order to make clearer the distinction between the free 
energy, A, of a reaction and its total energy, — AU, we will con- 
sider the chemical reaction, 
Zn + Hg2SO, + 7H20 = ZnSO.-7H20 + 2Hg 
which occurs when a rod of metallic zinc is placed in an aqueous 
solution saturated with mercurous sulphate. In this reaction 
the zinc dissolves and throws out the mercury. When allowed 
to occur in this way, there is evidently no work® done by this reac- 
tion and the total energy, — AU, liberated by the reaction must 
appear entirely in the form of heat. That is, by the First Law 
(equation (1)) we have 
—AU = — Q = 81,320 cal. of heat evolved. 
If instead of allowing the reaction to proceed in the above way, 
we place the mercury in the bottom of a tube, cover it with a paste 
of mercurous sulphate and then fill the tube with a saturated 
solution of zine sulphate into which the rod of zine dips, we will 
find on connecting the zinc and the mercury to the terminals of a 
volt meter that there exists a difference of potential between 
them amounting to 1.429 volts at 18° and if they be connected to 
the terminals. of a perfect electric motor, a current of electricity 
(193,000 coulombs of electricity for each atomic weight of zinc 
dissolved) will pass through the motor during the time the above 
reaction is taking place, and this current can thus be made to do 
useful work. The maximum amount of work which it is capable 
of doing represents the free energy of the reaction and is evidently 
given by the expression (X, 5) 
A = E X g = 1.429 volts X 193,000 coulombs = 275,800 joules = 
275800 ‘ Tai eda 65,880 calories. 
The rest of the energy of the reaction appears in the form of heat 
and amounts to —Q2 = 15,440 calories. We have, therefore, 
—-AU = —-Q+W=-—-Q+A = 15,440 + 65,880 = 81,320 
calories.

the pressure of the atmosphere owing to the fact that there is a slight change 
in volume in the above reaction.

Szc. 9] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 137 
Most of the processes which occur in nature and in the indus- 
tries take place in such a way that the whole or the greater part 
of the energy which they give out appears entirely in the form of 
heat which is then radiated and conducted away to the surround- 
ings and thus is no longer available for the production of work. 
This constant transformation of available energy in various 
forms into unavailable’ heat energy is called the degradation of 
energy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics is sometimes 
called the Principle of the Degradation of Energy because it 
points out that heat energy at the temperature of our surround- 
ings is not available for transformation into useful work. The 
Principle of the Degradation of Energy is more comprehensive 
than the Second Law of Thermodynamics as embodied in the 
Carnot equation, however, for there are other ways in which 
the capacity of a system for doing work can diminish besides the 
mere conversion of a part or the whole of its available energy into 
heat. For example, when a gas is allowed to expand into a 
vacuum it does no work. Some of its work-producing power has 
been lost by the process, however, for it might have been made to 
lift a weight during its expansion. Many other examples of 
processes which are attended by a loss of work-producing power, 
that is, a loss of “free energy” as it is also called, might be cited 
and our experience teaches us that the available energy of our 
world is constantly decreasing owing to the continual occurrence 
of such processes in nature and in the industries. This state- 
ment is the Principle of the Degradation of Energy. According 
to the first principle of energy (Principle of Conservation) the 
total energy of the world is a constant, but according to the 
second principle (Principle of Degradation) the available energy 
of the world is constantly decreasing. 
The two laws of thermodynamics are of great importance in 
physical chemistry since they enable us to derive a large number 
of important relations governing equilibrium in physical and 
chemical systems under a variety of conditions. We shall have 
occasion to employ a number of these thermodynamic relation- 
ships in the following chapters but will postpone the derivations 
of most of them until later. In the next section an application 
of the Second Law to a system at constant temperature is 
described.

10. Proof of Equality of Vapor Pressures at the Freezing Point. 
Consider a pure liquid at A (Fig. 24) in contact at bb’ with its 
solid crystals in B, the space above both the liquid and solid being 
filled with the vapor. Assume that both the liquid and solid are 
at the temperature of the freezing point and hence (by definition) 
in equilibrium with each other at bb’. If their vapor pressures 
are not equal then one’of them must be greater than the other. 
  
  
  Fie, 24. 
Suppose the vapor pressure of the liquid is greater than that of the 
solid. If this were the case the liquid would evaporate at A and the 
vapor (which according to our supposition has too high a pressure 
to be in equilibrium with the solid) would condense to solid 
again at B, and this process of distillation would continue until 
all of the liquid had been converted into solid; which would be 
contrary to our assumption that they were initially in equilibrium 
with each other. The only other possibility is that, as fast as 
the liquid is used up by evaporation at A, it is replaced by the 
melting of the solid at bb’. Under this arrangement we would 
have a constant stream of vapor passing by the position aa’ in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
Src. 11] SOME PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ENERGY 139 
direction AB and by placing a turbine at this point we could 
obtain work from a system working in a cycle at constant tem- 
perature which would be contrary to the Second Law of Thermo- 
dynamics (X, 7). Hence the vapor pressure of the liquid cannot 
be greater than that of the solid. In the same way it can be 
shown that the vapor pressure of the solid cannot be greater than 
that of the liquid. They must, therefore, be equal and the freez- 
ing point is, therefore, the point at which the vapor pressure 
curve of the liquid intersects that of the solid. (See Fig. 25.) 
By a similar method of proof it can be shown that if any two 
phases are both in equilibrium with a third phase, they are in 
equilibrium with each other. 
11. Free Energy and the Carnot Equation.—Since in equation 
(9) W represents the maximum work obtainable from Q: units 
of heat by means of a perfect heat engine, it also represents 
the free energy of the process which occurs during the operation — 
of the engine, Qi being the heat of the process (heat absorbed) 
at the temperature 7T;. In equation (9) we may therefore 
write W = A and, if we also put 7, = T and T; = T + dT, we 
have 
da = (10) 
which is a convenient way of expressing the Second Law so as 
to show the manner in which the free energy of any process 
changes with the temperature at which the process occurs, the 
temperature being understood to remain constant while the process 
in question takes place. Q is similarly the heat absorbed during the 
occurrence of the process in a perfect engine at the temperature 
T. In order to integrate this equation and thus to obtain an 
expression from which the free energy of any process (a chemical 
reaction, for example) can be computed at any temperature, it is 
first necessary to express Q as a function of J. Methods for doing 
this will be discussed in Chapter XX. 
Having expressed Q as a function of T' it is evident that the 
integral of equation (10) will enable one to calculate the free 
energy of a given process at any temperature provided its value 
for some one temperature has been determined, that is, provided 
the integration constant has been evaluated. Measurements of 
the free energies of chemical reactions at some convenient tem-
-P-A-G-E-168
140 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuar. X 
perature constitute therefore, an important but many times diffi- 
cult undertaking. In certain cases where such measurements 
cannot be carried out with the means at present at our disposal, 
recourse may be had to a new thermodynamic principle proposed 
by Nernst in 1906 and usually known as the Nernst Heat Theo- 
rem. In the particular form in which we shall present it below, 
it is a corollary of what has been called the Third Law of Thermo- 
dynamics. 
12. Entropy—A thermodynamic quantity defined by the 
equation 
dQ as =F (11) 
and named by Clausius* the entropy of a system is, like the quanti- 
ties U and A, characterized by being determined solely by the state 
of the system and not by the manner or path by which it reaches 
“that state. The increase in entropy, AS, in an isothermal 
reversible process is related to the free energy of the process in the 
following way: 
as = 8-5 - [=F - oF (12) 1 
or in words, the increase in entropy is equal to the temperature- 
rate of increase of the free energy. 
Corresponding to the Principle of the Degradation of Energy 
stated in section 9, we can also formulate the Principle of the 
Increase of Entropy which states that every physical or chemical 
process in nature takes place in such a way as to increase the sum 
of the entropies of all the bodies taking part in the process. The 
available energy of the world is constantly decreasing, its en- 
tropy is constantly increasing, or in simpler terms the amount of 
order (ordered energy) is constantly growing less, the disorder 
(unordered energy) greater. 
We may summarize the definitions of total energy, free energy, 
and entropy, as follows: A system composed of any number of

13. The Quantum Theory..—Matter and electricity have 
been shown to be discontinuous, that is, to be made up of discrete 
particles. Energy, on the other hand, has until recent years 
been treated as though it were a continuous entity, that is, as 
though there were no lower limit to the amount of it which an 
atom or an electron could emit or absorb. The quantum hypothe- 
sis originated by Planck* starts with the assumption that in the (22)

Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of Berlin.

emission of radiant energy by an oscillating atom or electron (the 
resonator), this energy is radiated in discrete units or pulses called 
quanta. The amount of energy in a single pulse varies with the 
frequency of the resonator, being in fact proportional to that 
frequency. ‘The proportionality constant or Planck’s h, as it 
is called, is a natural constant having the value 6.5-10 —27 erg- 
seconds. 
Various modifications of the quantum hypothesis have been 
applied in a variety of fields of physics and chemistry with, on the 
whole, such a measure of success as to warrant the expectation 
that there will eventually result some kind of a consistent quan- 
tum theory which will connect in satisfactory fashion the various 
phenomena whose fundamental relationships are evident in the 
light even of the many times incomplete, inconsistent and self- 
contradictory hypotheses employed in using the various forms 
of quantum theories which are in current use. 
14. The “Third Law of Thermodynamics” and the Nernst 
“Heat Theorem.’’?,*.—One of Planck’s deductions from the quan- 
tum theory was a new thermodynamic principle which from the 
evidence thus far accumulated seems to be of general validity. 
This new law of thermodynamics may be stated in the follow- 
ing terms:* Jf the entropy of each element in the crystalline state 
be taken as zero at the absolute zero, the entropy of every pure crys- 
talline substance at the absolute zero is zero and the entropy of any 
other substance is greater than zero. 
The entropy of a compound would thus be the sum of the en- 
tropies of its elements and the increase in entropy for all processes 
involving crystalline substance only at the absolute zero would 
evidently also be zero, whence from the Second Law (eq. 22) we 
find 
= limpoo AS = 0 (23) lim ce sa 
Another consequence of the quantum theory, as we shall see 
later (Chap. XX), is that for every pure solid substance, 
U ap = ° (24)

Equations (23) and (25) were put forward by Nernst before 
the formulation of the quantum theory and together constitute 
what is known as the Nernst Heat Theorem. With their aid 
it is possible to calculate free energy values from thermal data 
only. We shall consider applications of this theorem later on.

      CHAPTER XI 
SOLUTIONS I: DEFINITION OF TERMS AND 
CLASSIFICATION OF SOLUTIONS 
1. Definition of a Solution.—In our first chapter (I, 2) we 
applied the term mixture to any material which is composed of 
more than one species of molecule. In this and the following 
chapters we shall deal with an important class of mixtures known 
as solutions. A solution may be defined as a one-phase system 
composed of two or more molecular species (see definition of 
phase, I, 9). The exact significance of this definition will be 
more easily understood from the following considerations. 
If we grind together sugar, CizH22011, and sand, SiOz, we can 
obtain an intimate mixture of these two materials, but on close 
examination we can readily recognize the presence of two 
crystalline phases, namely, crystals of pure sand and crystals of 
pure sugar, in the mixture. This mixture is, therefore, hetero- 
geneous (I, 9) and is hence not a solution. Similarly, if we shake 
together (1) liquid mercury and liquid benzene, or (2) liquid 
mercury and gaseous nitrogen, or (3) liquid mercury and sugar 
crystals, we obtain in each instance systems in which the presence 
of two phases is readily recognized. Moreover, a chemical exami- 
nation of the liquid and the crystalline phases in each of the above 
systems would fail to give any evidence of the presence of 
more than one molecular species within the phase, and with- 
out such evidence we could not class any one of the phases as a 
solution. 
By bringing together (1) liquid water and liquid alcohol, or 
(2) liquid water and gaseous hydrochloric acid, or (3) liquid water 
and sugar crystals, however, we can obtain in each instance a 
one-phase (i.e., homogeneous) system in which the presence of 
more than one molecular species can be readily ascertained. We 
obtain, therefore, in each of these cases a solution. 
144 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  Suc. 2] DEFINITION OF TERMS 145 
In a true solution,! after equilibrium is reached, the individual 
molecules of the different molecular species present are intimately 
and uniformly mixed with one another, or, in another phraseology 
which is frequently used, the different component substances 
which were brought together in order to prepare the solution 
have become molecularly dispersed in one another. The dif- 
ferent molecular species of which a solution is composed will 
be called its molecular components and the substances corre- 
sponding to these molecular species, or more generally the sub- 
stances of which the solution is considered to be composed, will 
be called its components or its constituents. For example, a 
solution whose constituents are the pure substance, sugar, and 
the associated substance, water, has the following molecular com- 
ponents: (H,O), (H2O)2, (H2O)s, CieH22011, Ci2H22011:(H20)., 
and possibly others. 
2. Associated Substances as Solutions.—An associated sub- 
stance (III, 5) such as water, must, strictly speaking, be itself 
classed as a solution since it contains more than one species of 
molecule. It is a solution of a peculiar character, however, 
because the different molecular species all have the formula 
(H20)., where zx is an integer, and these species are, moreover, all 
in chemical equilibrium (I, 10) with one another, the equilibrium 
being established so rapidly that we are unable to separate any 
one of the molecular species from the others. Chemically, there- 
fore, and in many ways physically also, water behaves as it 
would if it contained only the molecular species, H2O, and is for 
this reason commonly spoken of as a “‘pure substance.” Re- 
garded as a solution, water is considered to be made up of the 
substances hydrol, H,O, dihydrol (H2O)s, trihydrol (H2O);, 
etc., no one of which, however, has as yet been obtained in the 
pure condition, at least not as a liquid. Owing to the fact that 
in so many ways an equilibrium mixture, such as water, resem- 
bles a pure substance in its behavior, it is convenient to class 
1 The term “true” solution is used here because of the existence of the 
class of systems to which the name “colloidal solutions” has been given. 
These systems consist of one phase very highly dispersed in another and 
occupy a position intermediate between homogeneous mixtures (“true” 
solutions) on the one hand and the ordinary heterogeneous systems on the 
other. They have already been discussed to some extent in Chapter IX. 
and will be further considered in Chapter XXV.

146 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuap. XI 
such mixtures with pure substances for many purposes and for 
this reason the term associated substance, rather than the term 
solution, is usually applied to them. The expression “pure 
water” can, therefore, be employed, if we agree to understand 
thereby an equilibrium mixture of molecules all of which have 
the formula (H2O)., where z is an integer, and in which the equi- 
librium responds so rapidly to changing conditions (temperature, 
pressure, etc.) that it may be regarded as establishing itself 
practically instantaneously? at each moment. 
3. Classification of Solutions——For purposes of systematic 
treatment solutions are most conveniently classified, according to 
their state of aggregation, as gaseous solutions, liquid solutions, 
and crystalline solutions. 
(a) Gaseous Solutions.—Gascous solutions furnish the sim- 
plest example of solutions, since the molecules are here so far 
apart that they are comparatively without influence upon one 
another. Owing to this fact many of the physical properties of 
mixtures of perfect gases are strictly additive (VIII, 3), that is, 
a molal physical property for a mixture of gases may be cal- 
culated by means of the relation, 
Y = Yata t YptRt . . . - Yntny (1) 
where y is the molal property in question (e.g., molal volume, 
molal heat capacity, or molal (molecular) refractivity) for the 
mixture and ya, yp, etc., are the corresponding molal properties 
for the pure constituents of the mixture, x4, rp, etc., being their 
mole fractions in the mixture. Equation (1) is an expression of 
the so-called law of mixtures. It will be noticed that Dalton’s 
law of partial pressures (II, 6) for gaseous mixtures has the same 
form as the above equation. 
Problem 1.—Two tubes, 10 mm. in diameter, are placed side by side so 
that white light of a constant and uniform intensity illuminates them 
lengthwise. The first tube is 50 mm. long and is filled with iodine vapor 
(Iz) under a pressure of 0.06 atmosphere. The second tube is 500 mm. long 
2 Numerous other liquids in which there exists a chemical equilibrium 
which responds very rapidly to changes in external conditions behave in 
many ways as though they were pure substances, and for many purposes 
may advantageously be classified as such. The numerous tautomeric 
substances familiar to the organic chemist are good examples of such 
systems.
-P-A-G-E-175
Sec. 3] DEFINITION OF TERMS 147 
and is filled with a gaseous mixture of hydrogen (Hz) and iodine (Iz) under 
a pressure of 0.06 atmosphere. Both tubes are at a temperature of 100° and 
when compared with each other are found to show the same shade and in- 
tensity of violet color when viewed lengthwise toward the source of white 
light. Calculate the concentration (in moles of I, per liter) of the iodine in 
the second tube. 
Owing to the comparatively large distances between the mole- 
cules of gases and the consequent lack of influence of one molecule 
upon another, no energy change occurs when any two perfect 
gases are mixed together in the same volume, provided that they 
do not react chemically with each other. This is made evident 
by the absence of any temperature change when two such gases 
are mixed together. Similarly when a perfect gas is allowed to 
expand into a vacuum there is no change in its temperature. 
These statements do not hold for gases under high pressures, 
however, for here very pronounced energy changes (heat effects) 
occur when expansion or mixing takes place. We shall have 
occasion to consider such energy changes in a later chapter. 
In the case of gaseous mixtures at such high pressures or at 
such low temperatures that the perfect gas laws do not apply 
with a sufficient degree of accuracy, modifications of these laws 
along lines similar to those followed by van der Waals or Berthe- 
lot in their treatment of pure gases (II, 10) are usually employed. 
We shall not consider them further in this book. 
(b) Crystalline Solutions.—The subject of crystalline solu- 
tions, or mixed crystals, has been briefly referred to in a previous 
chapter (V, 4). Owing to the restricted nature of molecular 
motion in crystals and the high viscosity of this state of aggrega- 
tion, crystalline solutions in a state of equilibrium are seldom met 
with in practice, because the attainment of equilibrium in a 
reasonable length of time is so frequently prevented by the 
restraints upon the free movements of the molecules. (Cf. V, 3.) 
For this reason crystalline solutions, as usually met with in prac- 
tice, are not amenable to the same methods of treatment as are 
nearly all gaseous and liquid solutions. This same statement 
frequently holds true also, and for a similar reason, for the glasses 
(VII, 3), which represent one type of liquid solutions. The dis- 
cussion of such cases of crystalline solutions as may be treated 
as systems in thermodynamic equilibrium will be taken up in 
connection with the chapter on the Phase Rule (XXIV, 12).
-P-A-G-E-176
148 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuap. XI 
(c) Liquid Solutions.—The most interesting zroup of solutions 
to the chemist is the class of liquid solutions, because by far the 
greater portion of the processes of the chemist are carried out 
in such solutions and because they play such a predominant and 
important réle in natural processes. For these reasons liquid 
solutions have been and continue to be the subject of the most 
careful study, and the discovery of laws and the establishment of 
satisfactory theories for the interpretation of many of the proc- 
esses occurring in such solutions has been one of the chief tri- 
umphs of modern physical chemistry. In the following chapters 
dealing with the subject of solutions we shall, therefore, restrict 
ourselves to the class of liquid solutions. 
4. The Constituents of a Solution. Solvent and Solute.— 
When crystals of some substance, such as sugar, are treated with 
water, the crystals are observed to gradually dissolve or disappear 
and a homogeneous system consisting of sugar and water is 
eventually obtained. Such a solution is commonly spoken of 
as a solution of sugar in water and is by some chemists regarded 
as having been formed owing to some specific solvent or dissolving 
action exerted by the water upon the sugar. For this reason the 
water is commonly called the solvent, and the sugar, the dissolved 
substance or the solute. It would be quite as correct, however, 
to look upon the solution as a solution of water in sugar and, as 
a matter of fact, it could be prepared by dissolving water in liquid 
sugar, if it were desired to doso. The sugar might then be called 
the solvent and water the dissolved substance or the solute. 
Similarly, if a little water (either as a liquid, or in the form of ice 
or steam) is “‘dissolved”’ in alcohol, a solution of water in alcohol 
is obtained. Exactly the same solution might be prepared, how- 
ever, by ‘‘dissolving”’ alcohol (either solid, liquid, or gaseous) in 
water. The nature of the solution thus obtained is entirely 
independent of the method of its preparation, and the designation 
of one constituent as the solvent and the other as the solute, on 
the above basis, is an entirely artificial and arbitrary, not to say 
confusing, distinction. A better and more general method of 
distinguishing the constituents of a solution is simply to refer 
to them as constituent A, constituent B, etc., and this is the 
method which will be usually employed in this book. The terms 
solvent and solute will be employed chiefly in the treatment of
-P-A-G-E-177
Suc. 5] DEFINITION OF TERMS 149 
an important class of solutions known as “dilute solutions,” 
that is, solutions in which the amount of one constituent is much 
greater than that of all the other constituents together. For 
such solutions the term solvent will be employed to designate 
the constituent which predominates in the solution, without 
however implying thereby that this constituent exercises any 
specific solvent power upon the others. The other constituents 
will be called the solutes. The method of designation is in 
accordance with common usage but its purely conventional 
character should not be forgotten.’ 
The following general treatment of the subject of solutions will 
for simplicity be restricted, in most cases, to solutions made up 
of only two constituents which will be designated either as A 
and B, or as solvent and solute, respectively. The relations and 
laws which we shall derive can, however, be readily extended to 
solutions containing any number of components. Moreover, 
since any substance A, in the liquid state, can be regarded as a 
limiting case of a solution of B in A in which the amount of B 
has become zero, pure liquids may be treated as special limiting 
cases under the subject of solutions and will be in certain cases 
included in our treatment of the subject. 
5. Methods for Expressing the Composition of Solutions.— 
The composition of a solution is frequently given in terms of 
percentages (i.e., grams in 100 grams of solution) of its various 
constituents. In what follows we shall, however, usually express 
the composition of the solution in terms of the mole fractions 
(II, 6) of its different components. Thus, if a solution is 
composed of N, moles of A and N, moles of B, the mole fraction 
of A will be z, = Paes and that of B will be a, = mS Ny 
(II, 6) and hence,   
x, + % = unity (2) 
8 The common expression, ‘‘ Water is the universal solvent,” means that 
a large number of substances are able to become molecularly dispersed in 
water and that water occurs in large quantities in nature. The ability of 
two substances to become molecularly dispersed in each other is a recipro- 
cal relationship, not a one-sided property as the expression “solvent power” 
might be taken to indicate, 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
150 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuav. XI 
Problem 2.—Calculate the two mole fractions for each of the following 
solutions: 10 grams of water (H2O) and 3 grams of alcohol (C:H;OH); 8 
grams of benzene (CsH,) and 1 milligram of diphenyl (Ci2H10); a 10 per 
cent. solution of sugar (Ci2H2201:) in water. 
Similarly, if we wish to express the composition of the solution in 
terms of its molecular components rather than its constituents 
(XI, 1) the same system will be employed on the basis of molecular 
Na Ns 
My + tes na + Ns 
represent the numbers of molecules of the molecular species A, 
B, etc., which are present in the solution. In many cases the mole 
fraction of a substance in a solution will be identical with the 
molecular fraction of the corresponding molecular species. This 
will of course always be the case when each substance in the 
solution has only one molecular species corresponding to it. 
Thus in a solution composed of benzene and toluene the mole 
fraction of the substance, benzene (molal weight=78), in the 
solution is identical with the molecular fraction of the molecular 
species, CsH.; but in a solution composed of water and alcohol 
the mole fraction of the substance, water (molal weight = 18), will 
not be identical with the molecular fraction of the molecular 
species, H,O, because there is in the solution more than one mo- 
lecular species corresponding to the substance, water. Mole 
fraction and molecular fraction will both be represented by the 
same symbol, x, and whenever it is necessary to distinguish be- 
tween them this will be done in the context. 
A common method of expressing the composition, especially of 
dilute solutions, is in terms of concentration. By the concentra- 
tion, C, of any substance in a solution is meant the quantity of 
the substance per unit volume of solution. Thismay be expressed 
either as (1) moles, (2) formula weights, or (3) equivalent weights 
of the substance per liter of solution (I, 8). The terms(1) 
molal, (2) formal, and (3) normal, are used correspondingly to 
indicate the strength of the solution. Thus a solution containing 
20.829 grams (i.e., 0.1 of (1387.37+2X35.46)) of barium chlo- 
ride, BaCly.per liter is said to be 0.1 molal, 0.1 formal, and 0.2 
equivalent or 0.2 normal with respect to barium chloride. Some- 
times 1000 grams of solvent is made the basis for expressing the 
concentration of the solution instead of 1000 c.c. of solution. fractions, 1, = tp = » etc., where n,, Mp, ete., 
 
-P-A-G-E-179

Concentrations expressed on this basis are termed weight concen- 
trations to distinguish them from the volume concentrations 
defined above. For the same reason the terms weight-molal, 
weight-formal, and weight-normal are correspondingly employed. 
Weight concentrations can be readily calculated from volume 
concentrations or vice versa, if the density of the solution is known. 
Problem 3.—A solution of density, D, is 1/n-weight formal with respect 
to a substance whose formula weight is M. Show that its volume concen-

What is its volume-formal concentration? 
Problem 5.—Calculate the molal concentration of aleohol (C2H;OH) in 
a 5 per cent. solution of it in water. The density of the solution at 20° is 
0.98936. Calculate also its weight-molal concentration and the mole frac- 
tion of the water (H2O) in the solution. 
Problem 6.—A 0.25 formal aqueous solution of H2SO, has at 15° a den- 
sity of 1.016. What per cent. of sulphuric acid does it contain? What 
is its volume normality with respect to sulphuric acid? tration in formula weights per liter is 
6. Vapor Pressure.—The vapor pressure, p, of a solution is 
equal to the sum of the partial vapor pressures of its constituents, 
or 
(ae OK ar 10 oP eee se (3) 
7. Boiling Point.—The boiling point of a solution is defined as 
the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the solution is 
equal to the total pressure upon it. (Cf. IV, 3.) 
8. Freezing Point.—A solution has in general as many freezing 
points as there are substances in the solution which are able to 
separate out as pure crystals. The freezing point of a given 
solution is the temperature at which the solution is in equilibrium 
with the pure crystals of one of its constituents. (Cf. VII, 1.) 
The nature of the crystalline phase must, therefore, always be 
stated except in the case of dilute solutions, where by general 
agreement, unless otherwise specified, the freezing point is under- 
stood to be the temperature at which the solution isin equilibrium 
with pure crystals of the constituent which is designated as the 
solvent.

SOLUTIONS II: THE COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF 
SOLUTIONS AND THE THERMODYNAMIC 
RELATIONS WHICH CONNECT THEM 
1. Vapor Pressure and Temperature.—We have already noted 
(IV, 3) that the vapor pressure of a substance always increases 
with rise in temperature. In the case of any pure liquid or of 
any constituent of a solution under a constant external pressure, 
P (that of the atmosphere, for example), the rate of increase of 
the vapor pressure with rise in temperature is indicated mathe- 
matically by the partial differential coefficient, (2%) The Piz 
subscripts (in this case P and 2) indicate variables which are con- 
stant for the process under consideration. ‘The above mathemat- 
ical expression stated in words would be read as follows: the 
temperature rate of change of the vapor pressure of a pure sub- 
stance (or of the partial vapor pressure of any constituent of a 
solution in which the mole fraction of the constituent is x) under 
constant external pressure, P; or more briefly, the partial of p 
with respect to 7’, P and x constant. 
It can be shown that the Second Law of Thermodynamics 
leads to the following exact expression for this differential coeffi- 
cient:

If the substance is under its own vapor pressure at all tempera- 
tures, instead of under a constant external pressure, equations 
(1) and (1a) have the form 
(Ge L

where Vo is the molal volume of the liquid (or crystals) at the 
pressure P and temperature T. This is known as the Clausius- 
Clapeyron? equation. Except in the neighborhood of the critical 
point, Vo is usually so small in comparison with vo that it may be 
neglected and then equation (2) takes the form of equation (1), 
that is, equation (1), which is rigorously exact if P is constant, 
is also approximately correct for many cases where P = p. 
Problem 1.—In order to integrate equation (1) or (1a) it is first necessary 
to express L and v, as functions of one of the variables. If the vapor obeys 
the perfect gas law and if L is a constant with respect to variations in 7, 
show that the integral of the above equations has the form,

tween 3000° and 3500° absolute. Calculate also the normal sublimation 
point of tungsten. (See Prob. 2, VI.) 
2. Variation of Boiling Point with External Pressure on: the

nal pressure, P, for any liquid are equal to each other at the boil-

3. Effect of Pressure upon Vapor Pressure.—If the pressure 
upon any pure substance in the liquid (or crystalline) state be 
increased, the vapor pressure of the substance also increases, the 
quantitative thermodynamic relation between the two being 
expressed by the equation,

also holds for the effect of pressure upon the partial vapor pres-

volume of A in the mixture, is equal to the increase in the volume 
of an infinite amount of the solution, which takes place when one 
mole of the substance, A, is added to it. 
4, Vapor Pressure Lowering.—If to any pure liquid, A, having 
the vapor pressure, po, we add some substance which forms a

Suc. 5] COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS 155 
solution with it, it can be shown both from molecular kinetics 
and from the Second Law of Thermodynamics that the vapor 
pressure of A is thereby lowered. In other words, the partial 
vapor pressure of any substance from a solution is always lower 
than its vapor pressure in the pure state. The vapor pressure 
lowering, Ap, is defined by the equation, 
  Ap = po — p (9) 
and a quantity called the relative vapor pressure lowering is 
a A : defined as eo ze where po is the vapor pressure of the sub- 0 0 
stance as a pure liquid and p its partial vapor pressure from the 
solution, both being at the same temperature, 7’, and under the 
same external pressure, P. 
5, Elevation of the Boiling Point.— 
Problem 4.—From what had just been said regarding the lowering of 
vapor pressure which occurs when one substance is dissolved in another, 
show that the following statement must also be true: The boiling point of 
a liquid is always raised by dissolving in it any substance whose own vapor 
pressure is negligibly small. 
The elevation of the boiling point, or the boiling point raising 
as it is also called, is defined by the equation, 
Sere ls (10) 
where 7’; is the boiling point of the solution and 7';, that of the 
pure liquid, both boiling points being of course for the same pres- 
sure. If the other constituent of the solution has an appreciable 
vapor pressure of its own, the boiling point is not necessarily 
raised when the solution is formed but may even be lowered, if 
the other constituent is a very volatile substance. This occurs, 
for example, when ether is dissolved in alcohol. 
6. Freezing Point Lowering.—We have already seen (X, 10) 
that at the freezing point of a pure liquid the liquid has the same 
vapor pressure as the crystals with which it is in equilibrium. 
If to such a system a second substance is added which dissolves 
in the liquid, but not in the crystals, the vapor pressure of the 
liquid is thereby lowered and it will no longer be in equilibrium 
with the crystalline phase. The crystals, since they now have 
the higher vapor pressure, will tend to pass over into the solution
-P-A-G-E-184
156 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XII 
which, if the two are in contact, they can do simply by melting. 
The process of melting is, however, attended by an absorption of 
heat (VII, 2), and consequently the whole system will cool down 
until some temperature is reached where the vapor pressure of 
the substance in the crystalline state is again the same as its 
partial vapor pressure from the solution and hence the two phases 
become once more in equilibrium with each other. That such 
a temperature will be reached can be demonstrated thermody- 
namically and can also be seen from a study of Fig. 25. This 
temperature we have already defined (XI, 8) asthe freezing point 
of the solution and the freezing point of a liquid is, therefore, 
evidently always lowered by dissolving another substance in it. 
The freezing point lowering is defined by the equation, 
ATy = Ty, — Tr (11) 
where 7, is the freezing point of the pure liquid and Tp that of 
the solution.

7. Osmotic Pressure and Osmosis.—Consider two vessels 
placed side by side under a bell-jar as shown in Fig. 26. Let 
vessel number 1 contain any solution, made up of any number 
of constituents, A, B, C, etc., and let vessel number 2 contain 
any one of these constituents, A for example, in the form of a

Sec. 7] COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS 157 
pure liquid.!_ The partial vapor pressure of A from the first ves- 
sel is less than its vapor pressure from the second vessel (XII, 4) 
and hence there will be a tendency for the substance, A, to pass 
over from the pure liquid state (vessel 2) into the solution (vessel 
1) which it might do by distillation, forexample. Now as ex- 
plained above (XII, 1) the vapor pressure of A from the two

vessels could be made the same either by raising the temperature 
of the solution or by lowering that of the pure liquid, the total 
pressure on both remaining the same. Or, the two vapor 
pressures might also be made the same by keeping the tem- 
perature of both vessels constant but varying the total pressure 
on one of them, 7.e., by increasing the total pressure on the 
1In the most general case vessel number 2 might contain constituent A, 
dissolved in some other pure liquid to form a solution of any stipulated 
strength. This other pure liquid would, in such a case, serve simply as a 
standard reference liquid and for theoretical purposes might be some wholly 
hypothetical liquid, endowed with any desired properties. Unless a standard 
reference liquid of some kind is specified, however, the constituent in question 
is usually considered as present in the pure liquid state in the second vessel, 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
158 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuapv. XII 
solution or by decreasing the total pressure on the pure liquid 
(XI, 3). 
The difference in the total pressures upon the two vessels 
which is just sufficient to produce equality in the vapor pressures 
of A from both vessels is called the osmotic pressure of the solu- 
tion with reference to constituent A and will be indicated by the 
symbol, Il, In order to completely define this pressure differ- 
ence, the actual pressures on the two vessels must also be speci- 
fied. Unless otherwise stated, therefore, we shall define the 
osmotic pressure, II,, by the equation, 
Ty =P) Be (12) 
where P, is the pressure on the pure liquid, A, and P that on the 
solution, when A has the same vapor pressure? from both, and 
unless otherwise specified P will always be understood to be one 
atmosphere. 
Problem 5.—Show by a method of reasoning similar to that employed in 
X, 10, that if a pure liquid, A, be separated from a solution containing it 
by a membrane which is permeable only to molecules of A, then A will pass 
through the membrane into the solution, if the solution and the pure liquid 
are both at the same temperature and pressure; but that if the pressure 
difference I, (as just defined) be established on the two liquids, then there 
will no longer be any tendency for A to pass through the membrane into the 
solution. 
The passage of a liquid through such a membrane (called a 
semipermeable membrane) is termed osmosis. Semipermeable 
membranes are found in all animal and vegetable organisms and 
osmosis plays a very important réle in physiological processes. 
2 More generally stated the definition of I, would be I,= P — Py, 
where Py, is the pressure on the pure liquid, A, and P that on the solution 
when A has the same escaping tendency from both. The vapor pressure of 
the molecules of the substance, A, from any phase or system containing it is 
only one of the many ways in which this escaping tendency may manifest 
itself. It is one which is very readily visualized by the student, however, 
and for that reason we shall employ it freqeuntly. Increase of pressure upon 
a liquid not only increases its vapor pressure, that is, its tendency to escape 
into the vapor phase, but it also increases its tendency to escape into any 
other condition whatsoever, as can be readily shown by purely thermody- 
namic reasoning. While, therefore, the concept of escaping tendency in 
general is a more abstract method of expression, we shall for the present 
employ instead the more concrete concept of its manifestation as a vapor 
pressure, 
   
-P-A-G-E-187
  Sec. 7] COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS 159 
The molecular kinetic interpretation of the process of osmosis 
will be discussed later. The phenomenon of osmosis can be 
easily demonstrated as a lecture experiment by tying a piece of 
gold beater’s skin over the mouth of a thistle tube, filling the 
tube with a strong solution of sugar colored with a little cochi- 
neal and then immersing the inverted tube in a beaker of water, 
as shown in Fig. 27. The gold beater’s skin acts as a semi- 
permeable membrane permitting water to pass through it readily 
but not sugar. Water, therefore, passes through the membrane 
into the sugar solution and dilutes it, causing the volume to 
increase and the level of the solution in the tube to rise. The 
weight of the column of solution above the membrane and hence, 
therefore, the pressure upon the layer of solution next the mem- 
brane gradually increases and with a properly prepared mem- 
brane osmosis will continue until the resulting pressure becomes 
so great that the tendency of the water to pass through the 
membrane into the solution is just equal to its tendency to 
pass in the opposite direction, and consequently the rates of os- 
mosis in the two directions balance each other and the column 
of liquid in the thistle tube ceases to rise. When this condition 
is reached the weight of liquid above the semipermeable mem- 
brane is a measure of the osmotic pressure of the sugar solution, 
with reference to the constituent, water. 
This particular osmotic pressure, II’,, however, is obviously 
defined by the equation, 
I’, = P — P, = (P — 1) atmos. (18) 
where P is the pressure upon the layer of solution next to the semi- 
permeable membrane. It is the osmotic pressure as defined by 
equation (13) rather than that defined by equation (12) which is 
usually obtained in direct osmotic pressure measurements. That 
is, it is the pressure difference necessary to establish equilibrium 
when the pure liquid (instead of the solution) is under atmospheric 
pressure. Either osmotic pressure II, or II’, may, however, be 
thermodynamically calculated, if the other is known, and in the 
case of aqueous sugar solutions of moderate concentrations the 
two osmotic pressures are practically identical. The one defined 
by equation (12) is, however, in general a simpler one to employ 
than is the one defined by equation (13).
-P-A-G-E-188
  160 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cnav. XII 
In direct osmotic pressure measurements with aqueous solu- 
tions the membrane employed is usually a film of cupric ferro- 
cyanide deposited in the pores of a porous earthern cup. Direct 
measurements of osmotic pressure are difficult to carry out, how- 
ever, and have thus far been accurately made only in the case of 
a few aqueous solutions. The osmotic pressure of any solution 
can be calculated thermodynamically, however, from the freez- 
ing point or from the vapor pressure of the solution and this is, 
in the majority of cases, the most reliable as well as the most con- 
venient method to employ in case one desires to know the osmotic 
pressure of any solution. The réle played by osmotic pressure 
in the theory of solutions is of such a nature, however, that the 
knowledge of the numerical value of the osmotic pressure of any 
solution is seldom of much importance. Osmotic pressure is 
chiefly of value simply as a concept by means of which some of 
the processes employed in the derivations of the laws of solution 
may be conveniently visualized. Historically, however, it has 
played and to many chemists of the present day still plays an 
important réle in solution theory, chiefly owing to some popular 
misconceptions as to its nature and the analogy between it and 
gas pressure, as will be explained further in Chapter XIV. For 
this reason more space will be given to the discussion of osmotic 
pressure than would be justified by its actual importance in the 
theory of solutions. 
8. The Thermodynamic Relations Connecting the Colligative 
Properties of a Solution.—The magnitudes of the vapor pressure 
lowering, the boiling point raising, the freezing point lowering, 
the osmotic pressure, and certain other allied properties of a 
solution depend in general upon the molal composition of the solu- 
tion and upon the natures of its constituents. But in the case of 
an important class of solutions which will be discussed in the next 
chapter, the magnitude of these quantities for one constituent 
of the solution depends only upon the nature of this constituent 
and upon its mole fraction in the solution and not at all upon the 
natures of the other components of the solution nor the relative 
amounts of them present. 
Now although, in general, the magnitude of any one of these 
quantities depends both upon the composition of the solution and 
the natures of its constituents, the relation between any two prop-
-P-A-G-E-189
  
Sec. 8] COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS 161 
erties for any constituent of any given solution depends only 
upon the nature of this constituent and not at all upon the mole 
fraction of the constituent in the solution nor upon the number 
or natures of the other constituents of the solution. Thus, for 
example, the relation connecting the partial vapor pressure of 
any constituent, A, of a solution with its osmotic pressure does 
not depend in any way upon the per cent. of A in the solution 
por upon the number, amounts, or natures of the other substances 
in the solution. For these reasons the properties mentioned are 
called the colligative properties of the solution. 
The exact and general relations which connect the colligative 
properties of a solution with one another can be easily derived* 
from the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics without any 
additional assumptions. Relations of this character, that is, 
relations which are necessary consequences of the two laws of 
energy alone, will be referred to as ‘purely thermodynamic 
relations.” We shall not stop here to explain further the details 
of the derivations of these relations but will simply state a few 
of them, using the nomenclature already employed.

erence to the same constituent, A: 
Opa L.

where L, is the molal heat of sublimation (VI, 3) of the pure con- 
stituent at the pressure P, and the temperature 7'r, and vo is the 
molal volume of its vapor at the pressure ps, and the tempera- 
ture, Tp. i

ture T, and the pressure 1—II4, and vo the molal volume of the 
vapor at the pressure p, and the temperature 7. 
(c) Vapor pressure and boiling point, 7',: Since in this case by 
definition (XI, 7) p =P, the relation is simply equation (1) 
above, which may be written:

where So, the molal adsorption surface for A is that surface area 
which contains one mole of A in excess of the amount necessary 
to make the mole fraction of A in the surface equal to its mole 
fraction in the interior of the solution, whence g, must evidently 
be the number of moles of A adsorbed by unit area of the surface. 
The derivations of all of the above relations are given in the 
Appendix. 
To these relations might be added many others, but the state- 
ment of additional ones will be deferred until they are needed. 
It will be noticed that none of the above equations contains any 
quantity which is in any way dependent upon the amount of the 
substance, A, present in the solution or upon the number, nature, 
or amounts of the other constituents of the solution. 
There is, however, for every solution, a set of relations which 
connects each of the colligative properties of the solution with 
the nature of its constituents and its molal composition. This 
set of relations we shall call the “Laws of the Solution.” It is 
evident, from what has just been said, that in order to deduce 
the complete set of these laws for any given solution, it is neces- 
sary to have only one of the laws as a starting point, for all of the 
others can then be obtained by combining this one law with the 
purely thermodynamic relations discussed above. As our start- 
ing point in deducing the Laws of Solutions we shall employ the 
law connecting the partial vapor pressure of any constituent of 
a solution with its mole fraction in the solution.

See Ref. 3 for the integrations of equations (14) to (17).     
9. The Fundamental Vapor Pressure Law.—If in a solution 
having the two molecular components, A and B, the molecular 
fraction of A be increased from 2, to x, + da,, the corresponding 
increase, dp,, in its partial vapor pressure, p,, is given by the 
expression, 
dp, = £,(T.E.)da, (20) 
and similarly for component B, 
dp, = {,(7.2.)dz, (21) 
the temperature and total pressure being constant; or stated in 
words, when the molecular fraction of any component of a solu- 
tion is increased by a very small amount, dx, the corresponding 
increase, dp, in its partial vapor pressure above the solution is 
equal to dz multiplied by a quantity which is a function of the 
thermodynamic environment (see XIII, 1) which prevails in 
the interior of the solution. It is evident that in order to inte- 
grate equation (20) it is first necessary to know the form of the 
function, f,(7.£.). The form of this function and the values of 
its parameters will in general be determined by the number, 
nature and relative proportions of the different constituents of 
the solution, and since in general these may be of the most va- 
ried character it is not possible, except by setting up largely 
empirical equations,* to obtain an evaluation of f, (7.£.) which 
will hold for all possible types of solutions. A better procedure is 
to classify solutions, as far as possible, with reference to this 
point, and then to seck an evaluation of f, (7.E.} for each class. 
As our knowledge of solutions has progressed we have come to 
¢The student who examines the literature of the thermodynamics of 
solution theory will find what sometimes purport to be more general or 
fundamental forms of expressing the relation between fugacity and com- 
position.4 These relations usually take a form equivalent to the following:

where f(t,, tg . . ., P, T), an unknown function of the composition of

recognize two large groups or classes of solutions for which it is 
possible to evaluate this function in a satisfactory manner, or in 
other words, for which it is possible to construct more or less 
complete and satisfactory systems of laws and theories. These 
two classes may be called, respectively, (1) Solutions of Constant 
Thermodynamic Environment and (2) Solutions whose Thermo- 
dynamic Environment is a Function of the Ion concentration. 
We shall restrict our consideration of the Theories of Solution to 
these two classes and in building up the system of laws for each 
class we shall follow the logical rather than the historical method 
of development, as our main purpose will be to present as clear 
and complete a picture as possible of the present condition of 
our systematized knowledge of solutions rather than to trace 
the stages by which this condition has been reached. The his- 
torical aspects of the subject are very thoroughly treated in 
Walden’s, “Die Lésungstheorien in Ihrer Geschichtlichen Auf- 
einanderfolge,’”’ 1910.

the solution the pressure and temperature, will by some writers be form- 
ulated as power series with various undetermined coefficients. This 
method of formulation is neither more nor less general than our equation 
20 and amounts to nothing more than a mathematical method of saying 
what has been said above in words. 
If in any specific case the function, f(7.Z.), can be evaluated in any 
convenient form with numerical parameters, then for that case it will be 
evident that we can carry through the derivation of a set of solution laws 
in a manner entirely analogous to the derivations given in the following 
pages. Since, however, in general this function and its parameters will 
depend very largely upon the class of solutions under consideration and is 
in general unknown, it seems purposeless to take the time and space to carry 
along through all subsequent derivations the mathematical statement 
that the thermodynamic environment depends upon the temperature, 
pressure, nature of the molecular species, etc., especially if by such a pro- 
cedure we are in any danger of deceiving ourselves with the idea that we 
are obtaining a more general theory of solutions.

CHAPTER XIII 
SOLUTIONS III: THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. 
IDEAL SOLUTIONS AND DILUTE SOLUTIONS 
1. Thermodynamic Environment.—Consider the two liquids, 
mercury, Hg, and benzene, CsHe, two substances which in their 
chemical and physical properties are widely different from each 
other. If we shake these two liquids together in a test-tube we 
find that neither substance will dissolve in the other to an appre- 
ciable extent. Instead, we obtain two liquid layers, one of which 
is practically pure mercury and the other practically pure ben- 
zene. The two species of molecules, Hg and CyHg, have scarcely 
any attraction for each other and refuse to intermingle. In 
other words, the substance mercury is not capable of existing 
in a molecularly dispersed state (XI, 1) under the conditions 
which prevail in liquid benzene, nor, on the other hand, are 
benzene molecules able to exist in the molecularly dispersed state 
in surroundings containing mercury molecules. This inability 
of these two liquids to mix with each other is closely connected 
with the great chemical and physical differences between them. 
Suppose now that we replace the mercury by water [HO 
+ (H20)2 + (H20)3 + . . . J, a liquid whose molecules resem- 
ble those of benzene more closely than mercury molecules do, 
and consequently (I, 2) one which in its physical and chemical 
properties is more like benzene than mercury is. On shaking 
water and benzene together we obtain, just as: before, two liquid 
layers, a water layer below and a benzene layer above. On care- 
ful examination, however, we would find that the water layer con- 
tains a little benzene (about 0.1 per cent.) dissolved in it and that 
the benzene layer contains a little water (about 0.03 per cent.) 
dissolved in it. These two liquids are able, therefore, to mix 
with each other to a very slight but quite appreciable extent. 
In other words, an appreciable quantity of water is capable of 
existing in the molecularly dispersed state in an environment 
165
-P-A-G-E-194
  166 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuav. XIII 
which is made up almost entirely of benzene molecules and simi- 
larly an appreciable quantity of benzene is able to exist in the 
molecularly dispersed condition in an environment made up 
almost entirely of water molecules. 
Let us now take a third liquid, ethyl alcohol, which resembles 
benzene even more closely than doeswater. If we shake benzene, 
C.H,, and alcohol, C2H,O, together we find that we always obtain 
a homogeneous system whatever be the relative amounts of 
benzene and of alcohol taken, that is, these two liquids are 
miscible with each other in all proportions. The attractive 
forces of alcohol molecule for alcohol molecule, benzene molecule 
for benzene molecule, and alcohol molecule for benzene molecule 
are so related that when we pour alcohol into benzene the alcohol 
molecules intermingle with those of benzene and continue to do 
so in whatever numbers they are added ‘The first molecules of 
alcohol which enter the benzene find themselves surrounded by 
benzene molecules only. As the amount of alcohol is increased 
the nature of the medium surrounding any given alcohol or benzene 
molecule changes gradually from one composed almost entirely 
of benzene molecules to one in which the proportion of alcohol 
molecules gradually increases until finally the medium surround- 
ing any given alcohol molecule or benzene molecule is composed 
almost entirely of alcohol molecules. 
Now the tendency of a given molecule to escape from a solution 
containing it depends upon the conditions which prevail within 
that particular solution. The molecule is subject to the action 
of various attractive and repulsive forces as well as to collisions 
from the molecules which surround it and the sum total of all 
these environmental influences determines the magnitude of 
the escaping tendency of the molecule in question. An attempt 
to analyze further the nature of these environmental influences 
would in the present state of our knowledge be largely speculative 
and would have no particular value. It is, however, important 
to recognize the existence of these influences and their general 
character, and it will be convenient to have a name to designate 
the sum total of these effects. The nature of the medium sur- 
rounding any given molecular species in a solution will, therefore, 
be called the thermodynamic environment of this molecular 
species. The thermodynamic environment which prevails within 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
Sec. 1] THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 167 
a solution depends, in general upon the relative numbers and the 
kinds of molecules which make up the solution and upon the tem- 
perature and the pressure.! 
When the two molecular species which make up the solution 
are very different in character the thermodynamic environment 
prevailing within the solution will be so different from that which 
prevails within one of the two pure liquids, that a separation into 
two liquid layers will occur when the proportions of the two con- 
stituents reach certain values which are determined by the nature 
of the constituents and by the temperature and the pressure. 
Thus when we add water to benzene the water molecules inter- 
mingle at first with those of the benzene, forming a solution which 
has a thermodynamic environment practically the same as that 
which prevails in pure benzene. When the concentration of the 
water molecules reaches a certain value, however (which depends 
upon the temperature and the pressure), any further molecules of 
water added will not go into solution, since for concentrations 
higher than this value the mutual attractions of water molecule 
for water molecule become so great that any excess of water 
separates out as a new liquid layer, having a decidedly different 
thermodynamic environment. 
In the case of alcohol and benzene which mix with each other 
in all proportions the two molecular species display many 
differences in both physical and chemical properties and the 
thermodynamic environments in the two pure liquids are prob- 
ably quite appreciably different from each other, sothat when 
alcohol is poured into benzene, the thermodynamic environment 
in the solution changes gradually from that which prevails in 
pure benzene to that which prevails in pure alcohol, but the total 
change in this instance is not so great but that both species of 
molecules are able to adapt themselves to it and hence do not 
find it necessary to form two distinct liquid layers possessing 
different thermodynamic environments. 
To recapitulate, therefore, if molecules of a liquid, A, be in- 
troduced into a pure liquid, B, they intermingle with those of 
B, forming a solution. As the concentration of the A molecules 
1 And in some special cases, which will not be considered here, upon the 
amount and kind of light with which the solution is illuminated and upon 
the magnetic and electric condition of its surroundings,
-P-A-G-E-196
    168 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuap. XIII 
increases, two tendencies become manifest. First, the mutual 
attractions among the A molecules increase owing to the fact 
that these molecules are getting closer together as their con- 
centration increases and as a result of this greater attraction there 
is a tendency for these molecules to collect together and to form 
themselves (together with some B molecules) into a second liquid 
layer having a different thermodynamic environment from the 
solution. 
Opposed to this tendency toward separation and formation of 
a new thermodynamic environment is the fact that the increasing 
numbers of A molecules by their very presence in the solution 
are changing the thermodynamic environment of the solution 
and are making it more like that which would exist in the layer 
which tends to be formed by the mutual attractions of the A 
molecules. This naturally results in lessening the tendency of 
the A molecules to separate and form a second phase. When 
the two molecular species are greatly different from each other 
the first of these tendencies is likely to prove the stronger and two 
liquid layers are formed. The more nearly the two species of 
molecules resemble each other the greater will be the second 
tendency and when they are sufficiently alike the second tend- 
ency will predominate and the two substances will mix in all 
proportions. 
Unless the two molecular species resemble each other very 
closely, however, the process of mixing is accompanied by quite 
an appreciable variation in thermodynamic environment in pass- 
ing from one pure liquid through the series of mixtures to the 
other pure liquid, and although the two molecular species may be 
able to adapt themselves to the new thermodynamic environment 
and remain in solution together, this adaptation will in general be 
accompanied by external evidences in the way of heat effects 
(evolution or absorption of heat) and volume changes (expansion 
or contraction) which take place when the two liquids are mixed 
together. The magnitudes of these effects may be taken as a 
rough indication of the extent of the change in thermodynamic 
environment, in all cases where the process of mixing consists 
simply in the intermingling of the two molecular species and is 
not accompanied by chemical reactions. Thus when one mole 
of benzene is poured into a very large quantity of alcohol the
-P-A-G-E-197
  
Sue. 2] THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. 169 
change in thermodynamic environment undergone by the benzene 
molecules is accompanied by an absorption of 0.36 calorie of 
heat and by an appreciable change in volume, which indicates an 
appreciable but not very large change in thermodynamic environ- 
ment. When one mole of alcohol is poured into a large quantity 
of benzene the process is accompanied by an absorption of 4 
calories of heat. In this case, however, we have a chemical 
reaction, namely, (C2H;OH),=«C2H;OH, accompanying the 
process of mixing, for ethyl alcohol is an associated liquid (III, 
5) and when it is poured into a sufficiently large quantity of ben- 
zene the associated molecules must (as we shall learn later) 
dissociate into simple ones and this reaction will be attended by 
a heat effect which will be added to that due to the change in 
thermodynamic environment alone. The total heat effect in 
such a case will not, therefore, be a trustworthy indication of the 
extent of the change in thermodynamic environment. 
A better measure of the magnitude of this change is furnished 
by the decrease in free energy (X, 9) which accompanies the 
transfer of one mole of one substance from one thermodynamic 
environment to the other. Thus, when one mole of benzene is 
transferred from the thermodynamic environment which prevails 
in pure benzene to that which prevails in pure alcohol, the change 
in thermodynamic environment will be measured by the mag- 
nitude of the corresponding free energy decrease, which can be 
shown to be substantially that given by the expression, 
gh Po A= RT ee »() (1)

where p, is the vapor pressure of the pure benzene and p is its 
partial vapor pressure from an alcohol solution in which its 
molecular fraction is x. 
2. Ideal Solutions.—We have discussed the character of the 
solutions formed when benzene is shaken successively with a 
series of liquids of continuously increasing resemblance to itself. 
There remains only to consider the limiting case of the solutions 
formed by mixing with benzene a liquid which resembles it as 
closely as possible and whose molecules are, therefore, as nearly 
like those of benzene as possible. Toluene will fulfill these

requirements very well as is evident from a comparison of the 
formulas of the two molecules.

When we shake these two non-associated (‘Table VI, 2) liquids 
together, we find that they not only mix readily with each other 
in all proportions, but we note also that the process of mixing 
is not accompanied by any appreciable heat effects or volume 
changes. The total energy of the system, in other words, is 
not changed when the two liquids are mixed together. More- 
over, this absence of energy changes is found to be generally the 
case whenever any two very similar non-associated liquids are 
mixed together and the more nearly the two liquids resemble 
each other the more exactly, as a rule, does this relation hold 
true. This behavior is interpreted in terms of our concept of 
thermodynamic environment by the view that the thermody- 
namic environments in the two pure liquids are practically iden- 
tical, and hence on mixing the liquids there is no change in this 
environment, whatever be the proportions in which they are 
mixed.? That is, a benzene molecule (or a toluene molecule) 
finds itself in practically the same thermodynamic environment, 
whether it be surrounded entirely by benzene molecules, or en- 
tirely by toluene molecules, or by mixtures of the two molecules 
in any proportions whatever. 
Any solution in which the thermodynamic environment is con- 
stant, and entirely independent of the relative proportions of 
the constituents in the solution will be called an ideal solution. 
An ideal solution, like a perfect gas, is strictly, therefore, only a 
limiting case which is approached the more closely, the more 
2 The process of mixing in such a case is very analogous to that which 
occurs when two perfect gases are mixed together in the same volume 
(XI, 3a). The free energy change which measures the magnitude of the 
change in thermodynamic environment can be calculated from equation (1) 
above and has always been found equal to zero when the two liquids resemble 
each other very closely.
-P-A-G-E-199
  Suc. 3] THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 171 
nearly its different molecular components resemble one another. 
The closest approach of any actual solution to the limiting case 
of an ideal solution probably occurs when we mix together two 
liquid hydrocarbons which are optical isomers (I, 2d) or when we 
liquify an element containing isotopic atoms. Such a mixture 
will be found to obey all of the laws of ideal solutions so closely 
that we should probably be unable to detect the slightest deviation 
and such a solution may, therefore, be considered as an actual 
example of an ideal solution. It will be readily seen that the 
following pairs of liquids when mixed together will also form 
solutions which will be very close to ideal solutions: (1) chlor- 
benzene and brombenzene; (2) mercury and tin; (3, krypton and 
xenon; (4) methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol; (5) holmium and 
dysprosium; (6) cesium and rubidium. 
8. Dilute Solutions.—In general a, solution composed of the 
two substances, A and B, will have a thermodynamic environ- 
ment different from that which prevails in either pure liquid A or 
pure liquid B and this thermodynamic environment will vary 
with changes in the relative amounts of A and B in the solution. 
Suppose we take any solution composed of A and B and pour 
into it some pure liquid A. This process is called ‘‘diluting the 
solution with A.” As the mole-fraction of A increases and that 
of B decreases, the thermodynamic environment in the solution 
approaches gradually that which prevails in pure liquid A and 
after the degree of dilution has become great enough the molecules 
of B are so few in number and so far apart that their influence 
upon the thermodynamic environment of the solution becomes 
negligibly small. When this condition is reached, further dilution 
no longer produces any appreciable change in the thermodynamic 
environment. In other words, for every solution in which one 
constituent, the solvent (XI, 4), largely predominates over the 
other, the solute, there exists a degree of dilution beyond which 
further additions of solvent no longer produce any appreciable 
effect upon the thermodynamic environment. When the mole 
fraction of the solvent in any solution is so large that the thermo- 
dynamic environment is practically identical with that which 
prevails in the pure solvent, the solution is called a ‘dilute 
solution,” or more accurately, a “sufficiently dilute solution.” 
The exact degree of dilution which the solution must have 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
172 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY  [Cuapr. XIII 
before its thermodynamic environment becomes practically con- 
stant and hence independent of further increases in the mole 
fraction of the solvent depends upon the natures of the solvent 
and the solute. Strictly speaking, the thermodynamic environ- 
ment never reaches absolute constancy until the solution becomes 
infinitely dilute, but for practical purposes it becomes sufficiently 
constant at moderate dilutions and from what has been said 
above with reference to ideal solutions, it is evident that the more 
closely the solvent and solute resemble each other, the less dilute 
does the solution need to be before its thermodynamic environ- 
ment becomes practically constant. No very accurate general 
rules can be formulated for deciding just how dilute a solution 
must be before it may be classed as a “dilute solution,” because 
that is a question which can only be decided by a study of the 
solution itself. From the knowledge which has been obtained 
from the study of the behavior of aqueous solutions, how- 
ever, it is possible to formulate the following general rules which 
hold for the majority of cases and which will give the student 
a general idea of the concentration range which is usually coy- 
ered by the term, “dilute solution.” 
(a) Aqueous solutions of most non-electrolytes possess a ther- 
modynamic environment which is practically constant and iden- 
tical (within say 1 or 2 per cent.) with that which prevails 
in pure water, as long as the mole fraction of the solute does 
not exceed about 0.01 (0.5 molal). 
(6) In a few instances (solutions of the alcohols and the 
sugars) this limit probably extends as high as 0.04 or 0.05, while 
in a few others it is very possibly considerably lower than 0.01. 
(c) In the case of aqueous solutions of strong electrolytes, 
(1, 2g) in particular, this limit must in certain cases be placed very 
much lower, as low as 0.00001 (0.0005 normal) in fact, owing to 
the powerful effect which ions (1, 2g) exert upon the thermody- 
namic environment of any solution containing them. 
The two groups of solutions which we have just considered, 
Ideal Solutions and Sufficiently Dilute Solutions, have the 
common characteristic of possessing a thermodynamic environ- 
ment which does not change with variations in the relative 
amounts of the constituents of the solution, and both groups 
of solutions obey the same set of laws, which we will call the
-P-A-G-E-201
  
Src. 4] THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 173 
Laws of Solutions of Constant Thermodynamic Environment 
and which we shall develop in the next chapter. 
4, The Nature of the Forces Which Determine Thermodyna- 
mic Environment.—Since every molecule consists of atoms joined 
together by electrical forces, each molecule will have a certain 
field of force around it, whose nature and magnitude will be 
determined by the distribution of the valence electrons of its 
constituent atoms. Since the chemical and physical properties 
of a substance are largely influenced by the natures of these 
molecular fields of force, we are justified in concluding that sub- 
stances which resemble each other sufficiently closely in their 
chemical and physical properties will have fields of force around 
their molecules which will be nearly identical in character, that 
is, the thermodynamic environments in the two liquids will be 
substantially the same and they will form ideal solutions with 
one another. 
It is entirely possible, however, that two molecular species 
which would be regarded as chemically quite different, such as 
CO and Nz, for example, (See X XVII, 5), might have such an 
arrangement of their surface electrons as to produce nearly 
identical fields of foree around their molecules and thus be 
capable of forming ideal solutions with each other. It is de- 
sirable therefore to have some way of estimating and comparing 
these molecular fields of force in the case of different liquids and 
thus of determining whether or not they may be expected to 
have nearly identical thermodynamic environments. 
The only exact method is, of course, to determine the value 
of A in equation (1), but a useful approximate rule for comparing 
the thermodynamic environments of two liquids can be based 
either upon a relationship discovered by Walden’ and generalized 
by Hildebrand, between solubility and internal pressures, or 
upon the magnitudes of the heat of mixing of the two liquids. 
This rule may be stated as follows: If a series of non-polar 
liquids be arranged in the order of their internal pressures or 
in the order of their molal heats of solution in some standard 
liquid, then the degree of difference of the thermodynamic 
environments of any two of these liquids will be approximately 
measured by the magnitude of the difference between their 
internal pressures or heats of solution. Liquids standing close  
-P-A-G-E-202
  174 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XIII 
to each other and having nearly identical internal pressures 
and heats of solution will form ideal solutions with each other 
while liquids which differ considerably in this respect will form 
solutions which will exhibit appreciable deviations from the 
laws of Ideal Solutions. On the basis of this rule, Hildebrand 
has shown that the data on internal pressures given in Table 
XIII can be used in determining whether or not two liquids 
may be expected to form ideal solutions with each other. The 
corresponding values for heat of solution although rather easier 
to measure accurately are not yet available for inclusion in the 
table. The application of the rule in the case of strongly polar 
substances such as water and salts, is, however, rendered difficult 
or impossible on account of the frequent formation of new 
molecular species when the two substances are brought together, 
since these new species may have fields of force quite different 
from those of the two substances used, and, as explained above, 
the heat of solution can then also no longer be employed as a 
measure of the change in thermodynamic environment. 
The discovery of some quantitative relation between the 
quantity A in equation (1) and the relative internal pressures, 
or the heat of mixing, of two liquids would be very useful but 
no sufficiently reliable data are as yet available. 
5. Surface Solutions.—If we place a drop of water upon a 
mercury surface, or a drop of benzene upon a water surface, the 
drop shows no tendency to spread out over the surface but as- 
sumes a more or less flattened shape which is the resultant of 
the combined actions of gravitation and surface tension. This 
same phenomenon occurs with any two liquids having very large 
differences of thermodynamic environment. 
If, on the other hand, we choose two liquids of similar thermo- 
dynamic environment, for example, if we place a drop of alcohol 
or a drop of acetic acid on the surface of water, the drop spreads 
rapidly over the surface and soon dissolves completely in the 
water, that is, the alcohol or acetic acid molecules penetrate 
the water surface and work their way into the interior because 
they are attracted by the water molecules with approximately the 
same avidity as by other molecules of their own kind. In the 
extreme case, we thus obtain an ideal solution of the two materials 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  Src. 5] THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 175 
and the surface film of this solution will contain equal numbers 
of both molecular species. 
Acetic acid molecules and alcohol molecules are polar in na- 
ture and resemble water because they contain the strongly 
polar hydroxyl group and carboxyl group respectively, joined 
to a comparatively short hydro-carbon radical. In other words, 
the active hydroxyl or carboxyl group forms a sufficiently large 
part of the molecule to overcome the influence of the hydro- 
carbon end and thus to enable the whole molecule to penetrate 
the molecular field of water. Purely hydro-carbon molecules 
such as those of benzene contain no such polar group and con- 
sequently do not resemble very closely, and are but little attracted 
by the water molecules. 
If, now, we choose a liquid such as oleic acid, C:;Hs; COOH, 
containing the active polar carboxyl group attached to the end 
of a long non-polar (I, 2g) hydro-carbon chain and place a drop 
of this liquid upon the surface of water, we find that the drop 
spreads out over the surface of the water until, if the surface is 
large enough, it consists of a layer which is only molecule deep, 
the molecules of the acid being packed closely together in this 
layer. The oleic acid does not, however, dissolve in the water to 
any considerable extent. Owing to the presence of the carboxyl 
group, one end of the molecule is strongly attracted by the water 
and attempts, so to speak, to dissolve in it. The long hydro- 
carbon chain, however is so different that it can not be dragged 
into. the thermodynamic environment of the water by the 
carboxyl group. ‘The result, of course, is that the drop spreads 
until all of the molecules have their carboxyl groups sticking 
down into the water and their hydro-carbon chains standing 
up in the air. 
It may be stated as a general rule that at any surface of 
contact between two different phases the molecules in the contact 
surface, if free to move, will orient themselves so that each end 
of the molecule points toward or sticks into that phase whose 
molecules it most resembles. Thus if an organic liquid whose 
molecules contain a polar group, such as OH, NOs, or NH, is 
brought into contact with water, the molecules at the surface layer 
will all turn until the active group points towards, or dissolves in,
-P-A-G-E-204
176 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XIII 
the water, while the hydro-carbon radical remains in the other 
layer. 
Surface solutions may be gas-like, liquid-like, or solid-like. 
All surface solutions which are sufficiently “dilute” are gas-like, 
that is, if they are compressed laterally so as to force the solute 
molecules into a smaller surface, the film continues to be homo- 
geneous” throughout (cf. with the definition of a gas, II, 1). 
When a certain force is reached, however, some of the sur- 
face molecules begin to ‘precipitate out” as a “liquid” or a 
“solid,” that is, they become close-packed laterally in the 
surface. As soon as these close-packed molecules appear, the 
lateral compression force (7.e. the lateral ‘diffusion pressure, ’’) 
thereafter remains constant until all of the molecules have become 
close-packed, i.e. have ‘precipitated out” as a “liquid” or 
“solid” surface film. If the lateral compression force be now 
further increased, the surface contraction is very slight and 
eventually the film will be shattered and some of its molecules will 
be forced upward to form a second layer above the first. With 
“solid” films this phenomenon is attended by an obvious wrink- 
ling and crumpling of the film. 
Beautiful experimental studies of surface solutions have 
been carried out by Hardy in England, by Devaux and Marcelin 
in France and by Harkins® and Langmuir’ in America. The laws 
of such solutions will be considered in the next chapter.

SOLUTIONS IV: THE LAWS OF SOLUTIONS OF CON- 
STANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 
Tue Distrrution Laws 
1. The General Vapor Pressure Law.—For solutions in which 
the thermodynamic environment is a constant the function 
f, (7.H.) in equation (20, XII) is constant and the equation may 
therefore be written 
  Ops : 
(on) Sue he ) 
where 7, is the partial vapor pressure of any molecular species, 
A, from a solution in which its molecular fraction (XI, 5) is a,, 
and k, is a constant characteristic of the species, A, and of the 
thermodynamic environment which surrounds it in the solution. 
Concerning the quantity, p,, in this equation it should be 
remembered that the directly measured vapor pressure above a 
solution is determined not only by the conditions which exist 
within the solution but, like any other gas pressure, it is subject 
to the influences which exist in the vapor itself and which at high 
pressures or at low temperatures cause the vapor to deviate 
appreciably from the behavior of a perfect gas (II, 9). If, 
therefore, the vapor pressure, p,, in equation (1) is to serve as a 
suitable measure of the escaping tendency of the molecular spe- 
cies, A, from the solution, it should, strictly speaking, first be 
corrected for those influences which cause the vapor to deviate 
from the behavior of a perfect gas. This ‘‘corrected vapor 
pressure” has been called! by Lewis* the ‘‘fugacity” of the mole- 
1 Lewis [Proc. Amer. Acad. Sci., 37, 49 (1901)]. The method of making 
the correction for deviation from the perfect gas law is discussed in this 
paper and also in a paper by Gay [Jour. Chimie Physique, 10, 197 (1912)], 
who calls the corrected vapor pressure the ‘‘expansibility tension” of the 
molecular species in question. 
In the case of a distribution law involving the vapor phase, if the partial 
vapor pressure employed has been obtained (as is usually the case) by

cular species, A, in the solution. It is evidently a measure of 
the tendency of this species to escape from the thermodynamic en- 
vironment, which surrounds it in the solution, into that condition 
of zero thermodynamic environment which prevails in a perfect 
gas. The necessary correction which must be applied to the 
observed vapor pressure in a given case in order to obtain the 
“fugacity,’’ could be readily calculated, if the constants of the 
van der Waals’ or of the Berthelot equation of state (II, 10a) 
were known for the vapor in question. Asa matter of fact, how- 
ever, in many cases the magnitude of this correction is so small 
that it falls within the error of measurement of the vapor pressure 
itself and can, therefore, be neglected. In general, however, 
it should be borne in mind that any law of solution which in- 
volves the vapor phase may be subject to deviations of the same 
kind and order of magnitude and from the same sources as those 
which cause gases to deviate from the perfect gas law (II, 10a). 
2. The Vapor Pressure of Ideal Solutions.—By integrating 
equation (1) we obtain 
P=khet+I (2) 
When x, = 0, px, = 0 also, and hence the integration constant, 
I, is zero. When a, = 1, ky = poy, the vapor pressure of pure 
liquid A at the same temperature and pressure. Equation (2), 
therefore, becomes: 
Pa = Posts (3) 
or stated in words: The partial vapor pressure of any mole- 
cular species above an ideal solution is equal to its vapor pressure 
as a pure liquid at the same temperature and pressure multi- 
  
calculation from the percentage composition of the vapor in equilibrium 
with the solution on the assumption that the vapor behaves like a perfect 
gas, the vapor pressure so calculated is, thereby, usually automatically 
“corrected ” for the effect of the influences present in the gas phase and when 
substituted in the distribution law in question usually shows good agreement 
with the law. This is the case with the data exhibited in Fig. 28. 
A quantity, », known as the molecular thermodynamic potential and 
connected with the fugacity, p, by the relation, 4, = f(2) + RT log. pa, 
is used by many writers on the theory of solution.

the partial vapor pressure of any molecular species from an ideal 
solution is a linear function of its molecular fraction in that 
solution. 
Problem 1a.—Prove that the total vapor pressure above an ideal solution 
made up of the two molecular species, A and B, is also a linear function of 
the molecular fracton of each species. 
Problem 1b.—Given the vapor pressure law of the Ideal Solution (eq. 3, 
XIV), prove by purely thermodynamic reasoning that the heat of forma- 
tion of an Ideal Solution out of its liquid constituents, and also the cor- 
responding volume change, must both be zero. (Cf. equations 1 and 8, 
XII.) 
The vapor pressure law and its application to an actual solu- 
tion are illustrated graphically in Fig. 28, which should be studied 
carefully in connection with equation (3) and problem 1. 
3. The Vapor Pressure of the Solvent from a Dilute Solution. 
Raoult’s Law.—Integrating equation (1) and evaluating the con- 
stants in the same manner as in the case of ideal solutions, we 
obtain the same equation, 
D = pot (4) 
for the vapor pressure of the solvent from a dilute solution. 
By combination with equations (2, XI), and (9, XII) we can 
put this in the form, 
ADE Spores ty re SONA, Po Po a N+Mi (6) 
where a is the relative vapor pressure lowering produced when 0 
N, moles of solute are dissolved in N moles of solvent. 
This relation is known as Raoult’s* law of vapor pressure lower- 
ing. In words it states that the relative lowering of the vapor 
pressure of a solvent, which occurs when a solute is dissolved in 
it to form a dilute solution, is equal to the mole fraction of the 
solute in the resulting solution. If the solute is a non-volatile 
one, the partial vapor pressure of the solvent is, of course, also the 
total vapor pressure of the solution.

5. The Distribution Law for Dilute Solutions.—If we take a 
dilute solution of some substance in solvent, 1, and shake this 
solution with another solvent, 2, with which the first solvent is 
immiscible, then some of the solute molecules will pass from 
the first to the second solvent until finally a state of equilibrium 
is reached. The solute is now said to be in distribution equili- 
brium between the two solvents and hence according to the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics (see the last paragraph of X, 10), it 
must have the same vapor pressure from both solutions.

two vapor pressures must be equal in such a case,

solution is in distribution equilibrium between two immiscible 
solvents the ratio of its mole fractions in the two solvents is 
always equal to a constant whose value is characteristic of the spe- 
cies in question and of the two thermodynamic environments 
which respectively exist in the two solvents. 
Problem 8.—Show that if the two mole fractions are small enough equa- 
tion (15) can be put in either of the following forms:

general one, one in fact which governs the distribution equilibrium 
of any molecular species between any two phases whatever, be 
they crystalline, liquid or gaseous, provided only that the 
thermodynamic environment in each phase does not change with 
the mole fraction of the solute in that phase, that is, provided that 
the solution in each phase is a “sufficiently dilute solution”

only a special case of this general distribution law. 
Problem 9.—At 25° the distribution ratio of Br2 between carbon tetra- 
chloride and water is és = 38. The partial pressure of Br2 above a 0.05 
molal solution of it in water at 25° is 50mm. If 1 liter of this solution be 
shaken with 50 c.c. of carbon tetrachloride, what will be the pressure of the 
bromine above the carbon tetrachloride phase. 
Problem 9a.—At 25° the solubility of iodine, I2, in CCl, is 30.33 grams per 
liter and in water 0.00132 moles per liter. One liter of CCl, containing 
25 grams of I, is shaken with 3 liters of water at 25° until equilibrium is 
established. How many grams of iodine will be found in the water layer?

(1) by its integral, p, = k,x,, we eliminate the constant, k,, and 
obtain

By combining this equation with equation (15, XII) so as to 
eliminate dp, and putting RT in place of pvo in the result, we have 
the osmotic pressure law for solutions of constant thermody- 
namic environment, namely,

This expresses the osmotic pressure of the solution referred to 
constituent, A, (XII, 7) whose molal volume as a pure liquid 
is Vo, and whose mole fraction in the solution is x,. 
If we assume that the substance A as a pure liquid is incom- 
pressible, then Vo,, is a constant independent of II and the gen- 
eral integral of equation (19) is Cn

the integration constant being obviously zero. This equation 
expresses the general connection between the osmotic pressure of 
an ideal solution and its composition. 
The same equation also applies to dilute solutions, if we 
understand that the solvent is the constituent which is present 
as the pure liquid (cf. the definition of osmotic pressure, XII, 
7), and with this understanding we may drop the subscript, A, 
and write 
r= aay log. & (21) Vo 
x being the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution and Vo 
its molal volume as a pure liquid at the temperature T. 
7. Direct Osmotic Pressure Measurements.—The pressure 
difference necessary to prevent osmosis through a perfectly semi- 
permeable (XII, 7) membrane is equal to the osmotic pressure 
and by determining this pressure difference for a given solution 
the osmotic pressure is thus directly measured. Membranes 
which approximate perfect semipermeability have thus far been 
obtained only in the case of a few aqueous sugar solutions and 
accurate measurements of osmotic pressure by this method are 
_ consequently very few in number. 
In Table XVII below are shown some results obtained by 
Morse’ and his associates for the osmotic pressures of cane-sugar 
solutions at 25°. These investigators employed membranes of 
cupric ferrocyanide deposited in the pores of a porous earthen- 
ware cell. The sugar solution was placed in the interior of the 
cell which was then surrounded by water. The pressure upon 
the solution was then increased until it was just sufficient to 
prevent the passage of water into or out of the cell through the 
cupric ferrocyanide membrane. 
It is not without interest to compare the values of the osmotic 
pressure obtained in this way with those calculated from the 
theoretical equation for an ideal solution (21), although for the 
solutions employed by Morse the calculation cannot be carried 
out without making several assumptions. In the first place 
the osmotic pressure measured by Morse is that defined by 
equation (13, XII) while that which appears in the equation for 
«Harmon Northrup Morse (1848-1920). Professor of Inorganic and 
Analytical Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University.

an ideal solution (21) is defined by equation (12, XII). For 
cane sugar solutions at 25°, however, the two quantities II and 
I’ do not differ by more than 1.6 per cent. for the concentra- 
tion range covered by the table. Another difficulty in applying 
equation (21) to these solutions is that this equation assumes that 
the “‘pure solvent,” that is, the constituent to which the mem- 
brane is permeable, is composed of only one species of molecule, 
a condition which is not fulfilled in the case of water. A third 
difficulty lies in the fact that for cane-sugar solutions the mole- 
cular formula of the solute in the solution is not known with cer- 
tainty, for the sugar molecules very probably become hydrated 
when they dissolve in water.

If values of x calculated in this way be substituted in the theo- 
retical equation (21), the values of II; thus obtained are shown 
in column 3 of Table XVII. 
These values do not agree very well with the experimental 
ones. Part of the disagreement is undoubtedly due to the fact 
that water is not a pure substance with a molecular weight, in 
the liquid state, of 18. The disagreement is probably too great 
to be accounted for by this fact alone, however, for the value 
assumed for the molecular weight of water appears in the equation 
in such a way that for moderate concentrations it cancels itself 
out approximately, as can be seen by a careful examination of 
equations (21) and (22). Most of the difference between the 
calculated and the observed values can probably be attributed to 
an erroneous assumption with regard to the molecular weight of 
sugar when dissolved in water. Instead of remaining unhy- 
drated, it is probable that the sugar molecules unite with some 
of the water to form a hydrate. If the number of water mole- 
cules which unite in this way with one molecule of sugar is W, 
then the mole fraction of the free water as computed from equa- 
tion (22) above would evidently be 
= Ae _ww.)+(-wm+m) 3) 
If we assume W=6 and substitute values of x computed from 
equation (23) in equation (21), we obtain the values of Tz 
given in the column 4 of Table XVII. These values show good 
agreement with the experimental ones and this agreement may 
be taken as evidence that the molecules of cane sugar in aqueous 
solution are on the average each hydrated with approximately 6 
molecules of water. The molecular formula of the solute in 
solution would, therefore, be C12H22011-6H20. 
We have mentioned the fact (XII, 7) that the osmotic pressure 
of any solution can be thermodynamically calculated from the 
other colligative properties of the solution. As an example of

Problem 9b.—A 1 per cent. solution of dextrin in water has at 16° an os- 
motic pressure of 16.6 em. of mercury. Calculate the molecular weight of 
the solute. (Use the van’t Hoff equation (28).) To what fraction of a 
degree would it be necessary to know the freezing point of this solution in 
order to determine the molecular weight of dextrin to 1 per cent. by the 
freezing point method? (Use equation (51).) 
This problem illustrates the application of the osmotic pressure 
law to the determination of the molecular weight of substances 
whose molecules are made up of a very large number of atoms. 
Molecules such as those of dextrin and albumin are, in fact, so 
large that solutions of these substances resemble colloidal solu- 
tions in many respects and are usually classed with such solu- 
tions for the purposes of systematic treatment. Owing to the
-P-A-G-E-217
  Src. 8] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 189 
small molal concentration of many of these solutions, the freezing 
point lowering is so small that it cannot be measured with suffi- 
cient accuracy to give a satisfactory value for the molecular 
weight of the solute. Moreover the freezing point is liable to be 
seriously affected by the presence of traces of impurities. It is 
with such solutions as these that the osmotic pressure method 
is of particular value for molecular weight determinations. 
Membranes quite impermeable to the large solute molecules, and 
sufficiently strong to withstand the small pressures involved, are 
comparatively easy to secure and these membranes are usually 
permeable to many of the impurities present in the solution and 
hence the measured osmotic pressure is not influenced by these 
impurities. 
8. The Van’t Hoff Equation.—In the comparisons given in - 
Table XVII we employed the general osmotic pressure law in the 
form, 
= Vo 
If the mole fraction of the solute is small enough, however, 
this equation may be rearranged into a more convenient form for 
calculation. In place of « we may put 1—a; (eq. 2, XI), where x; 
is the mole fraction of the solute in the solution. This gives,

Maclaurin’s Theorem we have 
nat Mott Kort... 2.) 26) I = log. x (24) 
If the mole fraction of the solute is small enough, its higher powers 
may be neglected in comparison with its first power and we 
can write 
BEE bOr aN, Vig tee Vn: NSENG 
and if we may neglect Ni in comparison with N in the denomi- 
nator of the right-hand member and write V in place of NVo, 
this equation becomes I= (27) 
WV =NiRT (28)
-P-A-G-E-218
  190 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XIV 
where N; is evidently the number of moles of solute in V liters 
of solvent at 7°. As the solution becomes more and more 
dilute V becomes practically identical with the volume, V., of 
the solution containing N; moles of solute. When this is 
true we have 
IV,.=MiRT or 1 = C,RT (29) 
The formal resemblance between equation (29) and the perfect 
gas law is obvious and for this reason it is possible to say that 
the osmotic pressure of an extremely 
dilute solution is numerically equal to 
the presssure which the solute molecules 
would exert as a gas, if they occupied 
the same volume as they do in the solu- 
tion and had the same temperature. 
This is the form in which the osmotic 
pressure law was first stated by van’t 
Hoff in 1886 and equation (29) is known 
as van’t Hoff’s law of osmotic pressure. 
Now the pressure of a gas is due to the 
impacts of the molecules of the gas upon 
the walls of the containing vessel and 
owing to the formal resemblance be- 
tween van’t Hoff’s osmotic pressure law 
and the equation of state of a perfect 
gas, many persons have held the view 
that the osmotic pressure of a solution 
is a real pressure existing within the 
Fic, 29. solution and caused by the impacts of 
the solute molecules against any retain- 
ing surface. In order to make clear the illogical character of 
such a view we will consider in some detail the molecular kinetic 
interpretation of the process of osmosis. 
9. The Molecular Kinetic Interpretation of the Process of 
Osmosis. (a) Osmosis in the Case of Ideal Solutions—Fig. 29 
represents two vessels each filled with a liquid A which for con- 
venience we will designate as our solvent. Each vessel is 
provided with a piston by means of which the total pressure 
upon the liquid may be varied at will. The two vessels are 
connected by a tube fitted with a membrane, M, of infinitesimal 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  Sec. 9] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 191 
thickness which allows the molecules of A to pass through it, 
but which is impermeable to every other species of molecule. 
Let both vessels be initially under the same pressure and at the 
same temperature. 
The molecules of A being in constant motion will strike the 
membrane, M, from both sides and hence will pass through it in 
both directions, but since the concentrations of the A molecules 
and the temperature, pressure and other conditions are the same 
in both vessels, equal numbers of molecules will strike both sides 
of the membrane in unit time and hence the quantities of A pass- 
ing through the membrane will be the same in the two directions. 
Suppose now that we dissolve in the liquid in the right-hand 
vessel some substance, B, which forms an ideal solution with A. 
Since there are now fewer molecules of A per unit volume in the 
right-hand vessel, the number of these molecules which can 
strike the semipermeable membrane from the right in unit time 
must be less than the number which strike it from the left and 
hence there must be a flow of A from left to right through the 
membrane. In other words osmosis must occur. 
This osmosis might be stopped (1) by raising the temperature 
of the right-hand vessel or by lowering that of the left-hand 
vessel, or it might also be stopped (2) by raising the pressure on 
the right-hand vessel or by lowering that on the left-hand vessel. 
If the second method is employed the pressure difference neces- 
sary to make the rates of passage of the A molecules through the 
membrane the same in the two directions, is evidently what we 
have defined (XII, 7) as the osmotic pressure of the solution.” 
One effect of increasing the pressure upon any liquid is to force 
the molecules closer together and, therefore, to increase the 
repulsive forces acting between them and hence to increase the 
vigor of their molecular impacts against any surface. By 
increasing the pressure upon the right-hand vessel, therefore, 
the vigor of the impacts of the A molecules against the semi- 
permeable membrane (and to a slight extent the concentration 
of these molecules as well) would be increased and the number 
of molecules which are able to pass through the membrane per 
unit time would consequently be increased. This is the most 
? Evidently an ‘osmotic temperature” for the solution might be similarly 
defined, if one wished to do so.
-P-A-G-E-220
  192 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XIV 
probable molecular kinetic interpretation of the process of 
osmosis and of the way in which the change of pressure on one 
side of the membrane brings the osmosis to a stop, in the simple 
case of an ideal solution. 
As the mole fraction of the B molecules in the right-hand 
vessel of Fig. 29 is increased the osmotic pressure increases in 
accordance with the integral of equation (19) and, as this integral 
shows, the osmotic pressure must approach infinity as the mole 
fraction of B approaches unity. This statement holds true 
regardless of the natures of A and B. In other words no pres- 
sure difference, however great, would be able to prevent the 
passage of A molecules from pure A on the left of the membrane 
into pure B on the right. 
(b) Osmosis in General.—In the simple case of the ideal solu- 
tion just considered we have seen that the solvent would flow 
through the semipermeable membrane into the solution merely 
because there is a greater number of solvent molecules per 
unit volume in the pure solvent than in the solution and hence 
the number of molecules striking the membrane from the sol- 
vent side will naturally be the greater. In other words the 
osmosis in such a case would be a purely kinetic phenomenon 
and quite analogous to the passage of hydrogen gas through a 
palladium wall into a gaseous mixture containing hydrogen at a 
smaller concentration (Cf. II, 6). In general, however, the 
phenomenon of osmosis is a more complex process, one which is 
probably quite appreciably influenced by the attractive forces 
(neutralized in the cases of ideal solutions) which act between 
the molecules in the interior of the liquid. Thus when a strong 
aqueous sugar solution is separated from pure water by a mem- 
brane permeable only to the water, the rate of osmosis might 
be very appreciably influenced by attractive forces acting 
between the sugar molecules on one side of the membrane and 
the water molecules on the other side of the membrane, or in the 
interior of the membrane if the latter is of appreciable thickness. 
The presence of such forces would affect also the pressure differ- 
ence which must be established on solvent and solution respec- 
tively in order to stop the osmosis. This is only another way of 
stating that the osmotic pressure of a solution is in general a
-P-A-G-E-221
  Sec. 9] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 193 
function of the thermodynamic environment prevailing within 
the solution. (Cf. XIII, 1.) 
In the above interpretation of the process of osmosis it will 
be noticed that we have said nothing about any pressure exerted 
against the semipermeable membrane by the molecules of the solute, 
nor is it necessary that we should. Such a pressure would 
undoubtedly exist, for the membrane is constantly being bom- 
barded by these solute molecules, but this pressure 7s not the 
osmotic pressure of the solution. The osmotic pressure of a 
solution is, in fact, not a real pressure exerted by something 
within solution, but is instead an abstraction, representing 
simply the pressure difference which would have to be established 
upon solution and pure solvent respectively in order that the 
solvent should have the same escaping tendency from both of 
them. It is thus a definite physical quantity quite independent 
of semipermeable membranes, osmosis or molecular theory of 
liquids. The partial pressure of the solute molecules against 
the semipermeable membrane has, however, been frequently 
given as the cause of osmosis and has been identified with the 
osmotic pressure. To what extent this is justifiable will become 
evident from the following considerations. 
(c) Thermal Pressure and Diffusion Pressure.— When a dilute 
solution of B in A in the right-hand vessel of Fig. 29 is separated 
from pure A in the left-hand vessel by a membrane permeable 
only to A, the molecules of B which are constantly striking the 
right-hand side of this membrane will exert against it a certain 
partial pressure, pp, which we will call the diffusion pressure of 
these molecules, since it is evidently a measure of the tendency 
of the solute to diffuse into the pure solvent, the diffusion being 
in the above case prevented by the presence of the membrane. 
The following molecular kinetic analysis of the conditions at the 
surface of the membrane will aid us in appreciating the nature of 
some of the factors which determine the magnitude of this diffu- 
sion pressure of the solute molecules. 
Let both liquids be under atmospheric pressure and consider 
the layer of B molecules which at any moment are just about 
to strike the membrane from the right. If these molecules were 
not subject to any attractive forces from their neighbors, they 
would exert against the membrane a pressure, pr, which will be 
13
-P-A-G-E-222
194 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XIV 
called their thermal pressure and which would be equal to the 
pressure exerted by an equal number of molecules of a gas at 
the same temperature and the same effective concentration. As 
a matter of fact, however, the layer of B molecules next the 
membrane will be subject to a pull backward by both the A 
and the B molecules which are behind them and to a pull forward 
by the A molecules on the other side of the membrane. These 
different attractive forces will influence the force with which the B 
molecules strike the membrane, and will thus be a determining 
factor in the effective pressure which these molecules will be 
able to exert against the membrane. If we call p, and p, the 
backward pulls (in pressure units) exerted by the A and the B 
molecules in the solution, and p’, the forward pull exerted by the 
A molecules on the other side of the membrane, then the actual 
pressure, pp, which the B molecules will exert against the mem- 
brane, when they strike it, will be 
Po = Pr + p's — (Pa + Ds) (30) 
For the thermal pressure, pr, we might write 
NBRT Br = U7 — y= Cow RT (31) 
where Cor, is the molal concentration of the B molecules, cor- 
rected. for the space actually filled by these molecules, the 
correction being made according to the method of reasoning 
employed by van der Waals in correcting the gas law for high 
pressures. (Cf. II, 10a.) Ccor, will be called the effective con- 
centration of the B molecules. 
Problem 9c.—What is the relation between thermal pressure and internal 
pressure? Cf. (IV, 9). 
In the limiting case of an ideal solution p’, = px + Dz for all 
concentrations and in the case of any dilute solution, as the 
concentration of the solute, B, decreases and approaches zero, 
Pz approaches zero and p’, approaches p,, so that here also p’, 
=), + ps. In words, the diffusion pressure of the molecules of 
the solute in an ideal solution or in an infinitely dilute solution 
is equal to their thermal pressure and hence is equal to the pres- 
sure which they would exert. in the gaseous state at the same 
temperature and the same effective concentration,
-P-A-G-E-223
Src. 9] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 195 
If we start with a solution in which the concentration of the 
solute is small, then as we gradually increase it, the value of pp 
(equation 30) will evidently always remain finite and, if the 
solution is an ideal one, pp = pr = Ccor. RT for all values of the 
concentration. If the solution is not an ideal solution, the value 
of pp is equal to CRT for small concentrations, but as the con- 
centration of the solute increases, pp will at first increase more 
slowly than Cc.;.RT, owing to the fact that p, + ps in equation 
(30) is greater than p’,. As the concentration of the solute con- 
tinues to increase, however, a point may be reached where p’, is 
greater than p, + pz. If this is true, the value of pp might for a 
time increase faster than Cco,.RT. In other words the variation 
of pp with the concentration is in general not predictable between 
infinite dilution and pure solute. When the mole fraction of the 
solute in the right-hand vessel becomes unity, however, p, obvi- 
ously becomes zero and we have, po = pr + p’a— Ps. Beyond 
the fact that pp under these conditions must still be a finite 
quantity, we cannot make any general statement with regard to 
its magnitude or even with regard to its sign, although these can 
usually be determined in any specific case. 
In the preceding discussion we have considered the conditions 
which exist on the two sides of the membrane when both the solu- 
tion and the pure solvent are under the same total pressure and 
at the same temperature. If the pressure or temperature of 
the solution be altered, however, there will be corresponding 
changes in the thermal pressure and the diffusion pressure of 
the solute molecules. Increase of pressure upon the solution 
will cause a corresponding increase in the diffusion pressure of 
the solute molecules and their diffusion pressure can be made 
numerically equal to the osmotic pressure, II’ defined by equation 
(13), by putting the solution under the pressure, P, also defined 
by that equation. In other words for the special case when a 
solution is in osmotic equilibrium with the pure solvent, the 
diffusion pressure of the solute molecules is equal in magnitude 
to the osmotic pressure, II’, of the solution. 
(d) Summary.—We may sum up our discussion in the following 
terms. Osmotic pressure, thermal pressure, and diffusion pres- 
sure are three quite distinct quantities and should be recognized 
as such. Briefly they are defined and described as follows:
-P-A-G-E-224
  196 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XIV 
1. Osmotic Pressure—The osmotic pressure of a solution is 
the pressure difference which must be established upon the solu- 
tion and the pure solvent respectively, in order to make the 
escaping tendency of the solvent the same from both of them. 
The osmotic pressure is, therefore, not a real pressure existing 
within the solution but is a definite physical quantity quite in- 
dependent of osmosis, semipermeable membranes or molecular 
theory. It is connected with the other colligative properties 
of the solution by definite relations which can be deduced by 
purely thermodynamic reasoning. For dilute solutions the 
osmotic pressure becomes in the limit equal to CRT where C 
is the concentration of the solute, but as the concentration 
increases the osmotic pressure approaches infinity as its upper 
limit. 
2. Thermal Pressure—Every molecular species in a solution 
possesses the unordered heat motion of all fluid molecules and by 
virtue of this motion its molecules may be considered as having a 
corresponding pressure, pr, called their thermal pressure. For 
dilute solutions of the species in question this pressure will be 
equal to CRT but as the concentration of the molecular species 
increases the value of pr also increases and approaches a finite 
but usually very large upper limit, the thermal pressure of the 
molecules in the pure liquid solute. If van der Waals’ equation 
held for the liquid, the thermal pressure would be equal to 
_NikT 
=) 
3. Diffusion Pressure-—The partial pressure which the solute 
molecules in any solution would exert against a membrane per- 
meable only to the solvent is called their diffusion pressure, pp. 
For dilute solutions the diffusion pressure is equal to CRT 
but as the concentration of the solute increases, the diffusion 
pressure remains finite for all values of C and reaches a definite 
limiting value whose magnitude and sign depend upon the tem- 
perature, the external pressure and the attractive forces which 
are acting in the interior of the liquid. 
The way in which the three quantities, Il, pr and pp, change 
with the mole fraction of the solute is illustrated graphically 
in Fig. 30.

  198 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XIV 
The above rather detailed treatment of these three quantities 
has been deemed advisable because of the great confusion 
regarding them which exists in the literature. The term osmotic 
pressure is loosely used to designate all three quantities, fre- 
quently without any appreciation of the differences among 
them. Osmotic pressure is frequently spoken of as the “‘ cause of 
osmosis,” and attempts are made to calculate the diffusion pres- 
sure from the freezing point. Neither the diffusion pressure nor 
the thermal pressure can be calculated from the freezing point, 
as there is no known relation connecting them. The osmotic 
pressure can be so calculated, however (see Table XVIII) and 
if the concentration of the solute in the solution is so small that 
the value of its diffusion pressure and the value of the osmotic 
pressure are within say 0.1 per cent. of each other, then the value 
of the diffusion pressure would obviously also be known within 
that limit. The calculation of diffusion pressure in such a man- 
ner, however, obviously involves an a priori knowledge of 
the amount by which the numerical values of the two pressures 
differ from each other for the solution in question and there is 
no very reliable method for determining this except by means of 
the direct determination of the diffusion pressure itself, which 
can be accomplished by means of rate-of-diffusion measurements. 
The measurement of the rate of diffusion of the solute in a given 
solution is, in fact, the only safe and certain method for deter- 
mining its diffusion pressure.

10. The General Boiling-point Law.—lIf to a solution (of a 
non-volatile solute) at its boiling point, Tz, we add dN, moles of 
solute, thus increasing its mole fraction by da; and decreasing that 
of the solvent by dz, then the decrease, — dp, in the vapor pres- 
sure of the solvent will, according to equation (18), be

From equation (10, XII) we obtain 7, = Ty, + Alg and dT; = 
d(At;). Making these substitutions in equation (34) we have 
Sa ae log. « (35) d(Ats) = 
In order to integrate this equation it is first necessary to 
express L, as a function of Ats which can be done thermody- 
namically in terms of the specific heats of the pure solvent in 
the liquid and vapor states respectively. 
If L, in a given case can be regarded as practically constant 
over the range covered by Afz, the integral would be

In Fig. 31 a comparison is shown between the values of Atg 
calculated from the general integral of equation (35) and those 
obtained by direct measurement in the case of some solutions 
in benzene. 
11. Dilute Solutions.—With the aid of Maclaurin’s Theorem 
the integral of equation (35) can be obtained in a form in which 
the boiling-point raising, Atz, is expressed as a power series in 
the mole fraction, x1, of the solute (cf. equation 26) and if 2 is 
small enough the terms of the series which contain its higher 
powers can be neglected in comparison with the term containing 
its first power. If this is done, the series-integral reduces to the 
expression, 
RT: RE Na 
oD NEING 
This is frequently the most convenient form of the equation to 
employ for dilute solutions. If the solution is so dilute that Ni (37)
-P-A-G-E-229
  Sec. 11] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 201 
can be neglected in comparison with N in the denominator, we 
may write 2 
Atz = as a (approx.) (38)   
and if we let N, be the number of moles of solute in 1000 grams 
of solvent this equation becomes 
MRT 52 tp = (eco 1000L, 
where M is the molecular weight of the solvent. The quantity 
in the parenthesis is evidently composed of constants which are 
characteristic of the solvent only, and are quite independent of 
the nature of the solute. This parenthesis is called the molal 
boiling-point raising for the solvent in question and is represented 
by the symbol, ks. Equation (39) may, therefore, be written 
Ats = ksN, (approx.) (40) 
In using equations (36), (37), and (40) it should be remembered 
that the last two are only approximate ones and that except for 
very small values of At, the three equations will give somewhat 
different results in a molecular weight calculation. In fact if 
either equation (37) or equation (40) is employed, due regard 
must be given to their limitations in comparison with the 
accuracy with which the value of At, is measured and the desired 
accuracy in the molecular weight, for the case in question. For 
example, suppose that in order to determine the molecular weight 
of a substance in aqueous solution at 100°, the boiling-point 
raising for the solution is determined; and suppose that a solution 
containing 200 grams of the substance in 1000 grams of water 
gives Atz=1.000°, accurate to 0.001°. If we calculate the mo- 
lecular weight of the substance, we find 97.2 from equation (86), 
98.6 from equation (37), and 102.2 from equation (39 or 40). 
If an accuracy of 1 per cent. is desired, it is evidently necessary 
to use equation (36) in calculating the value of M, in this 
instance. The use of equation (39) would give a result in error 
by 5 per cent. 
If benzene were the solvent instead of water and if 38.73 grams 
of the substance dissolved in 1000 grams of benzene gave Ats= 
1.000° accurate to 0.001°, then the calculated values of M, ) Ns (approx.) (39)
-P-A-G-E-230
  202 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. X1V 
would be 97.2 from equation (36), 98.5 from equation (37), and 
101.6 from equation (39 or 40), very nearly the same values as 
in the case of water. 
Problem 9d.—Perform the calculation indicated above for the same sub- 
stance dissolved in alcohol, whose heat of vaporization at the boiling point, 
79.8°, is 9990 cal. per mole. 
In practice equation (40) is usually employed in molecular 
weight determinations by the boiling-point method and the 
constant, ks, is determined by first finding the value of At, for 
a solute of known molecular weight, and then solving equation 
(40) for kg. This empirical value of kg is then employed in 
calculating the value of M, for a solute of unknown molecular 
weight. This method of operation usually gives a more accurate 
value of M; than is the case when kz is calculated from Ly, 
owing to a partial compensation of errors. In general, however, 
it is better and is always safer to employ equation (37) or better 
still equation (36) and to determine L,, if necessary, by a boiling 
point determination with one or more solutes of known molecu- 
lar weights. For further details concerning the B.P. law and 
its use in determining molecular weights see Jour. Amer. Chem. 
Soc., 41, 736 (1919).

A solution made up of two components, A and B, has at least 
two freezing points, one being the temperature at which the solu- 
tion is in equilibrium with pure crystals of component A, and 
the other the temperature at which it is in equilibrium with pure 
crystals of component B. The freezing-point diagram for such a 
system will therefore consist of two curves, one of which repre- 
sents the temperatures at which solutions of varying composition 
are in equilibrium with crystals of component A, and the other 
of which represents temperatures at which the solutions are in 
equilibrium with crystals of component B. Such a diagram is

two curves intersect each other is called the eutectic point and 
is the temperature at which a solution having the composition

dition can exist. For an ideal solution the two freezing point

  The curves shown in this figure are frequently called solubility 
curves as well as freezing point curves. The reason for this dual 
naming is the following: If we take any point, P, on the naph- 
thalene curve (Fig. 33), the ordinate of this point represents the 
temperature at which a solution having the composition given  
-P-A-G-E-234
  206 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XIV 
by the abscissa will begin to deposit crystals of pure naphthalene 
when it is cooled down from some higher temperature. In 
other words it is the freezing point of the solution with respect to 
naphthalene. On the other hand, if we take a quantity of pure 
liquid diphenyl and shake it with an excess of naphthalene crystals 
at the temperature corresponding to the ordinate of the point, 
P, the naphthalene will “dissolve” in the diphenyl until the com- 
position of the resulting solution reaches the value given by the 
abscissa of the point, P. The quantity of naphthalene which 
dissolves under these conditions is called the solubility of naph- 
thalene in diphenyl at the temperature in question. Obviously 
the curve shows how this solubility varies with the temperature. 
Hence the name “‘solubility curve.” Solubility may be expressed 
in any one of the various ways in which composition of a solu- 
tion is expressed, as explained in Section 5 of Chapter XI. 
Problem 16.—Calculate the solubility of naphthalene in benzene at 0°C.

This problem is given in order to emphasize the fact that, at 
any given temperature, the solubility (expressed as the molecular 
fraction of the molecular species in question) of any pure crystal- 
line substance in a liquid with which it forms an ideal solution 
depends only upon the heat of fusion and the melting point of 
the crystalline substance in question and is not dependent upon 
the particular liquid in which it is dissolved. 
If two non-polar substances do not form an ideal solution with 
each other, then the solubility of A in B is less than the calculated 
value when the internal pressure (IV, 9) of B is less than that of 
A, and vice versa. The difference between the two internal 
pressures must be fairly large however (ca. 10 per cent.) before 
significant deviations from the laws of Ideal Solutions are pro- 
duced, as may be seen by comparing the positions of benzene, 
diphenyl, and naphthalene, in Table XIII. 
If the melting point and the solubility, x;, of a non-polar so- 
lute, A, in a non-polar solvent, B, are known, then these two 
points will determine the locus of the straight line which would 
be obtained by plotting log x: against r (Cf. eq. 47).¢ If the 
two substances form an ideal solution with each other, the slope 
of the straight line will evidently be — Ly. (Cf. eq. 47.) If 
they do not form an ideal solution with each other, then the 
curve obtained cannot be a straight line throughout its whole 
course but will be such over a considerable range. Over that 
range the slope of the line will be determined by the magnitude 
of the heat of solution of the solute, A. In the absence of heat- 
of-solution data the values of the internal pressures of the 
solute A and the solvent B may be advantageously employed 
in order to predict the slope of the solubility line. Thus 
Hildebrand® has found that the slopes of the solubility lines for 
solutions of A in a series of liquids follow the order of the in- 
ternal pressures of these liquids, being steeper than — Lp for 
liquids of smaller internal pressure than A and vice versa. 
Problem 16a.—Calculate the temperature and composition of the ternary 
eutectic in the system benzene-diphenyl-naphthalene.

polar. Cf. Braham, Jour, Amer, Chem, Soc., 41, 1715 (1919),

13. Freezing Points of Dilute Solutions——When the mole 
fraction of the solute is small we may integrate equation (44) 
by means of Maclaurin’s Theorem in exactly the same way as 
in the case of the corresponding boiling point equation and obtain 
the analogous equations, 
RT? RTs? Ny Aty = Ce a= ie eSNG (approx.) (48) 
RTr,? Ni Meret N (approx.) (49) 
MRT»,? i 5 Aty = 000L», = (approx.) (50) 
and Atr = kN, (51) 
which correspond exactly to the boiling point equations (37), 
(38) ,(39) and (40) and are applicable under analogous conditions. 
The constant, kr, is called the molal freezing point lowering 
for the solvent ’in question. Equations (49-51) are usually 
known as the Raoult-van’t Hoff equations. 
In words equation (51) states that as the solution becomes more 
and more dilute the molal freezing point lowering, Re » should iV, 
approach a constant, kr, which is characteristic of the solvent 
and which can be calculated from the relation, 
bp = MRT 5 ke [008 fin, (52) 
For aqueous solutions we have, M = 18, R = 1.985 (see II, 7), 
Ty, = 0° + 273.1°, = 273.1°, and Ly, = 18 X 79.60 cal. (see X, 
6) and hence ky = 1.86°. Bedford® determined directly the 
AE 2 3 value of the ratio, No for a series of cane sugar solutions of con- 
1 
centrations ranging between 0.005 and 0.04 molal and found it to 
be constant within the limits of experimental error and equal to 
1.86°. (See Fig. 36.) 
For aqueous solutions of substances such as the alcohols and 
sugars which resemble water somewhat, the thermodynamic 
environment may be expected to remain approximately constant

up to concentrations as high as one or two weight-molal, and

Theorem this general equation can be put in the form of a series.

are substituted, the two expressions,

are obtained. For ideal solutions in which water is the solvent 
these expressions are accurate to 0.001° provided At, is not 
greater than 7°. 
In Fig. 34 is shown the graph of these equations together with 
the observed values of Aty for methyl and ethyl alcohols and for 
cane sugar. ‘The agreement in the case of the alcohols is very 
good but the observed points for cane sugar fall below the theo- 
retical curve. If, however, we assume that cane sugar exists 
in solution in the form of the hydrate, Cy2H22011-6H.O, and 
calculate the mole fractions of this hydrate by means of equation 
(23) the points thus obtained (dotted circles in the figure) fall 
exactly on the theoretical curve, thus confirming the osmotic pe 
pressure results for these solutions (see Table XVII). The / 
results for the alcohols indicate that they are either not hydrated~ 
in aqueous solution or else that the degree of hydration does 
not exceed that of a monohydrate. The data do not warrant 
a more exact conclusion than this owing to the assumption of 
18 as the molecular weight of water. 
Problem 17.—Calculate the freezing point of a weight molal solution of 
chloral hydrate, CCl;COH-H.0, in water. 
Problem 18.—From the data given in Table XIX calculate the volume 
of methane, CH, (measured under standard conditions) which must be 
dissolved in 1000 grams of benzene in order to lower its freezing point 0.6°. 
14. The Solubility Law for Dilute Solutions.—In the case of 
dilute solutions the term freezing-point curve is usually restricted 
to the curve representing the temperatures at which solutions of 
varying composition are in equilibrium with the pure crystalline 
solvent; while the term, solubility curve, is applied only to the 
curve which represents the compositions of solutions which at 
different temperatures are in equilibrium with the pure crystals 
of the solute. In the former case the heat of fusion of the sub- 
stance present in the crystalline state (7.e., the solvent) is iden- 
tical with its heat of solution in the ‘dilute solution,” for by 
definition (XIII, 3) this solution has the same thermodynamic 
environment as that which prevails in the pure liquid solvent. 
In the latter case, however, this condition is not true except for 
ideal solutions, for the thermodynamic environment in a dilute 
solution is in general very different from that which prevails 
in the pure liquid solute. Equation (41) applies to both cases 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  Suc. 15] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 211 
but in the latter case in place of Ly, the molal heat of fusion of 
the solute crystals, we must write Ls, the molal heat of solution 
of these crystals in enough solvent to form a “dilute solution.” 
Equation (41) would, therefore, read

or 
d log. x Li.

where T' is the temperature at which the crystals of the solute

tion of the solute is a; and Ls. is the heat absorbed when one mole 
of the solute crystals is dissolved in enough of the solvent to 
form a “dilute solution.”

iodine at 40°? 
15. The Application of the Solution Laws to the Interpretation 
of Processes Occurring within the Solution. (a) The Dis- 
tribution Laws.—Since all of the solution laws discussed in this 
chapter involve the molecular weight of at least one of the con- 
stituents, they are made the basis for the determination of molec- 
ular weights in solution. In employing the laws for this purpose 
the assumptions implied in their derivation and the exact signifi- 
cance of the quantities which they involve must be kept clearly in 
mind. Thus in using any one of the distribution laws it must 
always be remembered that these laws are derived only for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
212 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XIV 
distribution of a given molecular species and it is the mole fraction 
or concentration of the molecular species in question which 
belongs in the equation of the law and not the total mole fraction of 
the solute, if the latter happens to be made up of more than one 
molecular species. For example, when acetic acid is in dis- 
tribution equilibrium between water and benzene there are 
present in the system the two molecular species, CH;COOH and 
(CH;COOH). and each species will distribute itself between the 
two phases in accordance with the distribution law and will have 
its own characteristic distribution constant. But if we were to 
substitute in the distribution law (equation (15)) the mole 
fraction of acetic acid in each phase, arbitrarily calculated on 
the assumption that it exists only as CH*COOH-molecules in 
both phases, we would find that the “distribution constant” thus 
calculated was far from being constant. In other words, the 
law would apparently not be obeyed. The failure of the law in 
such a case would be only an apparent one, however, owing to 
the fact that we have through ignorance not substituted the 
proper values in the equation. We have an example of a devia- 
tion of -this character in Table XVI where the values of the 
calculated distribution constant are seen to decrease slightly 
but steadily as C,, increases. It is known from independent 
evidence, however, that the mercuric bromide is partially dis- 
sociated in the water layer and that the degree of this dis- 
sociation increases with the dilution of this layer, that is, it 
increases as C,, decreases. The result is that the true value of 
C. for the HgBre-molecules is in reality less than the total 
concentration of mercuric bromide in the water layer by an 
amount which is proportionally greater the smaller C,, and this 
is sufficient to account for the slight apparent deviation from 
the law shown in Table XVI. 
(b) The Osmotic, Freezing Point, and Boiling Point Laws. 
With reference to those solution laws which involve one of the 
colligative properties of the “solvent’’ (the freezing point, boiling 
point, and osmotic pressure laws) it should be remembered that 
in the equations of these laws (equations 25 to 29, 37 to 40, and 
48 to 51) ) the quantities x,, N;, and Cj, referring to the amount 
of the solute molecules, signify (as is evident from the derivation 
of these equations) the total mole fraction or concentration of
-P-A-G-E-241
Suc. 15] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 213 
all species of solute molecules in the solution and not the value for 
some one of these molecular species as was the case for the dis- 
tribution laws. For example, if one gram molecular weight of 
acetic acid (CH;COOH) were dissolved in 1000 grams of benzene, 
the quantity N, in equation (51) would be unity provided all of 
the acetic acid when in solution existed in the form of CH;COOH- 
molecules. If, however, half of it were in the form of (CH3- 
COOH)2 molecules, the solution would actually contain 
0.25 gram molecular weight of (CH;COOH).-molecules and 0.5 
gram molecular weight of CH;COOH-molecules or altogether 
0.75 gram molecular weight of solute molecules and this is the 
value for N; which would then belong in equation (51). Since 
the molecular condition of the acetic acid in the benzene is not 
known in advance we could evidently obtain some light upon this 
question by measuring the freezing point lowering produced hy 
known quantities of acetic acid and then calculating the value 
of N, and hence the molecular weight by means of equation (51). 
(c) Molecular Weights in Solution—By the investigation 
of the behavior of solutions with reference to the solution laws 
the following facts regarding the molecular weights of substances 
- in solution have been ascertained; (1) Almost all substances 
(except salts, acids and bases) when dissolved in water, alcohol, 
ether, acetic acid, or in general any solvent containing oxygen 
in its molecule have either the same molecular weight as they 
have in the gaseous state or a greater molecular weight due to 
the fact that they have united with some of the solvent toform 
a solvate. (2) The same statement is true of almost all organic 
substances (except those which contain an hydroxyl group) 
when dissolved in any solvent. (8) Polar organic compounds 
when dissolved in non-polar organic liquids are apparently asso- 
ciated (III, 5,) at least partially, in the solution. (4) Salts, acids, 
and bases in many solvents, especially in water, have apparently 
molecular weights smaller than those corresponding to their for- 
mulas, that is, they are dissociated, at least partially, into smaller 
molecules. This dissociation, known as electrolytic dissociation 
(I, 2g), and the properties to which it gives rise will form the 
topic of the next division of our subject. 
(d) The Interpretation of Experimental Data.—Probably the 
greatest source of uncertainty in the use of the solution laws for
-P-A-G-E-242
ee eT ee a ee 
214 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XIV 
interpreting the processes occurring within a solution lies in the 
difficulty of distinguishing between apparent divergencies from 
the laws, such as those described above, and real divergencies 
resulting from the fact that the thermodynamic environment 
within the solution is not constant. Frequently divergencies 
from both sources are present simultaneously and it is necessary 
to use great caution in drawing conclusions in such instances and 
to confirm any conclusions drawn by evidence from sources of 
an entirely different character. The interpretation of scientific 
data with the help of a set of derived relationships such as the 
laws of solutions cannot be intelligently made unless the deriva- 
tion of the laws and all of the assumptions involved therein are 
clearly understood by the one who is attempting to employ them. 
The literature of chemistry unfortunately abounds with examples 
illustrating the truth of this maxim and it is for this reason that 
so much space and attention have been devoted to the derivation 
of the solution laws in this chapter. 
It may be well to mention also at this point a not infrequent 
error in logic made by beginners. Suppose, for example, that 
postulating A and B as true we can demonstrate by purely logi- 
cal reasoning the truth of C as a necessary consequence. Evi- - 
dently then if we are able to prove by experiment that A and B 
are true, we at the same time establish the truth of C. Suppose, 
however, that we are able to show by direct experiment that C 
is true. It by no means follows from this that A and B are 
true, however. Before we are justified in drawing this conclusion 
we must first demonstrate that A and B are the only possible 
or reasonable assumptions from which the truth of C can be 
shown to follow. In other words if a derived relation, such as 
one of the solution laws for example, is found experimentally to 
hold true for a given case, it by no means necessarily follows 
that the assumptions on the basis of which the relationship was 
derived also hold true for that case. 
Problem 20.—Show that equations (28, 29, 38, 39, 49 and 50) are inde- 
pendent of the molecular weight of the solvent and that hence no information 
concerning the molecular weight of a solvent can be obtained from freezing 
point, boiling point or osmotic pressure measurements of dilute solutions. 
Problem 21.—A certain molecular species in dilute solution is in distri- 
bution equilibrium between two solvents. If equation (9) holds true for the

  Sec. 16] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 215 
vapor of this species above the two solvents show that equation (16),

the relations, p: = iNi + k'sNi? and p2 = k,N2 + k’2N,?, hold true for the 
vapor pressures of the solute from the two liquid phases respectively, show   
= const., must also hold true. If equation (9) is not true but if instead 
N that the relation ve = const., will still hold true within 0.1 per cent. for all 2 
eases in which Ge = ee ess ) Ni } 0.001. 
Problem 22.—Two liquids, A and B, when shaken together dissolve in 
each other forming two nonmiscible solutions. Show with the aid of 
thermodynamics (X, 10) that neither substance can obey the vapor pressure 
law of Ideal Solutions (equation 3) in both solutions; in other words, that two 
liquids cannot form an Ideal Solution with each other unless they are mis- 
cible in all proportions.   
Tue Laws or SuRFACE SOLUTIONS 
16. Surface Tension, Composition and Adsorption.—By pro- 
ceeding exactly as in section 6 above but using equation (18, 
XII) instead of (15, XII) we obtain the Gibbs equation, 
dy = af dlog.« = — gRT dlog. x (59) 
analogous to equation 19. In words this equation states that a 
constituent which lowers the surface tension will be adsorbed, 
z.e., concentrated, in the surface film of the solution and vice 
versa. 
Before this equation can be integrated some other relation 
connecting two of the variables y, « and So must be known. 
The only general relation which holds for all concentrations is the 
one for ideal solutions which is 
9, = ee 0 (60) 
and the integral for this case is 
y = const. (61) 
or in words, the surface film of an ideal solution has the same com- 
position as the interior and y is independent of a. 
By use of empirical relations connecting y and 2, integrals cov- 
ering special cases can, of course, be obtained. Weshall consider 
here only two cases met with in dilute solutions. It must be
-P-A-G-E-244
216 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XIV 
remembered that equation (59) is itself applicable only to solu- 
tions of constant thermodynamic environment. 
17. Dilute Solutions with Unsaturated Surface Films.—In 
dilute solutions of a solute which lowers the surface tension of the 
solvent, the solute molecules will be adsorbed in the surface 
layer and for values of g considerably below the saturation value 
we find that q is proportional to z, which is the relationship we 
should expect from kinetic considerations. 
Problem 23.—Show that the integral of equation (59) for this case is 
yo—-y =F, =q, RT (62) 
where ¥o is the surface tension of the pure solvent. 
F is evidently the force with which the adsorbed molecules 
tend to spread out over a larger surface. It has been previously 
discussed (XIII, 5) under the name surface-diffusion-pressure. 
Note the similarity between equation (62) and the equation 
po =CRT, for volume-diffusion-pressure (XIV, 9c) which has the 
same form as the perfect gas law. 
18. Dilute Solutions with Saturated Surface Films.—As the 
concentration of the solution increases the molecules adsorbed on 
the surface, approach one another and, just as in the case of a 
gas (cf. II, 10), their attractions for one another eventually 
become appreciable and the simple “gas-law’’ equation is no 
longer obeyed. The surface adsorption increases more slowly 
than the mole fraction in the solution and eventually the surface 
will become saturated with the adsorbed solute molecules, that is, 
the surface diffusion-pressure will reach its saturation value and 
the solute molecules in the surface will “precipitate out” as a 
“Viquid” or “solid” surface film. (cf. XIII, 5). 
The surface concentration g now becomes a constant independ- 
ent of y and if we integrate equation (50) for this case we obtain 
mn — 7 = “RT loge x (63) 
where 7; is the integration constant. In words, this equation 
states that the surface tension of the solution is a linear function 
of the logarithm of the mole fraction of the solute, which accords 
with the results of experiment.

CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS IN GENERAL 
19. Solutions of Variable Thermodynamic Environment.— 
Whenever the thermodynamic environment in a solution varies 
with its composition, the laws developed in the preceding sections 
of this chapter are no longer applicable. The magnitude and 
direction of the departure from these limiting laws in any given 
case depends upon the natures of the constituents of the solution 
and for this reason a satisfactory quantitative theory for solutions 
in general has not yet been developed (cf. XII, 9), but a partial 
solution of this more general problem may possibly be secured 
after a more thorough study of the internal pressure data for 
liquids has been completed. In working, therefore, with solu- 
tions in which the thermodynamic environment cannot be re- 
garded as constant (and this is the case with most solutions), 
each solution must be treated as a problem by itself and the 
quantitative relation connecting some one of its colligative prop- 
erties (the vapor pressure, for example) with the composition 
must be determined by direct experiment. The other relations 
can then be derived with the aid of thermodynamics. Although 
a quantitative theory for solutions in general is lacking, there 
are a few useful principles of a qualitative nature which are 
applicable to all solutions and which are of considerable practical 
assistance in the intelligent carrying out of some of the opera- 
tions to which solutions are subjected in the laboratory and 
the industries. We shall discuss two of these briefly. 
20. The Theory of Distillation—The boiling point-composition 
curves for homogeneous liquid mixtures may be conveniently 
divided into three types which are illustrated in Fig. 35. In 
type I the boiling point rises continuously from the boiling point 
of one pure constituent to the boiling point of the other. The 
curve for ideal solutions is of this type. Type II exhibits a 
maximum and type III a minimum boiling point at a certain 
composition. The latter type is characteristic of a solution of 
two liquids having widely different internal pressures. 
If a homogeneous liquid mixture of two constituents be sub- 
jected to fractional distillation at constant pressure, it is obvious 
that as the distillation progresses the more volatile portion of the 
mixture will collect in the distillate while the less volatile por-
-P-A-G-E-246
218 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuapr. XIV 
tion will remain in the residue. Or in other words the composition 
of the distillate, continuously approaches that of the liquid having 
the minimum boiling point, while the composition of the residue 
continuously approaches that of the liquid having the maximum 
boiling point. This is the principle at the basis of the theory 
of fractional distillation. Its application to specific cases will 
be understood by the solution of the following problems.

Problem 24a.—Each of the four solutions having the compositions in- 
dicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 35 is separated as completely as possible 
into two portions by fractional distillation at constant pressure. What 
will be the composition of each portion assuming that the boiling point curve 
is (1) of type I, (2) of type II and (38) of type III? 
Problem 24b.—In making up a standard solution of hydrochloric acid it 
is sometimes convenient to remember that if any hydrochloric solution of 
unknown strength be taken and boiled in the open air (760 mm.) for a suffi- 
cient length of time, it will attain the composition 20.2 per cent. HCl, 
boiling at 110°, and may then be diluted to the desired strength. Draw a 
diagram showing the character of the boiling point curve for HCl solutions 
in water. See Table XII for the additional datum required. 
21. Distillation of Nonmiscible Liquids——When liquids which 
are mutually insoluble (or practically so) in one another are heated 
together the mixture will boil when the sum of the separate vapor
-P-A-G-E-247
  Suc. 22] CONSTANT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT 219 
pressures of the components reaches a value equal to the external 
pressure on the mixture. This temperature can be readily de- 
termined if the vapor pressure curves of the component liquids 
are known. It will necessarily be lower than any of the boiling 
points of the components and may be far lower than some of 
them. This makes it possible to effect the distillation of a high 
boiling liquid at a temperature much below its boiling point with- 
out having recourse to vacuum distillation and is the principle 
at the basis of the process of distillation by steam which is fre- 
quently employed in the purification by distillation of such liquids 
as aniline, nitrobenzene, and oils which are insoluble in water. 
The composition of the distillate from such a distillation can be 
calculated by means of Dalton’s law of partial pressures (II, 6) 
if the vapor pressures of the pure components at the boiling point 
of the mixture are known. 
Problem 25.—A current of steam is passed at atmospheric pressure 
through a mixture of water and chlorbenzene (CsH;Cl). From the data 
recorded in the Landolt-Bérnstein tables, determine the boiling point of 
the mixture and the per cent. by weight of chlorbenzene in the distillate. 
22. The Theory of Fractional Crystallization—When a solu- 
tion is fractionated by distillation, the theory of the process is 
much simplified by the fact that only one gaseous phase is possible 
(I, 9) in the system. When the fractionation is carried out by 
crystallization, however, our problem may become a very com- 
plicated one owing to the large number of different crystal phases 
which are possible. The general principle underlying the theory 
of fractional crystallization may be stated as follows: When. a 
homogeneous liquid mixture of two constituents is subjected to frac- 
tional crystallization the composition of the mother liquor continu- 
ously approaches the liquid having the lowest crystallization tem- 
perature. ‘This liquid is usually a eutectic mixture of some kind 
although it may be one of the pure constituents. The crystals 
which separate during the fractionation may be either (1) one 
of the pure constituents, (2) a compound between the two, (8) 
mixed crystals containing both constituents, or (4) mixed crystals 
containing one of the constituents and a compound between the 
two. We shall not here enter upon the detailed discussion of
-P-A-G-E-248

connection with the discussion of the Phase Rule and its applica- 
tions (XXIV, 12).

CHAPTER XV 
THE COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS OF 
ELECTROLYTES 
1. The Molal Freezing Point Lowering.—We have already 
learned (XIV, 13) that the molal freezing point lowering 
‘At 
ee = ir) for any solvent should theoretically reach a constant 
limiting value in dilute solution and that for aqueous solutions 
this limiting value should be 1.86°. In the case of all aqueous 
solutions which do not conduct electricity this theoretical con- 
clusion has been completely and quantitatively confirmed by 
direct experiment, not a single exception to it having ever been 
discovered. But in the case of all aqueous solutions which do 
conduct electricity this conclusion is apparently never confirmed, 
since such solutions without exception give decidedly larger 
values than 1.86° for the molal freezing point lowering at in- 
finite dilution. These facts are illustrated graphically in Fig. 
36. In the case of sugar solutions the value of ky is constant 
and equal to 1.86° for all values of N; below 0.01. With salts 
of the types of KCl and MgSO, the values of ky are all larger 
than those for sugar and gradually approach the limiting value, 
3.72° (= 2 X 1.86°) as Ny decreases. The values for BaCle 
are still larger and approach a limit which is evidently close to 
5.58° (= 3 X 1.86°) while in the case of K;FeCy, the limiting 
value must evidently be close to 7.44° (= 4 X 1.86°). These 
figures are typical of those obtained with all solutions of sub- 
stances which conduct electricity. The limiting value of kp 
instead of being 1.86° is invariably some small exact multiple 
of this number. In other words the freezing point lowering 
is always much larger than the value corresponding to the 
molecular weight of the solute. 
2. The Other Colligative Properties——From the results ob- 
tained for the freezing point lowerings of aqueous solutions of

substances which conduct electricity it necessarily follows 
(see XII, 8) that the other colligative properties of these solu- 
tions, the osmotic pressure, the boiling point raising and the 
vapor pressure lowering, must likewise be abnormally large and 
this is completely confirmed by the results of experiment. Thus

the osmotic pressure of a 0.5 weight molal solution of KCl at 
25° has been found! to be larger than 20 atmospheres and its 
relative vapor pressure lowering is 0.014. The corresponding 
values for substances which do not conduct electricity are 12 
atmospheres and 0.009. 
These facts and a great many others concerning the behavior 
of solutions which conduct electricity find their only successful 
interpretation in the Ionic Theory which was first proposed by
-P-A-G-E-252
  224 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Onav. XV 
Arrhenius‘ in 1887. In the following pages the Ionic Theory will, 
therefore, be employed as the framework for the systematic devel- 
opment and presentation of our present knowledge of solutions 
of electrolytes. 
3. The Ionic Theory. (a) Electrolytic Ionization.—According 
to the Ionic Theory when a salt, such as KCl for example, is in 
solution in water, part of its molecules are split up or dissoci- 
ated in such a way that the valence electron (1, 2g) of the potas- 
sium remains attached to the chlorine atom which is thus charged 
with one unit of negative electricity while the potassium atom is 
left with a charge of one unit of positive electricity. During the 
process of solution each of these charged atoms attaches to itself 
a certain number of water molecules and the two electrically 
charged complexes thus formed are able to move independently 
of each other and are termed ions (1, 2g). It is the presence of 
these ions which gives to the solution its power to conduct elec- 
tricity and any substance which is capable of ionizing in this 
way is called an electrolyte. Positive ions are called cations 
and negative ions, anions. The dissociation or ionization of the 
potassium chloride may be represented symbolically by the fol- 
lowing reaction: 
K*Cl-(solid) + ag = KtCl--agss 
[K(H20) ml++[Cl(H20) ,]- (1) 
The symbol ag attached to the formula of a substance means 
simply that the substance is dissolved in a large amount of 
water. The groups [(K(H20)m]* and [Cl(H20),J- are the two 
ions. The numerical values of m and n in these expressions 
are not known and it is usually customary to omit the attached 
water in writing the symbol for an ion. Thus the ionization 
reaction for KCl in solution is usually abbreviated thus, 
KClssK* + Cl- (2) 
The character, $s, indicates that there is a chemical equili- 
brium (I, 10) between the two ions and the undissociated mole- 
cules, that is, the dissociation of the KCl at finite concentrations 
is not complete, a certain number of undissociated but comple-

tely polarized molecules always being present in the solution. 
These molecules are also probably in part hydrated. As the 
solution is diluted more and more, however, the number of 
undissociated molecules continually decreases and finally at 
infinite dilution the KCl is completely dissociated and for every 
mole of KCl which was originally dissolved there are actually 
present in the solution two moles of solute molecules, the two 
separate ions. The molal freezing point lowering of this solu- 
tion should, therefore, be just twice as great as the value for a 
substance like sugar whose molecules do not break up in solu- 
tion. The same is true of MgSO. which dissociates thus, 
MgSO, = Mgt* + SO — (3) 
the two ions in this instance being each charged with two units of 
electricity, since the sulphate ion retains both of the valence 
electrons of the magnesium atom. Barium chloride dissociates 
thus 
BaCl, = Batt + 2Cl- (4) 
giving one doubly charged barium ion and two singly charged 
chloride ions. One molecule of BaCl. when it dissociates gives, 
therefore, three solute molecules and its molal freezing point 
lowering at infinite dilution ought to be just three times 1.86° or 
5.58°. Similarly K;FeCy, dissociates thus 
K;FeCys = 3Kt + FeCys- ~~ (5) 
to give three singly charged potassium ions and one triply charged 
ferricyanide ion. Its molal freezing point lowering at infinite 
dilution ought therefore according to the Ionic Theory to be 
exactly four times 1.86° or 7.44°; all of which accords com- 
pletely with the experimental results displayed in Fig. 36. 
(b) Nomenclature and Types of Electrolytes—lIons are 
named from the atom or group of which they are formed. Thus 
all potassium salts give potassium ion K+ when they dissociate, 
all ammonium salts give ammonium ion NH¢", all chlorides in- 
cluding hydrochloric acid give chloride ion Cl-, all acids give 
hydrogen ion H*, and all hydroxides give hydroxyl ion OH-. 
Electrolytes are classified according to the character of their 
ions as uni-univalent (KCl, HCl, NH,NO;), which give two 
singly charged ions; uni-bivalent (BaCl,, H2SO., Ca(OH)s),

which give two singly charged and one doubly charged ion; bi- 
bivalent (MgSO., BaC20.), which give two doubly charged ions; 
uni-trivalent (FeCl;, NasPOs, K;FeCys), which give three 
singly charged and one triply charged ion; bi-trivalent (Fe2(SOx)s, 
Ba;(PO.)2) which give two triply charged and three doubly 
charged ions; tri-trivalent (FePO.), which give two triply charged 
ions; ete. 
Problem 1.—Write the dissociation reactions of the above electrolytes. 
Give also examples of still higher types and write their ionization reactions. 
Name the ions in each instance. 
4. Degree of dissociation.—If N, formula weights of an electro- 
lyte be dissolved in 1000 grams of water, a certain fraction of it 
will be electrolytically dissociated and this fraction is called 
the degree of dissociation, a, of the electrolyte at this con- 
centration. For a uni-univalent electrolyte the concentration of 
each species of ion in the solution will evidently be aN, and that 
of the un-dissociated molecules (1 — a)N,, moles per 1000 grams 
of water. The total concentration of solute molecules in this 
solution will, therefore, amount to 2eN, + (1 — a)N; or (1+ 
a)N, moles per 1000 grams of water. In other words the number 
of formula weights of a uni-univalent electrolyte dissolved in a 
given quantity of water must be multiplied by (1 + a) in order to 
obtain the actual number of moles of solute in the resulting solution. 
In order to calculate the value of a for a given case we might 
multiply the quantity Ny in any one of the solution laws by 1 + 
a and solve the resulting equation for a. In this way we would, 
for example, obtain from the freezing-point law for aqueous 
solutions (equation 53, XIV) the relation 
KS (1+e)™: “ : “a ‘ a= 00044+(1-+a)Ni = 0.009690(At 0.00425 Atr?) (6) 
from which we could evidently calculate a value for a from the ob- 
served freezing point lowering of the solution. The calculation 
of degree of dissociation in this manner, however, assumes (1) 
that the solute is not hydrated in solution, and (2) that the 
thermodynamic environment in the solution is the same as that 
which prevails in pure water, for these are the assumptions upon 
which equation (53, XIV) was derived. Neither of these as- 
sumptions is true, however. The ions and in many cases the   
 
-P-A-G-E-255
Sec. 4] PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS OF ELECTROLYTES 227 
undissociated molecules are known to be hydrated in solution and 
the whole behavior of solutions of electrolytes indicates that the 
thermodynamic environment even at fairly small ion concentra- 
tions (Cf. XIII, 3) may be quite appreciably different from that 
which prevails in pure water. 
The use in this manner, of any of the Laws of Solutions of 
Constant Thermodynamic Environment in order to calculate 
the degree of dissociation of an electrolyte has, therefore, no theo- 
retical justification. These laws have nevertheless been exten- 
sively employed for this purpose and when the values of a 
calculated in this way are compared with those obtained by the 
conductivity method (XVII, 2b) the agreement in many cases 
is so close as to make it probable that the two erroneous assump- 
tions mentioned above happen to produce errors which are op- 
posite in direction and which, therefore, partially compensate 
each other. Noyes* and Falk’ who have examined a large num- 
ber of electrolytes in this way* conclude that the degree of dis- 
sociation of uni-univalent strong electrolytes in aqueous solution 
at concentrations not exceeding 0.1 molal can as a matter of fact 
be calculated from the freezing point lowering of the solution with 
an accuracy of from 1 to 4 per cent. in most cases. (Cf. Table 
XXIX and XVII, 5.) We may, therefore, employ the solution 
laws in this way in order to compute approximate values for the de- 
gree of dissociation of uni-univalent strong electrolytes, remember- 
ing that in so employing them we are treating them merely as 
empirical equations. For this purpose equation (6) may be 
rearranged algebraically into the more convenient form.

Problem 2.—The degrees of dissociation of KCl, CsNOs;, and LiCl in 0.1 
weight formal solution at 0° as measured by the conductance method are 
0.86, 0.81 and 0.86 respectively. Calculate approximate values for the 
freezing points of these solutions. (Observed values are —0.345°, —0.325°, 
and —0.351° respectively.)

Problem 3.—The freezing point of a 0.1 weight formal solution of NaBrO; 
is —0.342°. Calculate an approximate value for a. 
Electrolytes which are dissociated to a large degree (50 per cent. 
or more in 0.1 normal solution) are called “strong electrolytes.” 
They include nearly ail salts and all of the so-called strong acids 
and alkalies. Electrolytes which are only slightly dissociated are 
called “weak electrolytes.” 
5. Complex Formation in Solution—Many electrolytes in- 
solution possess the property of uniting with other electrolytes 
or with non-electrolytes to form complex compounds which 
dissociate giving complex ions. Thus when KCN is added to a 
solution of AgNO; a reaction occurs which may be expressed 
stoichiometrically as follows: 
2KCN+ AgNO; = KNO;+ KAg(CN)2 (8) 
The complex salt KAg(CN)» dissociates thus 
KAg(CN)2.=K+t+Ag(CN).- (9) 
giving the very stable complex ion, Ag(CN).— 
Problem 4.—The freezing point of a 0.1 weight formal solution of KNOs 
is —0.33°. In an amount of this containing 1000 grams of water, 0.1 
formula weight of NH; is dissolved and the freezing point then drops to 
—0.51°. A second 0.1 formula weight of NH; depresses it to —0.69° 
and a third to —0.9°. If the same experiments be carried out with 0.1 
weight formal AgNO; instead of KNOs, it is found that the freezing point 
(—0.33°) of the AgNO; solution is not affected by the first two additions of 
NH; but that the third addition depresses it to —0.51°. The electrical 
conducting powers of the AgNO; and KNO; solutions are substantially 
unchanged by the additions of the NH;. What conclusions can you draw 
from these experiments as to the nature of the complex formed? 
Nors.—The use of KNO; in the first experiments is for the purpose of 
insuring the same thermodynamic environment as that which exists in the 
second set of experiments.

  CHAPTER XVI 
THE CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 
1. Classes of Electrical Conductors.—Solid and liquid con- 
‘ductors of electricity may be divided into two classes: (1) Purely 
metallic conductors in which the passage of the current is not ac- 
companied by a transfer of matter and produces no effect other 
than an increase in the temperature of the conductor: and (2) 
purely electrolytic conductors in which the passage of the cur- 
rent is accompanied by a simultaneous transfer of matter in 
both directions through the conductor. Aqueous solutions of 
electrolytes and fused salts are good examples of electrolytic 
conductors. 
Some interesting conductors which occupy an intermediate 
position between purely metallic and purely electrolytic con- 
ductors are also known.? In these cases part of the electricity 
which flows through the conductor carries no matter with it 
while the remainder does. The part of the electricity which 
passes through this intermediate class of conductors in the first 
way, that is, without being accompanied by a transfer of matter, 
may, by gradually altering the composition of the conductor, 
be varied gradually and continuously from 100 per cent (purely 
metallic conduction) to zero per cent. (purely electrolytic con- 
duction). Our two classes of conductors would seem, therefore, 
to constitute simply two limiting cases. As a matter of fact, how- 
ever, most conductors seem to belong exclusively to one or the 
other of these limiting cases, those of the intermediate or mixed 
character, of which solutions of sodium in liquid ammonia con- 
stitute an example, being comparatively rare. 
If a direct current is caused to pass through an electrolytic 
conductor between two pieces of metal, called the electrodes, 
the electrode at which the current enters the electrolytic conductor 
is called the anode and the other electrode is called the cathode. 
The passage of a current in this way through a purely electrolytic 
conductor is called electrolysis and is always accompanied by 
chemical changes of some kind at both electrodes.

2. The Mechanism of Metallic Conductance.—In our first 
chapter (I, 2h) mention was made of the fact that in metallic 
substances some of the electrons are able to move about from 
atom to atom within the body of the metal with comparative 
ease. When a difference of potential is applied to the ends of a 
piece of metal a stream of these electrons through the metal is 
immediately set up. This stream of electrons constitutes the 
electric current in the metal and the collision of these electrons 
with the atoms of the metal produces the temperature increase 
which always accompanies the passage of an electric current 
through a metal. The strength of the current for a given 
difference of potential varies with the nature of the metal and 
with the temperature, increasing as the temperature falls and 
becoming apparently infinite at the absolute zero. 
A metal carrying a current is surrounded by a magnetic field, 
and the direction and nature of this field would be the same 
whether the current in the metal were caused by the motion of 
positive electricity in one direction or by the motion of negative 
electricity in the opposite direction and before the nature of 
metallic conduction was understood, the ‘‘direction of the 
current” in a metal was arbitrarily defined as the direction in 
which positive electricity would have to flow in order to produce 
the observed magnetic effects. We now know, however, that the 
current is actually due to the motion of negative electricity, the 
electrons, so that we find ourselves in the rather peculiar position 
of defining the “direction of the current” in a metal as the 
direction opposite to that in which the electricity actually 
flows. 
A kinetic theory of metallic conductance which satisfactorily 
interprets the known facts has been advanced recently by 
Bridgman.® 
8. The Mechanism of Electrolytic Conductance.—When a 
difference of potential sufficient to cause a steady current, is 
applied to two electrodes dipping into a solution containing dis- 
solved electrolytes, all of the anions in the solution immediately 
start to move toward the anode or positive electrode while all of 
the cations start moving toward the cathode or negative elec- 
trode. The motion of these ions constitutes the current of 
electricity through the solution and the direction of the current in
-P-A-G-E-259
  
Src. 4] THE CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 231 
the solution is arbitrarily defined as the direction in which the 
cations move. . The quantity of electricity which is transported 
through the solution in this way is divided among the different 
species of ions in the solution in proportion to their numbers, 7 
the charges which they carry, and the velocities with which 
they move. The product of the number of charges on a given 
species of ion into the number of these ions and into the velocity 
with which they move through the solution under a unit potential 
gradient is evidently a measure of the current carrying capacity 
of this species of ion in the solution. 
4, The Mechanism of the Passage of Electricity between a 
Metallic and an Electrolytic Conductor. (a) Electrochemical 
Reactions.—Through any cross section of a solution containing 
electrolytes the current is carried by the ions of these electro- 
lytes and every species of ion in the solution, no matter how great 
a number of different species there may be, helps in carrying the 
current, each species in proportion to its current-carrying 
capacity (XVI, 3). In conducting the current from the solution 
to the electrode or vice versa, however, only a few, in many cases 
only one ion species is involved, namely, that species which 
most easily takes on or gives up an electron under the conditions. 
Since the current through the metallic portion of the circuit 
consists only of moving electrons it is clear that an exchange of 
electrons between electrode and solution must take place in 
some manner at the electrode surface. This exchange of 
electrons constitutes an electrochemical reaction, of which 
there are very many varieties. We shall consider a few such 
reactions. 
Case 1.—Let Fig. 37 represent an electrolytic cell composed of 
two silver electrodes dipping into a solution of silver nitrate. 
The cathode receives a negative charge from the dynamo, that 
is, a stream of electrons flows through the wire from the dynamo 
terminal to the cathode, and the negative potential of the 
cathode relative to the solution, therefore, rises. If this current 
is to continue flowing, these excess electrons on the cathode must 
be removed in some way by entering into an electrochemical 
reaction with some species of ion. ‘The reaction in this instance 
consists in a union of the electrons from the wire with the silver 
ions in the solution, which are thereby reduced to ordinary

silver atoms and deposited or plated out upon the electrode. The 
reaction may be written thus, 
UNG Gree) ra (1) 
At the anode the silver atoms on the surface of the silver electrode 
give up their electrons and enter the solution as silver ions, while

the electrons thus set free flow around through the wire to the 
positive terminal of the dynamo. This reaction, which may be 
written 
AG Cree ACE (2) 
is evidently the reverse of the one at the cathode and hence the 
electrolysis in this cell consists in the dissolving of metallic silver 
from the anode and the plating out of metallic silver upon the 
cathode.
-P-A-G-E-261
  Suc. 4] THE CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 233 
Case 2.—Let the cell in Fig. 37 consist of a silver anode and a 
silver chloride cathode, dipping into a solution of potassium 
chloride. A silver chloride cathode consists simply of a silver 
wire covered with a coating of solid AgCl. The electrode 
processes are as follows: The electrons which flow to the cathode 
from the dynamo terminal are removed by the following electro- 
chemical reaction: 
AgCl + (—) =Ag + Cl- (3) 
that is, the silver chloride is reduced to metallic silver, the chlo- 
rine atoms taking up the electrons from the wire and passing into 
solution as chloride ions. At the anode the reverse reaction 
occurs, 
Cl- + Ag = AgCl + (— ) (4) 
The chloride ions give up their electrons to the wire and unite 
with the silver electrode forming a coating of silver chloride 
over it. 
Case 3.—Let the cell in Fig. 37 consist of a platinum anode 
and a platinum cathode dipping into a solution containing a 
mixture of ferric sulphate (Fee(SO.)3 = 2Fet*+ + 380,-~) and 
ferrous sulphate (FeSO, = Fe++ + SO,--). The electrons com- 
ing to the cathode from the dynamo are removed from the 
cathode by the following electrochemical reaction: 
Fet++ + (—) = Fet+ (5) 
that is, the electrons are taken up by the ferric ions which thereby 
lose one of their positive charges and become ferrous ions. At 
the anode the reverse reaction occurs. 
(6) Characteristic Electrode Potentials.—Let the cell in Fig. 
37 consist of a platinum anode and a platinum cathode dipping 
into a solution containing the following electrolytes: KCl, 
Na2SO., and LiNO;. The ions arising from the ionization of 
these salts will be the cations, K+, Na* and Lit and the anions, 
Cl-, SOs-- and NO,;-. In addition there are also present in 
every aqueous solution very small quantities of hydrogen ion 
Ht and of hydroxyl ion OH™ arising from the electrolytic dis- 
sociation of the water itself which takes place to a very slight extent 
according to the reaction 
H.0 = H+ + OH- (6)
-P-A-G-E-262
  234 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XVI 
Now as the electrons coming from the negative terminal of 
the dynamo begin to collect upon the cathode the potential 
between this electrode and the solution thereby increases and 
the negative electrons on the electrode are attracted by the 
positively charged ions in the solution in contact with electrode. 
If this potential difference is great enough and is continuously 
maintained by electrons coming from the dynamo, we have seen 
that a union between the electrons in the wire and one or more 
species of the ions in the solution will take place. In other words 
an electrochemical reaction will occur. Now in the present 
instance there are obviously at least four electrochemical reac- 
tions, any one of which might conceivably take place at our 
cathode, to wit: 
  Lit + (—) = Li (metal) (7) 
K++ (-—) = K (metal) (8) 
Nat + (—) = Na (metal) (9) 
or 2H+ + 2(—) = Hz (gas) (10) 
Which of these reactions will actually occur? 
In order to bring about a given electrochemical reaction at any 
electrode we must first create a sufficient potential difference in 
the desired direction, that is, we must make the potential dif- 
ference large enough to force the electrons to go in the direction 
desired. Now the potential difference necessary to accomplish 
this is a characteristic property of each electrochemical reaction 
and of the concentrations of the ions and molecules involved in 
that reaction as well as of the thermodynamic environment by 
which these ions and molecules are surrounded. This potential 
difference we shall call the characteristic electrode potential of 
the reaction. More explicitly, the characteristic electrode potential 
of a given electrochemical reaction under a given set of conditions 
is the potential difference which exists between the electrode and 
the solution when the two are in equilibrium with each other with 
respect to the reaction in question. Whenever, therefore, the 
potential difference at any electrode is kept either greater 
or less than the characteristic potential of some electrochemical 
reaction which is possible at that electrode, then this reaction
-P-A-G-E-263
Src. 4] THE CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 235 
will proceed continuously in the one direction or the other as long 
as the necessary potential difference is maintained. 
Now in the present instance, as the potential difference be- 
tween our cathode and the solution rises, due to the flow of elec- 
trons from the dynamo to the cathode, it will eventually reach a 
value which will exceed the characteristic electrode potential of 
some one of the four possible reactions represented by equations 
(7) to (10). When this happens the reaction in question will take 
place at our cathode. Of these reactions, the fourth one happens 
to have the smallest characteristic electrode potential under the 
given conditions, and hence the electrolysis of our solution results 
in the evolution of hydrogen gas at the cathode due to a de- 
composition of the water as represented by reactions (6) and (10). 
These may be added together and written thus, 
2H,0 + 2(—) = He + 20H- (11) 
showing that hydroxyl ion is produced in the solution as one 
result of the reaction. In other words, the solution in the 
neighborhood of the cathode becomes alkaline. If a very heavy 
current is passed through the solution, it may happen eventually 
that the electrons are sent to the cathode from the dynamo 
faster than they can be removed by reaction number (10). In 
that case the potential at the electrode will rise and it may become 
great enough to cause reaction (9) to take place to some extent 
simultaneously with reaction (10); since its characteristic 
potential stands next above that of reaction (10). If, however, 
any metallic sodium should separate on the electrode as a result 
of the occurrence of reaction (9), it would immediately proceed 
to react with the water, thus 
2Na + 2H.0 = 2Nat + 20H- + Hz (12) 
so that the final products would be the same as though reaction 
(10) were the only one which occurred. If the current density 
(i.e., amount of current per unit electrode surface) at the elec- 
trode is kept small, however, only reaction (10) will take place at 
this electrode. 
Let us now turn to the anode of our cell and see what will 
happen there. The reaction must of course be one which will 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  236 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XVI 
furnish electrons to the anode. Any one of the following would 
do this: 
2Cl- = Cl(gas) + 2(—) (18) 
Cl- + 3H.0 = ClO;- + 6H+ + 6(—) (14) 
280.-— = 820s-— +2(—) (15) 
or 40H- = O2 (gas) + 2H20 + 4(—) (16) 
Of all these possible reactions, however, the last one has the 
smallest characteristic electrode potential in our solution and is, 
therefore, the one which will take place at our anode. By adding 
together equations (6) and (16) we obtain the equation 
2H,0 = 4H+ + O2 + 4(—) (17) 
which represents the final result of the electrolysis at the anode. 
Gaseous oxygen is evolved and the solution around the anode 
becomes acid. 
The electrode products of the electrolysis with this cell come, 
therefore, entirely from the water itself and not at all from the 
dissolved salts. The current also is carried from electrode to 
solution and vice versa entirely by the ions of the water and not 
to any appreciable extent by the ions of the dissolved electrolytes. 
The current through the solution, however is practically all carried 
by the ions of the dissolved electrolytes because there are so few 
Ht-ions and OH--ions that their current-carrying capacity 
(XVI, 3) is entirely negligible. The reason these two species 
of ions can nevertheless carry all of the current between the elec- 
trode and the solution is because at the electrodes, as fast as 
these ions are used up by the electrode reaction, a new supply is 
continuously produced by the ionization of some more water ac- 
cording to reaction (6), since any chemical or electrochemical 
reaction can be made to proceed continuously in one direction 
provided one of the products of the reaction is continually re- 
moved or destroyed as fast as it is formed, and this is what hap- 
pens at our electrodes, Ht-ions being removed at the cathode 
and OH--ions at the anode. 
It not infrequently happens that two or more possible elec- 
trochemical reactions will, in a given solution, have practically 
the same characteristic electrode potentials. When this happens 
the reactions will take place simultaneously during the electrolysis  
-P-A-G-E-265
  Src. 4] THE CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 237 
and a mixture of products will be obtained. This happens, for 
example, during the electrolysis of a moderately strong solution 
of HCl with platinum electrodes. At the anode the two reactions 
2CI- = Cle (gas) + 2 (—) 
and 4OH- = Oz (gas) + 2HsO + 4 (—) 
occur simultaneously, a mixture of oxygen and chlorine gases 
being evolved at the electrodes. Even when their characteristic 
electrode potentials are quite different, mixed electrochemical 
reactions can be made to occur by forcing more current through 
the cell than one reaction can take care of, as in the example 
given above (p. 235). The actual products of the electrolysis 
of any given solution depend, therefore, greatly upon the condi- 
tions under which the electrolysis is carried out and a clean-cut 
single electrochemical reaction entirely free from even traces of 
other reactions is, as a matter of fact, rather difficult to bring

about in any prolonged electrolysis. In Table XX are shown 
some of the electrochemical reactions which occur during electro- 
lyses of aqueous solutions with platinum electrodes. 
Problem 1.—What conditions must prevail in a solution in order that an 
object which is made the cathode in the solution shall be plated with brass by 
electrolysis? 
(c) Voltaic Action.—In the Daniell cell a copper sulphate solu- 
tion containing a copper electrode is placed in contact (by 
means of a porous wall or partition) with a zinc sulphate solution 
containing a zine electrode. At each electrode there exists a 
potential difference between solution and electrode, which po- 
tential difference is the characteristic electrode potential at the 
electrode in question under the given conditions, the two electro- 
chemical reactions involved being respectively 
Cu — 2(—) = Cut 
and Zn — 2(—) = Zn** 
The total potential across the terminals of this cell (z.e., the 
potential difference between the two electrodes) will, therefore, 
be equal to the algebraic sum of the two characteristic electrode 
potentials plus any potential difference which may exist at the 
junction between the two solutions. Now in this particular 
cell it happens that the two characteristic electrode potentials 
are such that the total potential across the cell is about 1.1 
volts, the zinc electrode being negative with respect to the copper. 
If the two electrodes are connected externally by a wire, a 
eurrent of electricity will, therefore, flow through the wire from 
the copper to the zinc, and zine will dissolve at the anode and 
copper deposit on the cathode. The total reaction of the cell 
will be the algebraic difference of the two electrode reactions, 
which is 
Zn + Cut? = Zntt+ + Cu (18) 
When two electrodes are arranged in a cell so that the two char- 
acteristic electrode potentials are such that the cell is capable, 
as above, of producing an electric current in an external circuit, 
the current is said to be produced by voltaic action and the cell
-P-A-G-E-267
  Src. 4] THE CONDUCTION OF ELECTRICITY 239 
is a primary battery. Voltaic action and electrolysis by means 
of a current produced externally and forced through the cell are 
essentially identical phenomena, however, and obey the same 
laws. A reaction such as that represented by equation (18) 
will also evidently occur without the production of an external 
current if a piece of zine be simply dipped into a solution of 
a cupric salt (Cf. X, 9). 
(d) Normal Potentials and Normal Electrodes.—For a given 
cell, each of the two characteristic electrode potentials (which 
together with the potential at the liquid junction make up the 
total E.M.F. of the cell) depends upon the concentrations of the 
molecular and ion species which take part in the electrochemical 
reaction at the electrode, as well as upon the thermodynamic 
environment in the solution around the electrode. In writing 
the equation of an electrochemical reaction a line above a formula 
will hereafter be employed to indicate that the molecular species 
is present in the gaseous state, a line below the formula will be 
similarly used to indicate the crystalline state, while the absence 
of such lines will indicate that the molecular or ion species in 
question is present only in solution. The so-called “normal 
potential” of a given electrochemical reaction is the characteris- 
tic electrode potential for that reaction when all gaseous sub- 
stances involved in the reaction as written are present under a 
pressure of one atmosphere and all similarly involved molecular 
and ion species which are present only as solutes have each a 
concentration of one formula weight per liter. Thus the poten- 
tial of the ‘‘normal hydrogen electrode” is the potential at a 
platinum electrode saturated with hydrogen gas under a pressure 
of one atmosphere dipping into a solution containing hydrogen 
ion at a concentration of one formula weight per liter when 
equilibrium is attained with respect to the reaction, H, — 2(—) 
= 2H+; the potential of the “normal zinc electrode” is the 
potential at a zine electrode dipping into a solution containing 
zinc ion at a concentration of one formula weight per liter when 
equilibrium is attained with respect to the reaction Zn — 2(—) 
= Zn*+; the potential of a ‘normal calomel electrode’’ is the 
potential of a mercury electrode covered with a layer of crystal- 
line HgCl in contact with a solution containing chloride ion at a 
concentration of one formula weight per liter when equilibrium is

240 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuapv. XVI 
attained with respect to the reaction, Hg + Cl-—(—) =HgCl; 
and the potential of a “normal arsenious-arsenic electrode’ is 
the potential at any suitable electrode which is in electrochemical 
equilibrium with respect to the reaction, H;AsO;+H.0 — 2(—) 
= H3AsO, + 2H*, when each of the solute species is present at 
a concentration of one formula weight per liter; etc. 
By joining together the solutions surrounding any two normal 
electrodes by means of some suitable intermediate liquid (such as 
a solution of KNO;) a voltaic cell is formed (Cf. above, 4c) and 
the total electromotive force of such a cell will (except for the 
small potentials at the liquid junctions between the two electrode 
vessels) be equal to the algebraic sum of the normal potentials of 
the two electrodes. If one of the electrodes of such a cell is the 
normal hydrogen electrode, then the total electromotive force of 
the cell (after subtracting the liquid junction potentials) is 
arbitrarily taken as the normal potential of the other electrode, 
that is, in computing the values of the different normal electrode 
potentials the potential of the normal hydrogen electrode is 
arbitrarily taken as zero. 
In Table XXI are given the “hypothetical normal potentials” 
of a number of electrochemical reactions based upon the normal 
hydrogen electrode as zero. They are termed “hypothetical 
normal” because they have been computed from measurements 
at various concentrations on the assumptions: (1) that the 
equivalent conductance ratio (see XVII, 2b, equation 10) is a 
correct measure of the degree of dissociation of all electrolytes 
even for concentrations greater than normal; and (2) that the 
thermodynamic environment in all solutions even for concen- 
trations greater than one mole per liter is the same as it is in 
pure water; in other words the laws of dilute solutions (XIII, 3) 
are assumed to hold for all such solutions. Neither of these two 
assumptions can be regarded as correct, hence the expression 
“hypothetical normal” as applied to such values as those given 
in Table XXI. We are not at present in a position to calculate 
the true normal potentials of electrochemical reactions and, 
in view of this fact, it would be better to adopt some other basis 
(milli-normal potentials, for example) for computing and record- 
ing characteristic electrode potentials, but this has not as yet 
been done. A more complete table of “hypothetical normal”

From the data in Table XXI calculate approximately the potential of 
the cell in the first two cases. Predict also from the data in this table what 
will occur: (a) when a piece of copper is dipped into a normal AgNO; solu- 
tion; (b) when a piece of tin is dipped into a normal FeCl; solution; (c) when 
a piece of tin is dipped into a normal HCl solution; (d) when a piece of copper 
is dipped into a normal HCl solution; (e) when a piece of silver is dipped into 
anormal Pb(NO,)2 solution; (f) when a 2n solution of FeCl, is mixed with 
a solution of HMn0O,; (g) when solid iodine is shaken with a normal solution 
of KBr; (h) when pure gaseous chlorine is passed through a normal solution 
of KI. 
Every chemical reaction occurring in a solution can always be 
regarded as made up of two opposing electrochemical reactions 
and it can be shown to follow from the laws of thermodynamics 
that whenever equilibrium (I, 10 and XXII, 1) has been attained 
in such a reaction, the concentrations of all of the solute species 
involved must be such that the characteristic electrode potentials 
of the two opposing electrochemical reactions are equal to each 
other. 
(e) Concentration Cells.—If a half-cell consisting of any 
reversible electrode in equilibrium with an electrolyte at con- 
centration C; be connected through a suitable liquid junction 
with another cell of the same kind but with the electrolyte at 
concentration C2, the resulting cell is called a concentration 
cell and the E.M.F. of such a cell is a measure of the free energy 
of dilution of the solution from C; to C2 as well as a measure of 
the fugacity-product ratio for the ions of the electrolyte at the 
two concentrations. The cell, Hz | HCl 0.1n || HCl, 0.0In | Ha, 
is a hydrochloric acid concentration cell, the equilibrium between 
the hydrogen gas and the hydrogen ion in each half cell being 
brought about by the use of platinum electrodes over which the 
hydrogen is bubbled. The E.M.F. of the above concentration 
cell is given by the integral of the following thermodynamic

The brief treatment of the subject of characteristic electrode 
potentials in this section and the problems illustrating the sig- 
nificance and use of electromotive force data are given at this 
point in order that the student may appreciate the general nature 
of the processes involved in the passage of electricity across a 
boundary between a metallic and an electrolytic conductor. In 
practice it frequently happens that owing to the slowness of 
some electrochemical reactions the actual reactions which occur 
in electrochemical processes are not always those which one 
would predict from such data as those given in Table XXI. 
The phenomena of “passivity” and ‘‘over-voltage’’ and many 
other factors and relationships which must be understood in order 
to handle intelligently electrochemical problems are treated at 
length in books devoted to the special field of electrochemistry,' ? 
a field which will not be included within the scope of this book. 
5. Faraday’s Law of Electrolysis.—From the preceding dis- 
cussion of the mechanism of electrolysis it is clear that the 
chemical changes which take place at the electrodes are the 
result of the taking on or giving up of electrons by atoms, atom 
groups, and ions and that for every ion involved in this electrode 
process, one, two, or three, etc., electrons are also involved 
according as the ion carries one, two or three, etc., charges which 
must be neutralized, that is, according as the change in valence 
is one, two or three, ete., units. Hence for every electrochemical 
change involving one equivalent weight of a substance the same 
quantity of electricity will always be required and this quantity 
will be 
qe = Ne (20) 
or for N. equivalents of chemical change the quantity of electric- 
ity required will be 
q = NeN. (21) 
where N is Avogadro’s number and e, the charge carried by one 
electron, is called the elementary charge of electricity. 
If we put 
Ne=fF (22) 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  
  244 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cnar. XVI 
equation (21) becomes 
q=FN. (23) 
where Ff is a universal constant. The significance of this equa- 
tion may be stated in words as follows: Whenever an electric 
current passes across a junction between a purely metallic and 
a purely electrolytic conductor a chemical change or chemical 
changes occur the amount of which, expressed in chemical equiva- 
lents, is exactly proportional to the quantity of electricity which 
passes and is independent of everything else. This statement 
is known as Faraday’s Law of Electrolysis and was discovered 
by Michael Faraday* in 1833. The proportionality constant, 
F, in equation (23) is known as one faraday or one equivalent 
of electricity and is evidently the amount of electricity required 
to produce one equivalent of chemical change. The quantities, 
e and F (equation 22), evidently bear the same relation to each 
other that the weight of an atom does to the atomic weight of 
the element (I, 6). 
The value of the faraday has been very accurately determined® 
by measuring (with a silver coulometer) the quantity of electric- 
ity required to deposit one equivalent weight of metallic silver 
from a silver nitrate solution and also by measuring (with an 
iodine coulometer) the amount required to liberate one equiva- 
lent weight of iodine from a solution of potassium iodide. The 
result obtained was F = 96,500 (+ 0.01 per cent.) coulombs 
per equivalent. 
An apparatus arranged for the measurement of the amount of 
a given chemical change produced by an electric current is 
termed a coulometer (or sometimes a voltameter) and is em- 
ployed for measuring the quantity of electricity passed through 
a circuit. The two most accurate types are the silver coulometer 
and the iodine coulometer. In the former metallic silver is

England. Served as laboratory assistant to Sir Humphrey Davy and later 
became Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, London. He dis- 
covered benzene in 1825 and made a large number of important discoveries 
in electricity and magnetism. The experiments upon which he based his law 
of electrolysis are an interesting illustration of the keen insight which led 
Faraday to enunciate a general law upon what seems today to be very meagre 
and inaccurate data. (Faraday’s Experimental Researches in Electricity.

liberated electrolytically from a solution of potassium iodide, 
the amount liberated being determined by titration. 
6. The Elementary Charge of Electricity.—If either e or N 
can be directly measured it is clear that the other one can then 
be calculated by means of equation (22), since / is known. 
--When X-rays pass through air or any other gas, the gas be- 
comes ionized (1, 2h), that is, some of its molecules lose tempo- 
rarily one or more of their electrons and thus acquire a positive 
charge. These charged molecules are called gaseousions. These 
ions as well as the electrons liberated from them all possess the 
unordered, heat motion (II, 1) of the other molecules of the gas, 
that is, they dart rapidly about in all directions colliding with 
anything which may come in their path. If a tiny droplet of oil 
or mercury or some other liquid is introduced into an ionized 
gas, it will eventually collide with one of these rapidly moving 
ions and will capture and hold it, The droplet thus acquires a 
charge of electricity exactly equal to that possessed by the 
captured ion and from the observed behavior of the charged drop- 
let in an electric field, the magnitude of its charge can be meas- 
ured. In this way Millikan has succeeded’ in obtaining a very 
accurate measurement of the value of the elementary charge of 
electricity. His apparatus is shown in Fig. 38. 
By means of an atomizer A a fine spray of oil or other liquid 
is blown into the chamber D and one of the droplets eventually 
falls through the pin hole p into the space between the two con- 
denser plates, M and N. The pin hole is then closed and the 
air between the plates is ionized by a beam of X-rays from X. 
The droplet is illuminated through the windows g and ¢ by 
a powerful beam of light from an are at a, and is observed 
through a telescope at a third window not shown in the figure. 
The droplet eventually acquires a charge by collision with one 
of the ions of the gas and can then be caused to move upward 
or downward at will by charging the plates M and N with electric 
charges of the desired signs, by means of the switch 8. The speed 
of the drop under the influence of the electric field is directly 
proportional to the magnitude of its charge, and the observer 
watching the drop observes sudden changes in its speed due to a 
    
-P-A-G-E-274
  246 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XVI 
change in the charge of the drop brought about by the capture, 
now and then, of an additional ion with which it happens to 
collide. By measuring this change in the speed of the drop im- 
mediately after the capture of an ion and combining it with the 
speed of the drop when falling under the influence of gravity, 
the magnitude of the charge of the captured ion can be calcu- 
lated. From a very large number of experiments of this kind

Professor Millikan found that the charge carried by a gaseous 
ion is always equal to or is a small exact multiple of 1.59 < 10-19 
(+ 0.1 per cent.) coulombs and this is, therefore, the elementary 
charge of electricity, the charge of one electron. Substituting 
this value for ¢ in equation (22) above we find for N the value 
N = 6.062-10?* (+ 0.1 per cent.), and this method is the most ac- 
curate one which we have at present for determining the value 
of Avogadro’s number. (Cf. IX, 4 and XXVI, 11.)

strength of the current or simply the current, J, is defined by the 
equation 
_4 r=$ (24) 
where q is the quantity of electricity which passes through a given 
cross section of the conductor in the time ¢. By direct current is 
meant one in which the ‘direction of the current” (XVI, 2) is 
constant. A current whose direction periodically varies is called 
an alternating current. 
According to Ohm’s* Law and the nature of our definitions of 
electrical quantities, the value of a direct current through any 
homogeneous metallic or electrolytic conductor is equal to the 
electromotive force (E.M.F.), EZ, between the ends of the con- 
ductor, divided by the resistance, R, of the conductor, or 
E i= R (Ohm’s Law) (25) 
The reciprocal of the resistance is called the conductance, L. 
1 a R (26) 
The unit of conductance is called the reciprocal ohm or the mho. 
The conductance, L, of any homogeneous conductor of uni- 
form cross section is proportional to the area, A, of the cross 
section and inversely proportional to the length, 1, of the con- 
ductor, or = 
t= (27) 
The proportionality constant, L, is evidently the conductance of 
a conductor 1 em. long and 1 sq. cm. in cross section. It is 
called the specific conductance of the material of which the con- 
ductor is composed. It depends upon the chemical nature of 
the material, its temperature, pressure and physical condition. 
The reciprocal of the specific conductance is called the specific 
resistance, R.

In dealing with the conductance of solutions of electrolytes an 
additional quantity known as the equivalent conductance is 
also employed. The equivalent conductance, A, of any solu- 
tion of an electrolyte is defined as the conductance of that volume 
of the solution which contains one equivalent weight of the elec- 
trolyte, when measured between two parallel electrodes 1 cm. 
apart. (See Fig. 39.)

ductance of a solution containing C equivalents of electrolyte per liter are 
by the nature of their definitions, connected by the relation,

If the concentration C is expressed in moles per liter, the quantity defined 
by equation (29) is called the molal or the molecular conductance, and is 
then usually represented by the symbol, A, in case the molal and equivalent 
weights are different. 
Problem 4.—A cylindrical resistance cell 2 cm. in diameter is fitted with 
horizontal silver electrodes 4 cm. apart, and is filled with 0.1 normal silver

and the equivalent conductance.

to deposit 10.grams of silver in 60 minutes from a solution of silver nitrate?

Problem 8.—A silver electrode weighing x grams is made the anode in a 
hydrochloric acid solution during the passage of a current of 0.1 ampere for 
10 hours. After drying, the electrode together with the closely adherent 
layer of silver chloride is found to weigh 10 grams. Calculate x. 
Problem 9.—A cupric sulphate solution is electrolyzed with a copper 
cathode and platinum anode until 6.35 grams of copper are deposited. The 
gas evolved at the anode is measured at 25° over water whose vapor pressure 
at this temperature is 23.8mm. Barometric pressure = 752mm. (1) What 
volume does it occupy? (2) How much time would be required for the 
electrolysis if a current of 0.1 ampere were used? (3) What is the mass of 
the gas evolved? 
Problem 10.—A current of electricity is passed for 53 hours through an 
aqueous solution of Na,SO, between platinum electrodes. A silver cou- 
lometer connected in series shows a deposit of 10.8 grams of silver in this 
time. The gas evolved at the cathode in the Na2SQx, solution is collected 
and measured dry at 20° under a pressure of 756mm. (1) What volume will 
it occupy? (2) What is its mass? (3) What was the average current 
strength employed in the electrolysis? 
Problem 11.—A solution of cupric sulphate containing 5 grams of copper 
is allowed to stand in contact with an excess of bright iron tacks until all of 
the copper has been deposited. If the solution is now boiled with bromine 
water in excess and then with an excess of NH,OH and the resulting pre- 
cipitate filtered off, ignited, and weighed, how much will it weigh? 
Problem 12.—Twenty grams of bright copper gauze are allowed to stand 
in contact with 1 liter of a 0.05 normal silver sulphate solution until action 
ceases. The gauze is then removed, dried and weighed. How much does it 
weigh? The solution remaining, which may be assumed to contain only 
cupric sulphate, is electrolyzed between platinum electrodes in such a 
manner that copper only is liberated at the cathode. How much copper is 
deposited? The gas given off at the anode is mixed with an excess of hydro- 
gen (x grams) and exploded. The residual gas is measured over water at 
20 and 772 mm. and found to occupy a volume of 2240 ¢.c. Calculate x. 
The vapor pressure of water at 20° is 17.5 mm.

CONDUCTANCE AND DEGREE OF DISSOCIATION 
1. Equivalent Conductance and Concentration. (a) Ao 
Values.—Let one equivalent weight of an electrolyte dissolved 
in say ten liters water be placed between two parallel electrodes 
1 cm. apart and of indefinite area, as shown in Fig. 39. The 
conductance of this solution measured in this cell is by defini- 
tion (XVI, 7) its equivalent conductance. If the solution in the 
cell be now gradually diluted, the conductance will be observed 
to change and will eventually increase gradually and continuously 
and approach a definite limiting value at infinite dilution. This 
behavior is illustrated by the data in Table XXII.

In the case of the first two electrolytes (strong electrolytes, 
XV, 4) in this table the limiting value, Ao of the equivalent con- 
ductance shown in the last column is obtained by extrapolation 
from the preceding values, and although extrapolation is always 
a more or less uncertain process, the values obtained for strong 
electrolytes are usually fairly reliable (to 1 per cent. or better in 
most cases) because the extrapolation extends over a short dis- 
tance only, that is, the extrapolated value is not greatly different 
from the last measured value. In the case of the last two electro- 
lytes (weak electrolytes, XV, 4), however, the Ao values cannot 
be obtained in this manner owing to the very long extrapola- 
250

tion which would be necessary, for conductance measurements at 
concentrations below 0.0001 normal are exceedingly difficult 
to carry out with any accuracy. The Ao values for weak electro- 
lytes are, therefore, obtained by another method described below. 
(b) Ion Conductances.—The increase of A with dilution is 
interpreted by the Ionic Theory as follows: (1) With increasing 
dilution the degree of ‘dissociation (XV, 4) of the electrolyte in- 
creases and since this results in a larger number of free ions (cur- 
rent carriers) between the electrodes of the cell the conductance 
increases correspondingly. (2) The resistance to the movement 
of the ions through the solution decreases with increasing dilution 
thus causing an increase in conductance. For dilutions so great 
that the viscosity of the solution is essentially the same as that 
of the solvent, the increase in equivalent conductance is usually 
attributed to the first effect entirely although in recent years 
there has been a tendency on the part of some physical chemists! to 
ascribe all the increase to the second effect, that is, the electrolyte 
(in the case of strong electrolytes) is assumed to be not only 
completely ionized but also completely dissociated at all con- 
centrations and the increase in equivalent conductance with 
dilution is ascribed to some unknown factor which causes the 
ions to move faster as the dilution increases. 
On either or both hypotheses when a sufficiently great dilution, 
z.e., infinite dilution, is reached the equivalent conductance, Ao, 
is evidently the equivalent conductance of a solution containing 
one equivalent weight of each of the ions. The magnitude of Ao 
for an electrolyte will obviously depend upon the speeds with 
which the ions of that electrolyte move through the water, since 
the faster they move the more efficient they are as carriers of 
electricity, and for a given electrolyte Ao will obviously be made 
up of the separate equivalent conductances of the ions of that 
electrolyte. Thus the Ao values of the following electrolytes at 
18° are expressed by the equations

especially important in the case of weak electrolytes where the 
Ao values cannot be obtained by extrapolation from the con-

the ionization is still far from complete. (Cf. above and Table

Sec. 1] CONDUCTANCE AND DEGREE OF DISSOCIATION 253 
(c) Empirical Dilution Laws.—The relation between the meas- 
ured values of any two variables over any range can always be 
expressed by means of an empirical mathematical equation and 
the agreement between the measured values and those calculated 
from the equation can be made as close as desired by making the 
number of undetermined parameters (i.e., the number of con- 
stants which are to be evaluated from the experimental data) 
in the equation sufficiently large. In deriving empirical equa- 
tions of this character, a form which will express the experi- 
mental data within the accuracy of measurement over as wide a 
range as possible and with the smallest number of undetermined 
parameters, is usually sought. If the form of function used is 
at the same time simple and capable of being employed for a 
great variety of data of the same class and especially if it can be 
shown to have some theoretical basis or justification, so much 
the better. 
A number of such functions have, at various times, been pro- 
posed for expressing the relation between conductance and con- 
centration in the case of strong electrolytes and while no one of 
them covers the entire range of concentration each of them repro- 
duces the experimental values satisfactorily over a certain range 
and may therefore be used for interpolation purposes within the 
range; but no such function can be safely employed for extrapola- 
tion into a region where no experimental values exist, such extra- 
polation being, as a rule, the more uncertain, the farther away 
the extrapolated value is from the last measured value. 
As examples of such functions we shall mention here only two 
of the most recent ones. An equation proposed by Kraus* has 
been tested by Kraus and Bray? for a great variety of electro- 
lytes in many different kinds of solvents and has been found to 
be on the whole very satisfactory. It has the following form:

where 7/7o is the ratio of the viscosity (III, 6) of the solution to 
that of water at the same temperature and A"/no is called the 
“corrected’’ equivalent conductance. (Cf. Sec. 2c below.) The 
quantities &, k’, h and likewise Ao are empirical constants whose 
values are so chosen as to give the best agreement ee the 
calculated and observed conductance values. 
In the sixth column of Table XXIV are shown the values of 
A"/no calculated from the Kraus equation for KCl solutions at 
18°, using for the four empirical constants the values given at 
the head of the table. On comparing these values with the ob- 
served values for the same concentrations as shown in column 4, 
it will be seen that the agreement is very good except for concen- 
trations below 0.001 molal. By using a different set of para- 
meters (namely, Ao = 129.9, k = 0.001, k’ = 1.703, and h = 
0.52) Kraus showed that his equation could be made to agree 
with the observed values from C = 0.02 down to the lowest 
concentration for which measured values were available. Since 
the two equations overlap in the region between 0.001 and 0.02, 
they together make it possible to compute the value of A for any 
value of C between 2n and about 0.00002n with an accuracy of 
about 0.2 per cent. 
Bates* has proposed an equation of the same form as that of 
Kraus except that the logarithm of the left-hand expression is 
employed instead of the expression itself.

XXXIII). As illustrated by the figures in the last column of 
Table XXIV, the conductivity data for strong electrolytes below 
one ten-thousandth normal are also entirely in agreement with 
the Ostwald dilution law. We shall see later that this law can 
be deduced theoretically from the Second Law of Thermody- 
namics and the Solution Laws (XXII, 3b). 
Problem 2.—Calculate the specific conductance of 0.0075n KCl solu- 
tion at 18° using (1) the Kraus equation and (2) the Bates equation with the 
values of the constants given in Table XXIV, and (3) by use of a graph with 
Ao — A plotted against C. Calculate, using Ostwald’s dilution law, the 
specific conductance of 0.02n HC:H;O: solution at 18° using the data given 
in Table XXII. 
2. Degree of Dissociation and Conductance Ratio. (a) Ions 
and Ion-Constituents.—Consider a solution of a salt CA, of con- 
centration C equivalents per liter. The equivalent conduct- 
ance of this solution may be regarded as made up of two parts: 
(1) the equivalent conductance of the ion-constituent, C, and 
(2) the equivalent conductance of the ion-constituent, A, that is, 
A= A,+ Aq (2) 
The distinction between ion and ion-constituent should be clearly 
understood. The equivalent conductance (A.+) of C-ion re- 
fers to the conductance of one equivalent weight of the con- 
stituent C when all of it is in the form of ions, while the equivalent 
conductance (A.) of the zon-constituent C refers to that part 
of the conductance which is due to the constituent C, part of 
which may exist in the solution in the form of free ions and the 
remainder in the condition of undissociated molecules. It is evi- 
dent from the definitions of these two quantities that they are 
related to each other by the equations 
Ac = aAct (3) 
and Ag = aA (4) 
where A, and A, are the equivalent conductances of the ion- 
constituents, C and A, in a solution of the salt CA, a is the de- 
gree of dissociation (XV, 4) of the salt in this solution, and A+ 
and Aq are the two ion-conductances in this same solution. 
Act and A. will in general differ from Ao-+ and Aoa-, the ion- 
conductances at infinite dilution, because the ions in the salt 
solution will not in general be able to move with the same
-P-A-G-E-285
  
Suc. 2] CONDUCTANCE AND DEGREE OF DISSOCIATION 257 
velocity as in pure water, since the velocity with which ions move 
through any medium will depend upon the frictional resistance 
which they experience in that medium and this frictional re- 
sistance will in general be different in a salt solution from what it 
is in pure water. 
(6) The Calculation of Degree of Dissociation.—It may happen 
with a given solution that the resistance experienced by one of the 
ion species in moving through the solution is practically the 
same as that which it experiences in pure water. If, for example, 
this were the case for the cation, then it is evident that A.+ 
would be practically equal to Ao.+ and equation (3) would become 
ze (5) Ao   
a 
and it is evident that by means of this equation we could cal- 
culate the degree of dissociation of the salt in this solution 
granting that the assumption A.+ = Ao-+ is justified. 
The equivalent conductance (A., Aa) of any ion-constituent in 
a solution is by definition equal to the total equivalent con- 
ductance of the electrolyte in that solution multiplied by the 
fractional part of the current-carrying done by the ion-con- 
stituent in question in that solution. This fraction is called 
the. transference number (ne, Na) of the ion-constituent and the 
methods by which it is measured are described in the next chapter. 
We have, therefore, 
Ae ek (6) 
and hence equation (5) may also be written

the same resistance that they do in pure water, we then have

A ok (10) 
that is, under these circumstances the degree of dissociation of a 
uni-univalent electrolyte at concentration C is equal to the ratio 
of its equivalent conductance at this concentration, to its equiva- 
lent conductance at infinite dilution. Equation (10) is the one 
which has been most commonly employed for calculating degree 
of dissociation from conductance data but it is evident from its 
derivation that the equation would be valid only for those solutions 
in which both tons are able to move with the same speed as at 
infinite dilution. 
(c) The Viscosity Correction.—In cases where the above con- 
dition is not fulfilled attempts have been made to correct for the 
effect of frictional resistance, on the assumption that Stokes’ 
Law (IX, 3) is obeyed and hence that the equivalent conductance 
of an ion is inversely proportional to the viscosity (III, 6) of the 
medium through which it moves. This assumption leads to the 
equations .

corresponding to equations (8) and (10). The assumption is of 
doubtful validity, however. In fact a systematic investigation® 
of this subject has shown beyond question that Stokes’ Law is 
not in general applicable to the movement of an ion. Instead, 
the following empirical equation seems to hold very closely for 
nearly all the cases studied:

where h is an empirical constant whose value (instead of being 
unity for all ions, as Stokes’ Law would require) varies for the 
different ions between about 0.6 and 1.1 and for a given species 
of ion depends upon the nature of the molecules composing the 
medium through which the ion moves. These relations are illus- 
trated in Fig. 40 and Table XXV,

to be unity. For the ions of other electrolytes in pure solutions

where A, 7/70 and n are respectively the equivalent conductance, 
the relative viscosity, and the anion transference number of the

lent conductance of the chloride ion in pure water, and h is the 
fluidity exponent of this ion, assumed to have the same value for 
all concentrations of all of the above electrolytes. Granting the 
validity of the basic assumption as to the equality of a, it is evi- 
dent that the validity of the second assumption can be tested by 
ascertaining whether a single value for h will satisfy all of the 
above relationships at all concentrations. Mac Innes has 
shown! that this is actually the case. By taking h = 0.56 for 
the chloride ion at 18° and calculating a for each of the electroly- 
tes by means of equation (14) the values shown in column 6 of 
Table XXVI are obtained. For comparison, the corresponding   
A A : values of ie and of a are also shown since, as explained above, 0 070 
the second and more often the first of these is usually taken as 
a measure of a in lieu of sufficient data to permit the use of the 
more exact relation (14). The magnitudes of the errors, likely 
to be produced thereby, are those shown. 
The figures given in column 6 of the table are very significant. 
It has long been recognized that in dilute solution the uni-unival- 
ant electrolytes as a class are all dissociated to approximately 
the same extent at the same concentration® and in 1918 the 
author showed” that at high dilutions the degrees of dissociation 
of such electrolytes were zdentical within the accuracy of measure- 
ment, the identity persisting up to higher concentrations the 
more nearly the electrolytes under comparison resembled each 
other. The relationship discovered by Mac Innes as set forth 
in column 6 of the above table goes one step further and indicates 
very strongly that this identity persists even up to 1.0 normal. 
Certamly the contrary conclusion is without any supporting 
evidence.

The same relationship very probably holds true also for the 
bromides and iodides. To what degree it may be true also of . 
the other uni-univalent electrolytes cannot be definitely deter- 
mined until more complete and accurate data are available. In 
f ‘ A i any case, however, in which the value 1% for an electrolyte is 0 
approximately equal to that of KCl at the same concentration, 
we may conclude (in lack of evidence to the contrary) that its 
degree of dissociation is identical with that of KCl and the values 
of a given in Table XXVII may therefore be employed at ordi- 
nary tempatures for any uni-univalent electrolyte of normal 
behavior.

Some prominent investigators’ in this field incline to the 
opinion that the speeds of the ions actually increase with increas- 
ing concentration of the electrolyte, and that even in solutions so 
dilute that the viscosity of the solution is practically identical 
with that of pure water the ions move with decidedly greater 
velocities than they do at infinite dilution. If such is the case, 
the degrees of ionization calculated from the conductance ratio 
are all too high. As mentioned above, other prominent authori- 
‘ties! in this field adopt the view that the ionization and 
dissociation of strong electrolytes in aqueous solutions are 
both 100 per cent. at all concentrations, while adherents to
-P-A-G-E-292
  264 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XVII 
the contrary view, namely, that the degree of ionization is zero 
at all concentrations are still to be found.1t The student who 
attempts to follow closely present day literature on this subject 
will be impressed by the state of confusion which seems to exist. 
This is partly due to the fact that some writers” use the term, 
degree of ionization, in such a way as to include not only the free 
ions in the solution but also the ‘‘ bound” ions which in all proba- 
bility constitute most or all of the undissociated molecules in 
the case of strongly polar substances such as the uni-univalent 
salts; while by other writers“ the term is used synonymously 
with degree of dissociation. 
The author’s own view is that none of the arguments advanced 
are sufficiently strong to make it either necessary or desirable to 
reject the original hypothesis of Arrhenius that the conductance 
ratio (more explicitly equation 5 or 14) is substantially a correct 
measure of the degree of dissociation of uni-univalent electrolytes 
in dilute aqueous solution. This is the point of view adopted 
throughout this book. It virtually amounts to defining the 
term, “ degree of dissociation,” by means of equation (14). 
In the case of strong electrolytes such as the salts of the alkali 
metals, it may well be that the a-C curve passes through 
a minimum at higher concentrations and that thereafter the 
degree of dissociation increases and after various fluctuations 
again approaches 100 per cent. which is perhaps the degree of 
dissociation of the fused salt. At present, however, we lack 
any conclusive evidence on this subject. 
Problem 3.—If in a solution containing 0.05 mole each of KCl and LiCl 
per liter each salt is 87 per cent. ionized, what would be the specific con- 
ductance of the solution (1) at 18° and (2) at 25°? Use Table XXIII. 
3. Conductance Ratio and Type of Electrolyte.—Salts belonging 
to the same ionic type (XV, 3b) have at the same equivalent 
concentrations approximately the same value of the conduc- 
tance ratio, z. Table XXVIII shows values of this ratio for 0 
the three simplest types. 
For uni-univalent and probably also for bi-bivalent salts 
these values would represent approximately, according to equa- 
tion (10), the degrees of dissociation of the salts, because salts of 
these types ionize directly into the ions to which Ao corresponds.
-P-A-G-E-293
Sec. 3] CONDUCTANCE AND DEGREE OF DISSOCIATION — 265 
Such is not the case, however, with the uni-bivalent, the uni- 
trivalent and the bi-trivalent types because they ionize in such a 
way as to give intermediate ions. Thus K2SO, ionizes so as to 
give the ions K+, SOs--, and KSO,-. At infinite dilution 
the intermediate ions KSO,- are all broken up into K* and 
SO.- — ions so that the Ay value corresponds only to these two 
ion species, but at any finite concentration the A value is made up 
of the separate conductances of three species of ions, the relative 
amounts of which are not known. Owing to the presence of 
these intermediate ions equation (10) could not be employed to 
calculate a for such electrolytes. We have no very satisfactory 
method for determining the degree of dissociation and the ion 
concentrations for salts like BaCle, although it can be done ap- 
proximately in some instances by a combination of methods.*

We can, however, make the general statement that all salts 
are highly dissociated in dilute aqueous solution. There are a few 
exceptions to this rule, but they are very few and the rule is one 
which the student should remember. Some of the exceptions 
are lead acetate, ferric sulphocyanate; cadmium chloride (a = 
45 per cent. at 0.1m); and the mercuric halides (a = 0.1 per cent. 
at 0.1n). 
Acids and bases, unlike salts, exhibit at any moderate con- 
centration, such as 0.1 normal, every possible degree of dissocia- 
tion between a small fraction of 1 per cent. up to nearly 90 
per cent. according to the nature of the substance. There is, 
to be sure, a fairly large group of uni-univalent acids and bases, 
including HCl, HBr, HI, HNO;, HClO;, KOH, NaOH, LiOH, 
which have ionic dissociation values comparable with those of  
-P-A-G-E-294
spy i al a Ag i a aa kl i ala ai el ee ek kk 
266 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XVII 
the uni-univalent salts, with which, therefore, they may be 
classed; and likewise the uni-bivalent bases of the alkaline earths 
are also highly dissociated in dilute solution, although perhaps 
somewhat less so than those of the alkali metals. But outside 
of these groups all possible values of a are met with, as illustrated 
by the following values of the percentage ionic dissociation (100a) 
at 25° and 0.1 normal: NH,OH, 1.3 per cent.; H2SOs, 34 per cent. 
(into H+ and HSO;-); HsPO., 28 per cent. (into H+ and 
H.POs-); HNOs, 7 per cent.; HC2Hs02, 1.3 per cent.; H2COs, 
HS, HClO, HCN, HBOz, all less than 0.2 per cent. 
Polybasic acids are known to ionize in stages, giving rise to 
the intermediate ion; and the first hydrogen is almost always 
much more dissociated than the second, and the second much 
more than the third. Thus H,SO; at 0.1 normal at 25° is about 
34 per cent. dissociated into H+ and HSOs;-, and less than 0.01 
per cent. dissociated into H+ and SO;-~. 
4. Conductance Ratio and Temperature.—At room tempera- 
A ond tures the value of AG for uni-univalent strong electrolytes changes 0 
with the temperature at a rate of less than 0.1 per cent. per 
degree. For KCl at about 0.08 normal, A. A. Noyes® found for 
100 . the following values: 
02 18° 100° 156° 218° 281° 306° 
89.3 87.3 82.6 O97 17.3 72 64 
which are typical of most salts of this type. In the case of weak 
electrolytes no general rule as to direction and magnitude can be 
given, although, as we shall see later (XXII, 10), the rate of 
change of a with the temperature can be calculated from the 
heat of ionization of the electrolyte. 
5. Comparison of Degrees of Dissociation Calculated by the 
Freezing-point and Conductance Methods.—As explained above 
(XV, 4), the freezing-point method can frequently be employed 
to calculate the approximate value of a for uni-univalent electro- 
lytes owing to a partial compensation of sources of error. A 
comparison of the values obtained by the two methods in the 
case of CsNO3, KCl and LiCl is shown in Table XXIX. In 
the case of CsNO; the values obtained from the freezing-point 
method all appear to be too small when compared with those

obtained by the conductance method, although the values given 
for the conductance method in the case of this salt may be 
somewhat in error because, owing to the lack of the necessary 
transference values, they are calculated from the less exact 
equation (12). This behavoir of CsNO; may, at least partially, 
be ascribed to the powerful effect which the ions have upon the 
thermodynamic environment in the solution. In the case of 
LiCl the values obtained by the freezing-point method are 
apparently all too large. This is due chiefly to the fact that LiCl 
is highly hydrated in solution and no account was taken of this 
in the calculation. (Cf. XIV, 7.) In the case of KCl these two 
sources of error appear to compensate each other almost exactly 
and the values of a by the two methods agree within the experi- 
mental errors of the measurements. LiCl and CsNO; are 
extreme cases. Practically all other uni-univalent salts lie 
within the limits set by these two. It is evident from these 
results that agreement between the values obtained by the two 
methods is no evidence that the values are correct (as has been 
concluded by some investigators), for the agreement can be

268 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XVIL 
only an accidental one. Even the accidental very close agree- 
ment in the case of KCl at 0° disappears at 25° when vapor 
pressure measurements are made the basis for calculating a. 
(Cf. XV, 2.) 
6. The Influence of Ions upon the Thermodynamic Environ- 
ment in Aqueous Solutions. (a) Nature of the Influence.—As 
stated above, the thermodynamic environment prevailing within 
a dilute solution of a strong electrolyte is quite appreciably 
different from that which prevails in pure water or in a dilute 
solution of a non-electrolyte, owing apparently to the com- 
paratively great influence which the large numbers of electrically 
charged particles (the ions) exert upon the other molecular 
species in the solution with them. This influence manifests itself 
by its effect upon the tendencies of the various molecular species 
to escape from the solution into any other condition. (Cf. XII, 
7, footnote 2.) Or, stated in other words, the fugacity (XIV, 1) 
of a given molecular species in a dilute aqueous solution is not 
simply a function of its own concentration but is a function of 
the ion concentration of the solution as well (XII, 9). The 
magnitude of the effect of the presence of the ions upon the 
fugacity of a given molecular species in the solution depends 
upon the nature of this species, and also, but frequently to a less 
degree, upon the nature of the ions present in the solution as well. 
For the purpose of presenting the known facts concerning the 
effect of the ion concentration upon the fugacities of different 
species of solute molecules it will be convenient to divide these 
solute molecules into three classes, as follows: (1) the ions 
themselves; (2) the undissociated molecules of strong electro- 
lytes; and (3) all other neutral molecules. 
It will be recalled that in a dilute solution of constant thermo- 
dynamic environment, in accordance with Henry’s Law (equation 
10, XIV), the fugacity of each species of solute molecule is 
proportional to its concentration, that is, 
Pr = k,C, (14) 
or 
Piast, oe 
ka, 
If therefore we plot values of the quantity - —the molal fugacity A (15)  
-P-A-G-E-297
  Sec. 6] CONDUCTANCE AND DEGREE OF DISSOCIATION 269 
—for each molecular species in a solution against corresponding 
values of the ion concentration of that solution, we shall obtain 
a picture of the effect of the changing thermodynamic environ- 
ment upon the fugacity of each molecular species. More- 
over the magnitude of the variation of the ratio, Ps from con- 
A 
stancy will be a measure of the sensitivity of the molecular species 
toward a variation of ion concentration in the medium surround- 
ing it. As is evident from the form in which we are expressing 
Henry’s Law, we shall confine the consideration to solutions so 
dilute that the mole fraction of each solute species may be taken 
as proportional to its volume concentration. 
(b) The Influence of the Ion Concentration upon the Fugacity 
of Ions.—The necessary data for calculating the variation of 
molal fugacity with concentration in the case of the ions of 
strong electrolytes can be obtained by a variety of different 
methods. The measurement of any of the colligative properties 
of the solution will furnish such data. The properties which have 
been chiefly used for this purpose are the E. M. F. of concentra- 
tion cells!® (XVI, 4e) and the freezing point lowering"? respec- 
tively. From both classes of data it is possible to calculate 
relative values of the molal-fugacity-product of the two ions 
of the electrolyte, for a series of concentrations. 
The values for the individual ions cannot be calculated except 
by making the assumption either that they are the same for both 
ions of the electrolyte in all cases or that they are the same for say 
K* and CI in all dilute solutions containing these two ions. If 
we make the latter assumption we obtain (from E. M. F. data) 
for KCl, NaCl, LiCl, HCl, and NaOH at 25° and (from freezing 
point data) for KCl at 0° the relative ionic fugacities shown 
graphically in Fig. 41. In calculating these values the degrees of 
ionization given in Table XXVII were used for all the electrolytes 
The ordinates in the figure represent relative molal fugacities, 
the molal fugacity of each ion being taken as unity at C, = 0.001 
normal. The abscissas represent concentration of the electrolyte 
on a logarithmic scale. 
The data thus far available seem to point to the following facts: 
(1) With increasing ion concentration the molal fugacity of a 
given ion species at first decreases, passes through a minimum and  
-P-A-G-E-298
  270 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XVII 
thereafter increases. (2) The location of the minimum and the 
rates of decrease and increase depend upon the nature of the 
ion species involved. (3) For sufficiently dilute aqueous solutions 
of electrolytes the molal fugacity of an ion-species is approximately 
constant. Thus within an accuracy of 5 per cent. this last 
statement is evidently true up to about 0.07 for Lit, 0.01n for 
K+, Na* and Cl, and 0.4n for H+ and OH- at 25° and up to 
about 0.03n for K+ and Cl at 0°.

In the development of the laws of solutions for cases involv- 
ing ions, we shall restrict the treatment presented in the follow- 
ing pages to solutions so dilute that the third principle stated 
above is applicable. This is necessary because for higher concen- 
trations, we have as yet no principle of general validity which will 
enable us to develop other than empirical laws for such cases. 
It is, of course, always possible by direct experiment to as- 
‘certain the relation between fugacity and concentration for any 
ion-species, or more exactly, the relation between concentration 
and fugacity-product for any two positive and negative ion 
species or fugacity-ratio for any two positive or any two negative 
ion species. By tabulating such results or by expressing them 
graphically, or analytically, the information thus available will 
make it possible to find the relative fugacity of a given ion species
-P-A-G-E-299
Suc. 6] CONDUCTANCE AND DEGREE OF DISSOCIATION = 271 
under any given conditions. For calculations involving the 
fugacity obtained in this way, it is usually unnecessary to know 
anything about the degree of dissociation of the electrolyte. 
All that is required is the relation connecting the fugacity of the 
ion species with the total concentration of electrolyte. 
It has, therefore, become customary to tabulate a quantity 
which has been variously named, “The Thermodynamic Degree 
of Ionization,” or “The Activity Coefficient,” and which is 
simply the factor by which the total concentration, C3, of the 
electrolyte must be multiplied in order to obtain a quantity 
known as the activity, a, of its ions, (or more properly, the re- 
lative activity, since its absolute value is not known) which is 
identical with the relative geometrical-mean fugacity of the two 
ions of the electrolyte. For moderate concentrations the fuga- 
city (or activity) of an ion species, can frequently be expressed 
as a function of the concentration C, by means of an empirical 
equation of the following form; 
log & or log ¢ =k Ci, + log Ko (16) 
where k& and h are characteristic of the ion in question, and K, 
is an undeterminable constant. C, represents the concentration 
of the electrolyte, one of whose ions has the fugacity p and the 
activity a at this concentration. Cy represents the total equiva- 
lent concentration of all strong electrolytes present in the solu- 
tion. For a solution containing only a single electrolyte Cz = C. 
An empirical equation involving four parameters and thus 
capable of expressing the data more accurately then equation 
16 and over a wider range has been employed by Harned? 
for interpolation purposes in computing a table’ of ‘activity 
coefficients.” 
(c) The Influence of the Ion Concentration upon the Fugacity 
of Un-dissociated Molecules of Strong Electrolytes.—This effect 
is shown graphically by curve u in Fig. 42, the values of the 
ordinates being indicated on the left-hand margin. The values 
employed are for the un-dissociated molecules of KCl in solutions 
of this salt at 0°. It will be observed that the molal fugacity,

o of these molecules increases very rapidly with increasing ion 
concentration, the increase beween C; = 0.001 and C; = 0.1 
being about sevenfold. Stated in other terms, the presence of 
the ions in the solution increases the escaping tendency of the 
undissociated molecules. This increase is known as the salting- 
out effect. It is shown generally by nearly all classes of neutral 
molecules when a salt is added to the solution containing them.

The difference between the undissociated molecules of strong 
electrolytes and other neutral molecules in this respect is that 
the magnitude of the salting-out effect is very much greater in the 
former case. As a partial explanation of this difference A. A. 
Noyes called attention! to the fact that the undissociated mole- 
cules of strong electrolytes are themselves probably highly 
polarized, that is, the two ions are already formed and the 
molecule owes its existence only to the electrical forces which 
hold the ions together. A polarized molecule (Cf. I, 2g and 2j) 
of this character might well be more sensitive to changes in the

(d) The Effect of the Ion Concentration upon the Fugacity 
of Neutral Molecules in General.—Neutral molecules in general 
undergo the salting-out effect in the presence of ions. The 
magnitude of the effect appears to be largely independent of the 
nature of the neutral molecule but depends upon the nature of 
the ions. 
If, however, the neutral molecules in a given instance enter 
into a chemical reaction with the molecules or ions of the salt 
or with the molecules of the solvent, the effects of such reactions 
may completely mask the salting-out effect proper and the total 
molal fugacity of the substance may be decreased instead of 
increased by the presence of the salt in the solution. 
The magnitude of the salting-out effect produced by the ions 
of KCl is illustrated by curve A in Fig. 42, the ordinates for this 
curve being indicated on the right-hand margin of the figure. 
It will be noticed that for an ion concentration of 0.1 equivalent 
per liter the salting-out effect amounts to only about 3 per cent., 
and the relation is nearly a linear one. Curve A can be satis- 
factorily represented by the following empirical equation: 
  
logio PA = b’aCy* = 0.13; (18) kaCa

CHAPTER XVIII 
ELECTRICAL TRANSFERENCE 
1. The Phenomenon of Electrical Transference.—We have 
seen (XVI, 3) that when a current of electricity is passed through 
a solution of an electrolyte all of the anions move toward the 
anode and all of the cations toward the cathode. Since the 
different ions move with different speeds, the faster moving 
ones will, other things being equal (XVI, 3), do more of the 
current-carrying than the slower moving ones. Through any 
cross section of the solution, however, the number of equivalents 
of cation which move toward the cathode plus the number of 
equivalents of anion which move toward the anode must by 
definition be equal to the total number of equivalents of elec- 
tricity (XVI, 5) passed through the solution, or

carried by each species of ion and also the number of equivalents 
of each ion species as well as the number of equivalents of each 
ion-constituent transferred in the one direction or the other 
through the solution during the passage of one faraday of elec- 
tricity. The quantities n. and na are called the transference 
numbers (XVII, 2b) of the ions and of the ion-constituents indi- 
cated by the subscripts. As a result of this transfer of ions 
through the solution, concentration changes take place around 
the electrodes. The nature of these changes and their relation 
to the transference number may be best understood by the con- 
sideration of a Hittorf* transference experiment.

2. A Hittorf Transference Experiment.—Let a solution of 
silver nitrate be electrolyzed between silver electrodes in the 
apparatus shown diagrammatically in Fig. 43. At the end of the 
electrolysis let the solution be drawn off in five separate portions, 
three middle portions and two electrode portions, as indicated 
in the figure, precautions be- 
ing taken to prevent mixing 
during this operation. Let 
each portion be weighed and 
analyzed to determine the 
per cent. of water and the per — catHove portion 
cent. of silver nitrate which it . 4 
contains. The results of 
these analyses will show that ““"=—"""“"""" 
the three middle portions 
have the same composition 
as the original solution (if the 
experiment has been properly 
conducted), but that the con- 
centration of silver nitrate ANODE _mipoLe PoRTioN | 
has increased in the anode 
portion and decreased in the 
cathode portion. The me- 
chanism of these concentra- 
tion changes is the following: 
At the anode, in accord- 
ance with Faraday’s Law, N.

the number of equivalents of electricity passed through the 
solution during the experiment. At the same time a certain 
amount, N, equivalents, of silver ion has moved out of 
the anode portion, and N. — N. equivalents of nitrate 
ion have moved into the anode portion. (See equation 1.) 
Suppose that the analysis of the anode portion gives the 
composition N2 equivalents of AgNO; in m, grams of water. 
The original solution before electrolysis contained Ny equiva- CATHODE,

lents of AgNO; in m, grams of water. The increase, Ne — Ni, 
must evidently be equal to N. — N., that is, it must be equal 
to the silver which has come into the anode portion from the 
electrode diminished by the silver which has gone out of the 
anode portion owing to the migration of silver ions toward 
the cathode. Hence by definition (equation 2), the transference 
number of the silver ion is evidently

and that of the nitrate ion is by definition (equations 2 and 3) 
Na =1—n,. At the cathode the reverse of the above process 
takes place and from the analysis of the cathode portion the 
two transference numbers can also be calculated by means of 
equation (4), thus giving a valuable check on the accuracy of 
the experimental work. 
In employing equation (4) the following points, which follow 
from its derivation, should be kept clearly in mind: From the 
total mass and composition of the electrode portion as calcu- 
lated from the results of the analysis and the knowledge of the 
electrode processes, the mass of water, m.,in the electrode portion 
can be computed. The analysis also gives the number of equiva- 
lents, Nz, of the ion-constituent whose transference number is 
desired, which are present in the m, grams of water in the 
electrode portion. From the known composition of the original 
solution we can calculate the number of equivalents, Ni, of this 
ion-constituent which were present in m, grams of water in the 
original solution. N,. in the numerator of equation (4) is the 
number of equivalents of the ion-constituent in question which 
have passed into the electrode portion from the electrode. If the 
ion-constituent happens to have gone out of the solution on to 
the electrode, then N. is obviously a negative quantity. In many 
cases it will be zero. Nin the denominator of equation (4) is the 
number of equivalents of electricity passed through the solution 
during the experiment, as measured by a suitable coulometer 
(XVI, 5) connected in series with the transference apparatus. 
3. True Transference Numbers and Ionic Hydration.—It 
will be noted that the above calculation of transference numbers 
by the Hittorf method assumes that all of the water in the solu-   
Ne

tion remains stationary during the passage of the current, and 
the change in composition which occurs in the neighborhood 
of the electrode is calculated with reference to the water, assumed 
to be stationary. The assumption is not strictly true, since the 
ions are hydrated (XV, 1) and hence some water is also carried 
with them as they move through the solution. In dilute solu- 
tion the water so carried is negligible, but in concentrated solu- 
tion it is not and it becomes necessary to add to the solution a 
third substance, such as sugar, which will remain stationary 
during the passage of the current and which can serve as the 
reference substance for measuring the concentration changes 
of the salt and the water. In this way the comparative degrees 
of hydration of different ions have been measured.

Transference numbers obtained by using a reference sub- 
stance which remains stationary during the passage of the 
current are called ‘‘true” transference numbers, while those 
obtained by the use of water as the reference substance are called 
“Hittorf” transference numbers. In dilute solution, however,

shown in Table XXX with their ion-conductances given in Table XXIII

4. Change of Transference Numbers with Concentration and 
Temperature.—In the case of uni-univalent salts the trans- 
ference numbers usually change very little with concentration as 
long as the latter does not exceed a moderate value, say 0.01 
normal. This is illustrated by the following values of na (Hittorf) 
at 18°.

The variation of the transference number with the concen- 
tration, such for example as that which occurs in the case of 
LiCl, might be supposed to be due to the different ways in which 
the mobilities of the two ions were influenced by the viscosity of 
the medium. . Experiments® in which the viscosity of a dilute 
solution of LiCl was increased 58 per cent. by the addition of 
raffinose showed, however, that under these circumstances no 
change in the transference number was produced and this result 
was confirmed’ by conductivity data. The exact cause of the 
influence of concentration upon the transference number is 
therefore uncertain,
-P-A-G-E-307
Src. 5] ELECTRICAL TRANSFERENCE 279 
With rising temperature all transference numbers which have 
been measured exhibit a tendency to approach 0.5. 
For compiled tables of the best transference data see refer- 
ence (1). 
Problem 1a.—If the anion transference number of potassium chloride is 
0.504 and if the equivalent conductance at infinite dilution has the following 
values: 129.6 for KCl, 126.0 for KNOs, and 104.9 for NaNOs, what is the 
transference number of sodium nitrate? 
Problem 1b.—Show that up to 0.1n the Hittorf transference number 
does not differ from the true transference number by more than 0.001 even 
in the case of LiCl. 
6. Transference and Ion Mobility.—A charged body in an 
electric field is acted upon by a force, f, equal to the product of 
the charge, q, into the potential gradient (dH/dl) at that point 
in the field, or 
f = q(d#/dl) (6) 
where d# is the change in potential in the distance dl. More- 
over, the velocity of a small body moving through a medium of 
great frictional resistance is proportional to the force acting upon 
it. Hence the velocity, uw, with which an ion moves through a 
solution of a given viscosity is proportional to the potential gra- 
dient prevailing within the solution (¢ being obviously a constant 
for a given ion), that is, 
Uct = Uct(dE/dl) and ue = Ue-(dE/dl) (7) 
where the proportionality factor (U.+, U.-) is obviously the 
velocity of the ion under unit potential gradient. It is called 
the mobility of the ion and is a characteristic property which 
varies with the temperature and with the nature of the medium 
through which the ion moves. Similarly the velocity with which 
a given ion-constituent is transferred through the solution will 
be 
ue =aU+(dE/dl) = U-(dE/dl) (8) 
and similarly for the anion. 
If a constant current, J, of electricity be passed for ¢ seconds 
through a solution containing C equivalents of a uni-univalent 
electrolyte, CA, per liter, placed in a cylindrical tube of cross 
section A, between parallel electrodes 1 cm. apart, a consideration 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  280 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuapv. XVIII 
of Fig. 44 will show that the number of equivalents, N., of the 
cation-constituent which pass through any cross section of the 
tube in this time will be 
N. = uctA(0.001C) (9) 
or, since u, = U.(dE#/dl), by equation (8), and d#/dl equals 
E/l for a constant current in a homogeneous conductor of uni- 
form cross section (prove this, see equations (25) and (27), 
XVI), equation (9) becomes 
N. = U.(E/l)tA(0.001C) (10) 
and similarly for the number of equivalents of anion-constituent 
passing in the opposite direction, 
N, = U.(E/1)tA(0.001C) (11) 
  
If we divide each of these equations by their sum we obtain an 
expression for each of the transference numbers (see equations 
2 and 3) in terms of the mobilities of the ion-constituents. 
U. U3 
U.+U. U.+Ua 
6. Transference and Ion-Conductances.—In the example just 
considered (Fig. 44), the total number of coulombs, gq, of elec- 
tricity passed through our solution in the time ¢ is by definition 
(equation (24), XVI) Ne= and na= (12) 
quilt (18) 
By Faraday’s Law (equation (23), XVI), it is also 
q =FN. (14) 
and N, the number of equivalents of electricity passed is, ac- 
cording to equation (1), expressed by the sum of equations (10) 
and (11), thus giving us 
It = q=FN. = F(N. + Na) = F(Ue + Us) (E/1)tA(0.001C) (15)
-P-A-G-E-309
  Sec. 6] ELECTRICAL TRANSFERENCE 281 
By simply combining this equation algebraically with equations 
(25, 26, 27 and 29, XVI) (prove this), we obtain the important 
relation, 
A=F(U.+ Ua) = FU. + FUa (16) 
and hence 
A = FaUa + Fate (17) 
or in words, the equivalent conductance of a uni-univalent elec- 
trolyte is equal to the faraday multiplied either by the sum of 
the mobilities of its ion-constituents or by the product of the 
degree of dissociation into the sum of the mobilities of its ions. 
But the equivalent conductance of the salt is equal to the sum 
of the equivalent conductances of its two ion-constituents, or 
to the product of its degree of dissociation into the sum of the 
conductances of its two ions (XVII, 2, equations 2, 3, and 4), 
that is, 
A=A.+Aa (18) 
and 
A = a(Act + Ac) (19) 
and by comparing these two equations with equations (16) and 
(17), it is evident that 
A, = FU., Aa = FUa (20) 
and Acy = FU c+, Ac = FU (21) 
and the absolute velocity in centimeters per second with which a 
given ion (or ion-constituent) moves through a solution under 
unit potential gradient is evidently equal to the equivalent 
conductance of the ion (or ion-constituent) in the solution in 
question, divided by the faraday. 
Equations (12) and (16) combined with (20 and (21) give 
Ac = Ang Ac = Ana (22) 
Ane Ata A and A= a Ag = a (23) 
both of which at infinite dilution become (since a = 1) 
Noo = Acct = Aotte, and Aoa=Aoa- = Acta (24) 
We have seen how values of Ao and of n are obtained experi- 
mentally (XVII, 1, and XVIII, 2 and 7), and it is clear that by 
means of equation (24) the individual ion-conductances at in- 
finite dilution recorded in Table XXIII can be computed. To
-P-A-G-E-310
282 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XVIII 
compute such a table all that is necessary is a set of Ao values for a 
sufficient number of electrolytes to include all of the desired ion 
species and the transference number of a single ion species of 
one of these electrolytes in very dilute solution. The values 
given in Table XXIII are based upon the transference number of 
potassium chloride. (See See. 4.) 
Problem 2.—A transference experiment is made with a solution of silver 
nitrate (0.00739 gram of silver nitrate per gram of water) using two silver 
electrodes. A silver coulometer in the circuit shows a deposit 
of 0.0780 gram of silver. At the end of the experiment the 
anode portion weighing 23.38 grams is removed and found on 
analysis to contain 0.2361 gram of silver nitrate. Calculate 
the transference numbers of the silver and nitrate ions in a 
silver nitrate solution of this concentration. The cathode por- 
tion weighs 25.00 grams. How much silver nitrate does it 
contain? 
7. Determination of Transference Numbers by 
the Moving Boundary Method.—From equations (7) 
and (12) it is evident that the ratio of the trans- 
ference numbers of the two ions in a given salt solu- 
tion is equal to the ratio of the velocities with which 
the two ion-constituents move through the solution 
and hence equal to the ratio of the distances covered 
by the two ion-constituents in a given time during 
the passage of the current. These two distarces can 
be directly measured with the apparatus shown 
diagrammatically in Fig. 45. A solution of the salt, 
CA, under investigation is placed between one of 
CA’ and another of the salt C’A, having respectively 
the same cation and anion as the salt CA. The 
boundaries aa and bb separating the solutions are 
Fia. 45. easily visible because of the different refractive indices 
(VIII, 3) of the solutions. A current is passed 
through the apparatus in the direction indicated by the short 
arrows. Boundary aa moves upward to a’a’ and evidently 
represents the distance covered by the anion-constituent A 
during the passage of the current. Similarly boundary bb moves 
downward to b’b’ and represents the distance covered by the 
cation-constituent. The ratio of the two distances is the ratio 
of the two transference numbers.   
   
-P-A-G-E-311
Sec. 7] ELECTRICAL TRANSFERENCE 283 
Problem 3.—Prove that the two boundaries will remain sharp while the 
current passes, if Ua <U, and Ue <U-.. The salts are so chosen that 
these conditions are fulfilled. If one desired to measure the transference 
number of NaCl by this method, what salts might be used for C’A and 
CA’? 
The experimental development of the moving boundary method 
has been due chiefly to Denison* and Steele.2_ When employed 
in practice it is necessary, as shown by Lewis,’ to correct the 
measured distance covered by the moving boundary for any 
mass displacement of the solution due to electrode processes. 
When so corrected the transference number yielded by this 
method has been shown by Miller®*, and by Lewis? to be identical 
with the Hittorf number. 
PROBLEMS 
The atomic weight table and the values of general constants such as the 
faraday may be employed in solving the following problems but no other 
data except those given with the problem are to be used. The influence of 
viscosity may be neglected in computing a. 
Problem 4.—Using a silver anode and a silver chloride cathode, 0.04974 
equivalent of electricity was passed through an aqueous solution containing 
8.108 per cent. of KCl and 4.418 per cent. of raffinose contained in a suitable 
transference apparatus. At the end of the experiment the anode portion 
weighing 103.21 grams was analyzed and found to contain 6.510 per cent. 
of KCl and 4.516 per cent. of raffinose. The cathode portion weighing 
85.28 grams contained 10.030 per cent. of KCl and 4.290 per cent. of raffinose. 
Three middle portions were found to have the same composition as the 
original solution. On the assumption that the raffinose remains stationary 
during the passage of the current calculate the true transference number of 
the potassium ion and the amount of water transferred per equivalent of 
electricity. Assuming that N.C! molecules of water are attached to the 
chloride ion calculate the number attached to the potassium ion. (Cf. 
Table XXX.) 
Problem 5.—A solution containing 0.1 equivalent of KCl per 1000 grams 
of H,0 has a specific resistance of 89.37 ohms at 18° and is 86.15 per cent. 
ionized. This solution is electrolyzed in a transference apparatus with a 
silver anode and a silver chloride cathode. At the end of the electrolysis 
the solution around each electrode is neutral and no gas has been evolved at 
either electrode. The anode is carefully washed, dried and weighed and is 
found to have increased in weight by 0.01300 gram. A cathode portion of 
100 grams is drawn off from the neighborhood of the cathode and is found 
on analysis to contain 0.7539 gram of KCl. Calculate from these data

ion is 0.50 in the case of ammonium chloride and 0.27 in the case of am- 
monium hydroxide.

CHAPTER XIX 
THERMOCHEMISTRY 
1. Heat of Reaction.—It may be stated as a general rule that 
all physical and chemical reactions are accompanied by heat 
effects. The heat of reaction is defined to be the number of 
calories of heat evolved when the reaction takes place, at constant 
volume, in the direction indicated, and between the amounts of 
the reacting substances indicated, by the stoichiometrical equa- 
tion of the reaction. Thus the equation 
2H, + 0. = 2H.0 + 117,400 () 
signifies that when 4 grams of hydrogen gas unite in a closed 
vessel with 32 grams of oxygen gas to form 36 grams of water 
vapor, 117,400 cal. of heat are evolved. The thermochemical 
equation of this reaction might, if desired, be written, 
H +40 = 46H.0 + 29,350 (2) 
which is the thermochemical equation for the union of 1 gram 
of gaseous hydrogen with 8 grams of gaseous oxygen to form 
9 grams of water vapor. A horizontal line above the formula 
of a substance in a thermochemical equation indicates that the 
substance is understood to be in the gaseous state. Similarly 
the absence of any line indicates the liquid state, a line below the 
formula indicates the crystalline state, and a suffix, ag (thus 
HClag), indicates that the substance is in solution in such a 
large volume of water that the addition of more water would not 
produce any appreciable heat effect, that is, the solution is 
understood to be so dilute that its heat of dilution is negligibly 
small,

occurs in stages, that the heat of the reaction is eon of what the 
stages are and in what order they may occur. 
These facts were discovered by Hess* in 1840 before the First, 
Law of thermodynamics had been established as a general 
principle. They may be illustrated by the process of forming a 
dilute solution of NH,Cl from NH; and HCl. ‘This process may 
take place in two different ways, thus: 
(1) NH; + HCl = NH.Cl + 42,100 (16) 
and 
NH.Cl + ag = NHClag — 3900 (17) 
equals 
NH; + HCl + ag = NH.Clag + 38,200 (18) 
(2) NH: + ag = NHsaqg + 8400 (19)

HCl + aq = HClaq + 17,300 (20) 
and 
HClag + NHsaqg = NH.Clag + 12,300 (21) 
equals 
NH; + HCl + ag = NH,Clag + 38,000 (18)   It is evident from these reactions that the heat of the whole 
reaction, 
NH; + HCl + ag = NH,Clag (22) 
is, within the experimental error (200 cal.), the same in both 
cases. 
Thermochemical equations can be added and subtracted, or 
multiplied and divided just the same as algebraic equations. 
Hess’s Law is of great practical importance in computing the heat 
of reaction for cases where it cannot be directly measured. 
A large part of the thermochemical data available at the present 
time! is the result of the pioneer investigations of Thomsen? and 
of Berthelot.

through them it is possible to calculate the heats of many other reactions 
which cannot be directly measured.

unity, calculate the heat of the reaction. What is the heat of neutralization 
of NaOH by HaAc in 0.17 solution?

electrolytes (Cf. XVII, 3).)

5. Heat Effects at Constant Volume and at Constant Pressure. 
When a reaction takes place at constant volume, the heat effect 
(H,, cal. evolved) which accompanies it is by definition under- 
stood to be the heat-of-the-reaction (XIX, 1). When a reaction 
occurs without change of volume there is evidently no work 
performed against the external pressure, and hence by the First 
Law of thermodynamics (X, 3), 
H, = — AU (36) 
If, however, the reaction occurs at constant pressure P, and 
is accompanied by an increase of volume Av, then according to the 
First Law, the heat effect (H>, cal. evolved) at constant pressure 
differs from that at constant volume simply by the work PA», 
performed by the system in the second case (X, 3 and 4, equa- 
tion 3), that is, 
H, — H, = Pav (37) 
In the case of liquid or crystalline systems, Av is always small, and 
hence in most cases PAv is negligible and for practical purposes 
we may assume 
H, = H, (38) 
but when gases are involved in the reaction, Av is frequently 
large and the work term must be taken.into account. 
Problem 9.—If A, B, M and N are perfect gases, show that for the reac- 
tion, aA + 6B = mM + mN occurring at constant pressure P, and constant 
temperature 7’, the work performed against the external pressure will be 
PAv = (m+n—a—bd)RT (39) 
and hence 
  H, — Hp, = (m+n—a-—d)RT (40) 
Problem 10.—Calculate in calories the difference between H, and H, 
for the following reactions: (1) 2Hz + O2 = 2H20 at 20°; (2) C+ 0: = 
C02 at 2000°; (3) HO = HO at 5°; (4) H,O = H.0 at 0° and 1 atm. 
The density of ice is 0.9 gram per cubic centimeter.

CHAPTER XX 
THE HEAT CAPACITY AND INTERNAL ENERGY OF 
MATERIAL SYSTEMS! 
GENERAL 
1. Heat Capacity at Constant Volume and at Constant Pres- 
sure.—When a substance is heated at constant volume, no exter- 
nal work is performed during the heating, but when the heating 
takes place at constant pressure, the substance expands and 
hence does a certain amount of work both against the external 
pressure (X, 5) and against the internal attractive forces. The 
amounts of heat required in the two cases will, according to the 
First Law of Thermodynamics (X, 4), differ from each other 
simply by the amount of external work done in the second case 
plus the change in internal energy which accompanies the volume 
increase; and the following relation connecting the specific heat 
capacity (definition, X, 2; frequently shortened to “specific 
heat’’) at constant volume, c( = (2). ), with that at con- 
stant pressure, cp( = (32). ), is readily deducible from the two 
laws of thermodynamics (see Appendix, 18): 
ono = 79), aw which may also be written 
Ta? Cp — Cy a aD. (16) 
1/0 : 3 where a( = =(s7) ) is the coefficient of cubical expansion, Dp 
o i Seis BO = -— ze) » the coefficient of compressibility, and D the 
density of the substance in grams per cubic centimeter, all at the 
absolute temperature T. The specific heat capacity at constant 
pressure is ordinarily the only one which can be conveniently

determined calorimetrically, and hence equation (1) is especially 
important because it makes possible the exact calculation of the 
value for constant volume. The product of the specific heat ca- 
pacity into the molal or atomic weight is called the molal or 
atomic heat capacity and will be designated similarly by the sym- 
bols C, and C,. 
For moderate and low temperatures Nernst and Lindemann? 
find‘ that the following approximation forrn of equation (1b) is 
sufficiently exact for solid substances: 
p= Ue ACAT (2) 
where A is a constant, characteristic of the substance and inde- 
pendent of 7 and which can therefore be evaluated from any pair 
of values of Cp and C,. The constant A is also approximately 
  0214 i é 5 equal to a F where Tr is the absolute melting point of the 
substance. 
Problem 1.—For aluminium at 0° the following values have been obtained: 
Cp = 0.2079 cal., a = 68.4-10-® per deg., 6 = 1.3-10-* per megabar, and 
D = 2.7 grams perc.c. Calculate c, in cal. at 0°. Calculate also the differ- 
ence, Cp — Cr, at —190°. (Notw: The bar is the unit of pressure in the 
absolute system; mega = 10% Refer to the concluding sentence of X, 3, 
before solving this problem.) 
Problem 2.—(a) Show that for a perfect gas, equations (1a) and (1b) 
reduce to the form 3B 
C;-C.=8 ) 
where R is the gas constant. (b) Show that for a gas which obeys Berthe- 
lot’s equation of state (II, 10b), equation Ae reduces to

Problem 3.—By measuring the velocity of sound in a gas the value of the (3b)

ratio, ae for that gas can be directly determined. In this way the specific 
y 
heat ratio for xenon at 19° has been found to be oP 1.666. Calculate

  292 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XX 
in recent years largely by Nernst and his associates at the 
University of Berlin have resulted in an extensive modification 
of former theories concerning heat capacity. Most of the recent 
attempts at a quantitative theoretical interpretation of these new 
results have been based upon the quantum theory of Planck 
(X, 18). For the quantitative development of this theory the 
student is referred to more advanced treatises and especially to 
W. C. McC. Lewis’ Physical Chemistry, Vol. 3. The following 
presentation is based upon the older principle of the equipartition 
of energy, as modified by what may be termed the constraint 
hypothesis. This method of interpreting the known facts con- 
cerning heat capacity has recently received elaboration at the 
hands of Sir J. J. Thomson,’ G. N. Lewis® and others. It 
is a qualitative interpretation only and does not appear to be 
necessarily inconsistent with some kind of a quantum theory, 
although its purpose is to render unnecessary the use of such a 
theory.

3. Monatomic Gases.—When heat is absorbed at constant 
volume by a monatomic (II, 1c) perfect gas, the only effect which 
we should expect is an increase in the mean translatory kinetic 
energy of the molecules of the gas. There is apparently no other 
way in which the heat energy could be absorbed by such a gas, if 
we exclude the possibility of affecting the energy condition in the 
interior of the atoms or their rotational energy. On this hypothe- 
sis the molal heat capacity, C,, of a monatomic gas can be easily 
calculated with the aid of the kinetic theory, in the following 
manner: 
For one mole of any perfect gas the total translatory kinetic 
energy, H;, possessed by its molecules, amounts according to 
equation (29, IT) to 
E, = 5Nmu? = 3 Rr (4) 
and if we add dQ calories of heat to the gas, thus causing its tem- 
perature to rise d7’ degrees, we would have for a monatomic gas at 
constant volume 
dQ = dH, = 3 Rar (5)
-P-A-G-E-321
  Suc. 4] ENERGY OF MATERIAL SYSTEMS 293 
and hence, by definition, 
Cy = (3) = 3k (6) 
or in words: C, for a monatomic perfect gas is equal to 3R and 
is hence independent both of the nature of the gas and of its 
temperature and pressure. The experimental verification of this 
prediction was one of the earliest triumphs of the kinetic theory. 
Experiment has shown that for all monatomic gases C, = 2.98 
cal. and in the case of helium, where the experiments have covered 
a wide temperature range, the value of C, has been shown’ to be 
the same at all temperatures within the range — 256° to 2350°. 
From equations (3a) and (6) it is also evident that for all mon- 
atomic perfect gases 
Cy=3 R = 4.96 eal. (7) 
and 
~= a = 1.666 (8) 
In the case of argon, however, the experimental data indicate 
that at — 180° its specific heat ratio rises to 1.670.!4 
At extremely high temperatures it is of course conceivable that 
some of the electrons within the atoms of a monatomic gas might 
have their kinetic and potential energy (intra-atomic kinetic 
energy, Cf. X, 2) appreciably increased by the extremely short 
and violent impacts which take place between the atoms of the 
gas at these high temperatures. If such were the case, then 
evidently the value of C, for a monotomic gas would become 
greater than 3p. No temperature great enough to bring this 
about has as yet been attained in practice, however. 
4. Diatomic and Polyatomic Gases.—Consider a perfect gas 
whose molecule is composed of » atoms. At a sufficiently low 
temperature these atoms will be held together so firmly by those 
forces which we call chemical affinity that the molecules will 
behave like perfectly rigid elastic bodies when they collide with 
one another. That is, the comparatively small force of the mo- 
lecular impacts at very low temperatures will not be sufficient to 
produce an appreciable effect upon the positions of the atoms
-P-A-G-E-322
  294 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XX 
within the molecule, relative to one another. Moreover if the 
temperature is low enough, especially if as in the case of hydrogen 
the atoms have comparatively small masses, the moment of 
inertia of the molecule around its center of inertia will be so small 
that very little of the heat energy added to the gas would go 
toward increasing the rotational energy of its molecules.® In 
the neighborhood of the absolute zero, therefore, we might 
expect a polyatomic gas to behave like a monatomic one and we 
would thus have 
C, = 3 (as T approaches zero) (9) 
As the temperature of the gas rises, however, the force of the 
impacts between the molecules gradually increases as the mole- 
cules move faster and faster. This force will eventually begin to 
affect the atoms within the molecule causing them to get farther 
apart with a consequent weakening of the forces holding the 
molecule together and an increase in the moment of inertia 
of the molecule. The energy of rotation of the molecule as a 
whole will therefore increase and the heat capacity of the gas will 
rise. At still higher temperatures the atoms within the molecule 
will begin to vibrate with wider and wider amplitudes, and thus 
more and more heat will be absorbed in molecular rotation and in 
intra-molecular vibration. Polyatomic gases are thus char- 
acterized by a constantly increasing heat capacity with rise in 
temperature. Eventually the temperature will become so great 
that the molecules will begin to be broken up into their constit- 
uent atoms, so powerful will be the force of the collisions, and 
an appreciable fraction of the molecules will be in this dissociated 
condition all of the time. In other words, we now have a chemical 
reaction to deal with and heat added to the gas will not only be 
absorbed in increasing molecular and intra-molecular motions 
but will also be in part absorbed by the chemical reaction which 
is taking place. The “apparent heat capacity” will therefore be 
a complex quantity, and to obtain what we shall call the “true 
heat capacity” of such a gas we shall have to subtract from the 
total heat required to raise the temperature of the gas 1° the 
amount of heat absorbed by the chemical reaction which accom- 
panies this rise in temperature. As we go on increasing the tem- 
perature the “true” heat capacity evidently keeps on increasing
-P-A-G-E-323
  
Suc. 4] ENERGY OF MATERIAL SYSTEMS 295 
owing to the fact that the number of molecules is increasing 
all the time due to the progressive dissociation of the gas. Even- 
tually practically all the original molecules will be split up into 
their constituent atoms and C, (true) will therefore approach the 
upper limit, Buk cal. 
To sum up then, for every polyatomic gas in the neighborhood 
of the absolute zero we should expect to have C, = ar. As the 
temperature rises C, will increase and will eventually approach 
the upper limit, C, (true) = Buk, where n is the number of 
atoms in the molecule of the gas. This maximum temperature 
will be the higher the more stable the gas. 
As an examp!e of this behavior the values of C, for hydrogen 
(Hz) may be cited. Between 35° and 60° absolute, Eucken* 
found’ C, for this gas to be constant and equal to 2.98 cal., that is 
equal to 3p, as in the case of monatomic gases. Hydrogen is the 
only gas which has been found to show this behavior at low tem- 
peratures. With other gases liquefaction intervenes and prevents 
the study of the gas in the neighborhood of the absolute zero. 
Above 60° absolute, C, for hydrogen rises, at first fairly rapidly 
and then more slowly, attaining the value 4.77 cal. at 0° C. 
From here on, the measured (i.e., ‘“apparent’’) values of C, 
increase in accordance with the equation® 
Cy = 4.51 + 0.00097 (10) 
up to the highest temperature (2000° C.) for which we have reli- 
able measurements. In order to obtain. the “true” value of C, at 
high temperatures it is necessary, as explained above, to subtract 
from the “apparent” value the heat required for the chemical 
reaction, H, = 2H. Specific heat measurements with hydrogen 
have not been carried to the very high temperature necessary to 
reach the limiting value C, (“true”) = 2 X 3r = 8R = 5.96; but 
in the case of iodine vapor (I) the dissociation into I atoms is

known to be practically complete at 3000° and Bjerrum? has 
shown® experimentally that above this temperature the value of 
C, is in fact equal to approximately 6 cal., as required by theory. 
Problem 4.—According to Langmuir [Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc., 37, 441 
(1915)], the heat of formation of hydrogen gas (Hz) out of atomic hydrogen 
at constant pressure is Hp = 90,000 cal. per mole at 3000° absolute; and 2 
at 2300° absolute the dissociation constant for this reaction is oH Ky = 2 
0.16 when pressure is expressed in millimeters of mercury. (a) Assuming 
that Hp varies with the temperature in accordance with the equation Hp = 
H,) — 2T, where Hy is an integration constant, calculate the degree of 
dissociation, a, of hydrogen at 1000°, at 2300°, and at 4000° absolute. 
(Cf. XIX, 5, and equations 45 and 55, XXII.) (b) Derive an expression 
for & (for P = const.) in terms of Hp, a and T, (c) Show that about 
2.7 cal. of the “apparent” molal heat capacity of hydrogen at 2300° absolute 
is due to the displacement of the dissociation equilibrium. (d) Show that 
the “true” molal heat capacity of H» gas at 2300° absolute would be C, = 
about 4 cal. (e) At what temperature would the limiting value C, = 5.96 
cal. be attained (within 1 per cent.) in the case of hydrogen, (1) as to the 
“true” heat capacity of the gas, and (2) as to the “apparent”’ heat capacity 
of the gas? In all of the above calculations assume that P = const. = 
760 mm. 
[Nore: The solution of this problem should not be undertaken until the 
study of Chapter XXII has been completed. | 
5. Liquids and Highly Compressed Gases.—Owing to the 
gradual transition from the gaseous state to the liquid state which 
is possible above the critical point (Cf. IV, problem 4), a liquid 
may be regarded as a limiting case of a gas which has been highly 
compressed and then cooled. Owing to the close proximity of 
the molecules in a liquid or a compressed gas and the consequent 
magnitude of the forces acting between the molecules, such a 
system is evidently a very complex one as regards its heat ca- 
pacity. As we should expect, the heat capacity at constant 
volume will vary both with the temperature and with the nature 
of the liquid and owing to the complexity of the system no very 
important facts of general interest have as yet been discovered 
concerning the heat capacity of mobile liquids. Throughout 
the comparatively small temperature range within which mobile

Agriculture in Copenhagen.

  Suc. 6] ENERGY OF MATERIAL SYSTEMS 297 
liquids are stable systems at ordinary pressures, the value of C, 
appears to be a linear function of 7’ for pure (7.e., non-associated) 
liquids. 
If, however, a liquid be supercooled until it assumes the glassy 
state (VII, 3), it loses all of its mobility and becomes a solid. Its 
heat capacity then decreases continuously with 7’ and becomes 
zero when T = 0, as is also the case with crystalline solids, and 
for the same reasons, as explained in the next section. 
Associated liquids (XI, 2) dissociate gradually with rising tem- 
perature and hence part of their observed heat capacity is due to 
the heat required for the chemical reaction which is taking place. 
(Cf. Sec. 4.) The observed heat capacity may thus be very 
much larger than the ‘“‘true’”’ heat capacity. Thus the observed 
value of Cy for water at 0° is 18.141 cal.. With rising tempera- 
ture, it at first decreases until ¢ = 27°, after which it increases, 
increase being the normal behavior for a pure (non-associated) 
liquid. Owing to the large quantity of heat required for the 
depolymerization of the water with rising temperature the 
“apparent” specific heat capacity of water is the greatest of any 
known liquid. 
CRYSTALLINE Souips!° 
6. The Absorption of Heat by a Crystal. (a) Very Low Tem- 
peratures.—The atoms in the crystal network of a monatomic 
substance are held in definite positions by the action of the power- 
ful crystal forces. As we have explained in a previous chapter 
(VII, 1), heat motion in a crystal at ordinary temperatures 
consists in an unordered oscillation of the atomic units about 
their centers in the crystal network. In the neighborhood of 
the absolute zero the amplitudes of these oscillations will become 
vanishingly small and at the absolute zero the oscillations would 
probably cease entirely. Near the absolute zero, therefore, a 
crystal should behave like a perfectly elastic body even toward 
molecular impacts from the outside, that is, its constituent atomic 
units would be so firmly bound together by the enormous crystal 
forces that the comparatively slight thermal impacts which at 
this low temperature the crystal could receive from the outside 
would not be powerful enough nor quick enough to set the indi- 
vidual atoms into a state of unordered oscillatory motion. In- 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  298 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY ([Cuap. XX 
stead, the whole crystal would behave like one large molecule and 
the only way it could respond’ in any appreciable degree to 
molecular impacts from the outside would be by vibrating as a 
whole, in the way an elastic body does when it is struck. Heat 
energy absorbed by a crystal in the neighborhood of the absolute 
zero would therefore practically all be used up in setting the 
crystal into a state of compressional and distortional vibration. 
With the aid of the theory of elasticity it should therefore be 
possible to deduce the relationship which connects heat capacity 
and temperature for solid substances in the neighborhood of 
the absolute zero. This has in fact been done!! by Debye* and by 
Tolman by two different methods of reasoning both of which 
lead to the result that 
cy = const. X T’ (12) 
(Cs De 3R = 71.9 X ee (13) 
In words, the heat capacity is proportional to the cube of the 
absolute temperature, the proportionality constant being char- 
acteristic of the substance. Equation (18), the form given by 
Debye, is simply equation (12) written for one mole of the sub- 
stance and with its proportionality constant split for convenience 
into two parts, the part @ having the same dimensions as 7’ and 
being a characteristic constant for each substance. The value of 
@ varies between such limits as @ = 50 for calcium and 6 = 88 
for lead up to 6 = 1840 for carbon in the form of the diamond. 
As to the temperature range over which equation (13) holds, 
Debye states that it may be expected to give results correct to 1 
6 i i per cent. up to T = rT Thus for cesium it could be used 
only up to T = 3 = 4° but for carbon it would hold up as high as 
1840 : 2 iH De 150°. In Fig. 46 the graph of equation (13) is 
shown, taking C, and T? as the variables and using for 6 the 
values indicated. In the same figure the observed values of C, for 
carbon and for aluminium are also given. The causes of the

individuals in a random fashion about their centers in the crystal 
network. As soon as the amount of energy absorbed in this 
manner begins to become appreciable, equation (13) will evi- 
dently cease to hold since it was derived on the assumption that 
no heat is absorbed in this manner. Moreover, the more power- 
ful the crystal forces, and the smaller the mass of the atoms, 
the higher will the temperature have to be before the individual
-P-A-G-E-328
  300 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XX 
atoms can attain such oscillation frequencies that their kinetic 
energy of oscillation begins to be appreciable, for the kinetic 
energy of an oscillating body is proportional to its mass and to the 
square of its oscillation frequency. With a substance such as 
cxsium or lead which is soft and easily compressible and has a 
comparatively low melting point (Pb, 327° and Cs, 26°), the 
crystal forces must evidently be rather weak and hence its atoms 
can be set into random oscillation at a very low temperature and 
since furthermore they are very heavy atoms (see Table I), the 
energy which they can absorb in this way will be comparatively 
large. We see, therefore, why, in the case of a substance such as 
lead, we should expect deviations from equation (13) to appear 
very soon. In fact no measurements have been made with lead 
within the small temperature region (7’+8°) where we could 
expect equation (13) to hold. The characteristic constant, 6, in 
that equation is evidently closely connected with the strength of 
the crystal forces and with the mass of the atoms of the crystal; in 
fact it varies directly with the former and inversely with the 
latter of these quantities. 
On the other hand, in the case of a crystal such as the diamond, 
where we have extreme rigidity coupled with a very high melting 
point, the crystal forces must evidently be very powerful, and this 
fact coupled with the small mass of the atoms evidently requires 
that a fairly high temperature must be attained before the 
energy absorbed by the random oscillation of these atoms can 
begin to be appreciable. This accords with the fact that @ is 
very large and hence that equation (13) holds fairly well for 
this substance even up as high as JT’ = 220°, as is evident from 
Fig. 46. 
(c) Moderate and High Temperatures. The Law of Dulong 
and Petit.—If we continue to raise the temperature of our crystal, 
the energy absorbed by the oscillating atoms increases con- 
tinuously and eventually the heat capacity will be determined 
almost entirely by the energy absorbed by these oscillating 
atoms and that which is absorbed in producing transverse and 
longitudinal vibrations through the crystal will soon become 
negligibly small. As the temperature increases and approaches ° 
the melting point of the crystal, the forces which are holding the 
atoms in their places in the crystal network will become so
-P-A-G-E-329
  Src. 6] ENERGY OF MATERIAL SYSTEMS 301 
weak in comparison with the kinetic energy of agitation, that 
the crystal is almost ready to begin breaking up by melting. 
(Cf. VII, 1.) As this condition is approached the average kinetic 
energy of the oscillating atoms will therefore approach that of 
freely moving unrestrained molecules, such as those of a gas or 
liquid. This latter kinetic energy in the case of a monatomic 
substance is, as we have already seen (equation 4), 
Ey = SRT cal. per mole (14) 
In addition to its kinetic energy a body oscillating about a cen- 
ter possesses potential energy (X, 1) also, that is, if the body were 
suddenly stopped in any part of its orbit, it would then fall into 
its center of attraction and on reaching this center would attain 
such a velocity that its kinetic energy would be the same as that 
which it possessed when moving in its orbit of oscillation. Po- 
tential energy and kinetic energy are therefore, on the average, 
equal in the case of a body oscillating about a center and hence 
for the total thermal energy, Zr, of N such oscillating atoms we 
would have 
Ey = 2E, = 3RT (15) 
and hence by definition 
_ dEy _ a Cy = Gar = BR = 5.956 cal. (16) 
That is, with increasing temperature the atomic heat capacity (at 
constant volume) of every pure monatomic crystalline substance 
approaches the limit 3R or 5.956 cal. 
In the case of most of the elements which are solids at ordinary 
temperatures (the exceptions are those of low atomic weight and 
high melting point such as carbon, boron, and glucinum), C, has 
attained the average value 5.9 + 0.1 cal. even at room tempera- 
tures.!2. Similarly for the same elements the values of C, do not 
differ from 6.2 cal. by more than 0.2, on the average, so that even 
for specific heats at constant pressure and at room temperatures 
the product of specific heat and atomic weight is approximately 
a constant for nearly all the solid elements. This striking regu- 
larity was noticed in 1819 by Dulong* and Petit’ and is known as 
* Pierre Louis Dulong (1785-1838). Professor of Physics at the Poly- 
technic School in Paris.

Dulong and Petit’s Law. It has been of considerable assistance 
in determining atomic weights in some instances. 
Problem 5.—A certain element was found to combine with chlorine in the 
ratio of 1.376 parts to 1 part of chlorine and the specific heat capacity of the 
solid element was found to be cp = 0.032 cal. per gram. Calculate an 
exact value for its atomic weight. 
(d) Very High Temperatures.—We have seen (XVI, 2) that in 
metals there appear to be considerable numbers of electrons which 
are in a comparatively free condition, since they are able to pass 
from atom to atom within the crystal under the influence of an 
E.M.F. In the case of a metal we might therefore expect that 
at sufficiently high temperatures the state of motion of the elec- 
trons would begin to be affected by the violently oscillating atoms 
and that considerable numbers of these electrons would conse- 
quently undergo an increase in their amplitude of oscillation, or 
their velocity of translation among the molecules, or both. If 
this should occur the value of C, should then rise above the limit 
C, = 8R = 5.956 cal. 
Direct experimental confirmation of this conclusion is rather 
difficult to obtain owing to the fact that the necessary values of 
a and 6 in equation (1b) are not readily measured at high tem- 
peratures, but by choosing for experimentation the metals of the 
alkalies and the alkaline earths which are strongly electropositive 
and whose electrons are therefore comparatively loosely held, 
it has been found" that the values of C, do in fact, rise consider- 
ably above the limit 3R, even at room temperatures and in the 
case of cesium, the most electropositive of all the metals, the 
value 3R appears to be exceeded even at the boiling point of 
nitrogen. White* found! C, = 6.844 for platinum at 1300° and 
Corbino,’ who has measured cy for tungsten at 1500° estimates 
C, to be as large as 7.8 cal. at this temperature! and a later 
determination” has given the value 7.35 at 2000°. Silver, tin, 
nickel, copper and aluminium appear to exhibit a similar behavior!® 
which may therefore be assumed to be characteristic of the 
metals. No satisfactory quantitative theory”! has as yet been 
developed for including this electron absorption of heat.

consequently with small values of 6) the initial flat portion of the 
curve is very short and we have a very rapid rise to the final flat 
portion where C, is nearly constant and equal to 5.9. Thus this 
value is reached in the case of lead (see Fig. 47) at as low a tem- 
perature as {= —50. 
As the mass of the atoms decreases and the melting point rises, 
6 increases and the character of the C,-T’ curve changes as 
shown in the figure, the initial flat portion increasing in length, the 
subsequent rise becoming more gradual and the value C,=5.9

being attained only at higher and higher temperatures. Thus for 
silver C, does not reach 5.9 cal. until t= 240°, and for aluminium 
t must be 760° before this value is attained. In the case of carbon 
it is not attained at any temperature within the range covered by 
the measurements and calculation indicates that the necessary 
temperature would lie above the melting point of this substance. 
(b) The Equations of Debye and of Nernst-Lindemann.—For 
monatomic crystals, Debye!! with the aid of a quantum 
theory (X, 13) and other auxiliary hypotheses has derived a 
general quantitative relationship connecting C, with T. This 
relationship contains only a single arbitrary constant, the con- 
stant 0 already referred to. The curves drawn in Fig. 47 are the 
graphs of the Debye function employing the values of 6 indicated. 
The points indicated by the centers of the circles are observed 
values of C, for the three substances indicated. The close con- 
cordance between the positions of these points and the graphs of 
the Debye function indicates that the latter is capable of repre- 
senting very closely the variation of C, with T for these 
substances. 
The complete equation of Debye is too complicated to repro- 
duce here, but for all temperatures above 7'=0.340 (and with 
the exception of such elements as carbon, boron, and glucinum 
this means practically for all temperatures above t= —150°) 
it may be replaced without error greater than 1 per cent. by the 
following empirical equation of Nernst and Lindemann:4 
yt (yet (7 ) 1)’ (a ay 1)’ 
in which e¢ is the base of the natural logarithms. This equation 
evidently contains only one constant which depends upon the 
nature of the substance, namely, the constant @ whose significance 
we have already discussed, and even this constant can be cal- 
culated with sufficient exactness for many purposes from the 
atomic weight A, the density D, and the absolute melting point 
Tr of the substance by means of the following equation derived 
by Lindemann: : 
0 = 136 (3)" Gy (18)   
C= ar (17)

  Suc. 9] ENERGY OF MATERIAL SYSTEMS 305 
8. Atomic Weight and Specific Heat Capacity.—The calcula- 
tion of atomic weight A from specific heat data with the aid of 
Dulong and Petit’s Law was illustrated by problem 5. For 
elements with large values of @ and for which Dulong and Petit’s 
Law does not hold with sufficient exactness at ordinary tempera- 
tures, a more exact result can be obtained by employing the 
Nernst-Lindemann equation and evaluating the constant 06 
either by determining two values of c., one at ordinary tempera- 
tures and one at a very low temperature, or by calculating @ 
in terms of A by means of equation (18). Thus for alumin- 
ium (c, = 0.200 at 0°) we obtain from the Nernst-Lindemann 
equation A = 26.8, while Dulong and Petit’s Law in the form 
C, = 6.2 gives 31 and in the form C, = 5.9 gives 29.5, the cor- 
rect value being 27.1. 
9. The Heat Capacity of Compounds and the Rule of Kopp.— 
At ordinary temperatures the molal heat capacity (Cp) of a solid 
compound is approximately equal to the sum of the atomic heat 
capacities of its constituent elements. This statement is known 
as the rule of Kopp.* In employing Kopp’s rule the value Cp = 
6.2 should be employed as the average value for all the elements 
which at ordinary temperatures conform to Dulong and Petit’s 
Law. For those which do not so conform and for those which in 
the free state are not solids at ordinary tempeatures, individual 
values of C, calculated from solid compounds containing the 
elements should be used. ‘Thus suppose we wished to calculate 
the specific heat capacity of anhydrousCuSO,. For Cu we could 
take C, = 6.2. Sulphur does not conform to Dulong and Petit’s 
Law, however, and oxygen is not a solid at ordinary temperatures. 
From a study of the heat capacities of various solid compounds 
containing these elements it has been found that in such com- 
pounds these two elements appear to have on the average the 
following atomic heat capacities, for oxygen C, = 4 cal. and for 
sulphur C, = 5.4 cal. For the specific heat capacity of CuSO. 
we would therefore have

306 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XX 
A still better procedure, however, would be to base the calcula- 
tion upon an observed value (if such were available) of c, for 
some analogous compound. Thus c, for ZnSO, has been found 
to be 0.174 cal. and hence for one mole of ZnSO. we have 
Cy = 0.174(66 + 32 + 4 X 16) = 28.2 cal. 
and this must also be the value of C, for CuSO, since Cu and Zn 
both obey the law of Dulong and Petit and hence have the same 
value for C,. Hence for CuSO. we would have 
oy 2802 op = 60 = 0.176 cal. 
Data concerning the variation of the molal heat capacity of 
compounds with the temperature are not very numerous or ex- 
tensive, but for several cases in which such data have been de- 
termined Lewis and Gibson’® found that the average atomic heat 
of compounds followed the Debye law, if instead of f the quanti- 
Tyh i : R ge ty a) were substituted therein, where h is a characteristic con- 
stant less than unity. The law so modified was found to hold 
for those elementary substances such as graphite, sulphur, sil- 
icon and the halogens which do not obey the Debye law and for 
the compound substances, formic acid, urea, and ethyl and propyl 
alcohols.

Problem 7.—The oxide of a certain metallic element contains 82.71 per

10. Constant Pressure Processes.—Consider any physico- 
chemical system in a state or condition which we will call a, 
the initial condition. Let the temperature and total pressure on 
the system be kept constant. Now suppose some isothermal 
process or processes (either chemical or physical, or both) to 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
Sec. 10] ENERGY OF MATERIAL SYSTEMS 307 
take place within the system, whereby it is transformed into a 
new condition which we will call B, the final condition. The reac- 
tion or process which takes place will be represented by a—s. 
The heat evolved by the system as a result of the reaction, a—B, 
we will call the heat effect, Hp, of the reaction. (Cf. XIX, 5.) 
The magnitude of the heat effect of a given isothermal reaction 
in a given system depends in general upon the temperature T' at 
which the reaction in question takes place; and the quantitative 
relation between Hp and T can be readily derived with the aid of 
the First Law of Thermodynamics, as follows: 
According to this law (see X, 4) the increase, AU, in the total 
energy, U, of the system, which accompanies any change in the 
condition of the system, is independent of the manner in which 
this change is brought about. For an isopiestic process the 
work, W, is also evidently independent of the nature of the proc- 
ess, because (see equation 3, X) W = pAv, where Av is the differ- 
ence between the initial and the final volumes respectively of the 
system. It therefore follows from equation (1, X) that Q, the 
heat absorbed during the change, is also independent of the way 
in which the change occurs. 
Suppose the system in question changes from the initial state 
A at the temperature 7' to the final state B at the temperature 
[T+ dT. This change can occur in two ways: 
(1) The reaction, a—B, may take place at the temperature 
T and the resulting system may then be heated from 7’ to 
T+ dT. The total heat absorbed in this process would be 
Qi: = — He + Cp,dT (19) 
where H, is the heat effect of the reaction at the temperature 
T and C>, is the total heat capacity of the system in the final 
state B. 
(2) The system in the state a may first be heated from 7 to 
T+ dT and the reaction, A>B, may then take place at the 
temperature T+ d7. The total heat absorbed in this process 
would be 
dHp Q2 = Cp,dT — (Hp + “ar oP) (20) 
where Cx, is the heat capacity of the system in the initial state a,
-P-A-G-E-336
  308 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XX 
But since Q is independent of the manner in which the change 
is brought about, we have Q: = Qs, and therefore 
dH, _ aT = Cp, — Cp, = ACp pune (2D) 
where AC, is evidently the increase in heat capacity (at constant 
pressure) of the system which accompanies the reaction 4—>B.

at the temperature 7’ and pressure pi and endeavor to discover by 
thermodynamic reasoning the increase, AU, in the total or in- 
ternal energy, U, of our gas, which occurs when the gas is allowed 
to expand isothermally from p,; to some other pressure ps. If it 
expands reversibly, that is, against an applied external pressure 
substantially equal at every moment to the pressure which it 
itself exerts, it will perform the maximum amount of work and
-P-A-G-E-337

this amount will be by definition (X, 9) the free energy, A, of the 
expansion process. From equation (2, X) we have dW = pdv 
and hence

A Wee = { pdo = RT log. © (24)

pA os Tap = RI log a (26) 
whence 
Q=A = Wax (27) 
and 
AU =Q — Wwe = 0 (28) 
or stated in words: 
The internal energy of a perfect gas is independent of its pres- 
sure or volume. When the gas expands isothermally without 
doing work it neither absorbs nor evolves any heat, but if it 
does any work during its expansion, it then absorbs an amount 
of heat exactly equivalent to the work which it performs. This 
result was discovered empirically by Gay-Lussac and by Joule.¢ 
It is also one of the conclusions yielded by the kinetic theory of 
gases. 
Problem 12.—With the aid of equation (22) demonstrate that the heat 
capacity (at constant volume) C,, of a perfect gas, is independent of its pres- 
sure or volume. Is this also true for Cp? 
18. Gases under High Pressures. The Liquefaction of 
Gases.*—When a gas under a high pressure is allowed to expand 
without doing work, some energy will be used up in separating 
the molecules against the attractive forces which exist between 
them (Cf. II, 10a), and if no heat is allowed to flow into the 
expanding gas, that is, if the expansion takes place adiabatically,

the temperature of the gas will fall, provided its initial tem- 
perature is below a certain characteristic value known as the 
inversion point of the gas, the position of which varies with the 
pressure on the gas. This cooling effect (known as the ‘‘Joule- 
Thomson* effect’’), which is zero in the case of perfect gases and 
very small for gases at moderate pressures, is frequently of con- 
siderable magnitude for gases under high pressures (see Table 
XXXII) and it is employed technically for the liquefaction of 
gases in machines of the Linde and Hampson types.

  The cooling effect which accompanies the adiabatic expansion 
of a gas which does work during its expansion is much greater than 
the Joule-Thomson effect, and as we have seen in the preceding 
section, occurs even in the case of perfect gases. The technical 
application of this larger cooling effect to the liquefaction of 
gases was for a long time prevented by mechanical difficulties 
but these were eventually overcome and the Claude liquid air 
machine makes use of this principle. The technical applications

in passing out through this tube it obviously cools the entering 
air which, on subsequent expansion at the expansion valve, 
attains a lower temperature until finally this progressive cooling 
results in the liquefaction of part of the air, which then collects in 
V and is drawn off through the valve R. 
In the Claude* machine (Fig. 49) the air, purified, compressed 
and cooled, enters the central tube of the concentric worms and 
passes into the expansion chamber, D, of an air-engine, either a 
turbine or a piston machine similar to a steam engine. Here it 
expands and does work in driving the engine and as a result 
undergoes a correspondingly large fall in temperature, about 95 
per cent. of the heat loss representing the energy supplied to the 
engine and the remaining 5 per cent, being due to the Joule- 
Thomson effect. The cold air then passes up and around a 
set of tubes Z similar to a boiler and connected with the feed 
supply as indicated. The air in these tubes is cooled by the 
expanded air which then passes out through the outer tube of the 
concentric worms and serves to cool the entering air. This 
process goes on until finally the air in the tubes L begins to 
liquefy and collects in the bottom of the compartment, whence 
it is drawn off at regular intervals by an automatic valve. The 
engine driven by the expanding air is connected to an air com- 
pressor and assists in compressing the air which is to be fed into 
the machine. 
A third system, the Jefferies-Norton system” (Fig. 50), differs 
from the Claude in at least three important points, viz.: (1) The 
system employs more than one engine (in the illustration three, AE, 
BE, and CE), each working through a different temperature 
range. The number of these temperature steps depends upon 
conditions, increasing with the total range of temperature to be 
covered and also with decreasing initial pressure employed. (2) 
The pressure in the outgoing leg of the U is only enough 
lower than in the incoming leg to allow for proper control of flow, 
unavoidable friction, head of liquid in the still trays and the like. 
(3) The engines work upon the gases after their liquefaction 
and distillation, thus permitting all the gas to be so treated. 
Incidentally, this prevents easily frozen impurities entering the

engine valve chambers and cylinders and in many cases simplifies 
the whole problem of initial purification of the gas to be treated. 
Engine CE corresponds in a way to Claude’s one engine system 
but the initial pressure used in the system can, on account of its 
greater efficiency, be much less than in the latter. Since, when 
expanding a given weight of gas between two definite pressures,

the higher its temperature, engine AE will extract the most 
heat from the system and deliver the most power to the crank- 
shaft per unit of gas used and engine CE the least, which empha- 
sizes the importance of this development. The first large scale 
Jefferies-Norton system constructed was installed by the United

14, The Pressure-Volume Law for the Adiabatic Expansion of 
a Perfect Gas.—For any process involving only infinitesimal 
energy changes, the equation of the First Law of Thermodynamics 
may be written 
dU = dQ. — dW = dQ — pdv (29)
-P-A-G-E-342
  
  314 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XX 
whence, 
dU (8) ar = (by definition) me,dT (30) 
when m is the mass of the system. 
For an adiabatic process 
dQ = 0 (by definition) (31) 
and hence for such a process, equation (29) becomes 
medT + pdv = 0 (32) 
For a perfect gas 
mT = Me v 33 = RP (33) 
and (see equation 3a) 
R = M(cp — cm) (34) 
Combining these equations with equation (32) so as to eliminate 
T, we find 
d log. p + ad log. v = 0 (35) 
which on integration gives 
cp 
pv” = pv’ = const. (36) 
This equation shows the manner in which p and v vary during the 
adiabatic expansion of a perfect gas. The specific heat ratio, 
Cp: Mae is of course a constant for a given gas.

equation (32). F 
Problem 15.—With the aid of equation (36) derive the relation connecting 
p and T during the adiabatic expansion of a perfect gas. 
Problem 16.—Four moles of a perfect monatomic gas at 0° and a pressure 
of 0.1 atmosphere are allowed to expand reversibly until the pressure falls to 
0.1mm. Calculate in liter atmospheres the work done: (1) if the expansion 
takes place isothermally, and (2) if it takes place adiabatically. 
Problem 17.—When air at 0° is allowed to expand suddenly from an initial 
pressure of five atmospheres to a final pressure of one atmosphere it is cooled 
1.1° by the Joule-Thomson effect. If it performed maximum work during 
this adiabatic expansion, approximately how much would it be cooled? 
The specific heat ratio for air is 1.40, (Cf. problem 15.)

CHEMICAL KINETICS 
Homocrenrous Systems 
1. Rate of Reaction.—The rate at which a chemical reaction 
proceeds in a homogeneous (I, 9) system is defined as the de- 
crease in the equivalent concentration of the reacting molecular 
species in the time, dé, divided by that time, or mathematically 
rate of reaction = — < (1) 
Experiment shows that in gaseous systems and in dilute solu- 
tions in which the thermodynamic environment is kept con- 
stant the rate of any chemical reaction is proportional to the 
product of the concentrations of the reacting molecular species, 
each concentration being raised to a power equal to the 
number of molecules of the corresponding molecular species 
which enter into the reaction, as shown by the chemical 
equation which expresses the reaction as it actually takes place. 
Thus if the reaction whose rate is being measured is expressed by 
the equation 
aA+bB+....=mM-+nN+.... (2) 
then the law just stated would be expressed by the equation 
—aAT_ _ TB) _ pra perp qa ode CO. (3) 
where the brackets, [A], [B]. etc., signify the concentrations, 
at the time, t, of the molecular species, A, B, etc., expressed in 
equivalents per liter. This law is known as Guldberg* and 
Waage’s? law of chemical mass action as applied to reaction rate. 
The constant, k, is known as the specific reaction rate.

If the above reaction does not go to completion in the direc- 
tion indicated by the arrow, the rate of the reverse reaction 
must also be considered. This would evidently be 
QM] INT pry = Sap cae k[M]"{N]” ... (4) 
and the resultant rate in the direction indicated by the arrow would 
be the difference between the actual rates of the two opposing 
reactions, that is, 
dA] _ _ dA] ATIBP /TMytN]= — GAL GA a) = MANIB) ... — b [MIMIN.. 6) 
In what follows we shall confine the consideration to the rates of 
reactions which run practically to completion in one direction, 
that is, reactions in which k’ is negligibly small. 
2. First Order Reactions.— Reactions in which the concentra- 
tion of only one reacting substance changes are called first order 
reactions, provided only one molecule of this reacting substance 
appears in the chemical equation which expresses the reaction 
as it actually takes place. The change of dibrom-succinic acid 
into brom-maleic acid, which occurs when it is boiled with water, 
is an example of a reaction of this type. 
CHBrCOOH CHCOOH q{M] _ 
= + HBr 
CHBrCOOH  CBrCOOH 
Another example is the hydrolysis of cane sugar in dilute aqueous 
solution in the presence of an acid. The reaction is 
Ci2H201 + H20 = glucose Gaenrrece 
Problem 1.—Two reacting substances, water and sugar, evidently are 
involved in this reaction. How can it be a first order reaction according to 
the above characterization of a first order reaction? 
For a first order reaction the general law of reaction rate, 
equation (8), evidently reduces to the form 
— d[A] 
dt 
or if we call A the equivalent concentration of the reacting sub- 
stance when the reaction begins (7.e., when t=0), and x the num-   
= KA] (6)

  318 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XXI 
ber of equivalents (per liter) which have disappeared as a result 
of the reaction, at the end of ¢ units of time, then at the time t we 
have [A]=A —a and—d[A]=dz, and equation (6) may be written 
in the form 
dx 
dt 
Problem 2.—Show that the integral of this equation is = k(A — 2) (7) 
1 A 7 logo g z= 0.4343 & (8) 
Problem 3.—In a solution at 48° containing 0.3 mole of cane sugar in a 
liter of 0.1 normal HCl, it is found (by means of a polarimeter) that 32 per 
cent. of the sugar is hydrolyzed in 20 minutes. (a) Calculate the proportion- 
ality constant, k, which is known as the specific reaction rate. (b) Calculate 
the rates of the reaction at its start and at the end of 30 minutes. (c) What 
per cent. of the sugar will be hydrolyzed at the end of 60 minutes? (d) 
What per cent. of the sugar would be hydrolyzed at the end of 30 minutes 
if the 0.3 mole had been initially dissolved in 10 liters of the 0.1m HCl instead 
ofin 1lliter? The HClacts merely asa catalyst (XXI, 12). Itisnotused up 
during the reaction and its concentration may be treated as a constant. 
8. Second Order Reactions.—When two reacting molecular 
species or two molecules of the same species simultaneously 
disappear. as a result of the reaction, under conditions such 
that the concentrations of both decrease, then the reaction is 
classed as a second order reaction. 
Examples: 
(1) The saponification of an ester by an alkali, 
CH;COOCH; + NaOH = CH;COONa + CH;0H 
(2) The polymerization of NO: in the gaseous state, 
2NO2=N204 
Problem 4.—If A is the initial concentration of one of the reacting sub- 
stances and B that of the other, and « is the number of equivalents, per 
liter, of each which have been changed over by the reaction after ¢ units of 
time, show that the equation for the rate of the reaction may be written, 
da qe k(A — x)(B — 2) (9) 
The general integral of this equation is 
1 BA ~ 2) _ a= Byt OSA ( (B=) 0.4343k (10)
-P-A-G-E-347
Suc. 4] CHEMICAL KINETICS 319 
Problem 5.—If A and B are equal or if the two reacting molecules are of 
the same kind show that the integral is 
1 x 
ieee” an 
Problem 6.—In the saponification of methyl acetate (CHs;COOCH:) by 
caustic soda, 20 per cent. of the ester will be saponified in 10 minutes when 
the initial concentrations are both 0.01 molal. (a) How long will it take to 
saponify 99 per cent.? (b) What will be the concentration of methyl 
alcohol at the end of half an hour? If the initial concentration of the 
ester is 0.015 mole and that of the NaOH 0.03 mole per liter, (c) what per 
cent. of the ester will be saponified in 10 minutes, (d) how long will it take to 
saponify 99 per cent., and (e) what will be the concentration of methyl 
alcohol at the end of half an hour? 
4, Third Order Reactions.—This order includes all reactions 
in which three reacting molecules are directly involved with 
concentration decrease. 
Example: 
2CH;sCOOAg + HCOONa = 2Ag + CO2 + CH;COOH + 
CHsCOONa 
The three molecules here are two molecules of silver acetate and 
one of sodium formate. The equation for the rate of this re- 
action would evidently be 
& Ce (Bs) (12) 
5. Reactions of Higher Orders.—Reactions of higher orders 
than the third seem to be of comparatively rare occurrence. For 
example, the reaction which is written 
2P-H3 + 402 = P20; + 3H20 
represents stoichiometrically the combustion of the gas PH3. 
This would apparently be a reaction of the sixth order since six 
reacting molecules are involved. Experiment shows, however, 
that the rate of this reaction actually corresponds to the equation 
of a second order reaction. The interpretation placed upon this 
fact is that the above reaction actually occurs in stages. The first 
stage is the slow reaction, PH; + O2 = HPO. + H2. This is 
evidently a second order reaction. The subsequent reactions 
by which H,O and P20; are produced are very rapid in com-
-P-A-G-E-348
  320 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XX1 
parison with the first stage so that the rate which is actually 
measured experimentally is the rate of the first stage of the re- 
action, which accounts for the fact that the reaction behaves as 
asecond order one. The rate of a reaction which occurs in stages 
can obviously never be greater than the rate of the slowest stage 
and this is the reason why reactions of higher orders are less 
commonly met with. The slowest stage of the reaction deter- 
mines its order and the slow stages seem most frequently to be 
either first, second or third order reactions. 
The most general and exact method of defining the “order” of 
a reaction is on the basis of the differential equation which 
expresses the law of the reaction rate in terms of the concentra- 
tions of the molecular and ionie species involved. By this 
method the order of the reaction is defined as simply equal to the 
algebraic sum of the exponents (of the concentrations of the spe- 
cies involved) which appear in the differential equation express- 
ing the reaction rate. According to this definition negative and 
fractional orders as well as the zero order are all: possible. A 
fuller discussion of such cases and of the whole subject of chemi- 
cal kinetics in homogeneous sytems will be found in Zawidski’s* 
excellent treatise! on the subject which should be read by every 
student interested in pursuing in further detail the subject of 
chemical kinetics. 
6. Saponification and the Ionic Theory.— 
Problem 7.—(a) In dilute solution the rate of saponification of ethyl 
acetate by Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH), or Sr(OH): is found to obey the equation of 
a second order reaction and to have a specific reaction rate only slightly 
smaller than in the case of saponification with NaOH. Stoichiometrically 
the reaction would be written. 
2CH;COOC2H; + Ba(OH)2 = (CH;COO).Ba + 2C,H;,OH 
and would appear to be a third order reaction. Show how according to the 
Ionic Theory we should expect the reaction to be a second order one and 
to have nearly the same specific reaction rate as in the case of NaOH. 
(b) The specific reaction rates for saponification with KOH, LiOH and CsOH 
are the same as for NaOH, but that for NH,OH is very much smaller (ini- 
tially only about zy as large, in fact, for a 0.1 normal solution). All the 
reactions are second order ones. How are these facts interpreted by the 
Ionic Theory? (Suggestion: Write all the reactions in the ionic form 
and make use of the facts stated in XVII, 3. Esters are non-electrolytes.)

Institute at Lemberg, Poland.

Sue. 7] CHEMICAL KINETICS 321 
Problem 8.—At 25° the initial rate of saponification of ethyl acetate by 
0.01 normal NaOH is 9.0 times as great as that by 0.1 normal KCN. From 
the conclusions reached in problem 7, together with the data given in XVII, 
8, what would you conclude as to the concentration of hydroxyl ion in the 
KCN solution? The source of this hydroxyl ion will be explained later 
(equation 25, XXIII). 
7. Reaction Rate and Thermodynamic Environment. The 
Neutral Salt Effect—Reaction rates in solution are usually 
appreciably influenced by the presence of neutral salts which 
apparently have nothing directly to do with the reaction itself. 
In many cases this ‘‘neutral salt effect,” as it is called, may be 
interpreted as due, at least partially, to the influence of the ions 
of the salt upon the thermodynamic environment (XVII, 6) pre- 
vailing within the solution, for the rate of any given reaction is 
"very powerfully influenced by the nature of the medium in which 
it takes place. In employing reaction rates for determining the 
concentration of some molecular species in a given solution it is, 
therefore, essential that the experiments be conducted as far as 
possible under comparable conditions as regards thermodynamic 
environment. Thus in problem 8, the NaOH solution employed 
in the experiment should have been one which had an OH--ion 
concentration as close as possible to that prevailing in the KCN 
solution, and it should also have contained sufficient KCl to 
make its total concentration of uni-univalent electrolyte 0.1 
equivalent per liter. The thermodynamic environment within 
the NaOH solution would then probably have been as close 
to that prevailing within the KCN solution as it is possible to 
make it. Only when the thermodynamic environments are 
identical in two solutions are we justified in assuming that a 
given reaction has the same specific reaction rate in both solu- 
tions. This should be borne constantly in mind in employing 
the laws of chemical kinetics in the study of solutions. 
8. Temperature and Reaction Rate.—It has been found in 
many cases that equal increments of temperature produce 
about the same multiplication of reaction rate. For each 
rise of 10° the rate of the reaction is multiplied 24 fold, the 
exact value of the multiplying factor varying with the nature 
of the reaction, approaching unity for very fast reactions and 
increasing rapidly as the reaction velocity itself decreases.? 
21
-P-A-G-E-350
322 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXI 
Problem 9.—Assuming 2.5 as an average value for this multiplying factor 
calculate how many fold the reaction rate would be increased by a rise of 
100°. 
A more general expression for the effect of temperature upon 
the specific reaction rate is that formulated by van’t Hoff as 
follows: 
dlogk A 
dr ~ 78 (13) 
where A is a characteristic constant. 
CaTALYSIS. 
9. The Phenomenon of Catalysis.—The rates of chemical reac- 
tions in many instances can be greatly increased by the presence 
in the reaction mixture of substances, called catalytic agents 
or catalysts, which are not themselves consumed by the re- 
action. This phenomenon is known as catalysis. There are 
many kinds and varieties of catalysts and the mechanism of 
their action is so different in different cases and so little under- 
stood that few, if any, general principles can be laid down con- 
cerning the phenomenon. It is of immense importance, however, 
in scientific and industrial processes as well as in many processes 
which occur in nature, and a brief statement regarding whatis 
known concerning the action of some classes of catalysts will be 
included here. 
10. Contact Agents.—Many reactions both in the gaseous 
state and in solution are greatly accelerated near the surface of 
certain solids such as platinum black, ferric oxide and other 
metallic oxides. Such substances in a finely divided state 
adsorb (that is, concentrate and hold upon their surface). one 
or more of the reacting substances from the gas or solution and 
the reaction in the adsorbed layer then proceeds much more 
rapidly than in the body of the gas or solution where the concen- 
trations are much lower and where the molecules are not orient- 
ated as they are in the adsorbed layer. This is supposed to be 
the mechanism of the catalytic effect of some of the contact 
agents. The action appears in many cases, however, to be a 
very specific one. The contact process of sulphuric acid mapu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  Sec. 11] CHEMICAL KINETICS 323 
facture is an example of a technical application of a contact 
agent. 
A clear presentation of the various hypotheses which have 
been suggested for interpreting the behavior of contact catalysts 
has been given recently by Bancroft.’ Rideal* and Taylor’s,’ 
Catalysis in Theory and Practice (1919) should also be consulted 
for further details concerning the whole subject of catalysis and 
catalytic agents. 
For reactions between gases at very low pressures the applica- 
tion of the principles of the kinetic theory of gases lead to quanti- 
tative deductions which are capable of experimental test. The 
quantitative theory of contact catalysis obtained in this way 
is discussed below. (Sec. 18.) 
11. Carriers—In many homogeneous reactions the catalyst 
reacts chemically with one of the reacting substances to form an 
intermediate compound which in turn reacts in such a way as to 
regenerate the catalyst and produce the final reaction products. 
Such catalysts are known as carriers. Thus nitric oxide, NO, 
acts as a carrier in the familiar chamber process for the manu- 
facture of sulphuric acid which is usually written 
O. + 2NO = 2NO2 
and then 
SO. + NO. + H.O = H.80. + NO 
12. Ions as Catalysts.—Hydrogen ion and hydroxyl ion act as 
catalysts for many reactions which occur in aqueous solution. 
The velocity of any reaction catalyzed by either of these two 
ions is, in dilute solution, directly proportional to the con- 
centration of the ions in question as long as the thermodynamic 
environment remains constant. The inversion of cane sugar 
by an acid, the hydrolysis of an ester by an acid and the hydra- 
tion of milk sugar by an alkali are examples of such reactions. 
They are frequently employed for the purpose of determining 
the concentration of the catalyzing ion in a given solution. 
13. Enzymes.—Many animal and vegetable organisms secrete 
certain complex colloidal compounds, known as enzymes, which 
«Eric K. Rideal, Lecturer in Physical Chemistry in the University of 
Cambridge. 
> Hugh S. Taylor, Assistant Professor of Physical Chemistry in Princeton 
University.
-P-A-G-E-352
  324 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXI 
possess highly specific but very powerful catalytic powers. 
Thus the yeast plant secretes the enzyme, invertase, which is 
able to convert cane sugar into glucose and fructose, while 
another yeast enzyme known as xymase will convert glucose 
(but not the closely related compound, fructose) into alcohol and 
carbon dioxide. On the other hand, glucose will be converted 
into lactic acid by an enzyme produced by the lactic acid bacillus. 
Enzymes are responsible for many of the processes of physiology 
(as pepsin, lypase, and trypsin in digestion) and for the processes 
of decay of dead animal and vegetable matter. The velocity 
of reactions catalyzed by enzymes increases with the tempera- 
ture up to a point usually between 30° and 40° after which 
it decreases owing to the destruction of the enzyme by heat. 
Enzymes are employed in a number of industrial processes such 
as brewing and butter and cheese manufacture. 
14, Water as a Catalyst—The presence of water seems to be 
indispensable for the occurrence of many reactions. Thus HCl 
and NH; when brought together in a perfectly dry condition will 
not react with each other. The presence of the merest trace 
of water vapor, however, suffices to start the reaction. The 
mechanism of this action is not understood but it has been sug- 
gested‘ that a few water molecules by uniting with one of the 
reacting substances ‘opens up’ its molecular field of force 
in such a way as to permit the entrance of the molecules of the 
other substance. 
15. Autocatalysis——Some reactions are catalyzed by the 
presence of one or more of their own reaction products and are, 
therefore, said to be autocatalyzed. The reaction between oxalic 
acid and a permanganate in solution is catalyzed in this manner. 
The decomposition of AgoO into Ag and Oy at high temperatures 
is catalyzed by the metallic silver and the rate of the reaction 
increases with the amount of silver. The action in this instance, 
however, is probably a contact action, the reaction 20 = Oz 
being catalyzed at the surface of the finely divided silver. 
16. Radiant Energy.—Many reactions which proceed very 
slowly or inappreciably in the dark are greatly accelerated when 
illuminated by radiant energy of the proper wave length. The 
union of He and Cl, gases in the sunlight and the changes which 
take place upon a photographic plate are examples of photo-
-P-A-G-E-353
TE ee ee ee Te ee ee ee 
Suc. 17] CHEMICAL KINETICS 325 
chemical reactions. Not only is the reaction rate influenced 
by the light, but the nature of the reaction products and the 
yield obtained are also affected. The subject of photochemistry 
is being extensively investigated at the present time. Other 
forms of energy such as the silent electric discharge, X-rays, 
cathode rays, a rays, etc., also exert a powerful influence upon 
the course and rate of chemical reactions in many cases. These 
effects, while introduced at this point, are not usually classed as 
catalytic, however. 
Recent theories of chemical kinetics class all chemical reactions 
as photochemical in nature, that is, every reaction is assumed 
to be produced by the absorption of radiant energy of a certain 
characteristic frequency. The velocity of the reaction is de- 
termined by the intensity of the characteristic radiation and 
depends upon the temperature only in so far as the intensity of 
the radiation is determined by the temperature. The heat of 
the reaction is assumed to be proportional to the difference in 
the frequencies of the characteristic radiations of the direct and 
reverse reactions and is calculable therefrom, the proportionality 
constant being equal to the product of Planck’s h (X, 13) and 
Avogadro’s number. This new theory thus involves the Planck 
quantum hypothesis and is discussed in detail in the writings of 
Trautz,2 W. C. McC. Lewis,’ Pratolongo,’ Perrin, Baly* and 
others.°® 
The validity of the radiation theory has been seriously ques- 
tioned, however, by Langmuir,’ by Tolman? and by Lindemann.” 
HETEROGENEOUS SysTEMS 
17. Solid Substances.—When a solid substance reacts with a 
substance in solution the rate of the reaction is proportional to 
the surface of the solid exposed to the solution. When a solid 
dissolves in its own solution the rate at which it dissolves, «,

experiment last, if one wishes to determine’ the solubility with an accuracy 
of 0.01 per cent.? Assume constant surface and constant conditions of 
stirring. = kA(S — C) (14) 
18. Chemical Reactions on Surfaces. Contact Catalysis.—A 
quantitative theory of the kinetics of surface reactions has 
been developed by Langmuir’ as follows. Consider any gaseous 
reaction which takes place in contact with the surface of some 
catalyst. The available surface of the catalyst will contain a 
certain number of atoms of the catalyst and by virtue of their 
electric fields (i.e., their “‘chemical affinity” in the older termin- 
ology) they are able to bind a certain number of the gas molecules 
which strike them. ‘The ratio in which the adsorbing molecules 
(i.e., the surface molecules of the catalyst) and the adsorbed 
molecules unite in any given union of this kind will evidently be 
in accord with the Law of Combining Weights. The adsorbed 
layer will thus be only one molecule deep and at any given 
moment only a part of the surface will be covered by the 
adsorbed gas owing to the kinetic equilibrium which exists. 
(ef. VI, 4). Two cases are of special interest and will be con- 
sidered separately. 
First Case. Surface of Catalyst Covered to Only a Small Extent 
by Adsorbed Layer.—As an example consider a simple dissociation 
reaction such as, H, = 2H. The rate of condensation of He 
molecules on the surface of the catalyst will evidently be k.mg, 
where k, is a proportionality constant and m, is given by equation 
(2, VI). Similarly the rate of evaporation of the undissociated 
H. molecules will be k.a”. Here n represents the number of 
atoms of the catalyst required to hold one molecule of the 
adsorbed gas while the latter is in the adsorbed condition and
-P-A-G-E-355
  
Suc. 18] CHEMICAL KINETICS 327 
a is the fractional part of the total number of catalyst atoms 
which at any moment are holding adsorbed molecules of the gas. 
Since equilibrium prevails, we have, 
kom, = kea® (15) 
Now the product of a catalyzed reaction is produced in the 
adsorbed film by the reaction of m adjacent adsorbed molecules, 
m being, of course, unity for a dissociation reaction. For the 
velocity of the reaction we have therefore

For the dissociation of Hz in contact with a hot wire, m = 1 
and since experiments show that the rate of this reaction is pro- 
portional to the square root of the pressure of He, we conclude 
that n = 2, that is, that the adsorption compound between the 
metal and the hydrogen has the formula MH. For the reverse 
reaction, 2H = He, the above course of reasoning would give 
m = 2 and n = 1 and hence lead us to conclude that the rate 
of this reaction should be proportional to the square of the 
pressure of the atomic hydrogen which conclusion has been 
completely confirmed by experiment. The same course of 
reasoning has been successfully applied to the other reactions. 
Second Case. Surface of Catalyst Almost Completely Covered 
by Adsorbed Layer.—Let us consider a reaction between two gases 
taking place in an adsorbed layer. We will suppose further 
that the surface of the catalyst is almost entirely covered by an 
adsorbed layer of gas 1. Using the same nomenclature as above 
we have for the rate of condensation of the first gas, km,(1 — a)", 
while its rate of evaporation will be a constant, k., since the 
surface is almost entirely covered. Hence 
kang (1 — a)"= ke (18) 
The second gas can react only when it comes in contact with 
the uncovered surface of the catalyst and hence its rate of reaction 
must be 
dees a men k,(1 — a)" m’, (19)

Combining this with equation (18) and equation (2, VI) we 
have, dc’ p

that is the rate of the reaction is proportional to the pressure of , 
gas 2 and inversely proportional to the power of the pressure of 
gas 1. 
The reaction 
2802 + O2 = 280; 
when catalyzed by platinum has been found by Bodenstein and 
Fink to be proportional to the pressure of SO, and inversely 
proportional to the square root of the pressure of SO3. This 
result is in agreement with the above equation, if the SO; is gas 1 
and the SOs, gas 2; n’ being 1 and n, 2. This would indicate 
that the surface of the platinum is almost entirely covered with 
a layer of SO3, the adsorption compound having the formula 
PtSOs.

CHAPTER XXII 
CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
A. Homogcenrous Systems at Constant TEMPERATURE 
1. The Nature of Chemical Equilibrium.—sSuppose that we 
bring together in any homogeneous gas or liquid system two 
substances A and B which enter into chemical reaction with 
each other to form the substances M and N as expressed by the 
equation 
aA + 6B = mM + nN (1) 
As this reaction proceeds, the concentrations of A and B will be 
observed to decrease and those of M and N to increase, at first 
rapidly and then more slowly until finally a steady condition 
will be reached in which the concentrations of the molecular 
species A, B, M and N no longer change, that is, the reaction 
has apparently stopped. In the same way if we were to start 
with the two substances M and N at the same initial equivalent 
concentrations as were used for A and B in the first experiment, 
we would find that reaction (1) would proceed from right to left 
until eventually a steady condition of no concentration change 
would again be reached. The concentrations of the four molecu- 
lar species when this steady state is attained are found to be 
independent of the direction from which this condition is ap- 
proached. That is, whether we started with a moles of A and 
6 moles of B or with m moles of M and n moles of N, the con- 
centrations of all four species when the reaction had apparently 
ceased would have the same respective values regardless of the 
direction in which the reaction took place. When a steady 
condition of this character is reached in any chemical reaction, 
the molecular species involved are said to be in chemical equilib- 
rium with one another. This equilibrium is not a static one, 
however, but is instead a dynamic one. That is, the chemical 
reaction does not actually cease but rather it continues to take 
place in both directions but at the same rate in each direction.

The reacting substances are thus re-formed by the reverse re- 
action just as fast as they are used up by the direct reaction, the 
net concentration change being zero. 
The concentrations of the reacting molecular species when 
equilibrium is attained will be called their equilibrium concen- 
trations. In any chemical equilibrium in a perfect gas or a 
dilute solution at a given temperature, the equilibrium concen- 
trations, Cy, Cs, Cy and Cx, are always so related that they 
fulfill the following condition 
Cre 
Che   
= const. (2) 
where the value of the “equilibrium constant,” as it is called, is, 
for a given thermodynamic environment, characteristic of the 
reaction in question. This relation is Guldberg and Waage’s 
law of chemical mass action as applied to chemical equilibrium. 
In section 3 we shall recognize it as a special case of a more 
general law based upon the principles of thermodynamics. 
2. The Criterion for True Chemical Equilibrium.—The fact 
that in any instance a given chemical reaction has apparently 
come to a stop cannot be taken as proof that a true chemical 
equilibrium has been attained. In order to make certain the 
equilibrium should be approached from both directions. If the 
value of the equilibrium constant computed from the equilibrium 
concentrations is found to be independent of the direction from 
which the equilibrium is approached, then the equilibrium is a 
true chemical equilibrium. False equilibria are sometimes met 
with, due to various causes such as destruction or absence of an 
essential catalytic agent (X XI, 9), extreme slowness of some stage 
of the reaction, or slow diffusion of one or more of the substances 
involved. False equilibria occur most frequently in the case of 
reactions in heterogeneous systems.   
Problem 1.—In one experiment 0.100 mole each of Hz and CO: are 
heated together at 686° in a closed liter vessel until the reaction has appar- 
ently ceased. The vessel is then found to contain 0.0422 mole of HO. In 
a second experiment 0.110 mole of CO and 0.0902 mole of H;O are heated 
in the same way and when the reaction has apparently ceased 0.0574 mole 
of CO. is found to have been formed. Was true chemical equilibrium 
attained in these experiments?

3. The Thermodynamic Law of Chemical Equilibrium at 
Constant Temperature. (a) Gaseous Systems.—If any number 
of molecular species A,B, . . . ., M,N,. . ete., are in chemical 
equilibrium with one another in the gaseous state as expressed 
by the equation 
aA +0B+..2@mM+nN+..... (3) 
the following purely thermodynamic (XII, 8) relationship can 
be shown to connect the partial pressures, p, and molal volumes, 
v, of the molecular species concerned, at any given constant 
temperature 7’ (see Appendix, 16, for derivation) : 
Moydpy + Nxdpy +... —an,dp, — by,dpzp—...=0 (4) 
where dp for each substance represents the complete differential 
dp = (35) | dP + (2). dx, P being the total pressure on the sys- 
tem and x the mole fraction of any constituent of the system 
whether it be concerned in the chemical reaction or not. In 
other words, if the chemical equilibrium be displaced in one direc- 
tion or the other by changing either the pressure or the composi- 
tion of the gas or both, the corresponding changes in the partial 
pressures of the molecular species concerned in the equilibrium 
must occur in such a way as to fulfill the condition represented by 
equation (4), which for brevity may be written 
=*mvy dpy = 0 (5) 
where the + sign indicates that the terms for the substances on 
one side of the reaction must be taken with opposite signs from 
those for the substances on the other side of the reaction. 
In order to integrate this equation it is first necessary to know 
the equation of state for each molecular species involved. If 
all the substances obey the perfect gas law or in general if p 
represents the fugacity (XIV, 1), we have mvydpy = MRT dlog.p. 
= RTdlog.p% and similarly for each of the other substances 
involved in the reaction. Equation (5) therefore becomes 
RTdlo gee =0 (6) a Da ss 
which on integration gives 
Du Px- + op = const. = Kp (7) 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
332 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuarv. XXII 
This is the law of chemical mass action (for a gaseous system) 
expressed in terms of partial pressures or fugacities. If the sub- 
stances are all perfect gases, we may also write py=(CyRT)” 
1 and similarly for each of the other substances, where C (=) 
represents the equilibrium concentration in moles per liter 
(XXII, 1) in each instance. Equation (7) may therefore be 
written 
CE Cras au oN: > = K,(RT}* = K, 8 orgs = KRM) (8) 
where An=a+tb+. ...—m—-—n-... (9) 
and we thus obtain the mass action law (equation 2) in terms of 
volume concentrations. The relationship between the equilib- 
rium constants, K, and K., of the two modes of expression is 
shown in equation (8) from which one constant can evidently 
be calculated if the other is known. 
Problem 2.—Show that for perfect gases the mass action law may also be 
written in terms of the mole fractions of the substances concerned, thus 
Hotty i = K,P" = K, (if P is constant) (10) eae can’ Beat 
(b) Liquid Systems.—In the case of a chemical equilibrium 
in solution, equation (7), where p represents fugacity, must 
evidently hold for the vapor above the solution and if the 
thermodynamic environment in the solution is constant, the 
fugacity of each molecular species will be proportional to its 
mole fraction, z, in the solution. (See equation 1, XIV.) Equa- 
tion (7) may, therefore, be written 
mn 
eis a = const. = KA, (11) 
UX   
for the solution. This is the law governing a chemical equilib- 
rium in any solution in which the thermodynamic environment 
is constant. 
Problem 3.—Show that from the nature of the definitions (XI, 5) of x 
and C for any substance in a solution the following relationship exists

where An and K, are defined by equations (9) and (11) respectively and Co 
represents the total concentration (in moles per liter) of all molecular species 
in the solution which are not directly concerned in the reaction (solvent 
molecules, for example). 
Problem 4.—Under what mathematical condition and also under what 
other practical condition will equation (12) reduce to the form 
CG 
or -G In writing the mass action law in terms of concentrations it is 
frequently customary to employ the formula of the substance in- 
closed in brackets as a symbol representing its volume concentra- 
tion. Thus in this nomenclature equations (2) and (13) would 
be written 
    ROOnEts =. 1c. (13)

4, Determination of the Equilibrium Constant.—In order to 
determine by direct measurement the numerical value of the 
equilibrium constant for a given reaction at a given temperature, 
it is first necessary to establish equilibrium between the different 
substances taking part in the reaction and then to measure the 
concentration of each substance in this equilibrium mixture. In 
order to be certain that true equilibrium has been attained, it 
should, as explained above, be approached from both directions 
and in many cases a catalyst (X-XI, 9) must be used in order to 
hasten the attainment of equilibrium. The method employed 
for determining the concentration of any substance in an equilib- 
rium mixture must be one which does not change this concen- 
tration during the process of determining its value, for such a 
change would result in a displacement of the equilibrium. The 
customary methods of chemical analysis cannot, therefore, be 
employed in many cases and we are obliged to. modify these 
methods or to resort to physical methods for measuring the 
equilibrium concentrations of the molecular species concerned. 
As an example we will consider the problem of determining the 
equilibrium constant for the gaseous reaction.

Equilibrium in this reaction may be reached either by heating 
gaseous HI to the desired temperature or by heating a mixture =K. (14)

of Hz and I, gases to the same temperature. This equilibrium 
is attained very slowly at ordinary temperatures but at the 
temperature of 440° or above it is reached in a short time. If, 
therefore, we heat a known quantity of HI (or of He and I.) at 
440° in an equilibrium vessel until equilibrium is reached, 
we may determine the equilibrium concentrations by drawing 
out a sample of the mixture through a cooled capillary tube con- 
nected with the equilibrium vessel and then analyzing this sample 
at our leisure, for the mixture on being drawn into the capillary 
is cooled so quickly that the rate of reaction is reduced nearly 
to zero before any appreciable shifting of the equilibrium can 
occur and the composition of the cold sample will be the same as 
that of the equilibrium mixture at the higher temperature. In 
one experiment? of this kind Bodenstein* heated 20.55 moles of 
H. with 31.89 moles of Iz to 440° until equilibrium was at- 
tained. The equilibrium mixture was then rapidly cooled and on 
analysis (by absorbing the I, and HI in caustic potash and meas- 
uring the H2 remaining) was found to contain 2.06 moles of 
He, 13.4 moles of I; and 37.0 moles of HI in the volume, »v. 
Hence sd i

Instead of cooling such an equilibrium mixture and then ana- 
lyzing it, it is frequently possible to determine its composition 
at equilibrium by a suitable physical method. Thus in the 
present case HI and H: are both colorless gases while I, is strongly 
colored, and by comparing the depth of color of the equilibrium 
mixture with that of a series of vessels containing iodine vapor 
alone, at known concentrations, the composition of the equilib- 
rium mixture can be determined. 
Problem 5.—A 1-liter glass tube containing 0.1 mole of HI gas is heated 
to 440° until equilibrium is established. By comparing the depth of 
the violet color observed on looking through the tube with the color of 
standard tubes containing pure iodine vapor, the color of the equilibrium 
mixture is found to correspond to an I, concentration of 0.0112 mole per

rium. (Cf. XI, problem 1.) 
Problem 6.—A liter vessel containing 0.14 mole of Hz and 20.6 grams of 
iodine is heated to 440°. How much HI will be formed? What will be the 
partial pressure of each substance when equilibrium is reached? What will 
be the total pressure of the mixture? 
Problem’ 7.—z grams of HI are heated in a 2-liter vessel at 440° until 
equilibrium is reached, the total pressure being 0.5 atmosphere. Calcu- 
late x. 
When a gas containing more than one atom in its molecule is 
heated to a sufficiently high temperature it breaks up or dissoci- 
ates partially into simpler molecules (XX, 4) and the fractional 
extent to which such dissociation occurs at any given temperature 
and pressure is called the degree of dissociation, a, of the gas. 
This degree of dissociation and hence also the equilibrium con- 
stant of the reaction can usually be calculated by determining 
the density of the partially dissociated gas in equilibrium with 
its dissociation products at the temperature in question and 
comparing this observed density, Doys,, with the density, Deatc, 
which the gas would have at the same temperature, if it did not 
dissociate. This latter density can of course be calculated from 
the molecular weight of the undissociated gas and the tempera- 
ture and pressure. 
Problem 8.—When one molecule of a gas dissociates it produces n mole- 
cules of dissociation products. If one mole of the gas is heated to such 
a temperature that the degree of dissociation is a, show that the total num- 
ber of moles of all molecular species present in the dissociation mixture is 
1+ (n —1)a. Show also that @ can be calculated from the equation

At 49.7° and 26.8 mm. the observed density of the gas referred to air is 
1.663. Calculate its degree of dissociation. 
Problem 10.—Show that for any dissociation of the type, AB = A + B, 
the equilibrium constant, K., for the dissociation reaction is expressed by 
the relation

where C is the volume concentration of the dissociating substance calculated 
on the assumption that it does not dissociate, that is, C = aE + v, where 
m is the number of grams of the substance in the volume v. 
Problem 11.—From the data in the preceding problems calculate the 
value of K, for the dissociation of N2O, at 49.7° and 26.8 mm. Calculate 
also K, and K, for one atmosphere pressure. From your results calculate 
afor P = 1, for P = 0.5, and for P = 0.1 atmosphere respectively. What 
would be the partial pressure of the NO» molecules for P = 0.6 atmosphere. 
Calculate the actual density (referred to air) of the gas, for P = 93.75 mm.

Problem 12.—Phosphorous pentachloride dissociates in the gaseous 
state according to the equation

PCI; after equilibrium is reached in each of the following experiments: (a) 
10 grams of Cl: are mixed with the PCl;, (1) at constant volume and (2) at 
constant pressure; (b) the same experiments with 1 gram of Ar; (c) the 
same experiments with 1 gram of PCl;; (d) the total pressure is reduced to 
0.5 atmosphere; (e) the volume is increased to 50 liters by reduction of 
pressure. 
Problem 13.—At 290° and 330° respectively the sublimation pressures 
(VI, 1) of NH,Cl crystals are 185.3 and 610.6 mm. respectively. The meas- 
ured values for the density of the saturated vapor at the same two tempera- 
tures are 0.00017 and 0.00053 gram per cubic centimeter respectively. 
Calculate the degree of dissociation and the equilibrium constant for each 
temperature. 
Problem 14.—Preuner and Brockmdller? found that 0.0755 gram of sele- 
nium vapor occupying a volume of 114.2 c.c. at 700° exerts a pressure of 
185mm. Theselenium isin a state of dissociation equilibrium in accordance 
with the reaction Ses@23Se2, Calculate a, K, and K,. What pressure 
would be exerted by 0.0369 gram of selenium vapor in a volume of 148 c.c. 
at 700°? [Value observed = 86.5 mm.] 
5. Chemical Equilibrium in Solutions of Constant Thermo- 
dynamic Environment.—All chemical equilibria in solutions 
where the thermodynamic environment remains constant must 
obey the law of mass action as expressed by equations (11) and 
(43), since for such solutions this law is a purely thermodynamic 
deduction. The application of the mass action law to such 
sofutions is so similar to the corresponding applications of
-P-A-G-E-365
Suc. 6] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 337 
equation (8) to gaseous equilibria that no special discussion will 
be required. 
6. Ionization Equilibria in Solution. (a) General. We have 
already seen (XVII, 6) that in solutions containing ions the 
thermodynamic environment is a function of the ion concentra- 
tion and cannot, therefore, be treated as a constant, if the ion 
concentration changes. For an equilibrium involving ions we 
are thus not in a position to connect equation (7) with the mole 
fractions (in the solution) of the molecular species involved in 
the equilibrium, except by the use of purely empirical relation- 
ships (such as equation (16, XVII)) connecting fugacity with 
electrolyte concentration. While a dilution law can be derived 
in this way, it will not always be the most convenient one and in 
the following pages, therefore, the laws governing ionization 
equilibria will be presented mainly as purely empirical relations. 
(b) The General Dilution Law for Uni-univalent Electro- 
lytes.—The ionization of a uni-univalent electrolyte, CA, is 
expressed by the equation (XV, 3) 
CA=Ct + A- 
and the equilibrium expression for dilute solutions is 
ce ] (see equation 13) 
If the solution contains no other electrolytes, then from the defi- 
nition of a it follows (see problem 10) that 
[C*AT] a 
[CA] ~ I-a 
where C is the total concentration of the electrolyte in moles per 
liter. 
In general the sum of the concentrations of all the species of 
positive ions (or of negative ions) in any solution is called the 
total-ion concentration of that solution. In the case now under 
consideration (a solution of a uni-univalent electrolyte) there is 
evidently only one species of positive ion, C-ion, present in sig- 
nificant amount in the solution and hence the total-ion concen- 
tration of our solution is aC. 
(c) Strong Electrolytes——When we come to classify the uni- 
univalent electrolytes with reference to their ionization behavior 
we find that for practical purposes they may be roughly divided 
into two groups. In the first group fall the strong electrolytes 
22     
(19)
-P-A-G-E-366
338 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXII 
(XV, 4 and XVII, 2c). For these electrolytes the total-ion con- 
centration is always a controlling factor, the tendency to dissoci- 
ate as measured by the magnitude of the equilibrium expression, 
being greater the greater the ion concentration of the solution, 
for ion-concentrations above 0.0001n. 
The fact that the ionization equilibrium of strong electrolytes, 
even in very dilute solutions, is so greatly at variance with the

law of mass action is due chiefly to the behavior of the undissoci- 
ated molecules of these electrolytes. The deduction of that law 
assumes that the molal fugacity of every molecular species con- 
cerned in the equilibrium is constant under all conditions. 
While this condition is approximately fulfilled by the ions at low 
concentrations, the undissociated molecules deviate from it very 
widely as we have already seen (XVII, 6c). The effect of this 
deviation (the causes of which we have already discussed) upon

Sec. 6] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 339 
ionization equilibrium will be more clearly appreciated by solving 
the following problem. 
Problem 15.—Calculate the value of the equilibrium expression for the 
ionization of KCl for the concentrations given, in Table XXIV, using the 
values of a given in Table XX VII. 
It will be observed that below 0.0001n the equilibrium ex- 
pression is constant or in other words the conductance data conform 
to the mass action law at these very low concentrations. This be- 
havior of KCl is typical of uni-univalent strong electrolytes and 
the value of the equilibrium expression in this region 7s the same 
for all such electrolytes. A graph illustrating the variation of the 
equilibrium expression for KCl with the concentration, at small 
concentrations, is shown in Fig. 51. 
(d) Weak Electrolytes.—In the second group fall the weak 
electrolytes. For these electrolytes the influence of the ion 
concentration upon the equilibrium is always small and becomes 
smaller the more dilute the solution. For most purposes, there- 
fore, the law governing the ionization of a weak electrolyte in 
its own pure solution may with sufficient accuracy be written 
aC 
l-a@   
= const. = K, (22) 
an equation which we have already met under the name of 
Ostwald’s dilution law (XVII, Ic). 
In other words the ionization of weak electrolytes in dilute 
solution takes place in accordance with the law of mass action. 
(See equation 19.) The weaker the electrolyte, that is, the 
smaller the numerical value of its ionization constant, K., the 
more closely is the mass action law obeyed. Even if the ion con- 
centration of the solution be greatly increased by adding a strong 
electrolyte to it, the resulting change in the thermodynamic 
environment will cause (see XVII, 6) only comparatively small 
changes in the fugacities of the ions and undissociated molecules 
of the weak electrolyte, and hence the ionization constant of such 
an electrolyte may for most purposes be assumed to have approxi- 
mately the same value in all dilute solutions in a given solvent 
and at a given temperature, regardless of what other substances 
may be present, at small concentration, in the solution. In con-
-P-A-G-E-368

centrated solutions and for solutions containing large additions 
of other substances, particularly electrolytes, this statement no 
longer holds true, however. The behavior of a typical weak 
electrolyte is illustrated in the following problem and table.

Problem 17.—In Table XXXIII are given the values of the conductances 
of a series of aqueous solutions of acetic acid at 25°. Under V is given the 
“dilution” of the solution, that is, the volume (in liters) containing one 
equivalent of the acetic acid. Calculate in each instance the molal con- 
centration, C, of the solution and the degree of dissociation, a, and tabulate 
your results in the corresponding columns. The value of Ao for acetic acid at 
25° can be obtained from the data in Table XXIII. For the higher con- 
centrations where the viscosity of the solution is appreciably different from 
that of water, its influence may be approximately taken account of by 
using equation (12, XVII) to calculate a. For this purpose the relative 
viscosity, n/no, of each solution is given in the table. Finally, as explained in 
section (3b) and problem 4, the equilibrium constant for a reaction in solution 
should in general be expressed in mole fractions instead of yolume concen-

trations. That is, the quantity K. would not necessarily be constant except 
in the more dilute solutions. In general the quantity K, should be employed. 
The value of K, for any solution is most conveniently calculated from the 
corresponding value of K, with the aid of equation (12). For this calcula- 
tion the density of the solution will be required and density data are there- 
fore included in Table XXXIII. Note that the calculation of K, in this way. 
involves the assumption that the molecular weight of water in the liquid 
state is 18. After calculating the values of K, and K, for all of the solutions, 
construct graphs with values of C as ordinates and corresponding values of 
K. and K, respectively as abscisse. 
Up to how high a concentration can the viscosity influence in the case of 
acetic acid be neglected, if an accuracy of 1 per cent. is desired in the value 
of «? Up to what concentration can (a) volume concentrations and (b) 
mole fractions be safely employed in formulating the equilibrium expression, 
without producing an appreciable deviation from constancy? The answers 
to these questions are largely governed by the accuracy of the experimental 
data and the student may form an estimate of this from his construction of 
the above graphs. 
A satisfactory interpretation of the decrease in the value of 
K, for acetic acid above 0.75n is rendered very difficult by the 
uncertainty which exists with regard to the validity, at the higher 
concentrations, of several of the factors and assumptions in- 
volved in the calculation. An analysis of the nature and effects 
of these factors is valuable as an example of the difficulties 
(already briefly discussed, XIV, 15d) of drawing any reliable con- 
clusions concerning the individual behaviors and effects of several 
variables by the study of a derived relationship involving them 
all. A consideration of these factors will also serve to exemplify 
some of the difficulties which are encountered when we attempt 
to extend our solution laws into concentrated aqueous solutions of 
electrolytes. 
The factors and assumptions involved in attempting to deter- 
mine and analyse the behavior of acetic acid with respect to the 
mass action law in the more concentrated solutions are as follows: 
(1) Aconstant value for K, is to be expected only if the thermo- 
dynamic environment remains constant. Owing to the slight 
degree of dissociation of the acetic acid the influence of the ions 
upon the thermodynamic environment could scarcely be appreci- 
able within the range covered by Table XX XIII, however, and 
their influence may therefore be neglected in comparison with 
the effects of the other factors. The direction of their influence
-P-A-G-E-370
342 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXII 
would be probably to produce an increase in the value of K, with 
increasing ion concentration. 
(2) The thermodynamic environment changes with increasing 
concentration of the acetic acid molecules. The direction and 
magnitude of this effect is not known with certainty but a study® 
of the influence of additions of acetone to dilute solutions of 
acetic acid has shown that this non-electrolyte at 0.625n appar- 
ently produces an appreciable change in the thermodynamic 
environment of the solution, the ionization of the acetic acid being 
decreased by the presence of the acetone molecules.’ If the 
unionized molecules of acetic acid have a similar influence this 
would cause a decrease in K, with increasing concentration. 
(3) In the above calculations the conductances of the ions are 
assumed to be inversely proportional to the viscosity of the 
solution. The viscosity correction at 0.25n amounts to nearly 
6 per cent. in the value of the equilibrium constant and the effect 
of applying the correction is to increase the computed value of 
this constant. No significant error is produced in applying this 
correction since investigation has shown that both ions obey 
Stokes’ Law. (See XVII, 2c.) 
(4) In computing the mole fractions of the solute molecules, 
the molecular weight of the water is taken as 18. This is of 
course not correct (III, 5), but the effect of this assumption would 
not influence the constancy of the computed values of K, if 
the average molecular weight of the water itself remained con- 
stant. It does not do so, however, but probably decreases as 
the concentration of the acetic acid increases, owing to the shift- 
ing of the association equilibrium which takes place in accordance 
with Le Chatelier’s Theorem (Sec. 11 below). The effect of 
such a decrease is to cause the computed values of K, to increase 
slowly with increasing concentration of the acetic acid. The 
magnitude of this effect cannot at present be determined. 
(5) The ionization of the acetic acid does not take place as 
represented by the simple equation 
HAc=Ht-+Ac— 
but involves the solvent also, as explained previously (XV, 8). 
A more nearly correct method of writing the ionization reaction 
would be 
HAc+(H20) «= [H(H20),]++[Ac(H:20) ]-
-P-A-G-E-371
  Suc. 6] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 343 
and the mass law expression could then be written 
ae Dayo const. (23) Uuac 
where x represents mole fraction and p fugacity or vapor pres- 
sure. In sufficiently dilute solutions the vapor pressure of the 
water may be assumed to be practically constant, but it decreases 
with increasing concentration of the solute. The effect of neg- 
lecting to take account of the change in the vapor pressure of the 
water with increasing concentration is to cause the calculated 
values of the equilibrium constant for the higher concentrations 
to come out too small. This is the behavior shown by the values 
of K, computed in Table XX XIII. : 
The value of a in equation (23) is not known, and even if it 
were, the uncertainties in the other factors involved in the 
problem would make it impossible to make any trustworthy 
calculation for the concentrated solutions. A much better degree 
of constancy in the calculated value of K, can of course be ob- 
tained by treating a as an empirical constant to be evaluated 
from the experimental data, but no particular significance is to 
be attached to the value of a thus obtained or to the better con- 
stancy which would result, since a two-constant equation can 
always be made to fit a given set of values more accurately than 
one containing only a single arbitrary constant. 
(6) The amount of water combined with the molecules and ions 
of the solute should be subtracted from the total quantity of 
water present in the solution before computing the values of the 
mole fractions. (Cf. equation 23, XIV.) Neglecting to do this 
would not have any appreciable effect at the lower concentra- 
tions, but with increasing concentration of the solute it would 
cause the computed values of K, to be too small. The concen- 
tration at which this effect would begin to be appreciable in the 
case of acetic acid is not at present known but it could be approxi- 
mately determined by suitable experiments. 
(7) In the above calculations the acetic acid is assumed to be 
entirely non-associated in the solution. With increasing con- 
centration we know, however, that it becomes more and more 
associated because pure acetic acid is a highly associated liquid. 
To what extent the influence of this factor is appreciable in the 
concentration range covered by Table XXXIII is difficult to 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  344 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXII 
determine but it is probably negligible. The effect of association 
would be to cause the computed values of K, to be too large. 
Owing to the conflicting effects of the factors just discussed it 
is evidently impossible to determine the concentration range 
within which the ionization equilibrium of acetic acid actually 
obeys the mass action law with a given degree of accuracy; nor 
would an answer to this question be, per se, of very much value, 
since it would not give us the desired information concerning the 
questions involved in the separate factors discussed above. The 
answers to such questions are not to be obtained from the con- 
stancy or lack of constancy displayed by the computed values 
of an equilibrium constant, but must be sought for by means 
of more direct evidence, involving as few variables as possible. 
For the purpose of calculating values of A it is important to note 
the empirical fact that K.is substantially constant up toC = 0.5n, 
but no theoretical significance is to be attached to this fact or to 
the fact that K, is constant over a trifle wider range than K.. 
A one-constant empirical equation which holds over a still wider 
concentration range has been formulated‘ by Kendall.¢ 
(e) Ionization in Mixtures of Electrolytes.—In mixtures con- 
taining weak electrolytes it will, as just stated, be sufficiently 
exact for most purposes to assume that all such electrolytes obey 
the law of mass action. If the mixture contains only one strong 
electrolyte, the degree of dissociation of this electrolyte may be 
assumed to be practically uninfluenced by the presence of any 
weak electrolytes, but if more than one strong electrolyte be 
present, the ionization equilibrium of each strong electrolyte 
will be influenced by the presence of the ions of the other strong 
electrolytes and the general problem of calculating the degree of 
dissociation of the strong electrolytes in such a mixture is a com- 
plex one. It is usually solved by estimating the total ion concen- 
tration, C;, of the mixture by a series of approximations and then 
assuming that the expression

-P-A-G-E-373
  Sxc. 6] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 345 
or some other empirical relationship holds for each electrolyte in 
the mixture, with the same values for the empirical constants as 
are obtained from the ionization of that same electrolyte in its 
own pure solutions at the same temperature. 
This assumption, namely, that the equilibrium expression for 
a strong electrolyte in a mixture is the same function of the total- 
ion concentration as it is in a pure solution of that electrolyte, 
was first made by Arrhenius and is usually known as the isohy- 
dric principle. The chief evidence in favor of the validity of this 
principle rests upon the fact that the measured specific con- 
ductance of a mixture of two electrolytes agrees fairly well 
with the specific conductance calculated from this principle. 
This agreement is likewise almost if not quite as good, if the 
isohydric principle be formulated in the following approximately 
identical and more convenient form: The equilibrium expression 
for a strong electrolyte in a mixture in which the total concentration 
of all strong electrolytes is C equivalents per liter is the same as it is 
in a pure solution of that electrolyte at the same equivalent concentra- 
tion. The approximate rule that all uni-univalent strong 
electrolytes are ionized to the same extent at the same concentra- 
tion has already been stated (XVII, 2c and 3). In so far as this 
rule is valid, it is evident that, if a solution contains several uni- 
univalent strong electrolytes, the equilibrium expressions for all 
of these electrolytes in that solution must be equal to each other. 
Problem. 18.—On the basis of the isohydric principle demonstrate the 
truth of the following rule: If two uni-univalent strong electrolytes having 
one ion in common (e.g., KCl and NaCl) are in solution together, the degree of 
dissociation of each electrolyte in the solution is equal to the value which that 
electrolyte has in its own pure solution at such a concentration, C, that aC in 
that solution is equal to C; in the mixture. 
The rule given in problem 18 may also be formulated in the 
following approximately identical and more convenient form: 
If two uni-univalent strong electrolytes having one ion in common 
(e.g., KCl and NaCl) are in solution together, the degree of dissocia- 
tion of each electrolyte in the solution is equal to the value which that 
electrolyte has in its own pure solution at a concentration equal to 
the sum of the concentrations of the two electrolytes in the mixture. 
Kraus has suggested? another principle for calculating degrees 
of dissociation in mixtures. This principle is based upon the
-P-A-G-E-374
346 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY ([Cuav. XXIT 
assumption that the ionization of a strong electrolyte is deter- 
mined by the product of the concentrations of its own ions in the 
solution instead of by the total-ion concentration of the solution. 
On this basis the degree of dissociation of a strong electrolyte in 
any mixture, where its ion-product is I, is the same as its degree of 
dissociation in its own pure solution at such a concentration that 
its ion-product is also J. The conductance data for mixtures 
seem to agree somewhat better with the assumption made by 
Kraus, but the difference in the results obtained by the two 
methods of calculation is not very large in the cases where they 
have been compared. The question as to which of these two 
methods of calculating degrees of dissociation in mixtures is more 
nearly correct must be left for future investigation. The whole 
question is, however, in a very unsatisfactory condition. 
(f) Ionization Equilibrium in Non-aqueous Solutions.—When 
electrolytes are dissolved in solvents other than water, we obtain 
in many cases, solutions which are good conductors of electricity, 
and although these solutions have not been so extensively in- 
vestigated as have aqueous solutions, their general characteristics 
are fairly well known. The phenomena analogous to hydration 
(solvation), hydrolysis (solvolysis), etc., are observed in 
these other solvents and there is a close parallelism between 
the dissociating powers of various solvents and their dielectric 
constants. The following approximate quantitative relation 
between the dielectric constant of a solvent and the ionization 
constant of an electrolyte in that solvent has been discovered by 
Walden.!? 
If the values of the equilibrium expression K, for a typically 
“strong” uni-univalent electrolyte be computed for a series of 
different solvents, using in the case of each solvent such a concen- 
tration C,, that the degree of dissociation of the electrolyte has 
the same value in all of the solutions, then Walden’s rule is 
expressed by the following equation 
K. = const. X Ka? 
where Kz, is the dielectric constant of the solvent. Thus if a 
be taken as 0.86 the constant in the above equation has at room 
temperature the value 3-10-°.

PROBLEMS 
Note.—In all problems dealing with ionization equilibria in solution at 
18° or 25°, necessary Ao values are to be computed from Table XXIII and 
values of @ for all uni-univalent strong electrolytes (except TICl) may be 
determined directly from Table XX VII. Other conductance data required, 
if not to be found in this book, may be taken from the Landolt-Bérnstein 
tables or from any other reliable source. A critical summary of con- 
ductance data for aqueous solutions of strong electrolytes has been pre- 
pared by A, A. Noyes and K. G. Falk [Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc., 34, 461 to 
472 (1912)] and a very complete compilation of similar data for many 
weak electrolytes can be found in Scudder’s Conductivity and Ionization 
Constants of Organic Compounds,

acid at 18°, what will be the acetate-ion concentration in the resulting 
solution? 
Problem 20.—How much sodium acetate must be added to 1 liter of 
a 0.2 molal acetic acid solution at 18° in order to decrease the hydrogen-ion 
concentration 100-fold? 
Problem 21.—On the basis of the isohydric principle in its simpler form, 
calculate the concentration of each species of ion in the following mixtures 
at 18°: 1 liter of a solution contains (a) 0.1 mole each of KCl and NaCl; 
(b) 0.1 mole each of NaNO; and NaCl; (c) 0.005 mole of AgNO; and 0.1 
mole of KNO;; (d) 0.1 mole each of KNO; and NaCl; (e) 0.005 mole of TIC1

ion in the resulting solution?

B. HeTeroGEennous Systems at Constant TEMPERATURE 
7. The General Equilibrium Law.—Whenever any molecular 
species which takes part in a chemical equilibrium in a system at 
a constant temperature and under a constant external pressure 
is represented in that system by a pure crystalline phase, then 
the vapor pressure or fugacity of that molecular species cannot be 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  348 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXII 
changed by any displacement of the chemical equilibrium, for the 
pressure of the vapor of any substance in equilibrium with its 
pure crystals can have only one value at a given temperature and 
pressure. (Cf. VI, 1.) In other words, if the substance A is 
involved in any chemical equilibrium in a gas or solution, then as 
long as the gas or solution is kept in contact with and in equilib- 
rium with crystals of A, the value of the coefficient (es) : yPy 
is equal to zero. (Cf. XXII, 8a.) Owing to the very small 
value of the ratio, a for crystals at moderate pressures, it 0 
follows from equation (7, XII) that the coefficient (Bee) 
must also be extremely small under these conditions. Hence the 
quantity, dp,,= (2) dz + (Se) dP, which appears in the 
general law governing chemical equilibrium (equation 4) is either 
zero or is negligibly small, if the substance A is present in the 
system as a pure crystalline phase. We thus reach the conclusion 
that for a chemical equilibrium in a heterogeneous system, not 
only the general thermodynamic law governing the equilibrium 
but also all the special integrated forms of it (such as equations 
7,8, 10, 11, and 18) are identical with the corresponding equations 
for homogeneous systems, but with the omission of all terms refer- 
ring to substances present in the system as pure crystalline phases. 
It is clear that this same statement would also hold true for any 
substances which were present as pure liquids or whose fugacities 
were kept constant by any means whatsoever. 
8. Crystals in Equilibrium with Gases.——From the general 
conclusion deduced in the preceding section it is evident that for 
the equilibrium represented by the equation (Cf. XIX, 1)

in which crystalline ammonium chloride is in equilibrium with 
its gaseous dissociation products, the equilibrium law would be

corresponding to the general equations (7) and (8).

tothe presence in the apparatus of liquid water at a definite 
temperature which can be controlled by means of a constant tem- 
perature bath into which the whole apparatus is plunged. 
Problem 29.—In one experiment with the apparatus shown in Fig. 52, 
the constant temperature bath surrounding the whole apparatus was main- 
tained at 38° and the reaction tube at 900°. When equilibrium was 
reached the manometer registered 121 mm. The vapor pressure of water at 
38° is 49.7 mm. Calculate the equilibrium constant for reaction (29) at 
900°. If the constant temperature bath had been regulated at 20° instead 
of 38° in the above experiment what would the manometer have read after 
the attainment of equilibrium? (See IV, 1, Table IX.) 
(The mean value obtained experimentally under these conditions was 
43.7 mm.) 
9. Crystals in Equilibrium with Solutions.—On the basis of the 
reasoning given in section 7 above, the student should have no 
difficulty in formulating the equilibrium expression for any het- 
erogeneous chemical equilibrium in a solution of constant thermo- 
dynamic environment. 
Problem 30.—When phenanthrene picrate is dissolved in alcohol it par- 
tially dissociates into free phenanthrene and free picric acid. Assuming that 
the thermodynamic environment within the solution remains constant, for- 
mulate the equilibrium law for the above reaction when the solution is kept 
saturated (1) with picric acid; (2) with phenanthrene; (3) with the solid salt; 
(4) with both the solid salt and the acid. 
Aqueous solutions saturated with crystalline electrolytes form 
an important group of heterogeneous equilibria in solutions 
whose thermodynamic environment is a function of the ion con- 
centration. Take for example the equilibrium represented by 
the equation 
CA Ce Aq 
where a solution is saturated with the solid uni-univalent elec- 
trolyte, CA. As explained in section 7 above, the general 
thermodynamic law for this equilibrium (equation 7) becomes 
Pot X Pa- = const. (35) 
where p represents the fugacity of the ion species indicated. 
In order to obtain a relation involving the concentrations of 
the two ion species in the solution, it is only necessary to know 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
Szc. 9] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 351 
the relation between fugacity and concentration for each. ion- 
species. We have already seen (Fig. 41) that the fugacity of 
an ion-species, while approximately proportional to its con- 
centration, increases rather more slowly than the latter in 
dilute solutions. This may be conveniently expressed by the 
relation | 
pi = kC; — £:(Ci) (36) 
where f; (C;) is small in comparison with kC;. If we combine an 
equation of this form for each ion species (C+ and A7) with 
equation (35) above, we have 
[C+] [A] = const. + £(C.) (37) 
in which f(C;) is a positive quantity small in comparison with the 
const. term. For dilute solutions C; is so nearly identical with 
Cz, the concentration of the electrolyte, that either may be used 
in an empirical equation such as (36) ‘or (37). 
Problem 31.—Assuming that the fugacity of each ion species can be 
expressed as a function of the total electrolyte concentration by means of 
an equation of the form (16, XVII), show that equation (37) will have the 
form; 
log CiCz = (ki + ke) Ch (38) 
where C;, is the total concentration of electrolyte which furnishes the ion 
Ct and C; is the total concentration of electrolyte which furnishes the 
ion A~, Cz being the total concentration of all electrolytes in the saturated 
solution. What relation does the exponent fA in equation (38) bear to the 
values of this exponent for the separate ions?   If the ions C+ and A~ both come from the same electrolyte, 
that is, if the solution in which the slightly soluble salt CA is 
dissolved, contains no other electrolyte having an ion in common, 
then C; = C2 and equation (38) becomes 
2 
log = (hi +) (C2 80) (39) 
where So is the solubility of CA in pure water and S is its sol- 
ubility in a solution in which the total electrolyte concentration 
at saturation is Cz. For example, if a solution containing 
initially N, equivalents of a salt C’A’ be saturated with CA then 
the value of Cz in equation (39) would be S + Nz.

temperatures. (42) 
The Solubility-Product Law.—For sufficiently dilute solutions 
the term f(C;) in equation (37) may be neglected in comparison 
with the constant and we may write it in the following approxi- 
mate form: (Cf. eq. 42)

where So is the solubility of the salt in pure water and ap its 
degree of dissociation in this saturated solution. In words this 
equation states that: In sufficiently dilute solutions saturated 
with a slightly soluble wni-univalent salt the product of the concen= 
trations of the ion species of that salt is constant. This state- 
ment is usually known as the solubility-product law. It is 
more nearly true the less soluble the salt and the more dilute the 
solution. For most purposes it holds sufficiently well for all 
cases where the solubility of the salt and the ion concentration 
of the solution are both not more than a few hundredths of an 
equivalent per liter. 
An example illustrating the accuracy with which the principle 
holds for thallous chloride’ at 25° is shown in Fig. 53. The solubil- 
ity of this salt in pure water at 25° is 0.01629 equivalents per 
liter. Although the solubility product very evidently increases 
as the total-ion concentration increases, the change is not very 
rapid and for ion concentrations not greater than 0.04 (i.e., C? = 
0.2) the solubility product for thallous chloride may evidently 
be taken as constant within 10 per cent. For less soluble salts 
the magnitude of the solubility product and its rate of change 
with the ion concentration are both much smaller. 
The application of the solubility product law to salts of higher 
valence types (XV, 30) or to salts of any valence type when the 
solution contains a salt of a higher valence type is complicated 
by the presence of intermediate ions (XVII, 3) whose concentra- 
tions and equilibrium relations are not known. Thus, for 
example, the solubility product law for a solution saturated with 
PbCl, would read 
[Pb+*] [CI-}? = const. (44) 
and if either the chloride-ion concentration or the lead-ion ecn- 
centration of the solution were increased by the addition of a salt 
with the common ion, we should expect the solubility of the 
PbCl, to be diminished. This is what actually happens when a 
chloride, such as KCl, is added to a saturated solution of PbCle. 
When, however, a salt (Pb(NO;)e, for example) having the 
common bivalent ion is added, the solubility of the PbCl. may 
actually be increased. ‘The addition of the Pb(NO;)2 doubtless 
increases the lead-ion concentration of the solution somewhat, 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
  Suc. 9] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 355 
but at the same time it decreases the chloride-ion concentration 
owing to the occurrence of the reaction 
Pbt+. -- Clr = PbCi+ 
resulting in the formation of the intermediate ion, PbCl*+. This 
decrease in the chloride-ion concentration may more than com- 
pensate for the increase in the lead-ion concentration and can 
thus produce an actual increase in the solubility instead of a 
decrease. A general discussion of solubility relations when salts 
of higher valence types are involved can be found in papers® by 
A. A. Noyes, Bray and Harkins, 
Problem 34.—When conductivity water having a specific conductance of 
0.70 X 10-* reciprocal ohms at 18° is saturated with silver iodate at this 
temperature, the specific conductance of the saturated solution is found to 
be 12.6 X 10-8 reciprocal ohms. Calculate the solubility product (aoSo)? 
for AglO; at 18° and also the solubility So. 
Problem 34 shows that with the aid of conductance measure- 
ments it is possible to determine the solubility product (aoSo)? 
without knowing either the solubility (So) itself or the degree of 
ionization (ao) in the saturated solution. 
In the following problems make two calculations, one based 
upon the solubility-product law and the other upon the em- 
pirical equations 39 and 40, or 42. 
Problem 35.—From the results of the preceding problems calculate the 
solubility, S, of AgIOs (a) in a 0.01 molal solution of AgNO; and (0) in a 
0.02 molal solution of KIO; at 18°. 
Problem 36.—From the results of the preceding problems calculate the 
amount of AgIO; which will dissolve in a 0.02 formal solution of NH; at 18°, 
assuming that the complex ion, Ag(NHs)2*, forms quantitatively. (Cf. 
XV, problem 4 and XVIII, problem 13.) 
Problem 37.—The solubility of silver chloride in water at 25° is 2 mg. per 
liter. If a precipitate of AgCl is washed with 2 liters of wash water at 25°, 
how much AgNO; should the wash water contain in order to prevent the 
dissolving of more than 0.05 mg. of AgCl during the operation of washing? 
Assume equilibrium to be established during the washing. 
Problem 38.—The solubility of thallous chloride is 0.0163 and that of 
thallous sulphocyanate 0.0149 mole per liter. How many grams of thal- 
lium can be obtained from 1 liter of a solution which is saturated with 
both salts at the same time? 
Problem 39.—State and interpret in the light of the facts presented in 
this chapter the effect on the solubility of cuprous iodide (CuI) produced by 
the presence of the following substances in dilute aqueous solution: (1)

drochloric acid, (10) acetic acid. State also, as far as possible, the relative 
magnitudes of the effects of the above substances. (See equation 74, 
XXIII.) 
Problem 40.—What would be the direction and relative magnitude 
(whether large or small) of the effects on the solubility of silver benzoate 
(So = 0.014 mole per liter) produced by adding separately to 1 liter of a 
saturated solution 0.05 mole of each of the following substances? Explain 
what occurs in each case. AgClO;, CsHsCOOLi, LiNO;, NHs, LiCN, 
HNO;, HCl. Benzoic acid is a weak acid. 
C. TEMPERATURE AND CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
10. The General Thermodynamic Law.—lIf A is the increase 
in free energy (X, 9 and 11) which is associated with the occur- 
rence of a chemical reaction at a constant temperature 7’, then 
it follows from the Second Law of thermodynamics, as formulated 
in equation (10, X), that this free energy changes with the tem- 
perature at a rate which is expressed by the equation

and similarly for the other substances. Combining this relation 
with equation (45) above gives (see equations 4 and 5) 
Zee) _ Hp

where Hp, the heat-of-the-reaction (XIX, 5), is the heat evolved 
when the reaction as written takes place, at constant pressure, 
from right to left, that is, so as to produce the substances A and B. 
If the substances involved in the equilibrium are all perfect 
gases, then as explained in section 3a above,     
Umrxpu = RTOlog.*-"*~ = RTD log.Ky (48) ie a Pa--  
-P-A-G-E-385
  ‘Sxc. 10] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 357 
and equation (47) may be written 
dlog-Ky _ Hp 
Taq eR T? 
an equation which expresses the dependence of the equilibrium 
constant, Kp, upon the temperature. Hp, the heat-of-the-reac- 
tion at constant pressure, is evidently the heat evolved when the 
reaction takes place at constant pressure in such a direction that 
the products of the reaction are those substances which appear in 
the denominator of the equilibrium expression, Kp. 
If we formulate the equilibrium expression in terms of concen- 
trations instead of partial pressures (7.e., employ equation (8) 
instead of equation (7)), then it follows from the relation connec- 
ting K, with K, and the relation connecting Hp with AU (equa- 
tions (36) and (40), XIX) that

reaction, is equal to the heat evolved when the reaction takes place 
at constant volume in such a direction that the products of the 
reaction are the subtances which appear in the denominator of 
the equilibrium expression, K,. 
Problem 41.—Deduce equation (50) in the manner indicated. 
Equations (49) and (50) also hold for heterogeneous equilibria 
involving gases. Thus for the equilibrium, aA + bB + cC,= 
mM + nN, we would write (Sec. 7) 
Cr C.-Ce K, (51) 
and AU would be the heat evolved when n moles of the substance N 
in the crystalline state reacted with m moles of the substance M 
in the gaseous state to produce a moles of the substance A and 
¢ moles of the substance C, both in the gaseous state, and 6 moles 
of the substance B in the crystalline state. 
By reasoning similar to the above (Appendix, 17), we can show 
that for equilibria (whether homogeneous or heterogeneous) 
in solutions of constant thermodynamic environment we have the 
relation

where AU is the heat evolved when the reaction in the solution at 
T° and in constant thermodynamic environment takes place 
without the production of external work in such a direction as to

equilibrium expression. Equation (53) is known as the van’t 
Hoff equation. 
Problem 42.—When water vapor is heated to high temperatures it 
partially dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen according to the equation 
2H.O0 = 2H; + Oz (54) 
and the equilibrium constant for this reaction at 1227° is

(b) From these data calculate the value of K, for this reaction at 2227°. 
(c) Calculate K. at 1227° and at 2227°. (d) Calculate the degree of dis- 
sociation of water at each temperature under a pressure of 1 atmosphere. 
(e) If 0.1 mole of H:O in a vessel of 10 liters capacity be heated to 2227°, 
how many moles of oxygen will be produced? (f) How many if the vessel 
has a capacity of 100 liters? 
Problem 43.—From the data given in problem 13 calculate the value 
of H, in the thermochemical equation 
NH.Cl = NH; + HCl+ H, (58) 
Calculate the sublimation pressure of NH,Cl at 306°.

where H, the heat-of-dissociation, is the heat evolved during the ionization 
of one mole of the electrolyte. From data obtainable in problems 7 and 8, 
Chapter XIX, and Tables XXII and XXIII, Chapter XVII, calculate the 
percentage rate at which the degree of dissociation of a 0.05n solution of 
acetic acid changes with the temperature at 18°. On the assumption that 
H, is independent of T calculate with the aid of equation (59) the degree of 
dissociation of a 0.05n solution of acetic acid at 25° and compare your re- 
sults with the value obtained in problem 17 above. 
Problem 45.—By determining the solubility (So) of orthonitrobenzoic 
acid in water at different temperatures Noyes and Sammet? found that for 
this substance ) BOiaa 0.03335, and from conductance measure- 
dlog. ments they found similarly (“38) et —0.0216. Calculate the value 
of H, in the thermochemical equation 
Ht+B-=HB+H, (60) 
where HB is written for orthonitrobenzoic acid and B” for its anion. The 
value of H, for this reaction, determined calorimetrically, is 4040 + 100 cal. 
11. The Theorem of LeChatelier.—The effect on any physico- 
chemical equilibrium, produced by an attempt to alter any one of 
the factors which influence it, can be qualitatively predicted by 
means of a theorem formulated by LeChatelier* which may be 
stated as follows: If an attempt is made to alter any one of the 
factors (e.g., the temperature or pressure of the system or the 
fugacity of any constituent of the system) which influence any 
physico-chemical equilibrium, then a shift in the equilibrium will 
take place in such a direction as to decrease the magnitude of the 
alteration which would otherwise occur in. that factor. 
For example, if we add a certain amount of heat to any system, 
this will increase the molecular energy of the system and pro- 
duce a corresponding rise in temperature, but if a physico-chem- 
ical equilibrium exists within the system, this equilibrium will be 
displaced in the direction in which heat is absorbed, and since part 
of the heat added to the system is used up in this process the 
increase in the temperature will be smaller than would otherwise 
be the case. It therefore follows that increase in temperature 
always displaces an equilibrium in the direction in which heat is 
absorbed. In a similar way it is evident that increase of pres- 
@ Henri Louis LeChatelier. Professor of Chemistry in the University of 
Paris, Member of the Institute of France,  
-P-A-G-E-388
  360 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cnav. XXII 
sure will displace an equilibrium in the direction of the smaller 
volume. 
In the case of a chemical equilibrium, if the fugacity of any 
substance involved in the equilibrium be increased by increasing 
its mole fraction, then the chemical equilibrium will be displaced 
in the direction which results in the disappearance of some of this 
substance. If, however, the fugacity of some inert substance not 
directly concerned in the chemical equilibrium (e.g., argon in a 
gaseous mixture, or the solvent in a dilute solution) be momentar- 
ily increased by increasing its mole fraction, then the equilibrium 
will be displaced in the direction of the larger number of molecules, 
for by this increase in the total number of molecules the mole 
fraction, and hence also (in most cases) the fugacity, of the inert 
substance will not undergo so great a permanent increase as 
would be the case if no shift in equilibrium took place. 
Problem 46.—With the aid of the theorem of Le Chatelier predict as far 
as possible the direction in which the equilibrium will be shifted (1) by 
increasing the external pressure at constant temperature and composition 
and (2) by adding a large quantity of some inert substance keeping the 
temperature and external pressure constant, in the case of the reactions 
shown in equations (15, 16a, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33 and 34) of this chapter. How 
would you ascertain with the aid of LeChatelier’s theorem the effect of in- 
creased pressure upon the melting point of a substance? In which direction 
will the following equilibria be displaced by increasing the temperature?

CHAPTER XXIII 
CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA INVOLVING THE IONS OF 
WATER 
1. Scope of the Chapter.—From a purely practical point of 
view, if for no other reason, aqueous solutions are of more inter- 
est to the chemist than almost any other class of solutions with 
which he has to deal, because in most of the operations which the 
chemist carries out in solution, water is the solvent which he 
employs. We have. already learned (XVI, 4b) that water is 
itself electrolytically dissociated to a very slight extent into 
hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions, and although the number of 
these ions is so small that pure water is, in fact, a fair electrical 
insulator, the réle which they play in many of the processes with 
which the chemist has to deal is nevertheless of the greatest 
importance, so important, in fact, that unless it is clearly under- 
stood many of the most common everyday operations of the 
laboratory cannot be intelligently carried out. 
The hydrolysis of salts and other substances, the proper use of 
indicators in titrametric analysis, the proper conditions for pre- 
cipitation in gravimetric analyses, the catalytic action of water, 
the maintenance of neutrality, the dissolving of substances, the 
percentage yield and the character of the products in many 
industrial processes are all examples of instances in which the 
part played by the ions of water is frequently of the most funda- 
mental character. In the present chapter we shall consider in 
some detail a few of these instances in order to illustrate the 
application of the laws of chemical equilibrium in this important 
field and to give the student an opportunity to gain some facility 
in the application of these laws to specific cases. 
2. Definitions.—With respect to their ionization products in 
aqueous solution, electrolytes are classified as acids, bases or 
salts in accordance with the following definitions; 
(a) Any electrolyte which gives hydrogen-ion (H+) as one of 
the direct products of its ionization is called an acid. The 
361 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  362 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuap. XXIII 
extent to which it dissociates in this way is a measure of its 
strength as an acid. 
(b) Any electrolyte which gives hydroxyl-ion (OH-) as one 
of the direct products of its ionization is called a base. The 
extent to which it dissociates in this way is a measure of its 
strength as a base. 
(c) An electrolyte which gives at least one positive ion, other 
than H*, and at least one negative ion, other than OH-, as pro- 
ducts of its ionization is called a salt. 
(d) A salt may also give hydrogen-ion as one of the direct 
products of it ionization. It is then an acid as well as a salt 
and is called an acid-salt. 
    
  
      Examples: 
NaHSO, = Na+ +H+ + SO,-- (1) 
K.HPO, = 2K+ +H+ + PO.--- (2) 
COOH Coo- 
| = NH +| + Ht (3) 
COONH, Coo- 
(e) If a salt gives hydroxyl-ion as one of the direct products 
of its ionization, it is a base as well as a salt and is called a basic 
salt. 
Examples 
Fe(OH).Cl = Fe+++ + 20H- + Cl- (4) 
CH.NH;OH:COOK ‘a 
Potassium glycocollate — nO Ce 
and then perhaps 
CH:NH;0HCOO- = +CH,.NH;COO- + OH- (5) 
(f) Some substances give both hydrogen- and hydroxyl-ions 
as products of their ionization. Such substances are called 
amphoteric electrolytes. Zinc hydroxide is an example of such 
an electrolyte. 
Zn(OH)2 = Znt++ + 20H- (6) 
and 
H.ZnO, = H+ + HZn0.— (7) 
Aluminum hydroxide is another example; 
Al(OH); = Alt+++ + 30H- (8)
-P-A-G-E-391
  Sec, 2] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 363 
and 
H;Al03; = H+ + HeAl0;- (9) 
HAIO, = H+ + AlO.- i (10) 
The formula H;A1O; differs from the formula HAIO2 only by 
one molecule of H.O. Since we do not know the degree of hydra- 
tion of these substances in solution, it is frequently customary to 
write their formulas without any extra water attached to them, 
that is, HA1O: is written in preference to HsAlO3 or H;A10, or 
H,AlOs, etc. It may be that molecules corresponding to each 
of the above formulas are present in the solution. Similarly we 
might write the formula of the base AIOOH instead of Al(OH)s. 
As a base, aluminium hydroxide forms with acids the neutral alu- 
minium salts, such as AlCls, and basic salts, such as Al(OH).Cl, 
which latter salt might equally well be written AIOCI and 
called aluminyl chloride. As an acid, aluminium hydroxide 
forms with bases salts called aluminates (e.g., KAIO2). Ina 
similar way zinc hydroxide forms the zinc salts (ZnCl) and the 
zincates (KHZnO2). 
Amphoteric electrolytes must evidently have two ionization 
constants, one, K,4, for the ionization as an acid and the other, 
Kz, for the ionization as a base. Thus, for the ionization of 
arsenious acid HAsO. (or arsenyl hydroxide, AsSOOH) we have 
for the acid dissociation* or 
    HAsO, = H+ + AsO;- (11) and 
[H+][AsO.7] _ i A ° [SHAsO.] ~ Ka = 6-10-1%(at 25°) (12) 
and for the basic dissociation 
AsOOH = AsO+ + OH- (18) 
and 
af, = 
[AsO*IOH™] _ x, = 5-10-" (at 25°) (14)   
[SHAsO.] 
The quantity (2HAsO:;) in the above equations is used to repre- 
sent the total concentration of the un-dissociated substance. That 
is, [2HAsO,] means [AsOOH] + [As(OH)s] + [HAsOz] + [HsAsO3] 
+ etc., the summation including all the different forms in which 
arsenious arsenic exists in the solution as neutral molecules con-
-P-A-G-E-392
  364 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXIII 
taining only one atom of arsenic permolecule. Thenumber of dif- 
ferent kinds of such molcules present in the solution is not known, 
but since they are all in chemical equilibrium with one another the 
mass action law requires that the concentration of any one kind 
must be proportional to the concentration of every other kind. 
This being the case, it follows from the principles of proportion 
that the concentration of any one species must also be proportional 
to the sum of the concentrations of all the species and we may 
therefore employ this sum in formulating the equilibrium expres- 
sion for the ionization reaction, instead of employing the con- 
centration of some one species. From equations (12) and (14) 
it is evident that arsenious acid is a stronger acid than it is a 
base. As an acid it forms the arsenites (KAsO:2) and as a base, 
the arsenyl salts (AsOCl). 
(g) Any aqueous solution in which [H+]>[OH-] is said to be 
acid. If [OH-]>[Ht+], the solution is said to be alkaline. If 
[H+] = [OH-] the solution is said to be neutral. The concentra- 
tion [H+] of hydrogen-ion in any solution may be called the 
true acidity of that solution and the concentration [OH-] of 
hydioxyl-ion in that solution, the true alkalinity of the solution. 
3. The Ionization of Water—Every aqueous solution contains 
both hydrogen-ion and hydroxyl-ion owing to a slight ionization 
of the water itself according to the equation 
H.0 = H+ + OH- (15) 
Water is therefore both an acid and a base, but since H+ andOH- 
must evidently be produced in exactly equivalent amounts, its 
strength as an acid must be equal to its strength as a base and 
pure water must, according to the above definitions, be neutral. 
The mass action law for the ionization of water gives, in 
terms of fugacities (XXII, 3b), 
Put X Pow _ const. 16 ie (16) 
Now the partial vapor pressure of water from dilute aqueous solu- 
tions is not greatly different from the vapor pressure of pure 
water. For example, the vapor pressure of water is changed less 
than 1.5 per cent. by dissolving enough KCl to form a 0.5n solu- 
tion. (See XV, 2.) For dilute aqueous solutions (say up to 0.1
-P-A-G-E-393
Sno. 4] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 365 
molal) we may, therefore write pa. = const. without introduc- 
ing an error as great as 1 per cent. Equation (16) may then 
be written 
Dut X Pou = const. (17) 
and, if we assume that the fugacity of each ion-species is propor- 
tional to its concentration (Cf. the curve for H+ and OH~ in Fig. 
41) we have 
[H*][(0H7] = Kw (18) 
or stated in words: In any dilute aqueous solution the product 
of the concentrations of H*+-ion and OH--ion in that solution is 
always equal to a constant quantity, K., whose value depends 
only upon the temperature. K.,, is called the ionization constant 
of water. Values of K,,:10" for different temperatures are shown 
in the following table:

Problem 1.—The specific conductance of perfectly pure water obtained 
by Kohlrausch and Heydweiller at 18° is 0.04-10~* reciprocal ohms. With 
the aid of Table XXIII calculate the ionization constant of water at 18°. 
Calculate also the true acidity and the true alkalinity of pure water at 18°. 
Problem 2.—From the values of Kw at 0° and 50° respectively, as given 
in Table XXXIV, calculate the average value for the heat of ionization of 
water within this range. Compare your result with equation (35, XIX) 
and explain, 
4. Hydrolysis of Salts. (a) One Constituent Weak.—If the 
salt BA of the strong base BOH and the weak acid HA be dis- 
solved in water, it dissociates, 
BA = Bt + A- (19) 
giving A~-ion. There is always present H+-ion, also, owing to 
the ionization of the water, and we thus have present together the 
   
-P-A-G-E-394
366 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuapv. XXIII 
two ions, H+ and A-, of the weak acid HA, and since in any solu- 
tion containing these two ions the relation 
(HANIA [HA] 
must be satisfied, it is evident that a certain amount of un-dissoci- 
ated acid HA must be formed by the reaction 
Ht+ + A- = HA (21) 
The removal of hydrogen-ion from the solution by this reaction, 
however, disturbs the equilibrium 
H.O0 = H+ + OH- (22) 
and some more water must ionize in order to maintain the prod- 
uct, [H+][OH-], constant. We can express these three reactions 
conveniently in one equation by combining equations (19), (21), 
and (22), giving us 
(B+ + A-) + H.0 = (B+ + OH-) + HA (23) = K, (20) 
or simply 
A- + H.0 = HA + OH- (24) 
Reaction (23) (or (24)) is known as hydrolysis and the salt is 
said to be hydrolyzed. In writing hydrolysis reactions, and indeed 
all chemical reactions in solution, it will be convenient, for con- 
sideration of the equilibria involved, to write all strong electro- 
lytes in the dissociated form and all weak electrolytes in the 
undissociated form. 
From equation (24) it is evident that the hydrolysis of the salt 
of a strong base and a weak acid makes the solution alkaline since 
OH--ion is one of the products of the hydrolysis. A solution of 
KCN, for example, is strongly alkaline owing to the following 
hydrolysis reaction: 
(K+ + CN-) + H.O = (K+ + OH-) + HCN (25) 
The alkalinity of solutions of NazCOs; is due similarly to the reac- 
tions 
CO;-~ + H.0 = HCO;- + OH- (26) 
HCO;- + H.O = HCO; + OH- (27) 
and 
H.COs = H,0 + COz (28)
-P-A-G-E-395
Src. 4] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 367 
If the COz is allowed to escape from a sodium carbonate solution, 
all three of the above equilibria will evidently be driven toward 
the right and the alkalinity will be increased. The bicarbonate 
ion, HCO;-, is an acid as well as an ion because it ionizes thus 
HCO; - = H+ + CO;— (29) 
to give hydrogen-ion and carbonate ion. This is also true of 
the intermediate ions of all polybasic acids. 
Problem 3.—Write the reactions for the equilibria which exist in a solu- 
tion saturated with crystals of CaCO;. From these reactions predict the 
effects on the solubility of CaCO; produced by adding to the saturated 
solution a small quantity of (a) nitric acid, (6) sodium hydroxide, (c) carbon 
dioxide. The ion, HCO;-, is an extremely weak acid, very much weaker 
than carbonic acid, H2COs. 
In the case of a salt of a weak base and a strong acid (aniline 
hydrochloride, for example), the hydrolysis reaction may be 
written 
(Bt+ A-) + H.O = BOH + (H+-+ A-) (30) 
or 
Bt+ H,0 = BOH + H* (31) 
and the solution becomes acid as a result of the hydrolysis. 
(b) Both Constituents Weak.—When the salt of a weak base 
and of a weak acid is dissolved in water both of the ions of the 
salt unite with the ions of water to form undissociated mole- 
cules of the weak acid and the weak base respectively. The 
reaction may be represented thus 
(Bt+ A-) + H.O = BOH + HA (32) 
If the weak acid HA and the weak base BOH are of equal strength 
(i.e., if K, = Kz), the solution will evidently remain neutral. 
If the weak acid is stronger than the weak base, the solution will 
become slightly acid as a result of the hydrolysis, while if the 
weak base is the stronger, the solution will become slightly 
alkaline. The hydrolysis of ammonium acetate, for example, 
(NH,t+Ac-) + H,0 = NH,OH + HAc (33) 
leaves the solution practically neutral because the ionization 
constants of ammonium hydroxide and acetic acid are almost 
identical. If the acid and the base are both extremely weak, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
368 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXIII 
salt will be almost entirely hydrolyzed and the solution will con- 
tain only the undissociated molecules of the weak acid and weak 
base with very few salt molecules. The hydrolysis of a salt is 
evidently the reverse of the neutralization of an acid by a base. 
5. Degree of Hydrolysis.—Hydrolysis always occurs when the 
salt of a weak acid or a weak base is dissolved in water. The 
extent to which the hydrolysis takes place depends upon the 
ionization constants of the acid and base and upon that of the 
water at the temperature in question, and it can be calculated if 
these constants are known. The degree of hydrolysis, h, is 
defined as that fraction of the total salt which has undergone 
hydrolysis. In order to make clear the factors which determine 
the extent of the hydrolysis we will now derive an expression for 
h in terms of the ionization constants involved. 
(a) One Constituent Weak.—We will consider first the hydro- 
lysis of the salt of a strong base and a weak acid in a solution 
prepared by dissolving Cs moles of the salt in enough water to 
make the volume of the solution 1 liter. Cs will be called the 
total concentration of the salt in the solution. The hydrolysis 
reaction is 
(B++-A-) + HO = (Bt+OH-) + HA (34) 
The equilibrium equations which must be satisfied in this solu- 
tion are evidently 
[HAA] _ THAT & Ka (35) 
and 
[H+] [OH-] = K, (36) 
for the weak electrolytes. We have also the following relations 
known as condition equations 
[HA] = hCs (37) 
[OH-] = ahCs (38) 
where a, is the degree of dissociation of the strong base, BOH, in 
the solution: and 
[A-] = as(1 — )Cs (39) 
where ag is the degree of dissociation of the unhydrolyzed por- 
tion of the salt, BA, in the solution.
-P-A-G-E-397
Suc. 5] ' CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 369 
Eliminating [OH-] from equations (36) and (38) and making 
the obvious substitutions in equation (35) we have 
hasCs. _ Ky 
(=e aan 2 (40) 
If we had employed a salt of a weak base instead of one of a weak 
acid, the corresponding equation would be similarly 
WasCs  _ Ku _ We 
(AS Weer Ks oo 
where Kz is the ionization constant of the weak base and a, 
the degree of dissociation of the strong acid in the solution. 
From these two equations it is evident that the degree of hydro- 
lysis is greater the weaker the acid (or the base), that is, the smal- 
ler K,4 (or Kz) is. Moreover, since K,, increases rapidly with 
rise in temperature (see Table XXXIV) and K, (or Kg) either 
increases slowly or else decreases, h also increases rapidly with 
the temperature. 
Since the strong base (or strong acid) which results from the 
hydrolysis has one ion in common with the unhydrolyzed por-   
(41) 
B tion of the salt, the ratio S (or) which appears in equation Ss Ss 
(40) (or (41)) can be computed by means of the principle stated in 
problem 18, XXII, and, in so far as the principle regarding the 
degree of dissociation of electrolytes of the same type (XVII, 2a 
and 3) holds true, a, will be equal to as and for most calculations 
equations (40) and (41) may be written 
hsCs_ Ky 
1-h Kaos 
(b) Both Constituents Weak.—If both the acid and the base 
are so weak that they obey the law of mass action, we may write 
the hydrolysis reaction thus 
(Bt+ A-) + H.0 = BOH + HA (43) 
and the following equilibrium equations must be satisfied in the 
solution   
= Ky (42)

and 
[H+] [OH-]=Ky (46) 
These when combined give us 
[HA] [BOH] Ky 
[B+] [A-] ~ Ky-Ka 
Now one of the constituents, either the acid or the base, will 
usually be stronger than the other. Let us assume first that the 
base is the stronger of the two. The solution will, therefore, be 
somewhat alkaline and we will have the following condition 
equations: (47) 
  [HA]=hCs (48) 
[BOH]+[OH-]= total base =hCs (49) 
[A-]=as(1—h)Cs (50) 
[B+] =[A-]+[OH-]=as(1—h)CstazhCs (51) 
Combining these condition equations with equation (47) gives

For Ky we have from equations (49), (50) and (51) above 
[B+] OH-]_ (as(1 — h)Cs-tanhCs) (anhCs) [BOH] (1 — ag)hCs 
and if we impose the condition that a,+p per cent., we find for 
substantially all cases where h>50 per cent. that Kz must not     
Kp (54) 
exceed (1 —h) Cb But if agp per cent. and h>50 per cent., 
then it can be seen by inspection that the quantity under the 
second radical in equation (53) will not differ from unity by more 
than 2p per cent., and hence for an accuracy of p per cent. in Ky 
we may write equation (53) in the form 
: a 
ina © ene. = Ku (approx.) (55)
-P-A-G-E-399
Sc. 5] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 371 
Equation (55) may, therefore, be used in place of the compli- 
cated equation (53), provided that h*50 per cent. and provided 
also that Kp>(1—h)Csqhg- If h>50 per cent., equation (55) 
may still be employed, if K, is small enough, the exact con- 
2h dition being evidently that a ab > ibe where p is the percent- 
age accuracy with which it is desired that Ky be known. 
Problem 4.—If the value of Ky is in error by p per cent., what will be 
the error in the value of h computed from equation (55), when / is equal to 
(a) 90 per cent., (b) 50 per cent., (c) 10 per cent., (d) 1 per cent.? 
In using equations (53) and (55) the best procedure is toemploy 
equation (55) first, in order to obtain an approximate value for 
Ky. Then using this approximate value, apply the two criteria 
given above in order to determine whether the use of equation 
(55) is justifiable for the case in hand. If this proves not to be the 
case or if there is any question, the calculation should be repeated 
with the aid of equation (53). In this repetition it will be suffi- 
ciently exact to substitute the approximate value of Ky in place 
of the expression 7—;,— where it occurs under the second radi- (1—A)as 
cal in equation (53). 1—a, when required can be computed from 
equation (54). 
In all of the above discussion we have assumed that the weak 
base is stronger than the weak acid. If the reverse is the case, 
the derivation and discussion are entirely analogous, the final 
expressions differing from those given above simply in the substi- 
tution of the subscript A in place of the subscript B and vice 
versa. 
Problem 5.—Derive the relation corresponding to equation (53) for the 
case that the weak acid is stronger than the weak base and state the con- 
ditions under which the equation reduces to the form (55). 
By comparing equations (40) and (55) it will be noted that if 
only one of the constituents of the salt is weak, the degree of 
. hydrolysis is approximately inversely proportional to the square 
root of the concentration of the unhydrolyzed salt, while if both 
constituents of the salt are weak, its degree of hydrolysis is nearly 
independent of its concentration, 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
372 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY |Cuarv. XXIII 
Problem 6.—Calculate approximately the degree of hydrolysis of each 
of the following salts in 0.1 and in 0.01n solution respectively, at 25°: 
KCy, PyCl, and PyCy. The ionization constants are, for hydrocyanic acid, 
HCy, 7.2-10~!°; for pyridine hydroxide, PyOH, 2.28-10-°. Calculate also 
the “true acidity” and the “true alkalinity” (XXIII, 2g) of each of the 
above solutions. 
6. Experimental Methods for Investigating Chemical Equilib- 
tia which Involve the Ions of Water.—The manner in which 
the degree of hydrolysis of a salt can be calculated from the 
equilibrium constants involved has just been explained. It is 
clear that if we could determine the degree of hydrolysis by direct 
experiment, we might then employ the equations just derived 
in order to compute the value of Ky or K, or Kz. We shall 
now proceed to consider some of the experimental methods which 
are employed in the measurement of degree of hydrolysis and in 
studying chemical equilibria in general in aqueous solutions. 
(a) The Conductance Method.—The specific conductance, 
L, of any solution containing a number of ions is expressed by 
the equation oe 
1000L = 2[X]Ax (56) 
where [X] is the equivalent concentration of the con-species, X, 
and Ax is the equivalent conductance of that ion-species in the solu- 
tion. The summation extends over all of the ion-species present. 
(Problem: Derive this relation. See equation (29), XVI, and 
equations (2), (3), (4) and (5), XVII.) 
The Measurement of Hydrolysis by the Conductance Method.— 
As an example of the application of the conductance method to 
the measurement of the degree of hydrolysis of a salt of a strong 
base and a weak acid, let us consider a solution in which the 
hydrolysis equilibrium 
(B++A-)+H,05(Bt+OH-)+HA (57) 
exists. For the specific conductance of this solution we have 
1000LZ = [Bt]Ap: + [A7]Ay-+[OH-]Aog (58) 
(Question: Why is it justifiable to omit the term [H*]Aq: 
from this summation?) If we substitute for each ion concentra- 
tion the expressions given in equations (38) and (39) and solve 
the resulting expression for h, we obtain 
_ 10007 — Csas(An+ + Aa-) 
~ Csan(Ap+ + Aon-) — Csas(Ap+ + Aa-)   
  
(59)
-P-A-G-E-401
Src. 6] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 373 
We can also write (see equation (29), XVI, and equations (2) to 
(5), XVID) i 
1000Ls=Csas(Ay+ + Ay-) (60) 
and in 
1000L, = Csas(Ag+ + Ag) (61) 
where Ls is the specific conductance of the unhydrolyzed salt 
when its concentration is C's, and Ly is the specific conductance 
of a solution of the pure base BOH when its concentration is Cs. 
Hence ee 
L — Lg h . a7, (62) 
Equation (59), with A, taken as equal to Aox for each ion, will 
give as accurate results as the conductance data justify, if the 
degree of hydrolysis is not too large. Equation (62) is more 
reliable but will require more measurements in some cases. Jor 
a salt of a strong acid and a weak base equations (59) and (62) 
also hold, if the subscript B is replaced by A, and OH- by Ht. 
If the salt is one in which both the acid and the base are weak, 
the conductance method is also applicable, but the calculation is 
in general somewhat more complicated than when only one 
constituent is weak and we shall not discuss the details of it here. 
Evidently the conductance method is of practical value only 
when the change in conductance due to the hydrolysis is large 
enough to make an accurate determination of its value possible. 
Problem 7.—The specific conductance of @ 0.001687 normal solution 
of sodium acetate at 218° is 1.0171-10-* reciprocal ohms. By adding suc- 
cessive small portions of acetic acid to the solution (the normality of the 
solution with respect to the salt being kept constant) it was found that its 
specific conductance could be reduced to 984-10-* but no further. A 
0.001687 normal solution of NaOH has a specific conductance of 1.738-10-% 
reciprocal ohms at 218°. Calculate the degree of hydrolysis of the sodium 
acetate at 218°. 
Problem 8.—The great effect of temperature upon degree of hydrolysis 
will be appreciated by computing the degree of hydrolysis for the above 
solution at 25°. Look up the necessary ionization constants. 
The Determination of the Ionization Constant of a Very Weak 
Electrolyte—As a second example of the application of con- 
ductance methods to the study of chemical equilibria in solution 
we will consider the determination of the ionization constant of
-P-A-G-E-402
374 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXII 
a very weak base or acid, one which is so weak that the conduct- 
ance of its own pure solution cannot be measured with sufficient 
accuracy to determine its ionization constant in the usual way. 
(See problem 17, XXII.) Suppose we wished to determine the 
value of Kp for the very weak base BOH. 
Let Z be the specific conductance of a solution of the strong 
acid HA of concentration C4 equivalents per liter. If we dis- 
solve Cz equivalents of our weak base in 1 liter of the acid solu- 
tion, the specific conductance of the resulting solution will be L’, 
which will be less than LZ owing to the replacement of some of the 
very mobile hydrogen ions by the less mobile Bt-ions, as a result 
of the partial occurrence of the neutralization reaction, 
BOH + (H+ + A-) = (B+ + A-) + 0.0 (63) 
For the solution of the pure acid we have 
1000L = o4CaAo = [A] (Ant + Ay-) = [H*](Aut + A,-) (64) 
and after the addition of the base we have 
1000L’ = [H+/ A, ++ [A-V’A,- + [BtV’A,+ (65)     
But 
[H+] + [Bt] = [A-/’ (66) 
and hence 
1000Z" = [A~V'Axt — [B+)Ant + [AVA + [B+'A,* = [AV’(Agt + A.-) + [Bt](Ast —Agt) (67) 
But since the two strong electrolytes, HA and BA, are of the same 
ionic type and are in solution together they will be dissociated to 
practically the same degree (XXII, 6e) in this solution. The 
occurrence of the neutralization reaction (63) will therefore not 
produce much change in the concentration of the common ion A, 
and we may write 
  [A-] = [A-J’ (approx.) (68) 
and on combining equations (68), (67) and (64) we obtain 
, . 10000 — L) py - (69)

Problem 9.—The specific conductance of 0.1n HCl at 25° is 0.03952 
and it is lowered to 0.03886 by dissolving 0.0494 formula weights of 14 As.Os 
in a liter of the solution. Calculate the value of Kg for the amphoteric 
electrolyte, arsenious acid. (See XXIII, 1f.) Aasot may be taken as 40 
and the other ion-conductances may be computed from Table XXIII. 
(b) The Colligative Property Method.—The hydrolysis of a 
salt having only one weak constituent evidently (see equation 57, 
above) results in an increase in the concentration of solute mole- 
cules in the solution and a consequent lowering of the vapor 
pressure and the freezing point and an elevation of the boiling 
point of the solution. If we can measure the change in the mag- 
nitude of one of the above properties which results from the 
hydrolysis, we will have a measure of the increase in solute mole- 
cules resulting from the hydrolysis and consequently a measure of 
the degree of hydrolysis. This method is applicable only to 
salts of very weak acids or bases (K4 or Kg<10-™) where the 
degree of hydrolysis is fairly large. The details of the method 
will become evident by the solution of the following problem 
where freezing-point lowering is the property chosen for measure- 
ment. 
Problem 10.—A solution prepared by dissolving 0.200 formula weight 
of KCl in 1000 grams of water has a freezing point of —0.681°. If 0.0900 
formula weight of AsO; be dissolved in this solution its freezing point is 
lowered to —t:°. The freezing point of a solution prepared by dissolving 
0.2 formula weight of AsOCl in 1000 grams of water is —i.°. On the
-P-A-G-E-404
  6 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXIII 
assumption that tf: = 1.010 and ¢, = 0.974, calculate from the above data 
alone the degree of hydrolysis of arsenyl chloride at 0° and 0.2n. Then 
with the aid of other necessary data calculate the ionization constant of 
arsenyl hydroxide. When AsO; dissolves in water it reacts thus 
AsO; + H.O = SHAsO, 
(See 1f, equation (14) above, for the meaning of the formula SHAsO:.) 
(c) The Distribution Method.— Whenever one of the molecular 
species concerned in a chemical equilibrium in aqueous solution 
can be caused to distribute itself between the aqueous solution 
and some second non-miscible phase in such a way that its con- 
centration in the second phase can be accurately determined, 
then its concentration in the aqueous solution can evidently be 
calculated, if the law governing the distribution is known. The 
following problems illustrate the use of this method, which is of 
very general application. 
Problem 11.—By shaking successive portions of a 0.03138n aqueous solution 
of aniline hydrochloride, AnCl, with 50 c.c. of benzene at 25° until equi- 
librium is established, the benzene layer on analysis is found to contain 
0.5938 gram of aniline, CsHsNHz, per liter. (The value 0.5938 in this ex- 
periment is an assumed value.) Assuming that the distribution cetisieny 
B 
Cu 
10.1 at 25°, calculate the degree of hydrolysis of the aniline hydrochloride in 
the water layer and the ionization constant of aniline hydroxide at 25°. 
Problem 12.—A current of air is passed through a saturation apparatus 
made up of a series of tubes containing a solution having the composition 
1000 grams of water, 0.002 mole of HCN and enough KCl (about 0.2 mole) 
to produce the same aqueous tension as that above a 0.2 weight formal solu- 
tion of KCN. The composition of the solution in the last tube of the satura- 
tion apparatus does not change during the experiment. On emerging 
from the saturation vessel the air passes through an absorption vessel con- 
taining a solution of AgNO; The air thus freed from HCN next passes 
through a second saturation apparatus just like the first but filled with a 
0.2 weight formal solution of KCN, and finally through a second absorption 
vessel containing a solution of AgNO3. The whole operation is so conducted 
that the air emerges at practically the same pressure as it enters the system 
and the whole apparatus is immersed in a constant temperature bath at 
50°. If m grams of AgCN are found to have been precipitated in the first 
absorption vessel and 0.93m grams in the second, what is the ionization 
constant of HCN at 50°? 
Problem 13.—When iodine is dissolved in a dilute aqueous solution of of aniline between benzene and a 0.03138 aqueous solution of KCl is

Sec. 6] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 377 | 
any iodide a large part of it combines with the iodide to produce tri-iodide 
in accordance with the equation, 
I, + I = 1;- (74) 
An appreciable quantity, however, remains in solution as I:-molecules in 
equilibrium with the iodide and tri-iodide. The distribution constant of 
I,-molecules between carbon tetrachloride and a dilute aqueous solution of 
H,80. is coe 
that a solution, prepared by dissolving 0.1622 formula weight of HI and 
0.0834 formula weight of I, in enough water to form a liter, will be in dis- 
tribution equilibrium with a 0,112 molal solution of I, in CCl, Another 
experiment showed that a solution prepared by dissolving. 0.07430 formula 
weight of HI and 0.001373 formula weight of I, in enough water to form a 
liter was in distribution equilibrium with a 0.00205 molal solution of I, 
in CCly, Conductance measurements show that the two acids HI and HI; 
are of equal strengths. (Cf. la.) From these data compute two values for 
the equilibrium constant of reaction (74) at 25°. (H1 and HI; are insoluble 
in CCl.)   
= 85 at 25°. It has been found by experiment at 25° 
(d) The Catalytic Method.—This method is applicable to salts 
of only one weak constituent and depends upon the fact that the 
rates of many reactions are catalyzed (XXI, 12) by hydrogen- 
ion and by hydroxyl-ion, the specific reaction rate being propor- 
tional to the concentration of the catalyzing ion. An application 
of the method has already been illustrated in one instance (prob- 
lem 8, XXI). 
Problem 14.—2100 c.c. of a 7 per cent. cane sugar solution are prepared. 
This solution is divided into two equal portions, both of which are brought 
to a temperature of 100°. A 50-c.c. sample of each is removed, cooled to 
20°, and its rotation, R, determined in a polariscope. To the remainder of 
one solution 0.1 mole of acetic acid and 0.1 mole of KCl are added and to 
the other (at the same time) 0.1 mole of aniline hydrochloride (AnCl), and 
both solutions thoroughly shaken. At measured intervals of time samples 
are withdrawn from each solution, quickly cooled to 20° (at which tempera- 
ture the rate of reaction is negligibly small), and polarized. Assume that the 
following results are obtained in such an experiment.

drolyzed in 0.1 molal solution at 100°? Why is the KCl added to one 
portion?

(e) The E.M.F. Method.—The characteristic electrode poten- 
tial of the electrochemical reaction 
H, — 2( — )=22H+ (75) 
is a function of the hydrogen-ion concentration and of the thermo- 
dynamic environment in the solution in contact with the hydro- 
gen electrode (XVI, 46). 
Problem 16.—The E.M.F. of the hydrogen electrode in equilibrium with 
a 0.1 molal solution of aniline hydrochloride at 25° is found to be E volts. 
By experiment with different solutions containing both NaCl and HCl 
together, and having a total concentration of 0.1 mole per liter, it is found 
by interpolation that the E.M.F. of the hydrogen electrode in contact with 
a solution containing (0.1 — a) mole of NaCl and a moles of HCI per liter 
is also Z volts. Calculate the degree of hydrolysis of aniline hydrochloride 
at 25° on the assumption that a = 0.00455 mole. 
(f) The Indicator Method.—The use of indicators for the 
purpose of determining the hydrogen-ion concentration of a 
salt solution is described in section 8, below. 
7. Solutions of Constant Hydrogen-Ion Concentration. Re- 
serve Acidity and Reserve Alkalinity..—When a drop of 0.5n 
acid is added to a liter of pure water the hydrogen-ion concentra- 
tion is increased at once more than 100-fold. Similarly when a 
drop of 0.5n alkali is added the hydroxyl-ion concentration is 
increased over 100-fold. In other words, pure water possesses 
no reserve power to neutralize even traces of acids or bases. For 
this reason the hydrogen-ion concentration of the best distilled 
water of the laboratory is usually far from being equal to 10-7 
equivalent per liter at room temperature. It is instead a very 
uncertain’ and fluctuating quantity dependent upon the traces 
of acid or alkaline substances which the water happens to dis- 
solve from the air. For many purposes it is important to have a 
solution of a definite hydrogen-ion concentration which possesses 
the power of maintaining its “true acidity” practically without 
change, even upon additions of strong acids or bases in small
-P-A-G-E-407
  Sno. 7] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 379 
quantities. A solution which possesses the power of neutralizing 
both acids and alkalies and thus of protecting itself against both 
of them will be said to possess reserve acidity and reserve alkalinity. 
Any solution which contains a weak acid together with its 
salt or a weak base together with its salt possesses this power. 
The true acidity of such a solution can be controlled by employ- 
ing a weak acid or base having the proper ionization constant. 
The mechanism by which a solution containing a weak acid, HA, 
and its salt, BA, protects itself against additions of small quan- 
tities of acids or bases is through the occurrence of the reactions 
A-+Ht=HA (76) 
and 
HA+ OH- = H.0+ A- (77) 
by which the added acid or base is neutralized. From these two 
reactions it is evident that if the reserve acidity and reserve 
alkalinity are to be equal to each other, then [A~] should be 
equal to [HA]. But 
(y= ne m (78) 
and hence 
{H*]=Ka : (79) 
or in words, if the reserve acidity and reserve alkalinity are to be 
equal to each other, then the acid employed should be one whose 
ionization constant is numerically equal to the hydrogen-ion 
concentration which it is desired that the solution shall have. 
If a weak base is employed instead of a weak acid, the corre- 
sponding condition is evidently 
[OH-] = Ky (80) 
Problem 17.—It is desired to prepare a solution having the hydrogen- 
ion concentration [H*]. The best weak acid which is available happens to 
be one whose ionization constant is n[H*+]. Show that the ratio of salt to 
acid in the solution should be

Problem 18.—Give complete directions for preparing a neutral solution, 
which possesses equal reserve acidity and reserve alkalinity, by means of a 
mixture of the two salts NaH.PO, and’ NasHPO,.. With regard to the

and

Problem 19.—The solubility of CO. in water at 25° and one atmosphere 
is 0.0338 formula weight per liter. What will be the true acidity of a 0.12 
formal solution of sodium bicarbonate, NaHCOs, which is saturated with 
CO, at 25° and one atmosphere? The ionization constants of carbonic 
acid at 25° are 
  
  [H4HCO] _ (cord aco ig and 
[HAICOM] _ aan “THeog = 610 (85) 
Neglect the influence of the salting-out effect. 
The actual magnitude of the reserve acidity or reserve alka- 
linity of a solution depends of course upon the total concentra- 
tion of the protecting materials. By means of the phosphate 
mixture mentioned in problem 18, it is possible to prepare a 
perfectly neutral solution which requires the addition of 0.5 
equivalent of HCl per liter before it will show an acid reaction 
to congo red and which requires the addition of 0.5 equivalent of 
NaOH per liter before it will exhibit an alkaline reaction toward 
phenolphthalein. With distilled water, 5-10-5 equivalents of 
either reagent would be sufficient to change the color of the indi- 
eator. The presence of weak acids and their salts in the saliva, 
in the blood, and in the other fluids of the animal body is respon- 
sible for the power which these fluids possess of protecting them- 
selves against a change in their hydrogen-ion concentration. 
8. Neutralization Indicators.—When a solution of a base is 
titrated with a standard acid, or vice versa, the end point of the 
titration should occur when the amounts of acid and base em- 
ployed are exactly equivalent to each other. At the end of the 
titration the composition of the solution should, therefore, be 
such as would be obtained by dissolving the pure salt in the proper
-P-A-G-E-409
  
Szc. 8] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 381 
amount of water. Unless the acid and the base are of equal 
strengths, however, this solution will not be neutral because the 
salt will be hydrolyzed to some extent. The indicator employed 
in the titration should not, therefore, in general be one whose 
color change occurs when the solution is neutral but rather one 
whose color change takes place when the solution has the parti- 
cular hydrogen-ion concentration which exists in a pure solu- 
tion of the salt formed during the titration. Since the standard 
solution employed in the titration should always be one of a 
strong acid or base (in order that the hydrolysis of the resulting 
salt shall be as small as possible), it is evident that the choice 
of a suitable indicator will be determined by the ionization con- 
stant of the base or acid which is to be titrated and by the con- 
centration of the salt in the resulting solution. 
Indicators are weak organic acids (or bases) whose undissocia- 
ted molecules exist in two tautomeric forms? in equilibrium with 
each other in the solution. One of these forms, HIn (or InOH), 
has the color A and is practically a non-electrolyte. The other 
form, HIn’ (or InOH’), ionizes, and this form together with the 
indicator-salt, BIn (or InA), and the indicator-ion, In~ (or 
Int), has another color B. For a good indicator either A or B 
should be white or A and B should be two sharply contrasted 
colors. 
? The different colors of the two tautomeric forms are due to different 
configurations of the molecules. Thus the non-ionizing and ionizing tau- 
tomers of phenolphthalein are supposed to have the structures 
CeHiOH

and

Coo-Ht 
respectively. Phenolphthalein is thus a dibasic acid and in an exact theory 
of its use as an indicator should be treated as such. [See Rosenstein, 
Jour, Amer, Chem. Soc., 34, 1117 (1912).]
-P-A-G-E-410

For an indicator-acid the equilibria existing in its solution may 
be represented thus 
HIn @HIn’@In- + Ht+   
      color A color B (86) 
and for an indicator-base, thus 
‘nO @In0OH’2Int + OH- (87) 
color A color B 
For a good indicator the mass action constant 
al = const. or reat = const. (88) 
should be extremely small, that is, the neutral molecules of the 
tonizing tautomer should be present only to a very slight extent 
in the solution. Practically all of the indicator should exist 
either in one or both of the forms HIn and In-, or InOH and Int. 
If this condition is not fulfilled, the color change of the indicator 
will be gradual instead of sharp. 
If we add a strong acid to a solution of an indicator-acid, the 
above equilibria (equation 86) will all be driven toward the left 
and the solution will have the color A, the ‘‘acid color of the indi- 
cator,”’ since practically all of the indicator will be present in the 
form of the molecules HIn. If on the other hand we add a base, 
BOH, to the solution, the hydrogen-ion concentration will be 
greatly reduced as a result of the reaction H+ + OH- = HO, 
and all of the above equilibria will be driven toward the right. 
The solution will now have the color B, the ‘‘alkaline color of the 
indicator,” since practically all of the indicator will be present in 
the form of the salt BIn and its ion In-. If the hydrogen-ion 
concentration of the solution is given that particular value which 
results in half of the indicator being present in the form HIn and 
the other half in the form In~ + BIn, the solution will have the 
color produced by the mixture of colors A and B in equal propor- 
tions. This intermediate color is called the “neutral color of 
the indicator.” The solution, however, will not be neutral but 
will have a value of [H+] which is determined by the ionization 
constant of the particular indicator employed. For an indicator- 
base the behavior is entirely analogous, We shall now proceed
-P-A-G-E-411
Sec. 8] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 383 
to formulate the equilibrium expressions for the ionization of an 
indicator. 
The mass action law gives us for an indicator-acid the 
expression 
{H+] (In7] (inte Kis (89) 
and for an indicator-base the expression 
[In*] [OB] _ fnOmp, ey 
Putting [OH-] = EA in equation (90) and solving (89) and (90) 
for [H+] we have 
K, [Int]   
[Ht] = K,,[In0H] (91) 
and 
_ x, bl ORY = Ku ay (92) 
Now [HIn] in the case of an indicator-acid is the concentration 
of that portion of the indicator which exhibits the ‘acid color.” 
If 1—+ is the fractional part of the indicator which exists in this 
form, then evidently [HIn] = (1—y)C; and [In-] = azsyCj, 
where C{ is the total concentration of the indicator and ays is the 
degree of dissociation of the indicator-salt. Equation (92) 
therefore becomes 
Hei arg   
(98) 
In the case of an indicator-base, if 1—v is the fractional part 
which is present in the form of the salt, that is, in the form which 
exhibits the ‘‘acid color,” we have [In*] = azs (1—y) Cy hence 
4) — Ko aus = +) [= Res a (94) 
Except for the position occupied by the quantity ozs; in equa- 
tions (93) and (94) both equations have the same mathematical 
form. For most problems involving the use of indicators ays 
may be taken as practically equal to unity. If we make this 
assumption, equations (93) and (94) evidently are identical in 
form and may be written 
ine Clay), Ea pear igel (95)
-P-A-G-E-412

384 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY (Cuar. XXIII 
Equation (95) is therefore applicable to any indicator, whether 
it be an acid or a base. Ky will be called the indicator-constant. 
y represents the fractional part of the indicator which is present 
in the form showing the “alkaline color’ of the indicator. If 
y = 0.5, the indicator will evidently show its “neutral color” 
and equation (95) yields the important conclusion that the 
indicator-constant, K;, of any indicator is equal to the hydrogen- 
ion concentration of the solution in which that indicator shows 
its “neutral color.” This makes the determination of the indi- 
cator-constant of any indicator a comparatively simple matter. 
In general, however, it is not the value of K; alone but rather 
dow, which it is impor-   
the value of the ‘‘indicator function,” K; 
tant to know for the different indicators. This is due to the fact 
that with some indicators the “neutral color” of the indicator is 
not taken as the end point in a titration, that is, some fraction 
other than one-half of the indicator is transformed from one form 
to the other at the end point. The value of this fraction varies 
with different indicators and is determined by the sensitiveness of 
the eye to the color changes which occur and by the value de- 
manded for the indicator function in a given titration. Thus, for 
example, in using phenolphthalein the eye can detect the appear- 
ance of the first flush of pink color more accurately than it could 
determine the exact intensity of red which corresponds to the 
transformation of one-half of the indicator from the colorless to 
the colored form. The value of the indicator function for any 
given value of y, and hence also the value of the indicator-con- 
stant of any indicator, may be determined by observing in a 
colorimeter the colors displayed by the indicator in a graded 
series of solutions of known hydrogen-ion concentrations and 
noting in what solution the indicator displays the desired “‘trans- 
formation color.” A standard displaying this ‘transformation’ 
color” is prepared by superimposing a tube of a solution showing 
the “acid color” upon a tube showing the “alkaline color” the 
i ut thy sti depths of the solution in the two tubes being in the ratio i, 
Table XX XV shows the colors displayed by a number of indica- 
tors in solutions of varying hydrogen-ion concentration. With 
the aid of this table one can evidently ascertain roughly the 
values of the indicator-constant for these indicators and with a

set of these indicators the approximate value of the true acidity 
of a given solution could be determined from the above table. 
Problem 20.—Which of the indicators in Table XXXV show their 
“neutral color” in a solution which is actually neutral? A drop of phenol- 
phthalein added to a certain solution gives it a red color, but thymol- 
phthalein is colorless in the same solution. What is the hydrogen-ion 
concentration of the solution? 
Problem 21.—A solution is 0.01 molal with respect to acetic acid and 0.1 
molal with respect to sodium acetate. Will the solution react ‘“acid” 
or “alkaline” to (a) methyl orange, (b) methyl red, (c) litmus, (d) phenol- 
phthalein? 
Problem 22.—A 0.1n solution of methylamine hydrochloride gives a 
red-violet color with litmus and a yellow color with methyl red. Approxi- 
mately what is the ionization constant of methyl amine? A more careful 
investigation shows that with paranitrophenol the above solution gives a 
color which is identical with the color shown by the same indicator when 
5 per cent. of it is transformed into its salt. The indicator-constant for 
paranitrophenol is 9-10-.8 Calculate a more exact value for the ionization 
constant of methyl amine. 
In titrating a strong acid or base in a solution containing no 
other acids or bases the indicator employed should theoretically 
be one whose indicator function has the value 10-”._ Practically, 
however, almost any sensitive indicator can be employed in such 
a titration because the addition of the slightest excess of the 
standard solution produces a large change in the hydrogen-ion 
concentration of the solution. If the acid or base to be titrated 
is weak or if the solution contains weak electrolytes in addition 
to the strong electrolyte to be titrated, then the indicator 
chosen must be one whose “transformation color’’ is reached at 
the proper hydrogen-ion concentration. The following problems 
illustrate the application of the above principles in choosing 
indicators. For a more extensive and detailed treatment of 
the theory of indicators and their application to titrametric 
analysis the student should consult the paper of A. A. Noyes.* 
Problem 23.—A certain monobasic acid whose ionization constant is 
K, is to be titrated. What should be the value of the indicator function 
of the indicator employed in the titration, if the concentration of the salt 
in the solution at the end of the titration is Cs equivalents per liter? 
Problem 24.—The ionization constant of butyric acid is 15-10-°. What 
should be the value of the indicator function of the indicator employed in 
titrating this acid, if the solution is 0.1n at the end of the titration? If the 
“neutral color” of the indicator is taken as the “transformation color” 
in the titration, which of the indicators shown in Table XXXYV could be
-P-A-G-E-415
  Sze. 8] CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA 387 
employed? Which, if the solution at the end of the titration were only 
0.001 with respect to the salt? 
Problem 25.—A solution contains equivalent amounts of hydrochloric acid 
and two weak organic acids of ionization constants 3.2-10-* and 1-8-10-", 
respectively. It is desired to determine the concentration of each acid by 
titrating with standard NaOH solution. If at the end of each titration the 
volume of the solution is 1 liter, calculate the value which the indicator 
function should have for each titration. From the indicators shown in 
Table XXXV select the three which appear to be the most suitable for the 
purpose. Note that the choice of the indicator for the HCl titration will 
be determined by the degree of ionization of the first of the two weak acids, 
the choice of the indicator for titrating the second weak acid will be deter- 
mined by the degree of hydrolysis of the salt of this acid, while the choice of 
the indicator for titrating the first weak acid will be determined by a more 
complicated set of equilibria. Assume that about 0.08 equivalent of NaOH 
is required to titrate the HCl. 
Problem 26.—Calculate the value of the indicator function for each of 
the three indicators suitable for titrating in succession the three hydrogens 
of phosphoric acid, assuming that the solution is 0.1n with respect to the 
salt at the end of each titration. (See problem 18, above.) 
The accuracy with which the end point of a titration can be 
determined depends, other things being equal, upon the magni- 
tude of the change in hydrogen-ion concentration produced by the 
addition of one drop of the standard solution as the end point is 
approached. ‘This change is smaller, and the titration therefore 
less accurate, the weaker the acid or base which is being titrated. 
Problem 27.—Assuming that at the end of the titration of a strong acid 
the end point can be detected within one drop (0.03 ¢.c.) of the 0.1 solu- 
tion of NaOH employed, calculate in drops the sensitiveness of the end point 
when the acid to be titrated bas an ionization constant equal to (a) 10-4, 
(b) 10-8, (c) 10-8, (d) 10-1 and (e) 107%. Assume that the solution at the 
end of the titration has a volume of 1 liter and that it contains 0.1 equiva- 
lent of the salt. Assume also that the indicators employed are equally 
sensitive to a given relative change in the hydrogen-ion concentration of 
the solution. 
From problem 27 it is evident that when the base or acid to be 
tritated is very weak the error in estimating the end point with 
an indicator may become very large. In such cases it is prefer- 
able to determine the end point by measuring the conductivity 
of the solution.®

  CHAPTER XXIV 
THE PHASE RULE 
GENERAL 
1. Composition-number and Component-number.—Every 
physico-chemical system (I, 9) is composed of molecules of some 
kind or kinds and the composition of any phase (I, 9) in such a 
system may be expressed in terms either of the molecular frac- 
tions (II, 6, problem 1) or the per cents. by weight of the differ- 
ent molecular species which compose the phase. Consider any 
phase which has attained a state of equilibrium with its sur- 
roundings at a given temperature 7’ and pressure P. Let the 
phase be composed of the molecular species 81, S2, S3, . . . Sn 
In order that the composition of the phase shall be completely 
determined it is first necessary that the values of the molecular 
fractions (or per cents. by weight) of a certain minimum number 
of these molecular species shall be designated. The minimum 
number (but not the kind) of molecular species whose molecular 
fractions or per cents. by weight must be so designated before the 
composition of the phase is completely determined will be called 
the composition-number, n, of the phase. If the system under 
consideration contains more than one phase, then the composi- 
tion-number of the system will be defined as equal to the largest 
composition-number of any of the phases of the system. 
The following examples will help in making clear the sig- 
nificance of the term composition-number: 
(a) The condition of a phase containing only one species of 
molecule (pure gaseous argon, for example) is completely deter- 
mined when its pressure and temperature are given. No speci- 
fication regarding its composition is required since the per cent. 
of the given species of molecule can obviously have no value other 
than 100. The composition-number of any system containing 
only one species of molecule is therefore zero. 
388
-P-A-G-E-417
  
Suc. 1] THE PHASE RULE 389 
(6) A liquid consisting of a mixture of two pure substances 
(I, 2b) contains two molecular species and the molecular frac- 
tion or per cent. by weight of at least one of these species must be 
designated before the composition of the phase is determined. 
Its composition-number is therefore one. 
(c) Liquid water consists (XI, 2) of a number of different 
molecular species, H20, (H20)2, (H20);, H+, and OH-, all of 
which are in equilibrium with one another in such a way that, 
when the temperature and pressure are fixed, the molecular 
fraction of every species present is also fixed. The composition 
is thus completely fixed and determined by the temperature and 
pressure alone, no further information being required. The 
composition-number of the system is therefore zero. Note that 
when we say that the composition of the mixture called water 
is “completely determined” at a given temperature and pressure, 
we mean merely that there is only a single composition possible 
at that temperature and pressure. We do not mean to imply 
that the composition is actually known. 
(d) A gaseous phase prepared by bringing together hydrogen, 
water vapor and oxygen contains the molecular species Ho, 
Oz, H2O and doubtless others. At ordinary temperatures in the 
absence of a catalyst the hydrogen, oxygen, and water are not in 
chemical equilibrium with one another and before the composi- 
tion of the phase is completely determined it is necessary to 
state the molecular fraction or per cent. by weight of at least two 
of the molecular species. That is, either the per cent. of water 
and the per cent. of oxygen, or the per cent. of water and the per 
cent. of hydrogen, or the per cent. of hydrogen and the per cent. 
of oxygen must be given before the composition of a phase com- 
posed of all three substances is completely determined. The 
composition-number of the phase is therefore two. At sufficiently 
high temperatures or in the presence of a suitable catalyst, the 
hydrogen, oxygen and water enter into a chemical reaction and 
reach a state of equilibrium with respect to this reaction. Under 
such conditions the composition of the phase will be completely 
determined, if the molecular fraction or per cent. by weight of a 
single molecular species be designated. The molecular fractions 
of the other two species are then determined by the fact that they 
must be such that they will satisfy the equilibrium law expressed

390 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL.CHEMISTRY [Cnar. XXIV 
by equation (6, XXII) and at the same time fulfill the condition 
that the sum of the molecular fractions of all the species present 
must equal unity. The composition-number of the phase is 
therefore one. 
We thus see that a system composed of a given number and 
kind of molecular species may have different composition-num- 
bers according to whether certain chemical equilibria are or are 
not realized within the system, and since the realization or non- 
realization of a given chemical equilibrium is frequently depend- 
ent upon the time covered by the experiment, a given system 
might have one composition-number for experiments covering 
short periods of time and another composition-number for experi- 
ments lasting for much longer periods of time. The composi- 
tion-number of a system is, therefore, not in general a number 
whose value can be predicted in advance of all experimental in- 
vestigation of the system. In fact with respect to ultimate and 
most stable conditions of equilibrium the composition-number of 
any system would have to be taken as one less than the number 
of chemical elements in the system. In actual practice, how- 
ever, the value of the composition-number of a given system is 
almost invariably obtained by means of the relation, (to be 
derived below) 
N=P+F-3 () 
where F is: the number of variants (temperature, pressure and 
composition-percentages) which the system is found by actual 
experiment to possess when it contains P phases in equilibrium 
with one another under a given set of conditions. It is important 
that these facts with respect to the term composition-number 
should be clearly appreciated, as failure to do so is one of the 
common causes of error in applications of the phase rule. 
Problem 1.—What is the composition-number of a solution prepared by 
dissolving in water (a) sodium chloride; (6) acetic acid; (cj potassium nitrate 
and potassium chloride; (d) hydrogen; (e) potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate 
and potassium chloride; (f) potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, potassium 
chloride and sodium chloride. 
In most discussions involving the use of the phase rule it is 
customary to employ a quantity known as the component-num- 
ber of the system, in place of the quantity which we have defined
-P-A-G-E-419
  Src. 2] THE PHASE RULE 391 
above under the name composition-number of the system. By 
the term component-number of (usually called “number of 
components” of) a system is meant nothing more or less than 
simply a number which is greater by one than the composition- 
number of the system. It is, therefore, evidently quite immate- 
rial which of these numbers one chooses to employ in describing 
the character of the composition of a system. We shall find it 
convenient to make use of both numbers in what follows. 
2. Derivation of the Phase Rule.—The factors which deter- 
mine the conditions of equilibrium in any system are entirely 
independent of the relative or absolute amounts of the different 
phases present in the system and of the way in which these phases 
are distributed throughout the system, provided that no phase is 
present in an exceedingly fine state of subdivision. 
Let us consider a system having the composition-number n and 
the component-number c and containing P phases all in thermo- 
dynamic equilibirium with one another. Let the phases be 
numbered I, II, III . . . p. In any given phase the fugacities 
(XIV, 1) of all the molecular species will be determined as 
soon as the fugacities of c such species are determined and the 
fugacities of each of these c species will be determined by the 
temperature, the pressure and the composition of the phase, or in 
all by N + 2 independent variables. For example, for phase I we 
would have 
Dil = Te (Ey Mii ary Gees to a), (2) 
pai = fs) Uy daig@a ats, i |. Sut) (3) 
el ORD ag ee er oo a (4) 
and similarly for phase IT: 
pi a LU(P, , a", Gar; ae ane ts Bar) (5) 
pe = f20(P, T, a1", a2", ta". . . ty") (6) 
pel = f2(P, T, wr, aa", aa... ay) (2) 
and so on, for each of the p phases. There are evidently in- 
volved in these Pp sets of equations the two variables P and T, 
the same for all phases, and N molecular fractions and c fugacities 
for each phase, or altogether, (pc + pn + 2). variables. 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
  392 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuarv. XXIV 
Now except in the case of molecular species which resemble 
each other very closely (such as isotopes (1, 2c) or optical isomers 
(1, 2d) ), the c equations for any one phase will all be different and 
may, therefore, be treated as c entirely independent equations. 
We have then pc independent equations. In addition to the 
relationships expressed by these equations we have the fact 
that the fugacities of a given molecular species must, at equilib- 
rium, be the same in all the p phases. That is, 
pDi=plt=pm=...=o0 (8) 
pt = pl =p =... =p2 (9) 
Pd = Pt = pdt =... =pe (10) 
This gives us c(p — 1) additional equations, or altogether pc + 
c(e — 1) equations connecting the pc + pn + 2 variables. In 
order to solve these equations simultaneously it is necessary that 
the values of ¥ of the variables shall be known, where F is given 
by the relation 
F = number of variables — number of independent equations 
= (pc + pn + 2) — (pc + c(P — 1)) 
=P(N—c)+c+2 (11) 
But by definition (XXIV, 1), c=N+1 so that the above 
relation may be written 
P+F=Nn+3 (12) 
or p+r=c+2 (13) 
In the above derivation we assumed for the sake of generality 
that each of the c molecular species is present to some extent in 
every phase of the system. The result would be the same, how- 
ever, if this condition were not true. Thus, for example, if species 
2 were not present in phase I, we should have two less variables 
(pe' and 2") in our system. But we should have two less equa- 
tions also (equation (3) and one of the equations (9)), so that the 
expression for F would be the same as before. 
The relationship expressed by equations (12) and (13) is known 
as the Phase Rule and was first deduced by Willard Gibbs.*

-P-A-G-E-421
  Sxc. 2] THE PHASE RULE 393 
r, the number of variables whose values must be designated be- 
fore the condition of a system is completely determined, is called 
the “number of degrees of freedom” possessed by the system. 
Problem 2.—If F is never negative, what is the maximum number of 
phases which could exist in equilibrium with one another in a system pre- 
pared by bringing together, at ordinary temperatures, water, argon, sodium 
chloride, silver chloride, and ammonia. What would be the character of a 
one-component (i.e. N = 0) system for which r= 2? In general what is 
the physical significance of negative degrees of freedom? 
In using the Phase Rule as expressed by equation (12) or (13) 
the following facts, which were assumed in deriving it, should 
always be borne in mind. 
(1) All phases present in the system must be under the same 
pressure. 
(2) No phase must be present in such a fine state of subdivi- 
sion that the fugacity of any molecular species contained in it is 
appreciably influenced by forces of the nature of surface tension. 
(3) Aside from composition no variables other than pressure 
and temperature shall be allowed to influence the system or any 
of its phases. This excludes such influences as electrostatic or 
electromagnetic fields, variations in the character or amount of 
radiant energy which falls on the system, the effect of gravita- 
tion, etc. If it is desired to consider the effects of variations in 
such variables, the Phase Rule can be extended so as to include 
them, but equation (13) was derived on the assumption that such 
influences are absent. 
(4) A system composed of isotopes, or in general any system 
in which the fugacity equation of one of the molecular species in 
each phase was identical with the fugacity equation of each of 
the other molecular species in that phase, would, as long as this 
condition remained true, apparently behave toward pressure and 
temperature changes like a system with the component-number 
one, because instead of having c independent fugacity equations 
for each phase we would have only one such equation. Thus, 
for example, the vapor pressure of a mixture of two optical iso- 
mers in the liquid state may be determined solely by the tem- 
perature, being independent of the percentage composition of 
the liquid phase. 
According to the number of degrees of freedom which they
-P-A-G-E-422
394 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXIV 
possess and irrespective of their chemical composition or 
physical condition, physico-chemical systems may be classed 
as either nonvariant, monovariant, divariant, trivariant, or 
tetravariant, etc. 
ONE-COMPONENT SYSTEMS 
3. The Phase Rule Diagram for a One-component System.— 
The condition of a system whose composition-number is zero 
(and whose component-number is therefore one) is completely 
determined by two variables only, the temperature and the 
pressure, and hence all the relations involved in the Phase Rule 
for such a system can be displayed graphically on a two-co-ordi- 
nate diagram which is called the P-T' diagram. 
For a one-component system the Phase Rule (equation 12) 
becomes 
p+r=3 (14) 
and, if p=1,r=2. That is, before the condition of the system 
is completely determined both its temperature and its pressure 
must be specified and, within the limits of the existence of the 
phase, both quantities may be fixed arbitrarily. Such a con- 
dition is evidently represented graphically by a surface, and 
any system which possesses two degrees of freedom is said to 
be divariant. All one-component homogeneous systems are, 
therefore, divariant and will be represented on the diagram by 
surfaces. 
If p = 2, equation (14) gives r= 1. That is, the value of 
only one of the variables, either the temperature or the pressure, 
can be fixed arbitrarily. The value of the other variable is 
determined by the system itself. A system possessing only one 
degree of freedom is said to be monovariant and is evidently 
represented graphically by a curve. All one-component systems 
of two phases are, therefore, represented by curves on the P-T 
diagram. 
If p = 3, equation (14) gives F = 0. A system possessing no 
degree of freedom is said to be nonvariant and will evidently be 
represented by a point. Every one-component system of three 
phases will therefore be represented on the P-T' diagram by a 
point which is called a triple point.
-P-A-G-E-423
  Suc. 4] THE PHASE RULE 395 
With this general analysis of the way in which phase relations 
are represented graphically the student should be able to inter- 
pret any phase-rule diagram for a one-component system. As an 
example of such a diagram we shall consider the one representing 
the system water.

each area represents. With this information and the scales of 
pressure and temperature indicated along the axes of the ordi- 
nates and abscisse respectively, the behavior of the system 
throughout the whole pressure and temperature range covered by 
the diagram is clearly displayed. 
In all the diagrams given in this book the following conven- 
tions will be employed. A full heavy line will indicate a stable

covered by the line. <A dotted line will be used to represent a 
metastable univariant system which has been studied throughout 
the range covered by the line. A light-weight line (whose posi- 
tion is estimated) will be used to represent a univariant system in 
a region where no actual measurements on the system have been 
made. By a metastable system is meant one which is in a super- 
cooled or superheated condition (IV, 10). 
Problem 3.—What are the possible nonvariant and the possible mono- 
variant systems composed of water in the region covered by Fig. 55? Why 
is the triple point not located exactly at 0°? (Cf. II, 5, and XXII, 11.) 
Problem 4.—Show with the aid of the Second Law of thermodynamics 
that the portion of the vapor pressure curve of a liquid which lies below the 
freezing point (.¢., the metastable portion) must always lie above the vapor 
pressure curve of the crystals. In a similar way it may be shown that the 
prolongation of any curve beyond a triple point must lie between the other 
two curves which meet at that point. 
Problem 5.—Take up in succession each one of the numbered dots in Fig. 
55. What is the condition of the system at the point represented by the 
dot? If the heat content of the system be (1) increased continuously and 
(2) decreased continuously at constant pressure, describe (as far as possible 
from the diagram) the phase changes which will take place within the sys- 
tem, stating the temperature at which each change occurs. Give a similar 
description of the phase changes which will occur if the pressure on the sys- 
tem be continuously (1) lowered and (2) raised at constant temperature. 
Assume that the system remains in a condition of stable equilibrium through- 
out. 
(b) Water at High Pressures.—Fig. 55 covers a compara- 
tively small range of temperature and pressure. At higher 
temperatures we know that the vapor pressure curve of liquid 
water keeps on rising until it comes to an end at the critical 
point (IV, 7) and the vapor pressure curve for ice probably 
decreases continuously and becomes zero at the absolute zero. 
The course of the ice-liquid curve, however, which seems to 
rise vertically with increasing pressure, offers some interesting 
possibilities. Does it continue to rise indefinitely or do new 
phases eventually appear? This interesting question has been 
answered by the researches of Tammann® and of Bridgman,’

being called Ice I. The regions of existence of these new kinds 
of ice are indicated on the diagram. Note that ice II has no

point curve of ice VI slopes to the right. This is the normal

Two-coMPONENT SysTEMS 
6. Space Models.—For -a two-component system the Phase 
Rule gives r = 4 — P and the maximum value which F can have 
is evidently three. Hence for the complete graphic represen- 
tation of a two-component system, three coordinates will be 
required and three axes at right angles to one another, repre- 
senting respectively pressure, temperature, and composition, are 
usually employed for this purpose. Space models constructed 
in this way, while giving the most complete representation of 
the phase relations in a two-component system, are not well 
adapted for representation on the printed page, and it is therefore 
more convenient to discuss two-component systems with the aid 
of the various two-coordinate diagrams which are obtained by 
cutting sections from the space model of the system perpendicular 
to one of the axes. There will evidently be three groups of such 
diagrams, the P-7 diagrams, the P-C diagrams, and the T-C 
diagrams, respectively. The P-T and the T-C diagrams are 
usually the most important ones, and of the various T-C sections 
which might be cut from the space model, the one corresponding 
to P = one atmosphere is in most cases the only one which has 
been experimentally investigated. We shall take up a few typical 
examples of such diagrams. 
7. Vapor Pressures of Salt Hydrates.—A considerable number 
of different crystalline phases are frequently formed in a system 
composed of water and a salt. Thus, for example, stable crystals 
having the following compositions can be obtained, under suitable 
conditions, from a system composed of water and ferric chloride: 
H.O, FeCls, FeCls-2H.0, FeCls-21¢H.O, FeCl;314H,O, and 
FeCl;-6H,O. Let us consider first the P-7' diagrams of the 
different crystal-vapor systems which can be formed from the 
above phases. With the aid of the Phase Rule and the principle 
governing chemical equilibrium in heterogeneous systems (XXII, 
8), the behavior of two-component crystal-vapor systems under 
equilibrium conditions can be easily predicted, as will be seen 
from the solution of the following problems. 
26
-P-A-G-E-430
402 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXIV 
Problem 13.—If the presence of the liquid phase be excluded, what are 
the possible divariant and the possible monovariant systems which can 
be prepared from water and ferric chloride? Is it possible for crystals of 
FeCl;-314 HO to exist in equilibrium with water vapor at more than one 
pressure at a given temperature? 
Problem 14.—A mass of crystals having the composition FeCl;6-H,O 
is placed in a cylinder provided with a frictionless piston, and the initial 
pressure upon the piston is made so great that there is no vapor phase in 
the cylinder. Suppose now that the pressure on the piston be very gradually 
reduced to zero, the temperature remaining constant at 5° C. If values of 
the pressure and corresponding values of the volume of the system be 
plotted on cross-section paper as ordinates and abscisse respectively, what 
will be the general character of the diagram obtained? Assume that condi- 
tions of stable equilibrium are maintained in the system throughout the 
experiment and that the temperature is low enough to avoid any liquifaction. 
Problem 15.—Crystals having the composition CaCl,6H,O are obtained 
by cooling an aqueous solution. After drying the crystals as far as possible 
with the aid of a centrifuge, it is desired to remove the last remaining traces 
of adherent water by passing a current of air through and over the mass of 
crystals spread out in a long tube. What condition must be fulfilled in 
order that the dried crystals shall have the composition CaCl.-6H,0? 
What would be the easiest and most certain method for producing this 
condition? 
Problem 16.—Under what condition will a crystal (a) deliquesce; (6) 
effloresce, when exposed to the air? 
8. Freezing-Point Diagrams.—If the pressure on a two- com- 
ponent system be kept constant at such a value that the vapor 
phase never appears in the system, we have only two variables 
at our disposal, temperature and composition. ‘The composition 
may be expressed as the mole fraction or per cent. by weight of 
any molecular species present in the system, or it may also be 
expressed in terms of the per cent. by weight of any one of the 
chemical substances from which we choose to consider the system 
to be prepared, the term chemical substance, in this connection, 
being understood to mean any material which behaves like a one- 
component system. A temperature-composition diagram of this 
kind is much used in the phase-rule treatment of metallurgical 
systems and has many advantages. 
Instead of making the composition of the whole system one 
of our variables in the diagram we may take in its place the com- 
position of one of the phases. This is a common practice in the 
case of aqueous solutions in equilibrium with crystalline phases. 
Such a diagram is called a freezing-point-solubility diagram and

the nature of the diagram for a very simple system has already 
. been discussed (XIV, 12, Figs. 32 and 33). We shall now proceed 
to a consideration of the more complicated freezing-point- 
solubility diagram which is obtained when the two constituents 
from which the system is prepared form a series of crystalline 
compounds with each other. 
Examples of such diagrams for systems composed of a salt and 
water’are shown in Figs. 60 to 62. In these figures the ordinates

the salt in the solution. Any point in the area above and to the 
left of the set of curves represents a one-phase system, namely, 
a solution having the composition and temperature indicated by 
the coordinates of the point. Since we have agreed to keep the 
pressure constant, a solution represents a divariant system. Any 
point on one of the curves represents a monovariant system, a

in equilibrium with a crystalline phase of the nature indicated 
by the label on the curve. Points in the region below and to the 
right of the set of curves have obviously no meaning as far as 
stable systems are concerned, but for metastable systems 
(.e., supercooled solutions) they would have the same signifi- 
cance as points above the curves. The conventions with regard 
to the use of full and of dotted lines, etc., described above (XXIV, 
4a), apply also to these figures. We shall now proceed to con- 
sider in detail some of the principal features of these diagrams. 
9. Eutectic Points and Melting Points of Compounds.— 
Suppose we start with pure water in equilibrium with a large 
excess of ice, and gradually add crystals of FeCl; to the system. 
These will dissolve in the liquid water and the freezing point of 
the solution formed will fall gradually and continuously as 
shown by the ice curve in Fig. 60. When a temperature of 
—55° is reached the further addition of FeCl; to the system 
will not cause a further lowering of the temperature, but instead 
a second crystalline phase, having the composition FeCl;-6H20, 
will make its appearance, and since we now have three phases 
the system becomes nonvariant. This temperature, at which 
the ice and the crystalline hydrate, FeCl;-6H.O, are both in 
equilibrium with the solution, is evidently a eutectic temperature 
(XIV, 12). After the appearance of this crystalline hydrate, if 
heat be abstracted from the system, the whole solution will 
solidify at constant temperature into a mechanical mixture of 
ice crystals and hydrate crystals in the proportions indicated 
by the abscissa of the eutectic point. 
Starting now at the eutectic point and having present a large 
excess of the hydrate crystals let us add heat to thesystem. The 
ice will gradually disappear and finally we shall be left with a two- 
phase system consisting of the solution and the hydrate crystals. 
If we continue to add heat, the temperature of the system 
will rise and more and more ferric chloride will pass into solu- 
tion. The variation of composition with temperature is indicated 
by the curve labeled 6ag in the figure. This is the solubility 
eurve for the hydrate, FeCl;-6H.O. Eventually the solution 
will attain the composition 60 per cent. FeCl; and 40 per cent. 
water. As indicated by the figure, a solution of this composi- 
tion is in equilibrium with crystals of the hydrate at a tempera-

  Suc. 10] THE PHASE RULE 405 
ture of 37°, which is the highest point on the solubility curve. 
The composition of the hydrate crystals is also 60 per cent. 
FeCl; and 40 per cent. water, so that this temperature is the 
melting point of these crystals. If to a system composed of 
crystals of FeCl;-6H,O and their melt we add either FeCl; or 
H.O, we should lower the freezing point (Cf. XI, 8) of the 
liquid. This is shown in the figure by the falling away of the 
curve on both sides of the temperature 37°. The addition of 
water would cause the freezing point to fall until the eutectic 
point —55° was reached once more. The addition of FeCl,, 
however, would cause the freezing point to fall until the tem- 
perature 27.4° was reached. Here a second crystalline hydrate 
having the composition FeCl;-314H,0 makes its appearance, 
and our system again becomes nonvariant at this new eutectic 
point. 
The rest of the diagram will now be easily understood. There 
are evidently five stable eutectic points at the temperatures — 55°, 
27.4°, 30.0°, 55.0°, and 66.0° respectively. One metastable 
eutectic point at the temperature 15° has also been realized 
experimentally. There are also four melting points of pure 
compounds shown, namely, FeCl;6H2O at 37.0°, FeCl;-314— 
HO at 32.5°, FeCls-214H20 at 56°, and FeCls;-2H2O at 73.5°. 
The shape of the solubility curve in the neighborhood of the melt- 
ing point of a compound indicates in a general way the extent 
to which the compound is broken up into its constituents in the 
melt. A curve with a very flat peak shows a high degree of 
dissociation in the melt,while a sharp peak shows that the crystals 
of the compound melt practically without decomposition. 
10. Transition Points.—The freezing-point-solubility diagram 
for the system water-zinc-chloride is shown in Fig. 61. The 
solubility curves for four crystalline hydrates appear on the 
diagram. Let us consider first the solubility curve for the hy- 
drate ZnCle4H.O. Starting at the eutectic point, —62°, and 
gradually raising the temperature, the amount of zine chloride 
in the solution increases as shown by the curve, and at a tem- 
perature of about —29.4° the composition of the solution would 
become the same as that of the crystals and this temperature 
would therefore be the melting point of the hydrate. Before 
this temperature is reached, however, a new crystalline hydrate,
-P-A-G-E-434
TT a NE eT ee oe eee eee 
406 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXIV 
ZnCly3H,0, makes its appearance in the system, and since we 
now have three phases the system becomes nonvariant. The 
temperature, —30°, at which this occurs is called a transition 
point. If we should continue to add heat to the system at this 
point, the reaction 
ZnCl-4H20 = ZnClo-3H.0 + HO (15) 
would take place and the temperature would remain perfectly 
constant until all of the higher hydrate had decomposed, and

we should be left with the monovariant system made up of the 
solution and crystals of the hydrate, ZnCle-3H,0. If the lower 
hydrate should fail to appear when the temperature —30° was 
reached, we might succeed in carrying the system up to the melt- 
ing point of the higher hydrate, but the system would then 
evidently be in a metastable condition. Of the remaining 
hydrates shown in this diagram, evidently only the one having 
the formula ZnCl214H.0 has a stable melting point, In

although the range of existence of the hydrate, ZnCl2H.0, is 
very short. In Fig. 62 is shown an interesting system in which 
there are four crystalline hydrates, no one.of which has any 
range of stable existence (at any rate under atmospheric pres- 
sure), the solubility curves being located entirely within the 
metastable region. Moreover, it will be noticed that the solu- 
bility of the anhydrous salt decreases rapidly with rising tem- 
perature. This is also true of the solubilities of three of the 
hydrates. No transition points, no melting points of compounds,

and no eutectic points have been actually observed with this 
| system, although the approximate positions of several such

Problem 18.—With the aid of Fig. 61 describe the character and range 
of existence of each of the (a) nonvariant, (6) monovariant and (c) divariant 
stable and metastable systems which can be produced from ZnCl, and H,0. 
Problem 19.—Describe the character and condition of each of the solu- 
tions represented by the numbered dots in Fig. 61. Describe in each in- 
stance the changes which may take place (1) if heat be continuously ab- 
stracted from the system and (2) if a current of dry air be passed con- 
tinuously through the thoroughly stirred system at constant temperature. 
Problem 20.—The same as problems 18 and 19, using Fig. 62. 
Problem 21.—Explain the action of a mixture of ice and common salt as 
a freezing mixture. What determines the lowest temperature attainable 
with a freezing mixture? 
12. Mixed Crystals and “Solid Solutions.’—In the tem- 
perature-composition diagrams shown in Figs. 60 to 62 the com- 
position of only the liquid phase was subject to continuous 
variation. The different crystalline phases all had constant 
compositions. In some two-component systems, however, the 
crystals deposited on cooling a solution contain both constituents 
in continuously varying proportions, that is, the two constituents 
of the system are miscible in the

two curves, one curve to repre- 
sent the compositions of the liquid solutions and another curve 
to represent the compositions of the crystalline solutions which 
at the various temperatures are in equilibrium with each other. 
Diagrams of this character are shown in Figs. 63 to 65. The 
full line is the curve for the liquid solution and the long-dash 
line the curve for the crystalline solution. Evidently the field
-P-A-G-E-437
  Suc. 13] THE PHASE RULE 409 
above the curves represents liquid solutions and the field below 
the curves, crystalline solutions. The field between the curves 
has no meaning as far as stable systems are concerned, but any 
point in this field might of course represent a supercooled liquid 
solution. It is usually not possible to swperheat crystals. 
The upper curve may be called the crystallization-point curve 
and the lower curve the melting-point curve for the system. It 
is evident from Figs. 63, 64 and 65 that the crystallization 
temperature of a liquid is sometimes raised and sometimes

As a general rule, the crystallization temperature is raised 
when the mole fraction of the “dissolved substance” is greater 
in the crystals which separate than it is in the liquid solution 
which is in equilibrium with them, and vice versa. 
Problem 22.—Describe the character of the system represented by each 
of the dots in Figs. 63, 64 and 65. Describe fully in each case the changes 
which will take place, if heat be gradually (1) added to and (2) abstracted 
from the system. 
Problem 23.—A solution represented by each of the dots in the upper 
part of Figs. 63, 64 and 65 is subjected to fractional crystallization. What 
will be the character of the two fractions finally obtained in each instance? 
(See XIV, 22.) 
13. Systems Containing Two Liquid Phases of Variable 
Composition.—Evidently whenever a two-component system con- 
tains two non-miscible solutions, whatever be the state of aggre- 
gation of these solutions, the temperature-composition diagram 
for the system must contain two curves in order that the variation

be displayed. Systems in which one of the solutions is liquid and 
the other crystalline have just been discussed. Examples of 
similar diagrams for systems in which two liquid solutions appear 
are shown in Figs. 66 and 67.

14, The Preparation of a Temperature-Composition Diagram. 
Cooling Curves.—In order to construct the temperature-com- 
position diagram for a given two-component system at constant 
pressure it is necessary to determine, at a sufficient number of 
different temperatures, the compositions of both phases in all 
of the two-phase systems formed. The most accurate method

method is no longer practicable. In the case of systems (such 
as the silicates) which give liquids so viscous that supercooling to 
a glass can be brought about without shift of equilibrium, the 
quenching method is applicable. In this method the “charge” 
is kept at a known high temperature until equilibrium is attained 
and then suddenly quenched in water or other suitable liquid

and when cold examined microscopically in order to identify the 
phases present. 
If the viscosity is low enough to permit the equilibrium to 
keep up with a reasonably rapid rate of cooling, a quicker me- 
thod, applicable to any temperature range and sufficiently exact 
for many purposes, is used extensively in the study of alloys. 
This method, known as the method of “thermal analysis,’’ is 
based upon the character of the cooling curves obtained with 
liquid mixtures of varying compositions. If we start with a eS: bw

two-component liquid system and allow it to cool slowly, pre- 
ferably with constant stirring, the curve obtained by plotting 
temperature against time is called the cooling curve of the mixture. 
As long as the system contains only the one liquid phase the 
cooling curve will be a smooth, continuous curve. If a second 
phase of different composition than the liquid phase appears, 
the cooling curve will show a sudden change in direction (a 
“break’’), because as the temperature continues to fall the 
composition of the liquid will change continuously. If the new 
phase has the same composition as the liquid phase the tem- 
perature will remain perfectly constant (a “halting point’’)

for a period, while the liquid phase is completely transformed 
into the new phase. If at any temperature three phases coexist, 
the system becomes nonvariant and a halting point will also 
be obtained and will continue until one of the phases disappears.

the composition of the liquid phases of the system. In such a

When a mixture of crystalline materials, represented by any 
point in the lower part of the diagram, is slowly heated, liquifac- 
tion will always begin as soon as the eutectic temperature lying 
above the field of the point is reached and this will be true regard-

Although the temperature at which liquifaction begins is inde-

pendent of the composition of the material heated, for all ma- 
terials lying between any two vertical lines of the diagram, the 
amount of the material which will be melted at the eutectic 
temperature depends upon its composition. Thus if the ma- 
terial has the eutectic composition it will all melt as soon as the 
eutectic temperature is reached.

Sxe. 17] THE PHASE RULE 421 
Space models for three component systems ordinarily show only 
the liquidus surface. If it is desired to show the transformations 
undergone by the crystalline phases after complete solidification, 
transparent materials or wire models must be employed. The 
manufacture of such models is described by Rosenhain.* (Journ. 
Inst. Met., 23, 247 (1920)).

17. Complex Diagrams.—The complete phase-rule diagram 
for a system requires for its representation c + 1 coordinates. 
As the component-number of the system increases, the diagrams 
which must be employed to represent the phase relations in the 
system become exceedingly complex and numerous. The con- 
sideration of systems with component-numbers larger than 3 
is beyond the scope of this book, and for the treatment of such 
systems as well as for discussions of many interesting cases 
met with in two- and three-component systems, which we have 
been obliged to omit entirely, the student is referred to special 
treatises dealing with the Phase Rule. Findlay’s’ The Phase 
Rule and Its Applications and Bancroft’s The Phase Rule may 
be especially recommended. The methods of ‘thermal analysis”’ 
as applied to the study of alloys are well presented by Ruer? in 
his The Elements of Metallography, and the subject of aqueous 
salt solutions forms the topic of Janecke’s* Gesdttigte Salzlésungen 
vom Standpunkt der Phasenlehre. The most exhaustive and 
authoritative work on the Phase Rule is Roozeboom’s* Die

    CHAPTER XXV 
DISPERSE SYSTEMS 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CLASSIFICATION OF DISPERSE 
SysTEMs 
1. Disperse Systems and the Phase Rule.—If we imagine 
any phase within a given system to be gradually broken up into 
smaller and smaller particles, then as the size of these particles 
gradually decreases the surface of contact between this phase and 
its neighbors will correspondingly increase and the effects of 
forees of the nature of surface tension (III, 3) will gradually 
become more apparent, and these surface forces will eventually 
begin to be an important factor in determining the fugacities 
of the molecular species composing the system. Whenever 
this situation exists to an appreciable extent in any instance, 
we have what is called a disperse system! or a dispersoid, and the 
Phase Rule in the form derived and discussed in the preceding 
chapter is no longer applicable to the system. (See XXIV, 2.) 
The influence of these surface forces is usually entirely inappre- 
ciable, however, unless the particles of the dispersed phase are 
of microscopic or submicroscopic dimensions, or unless the dis- 
persed phase constitutes a relatively large proportion of the 
system. 
The varied and peculiar properties and behavior displayed 
by disperse systems, which distinguish these important systems 
from the ordinary non-dispersed or aggregated systems, are due 
to the relatively enormous surface possessed by the dispersed 
phase. The degree of dispersion of a dispersed phase is usually 
defined as the ratio of its surface to its volume, or in other words, 
it is the surface exposed by 1 c.c. of the dispersed material. 
Problem 1.—What is the degree of dispersion of gold in a colloidal solu- 
tion of the metal made up of spherical particles 3 uu in diameter? What 
is the degree of dispersion of 1 gram of gold in the form of a sphere? Com- 
pare the two. (See problem 2, IX.) 
1 More properly a dispersed system. 
422
-P-A-G-E-451
  
Sec. 2] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 423 
The “‘colloidal solutions” described in Chapter [X are examples 
of disperse systems. Certain kinds of true solutions (that is, 
molecularly dispersed solutions, Cf. XI, 1) in which one of the 
constituents is a substance of very high molecular weight (Cf. 
problem 9b, XIV) frequently display many of the characteristics 
of disperse heterogeneous systems and are for this reason usually 
classified with them for purposes of systematic treatment. 
2. One-component Disperse Systems.—A system composed 
of a fine mist of liquid water suspended in water vapor is an ex- 
ample of a one-component disperse system. Such a system is 
a divariant instead of a monovariant one, however (Cf. problem 
3, XXIV), because the vapor pressure of a liquid in the form of 
small droplets is not determined by the temperature alone, but 
depends also upon the diameter of the drops. The smaller the 
drops, the higher will be their vapor pressure. A pure liquid 
in the form of a fine mist or cloud is therefore a metastable 
(XXIV, 4) system since the small drops have a higher vapor 
pressure than the larger ones, and hence the latter tend to grow 
gradually at the expense of the former, until they attain such a 
size that the influence of surface tension upon vapor pressure 
becomes inappreciable. 
If the individual drops in a fine mist are charged with an 
electric charge, as would be the case if they were produced by 
condensation in an ionized gas (I, 2h), the presence of the charge 
will lower the vapor pressure of the drop, and since also the 
coalescence of the drops by mutual collisions is hindered by the 
electrical repulsion existing between them, such a mist may per- 
sist for a considerable length of time. The presence of electrical 
charges on colloidal particles is a common phenomenon which is 
largely responsible for the comparative stability of many disperse 
systems. 
Not only is the vapor pressure of a substance in the dispersed 
condition different from its vapor pressure in the form of large 
aggregates, but its melting point, its chemical activity and 
many other properties are also different. The difference is of 
course only one of degree, however, not one of kind, the variation 
in the magnitude of any given property with increasing degree 
of dispersion being a perfectly gradual one. The curve showing 
the relation between any given property and the degree of dis-

    424 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
persion will have the same general form as the one mentioned 
in the following problem. 
Problem 2.—With the aid of the Second Law of thermodynamics the 
following expression for the rate of change of the vapor pressure (p) of a 
drop of liquid with the radius (r) of the drop can be derived: 
(22) ae Ve (1) 
Or) 7 (vo — Vo)r® 
where y is the surface tension of the liquid, V, its molal volume and v, 
the molal volume of the vapor. Show that if the vapor is a perfect gas and 
7 is a constant, the integral of this equation is practically 
RT log. 2 = 27Vo 
Pa T (2) 
where pa is the vapor pressure of the liquid in the aggregated or non-dis- 
persed condition (i.e, where r= ©). Calculate the vapor pressure of 
water at 0° in the form of small drops when the radius of the drops is (a) 
10-1, (b). 10-2, (c) 10-8 (d) 10-4, (e) 10-5 and (f) 10-* mm. respectively. 
(See problem 1, III, and Fig. 56 for additional data.) Construct a curve 
on cross-section paper showing the relation between the vapor pressure of 
water and its degree of dispersion. What effect will a variation of the con- 
stant have upon the curve? 
Problem 3.—An air bubble in water has the volume 0.01 c.c. under 
atmospheric pressure. What is the pressure inside the bubble. The 
bubble is divided into n bubbles of equal volumes and the pressure on the 
inside of each bubble becomes two atmospheres. Calculate n. 
8. Classification of Disperse Systems with Reference to the 
Nature of the Contact Surface.—Disperse systems may be 
grouped into the following four classes and subclasses in accord- 
ance with the nature of the phases in contact: 
I. Contact surface, gas-liquid. (a) A liquid dispersed in a 
gas. Examples: mist, fog, clouds, and spray. (b) A gas dis- 
persed in a liquid. Examples: foam, suds, and lather. 
II. Contact surface, gas-crystal. (a) Crystals dispersed in a 
gas. Examples: smoke, dust, and fumes of various kinds. (0) 
A gas dispersed in a crystal. Example: certain solid foams. 
ITI. Contact surface, liquid-liquid. Examples: emulsions of 
one liquid in another. Milk is an emulsion of fats in water. 
IV. Contact surface, crystal-liquid. Crystals dispersed in a 
liquid. A large number of the colloidal solutions and suspensions 
familiar to the chemist are of this character.
-P-A-G-E-453
  
Suc. 4] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 425 
The last two classes of disperse systems are the most important 
ones and have received the greatest amount of attention from 
investigators. The discussion of disperse systems in the follow- 
ing pages will be restricted almost entirely to these two classes 
of systems. 
4, The Phenomenon of Adsorption.— When any solid material 
is brought into contact with a gas or a liquid, the surface layer 
of the solid dissolves or adsorbs some of each of the constituents 
of the gas or liquid with which it is brought into contact. The 
amount of adsorption in any given case is directly proportional 
to the area of the contact surface, but the proportionality 
constant is a specific constant characteristic of the chemical 
nature and physical condition of the two phases in contact. 
Evidently a highly dispersed material may exhibit a very large 
adsorbing power owing to the enormous surface exposed. 
A common example of adsorption is the behavior of finely 
divided porous charcoal in taking up large quantities of gases. 
This property is sometimes made use of in producing high vacua. 
For this purpose a bulb containing cocoanut charcoal is sealed 
to the vessel which it is desired to exhaust. The bulb is first 
heated to expel the gases already adsorbed in the pores of the 
charcoal and then, after closing the vessel and allowing the tube 
containing the charcoal to cool, a tube containing liquid air 
is brought up around the bulb of charcoal which will then adsorb 
practically all of the gas contained in the vessel. A vacuum as 
high as 0.001 mm. of Hg may be conveniently obtained in this 
way without the aid of any pump. Charcoal was employed ex- 
tensively during the war as the active agent in the masks worn 
by the soldiers as protection against poison gas attacks. The 
use of powdered or animal charcoal in decolorizing solutions is 
another instance of its high adsorptive power. 
Whenever a precipitate is produced in a solution it always 
carries down with it by adsorption some of the constituents of 
the solution, and in nearly all colloidal solutions the dispersed 
phase contains adsorbed material on the surface of the colloidal 
particles. The phenomenon of adsorption is in fact a very 
general and important one. (Cf. XXI, 10.) 
5. Adsorption Equilibrium.—When any freshly prepared, finely 
divided substance (charcoal, or filter paper, or precipitated ferric
-P-A-G-E-454
  426 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
hydroxide, for example) is shaken with a solution or a gas, it 
adsorbs a certain amount of each of the substances present in 
the solution or gas, and finally reaches a state of adsorption 
equilibrium analogous to the distribution equilibirum in the case 
of two immiscible solutions (XIV, 5). We have already dis- 
cussed to some extent the mechanism of adsorption in connection 
with surface solutions (XIII, 5, XIV, 16-18) and contact cata- 
lysis (XXI, 18) and have seen that in the case of plane surfaces 
in contact with gases at pressures much below the saturation 
pressure, the adsorbed layer will in general be only one molecule 
deep. The relation connecting the amount of material adsorbed 
per square cm. of adsorbent and the concentration of the adsorbed 
material in the surrounding medium will depend largely upon 
the mechanism of the particular adsorption process and since 
these processes exhibit as great a degree of complexity as chemical 
reactions and solution processes, no general relation between 
these two quantities is to be expected. 
Two rather simple classes of cases may, however, be dis- 
tinguished. In one of these the adsorption process is character- 
ized by the formation of a relatively stable adsorption compound 
between the molecules on the surface layer of the adsorbent 
and the molecules of the adsorbed material. For this case 
Langmuir! has shown that we should expect from kinetic con- 
siderations that at very low concentrations, much below the 
saturation value, the surface concentration of the adsorbed 
material will be proportional to some small integral power or root 
of the concentration in the surrounding medium, the particular 
power or root depending, just as in an ordinary chemical equili- 
brium, upon the formula of the adsorption compound formed. 
Another comparatively simple case of adsorption would be 
one in which the adsorbed film is of the nature of a surface 
solution uncomplicated by the formation of adsorption com- 
pounds, that is, the adsorbed material “dissolves” in the surface 
layer, but the process of solution does not extend further. The 
fact that the solution is confined to the surface layer is sufficiently 
explained by the rigidity of the adsorbent which prevents free 
diffusion through it. Even if this bar to free diffusion did not 
exist the solution might still, in certain cases, be confined to the 
surface layer, for reasons discussed in Section 5, Chapter XIII.
-P-A-G-E-455
  Suc. 5] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 427 
In either case it is evident that we should expect the surface 
* concentration (or more generally the surface mole-fraction) of 
the adsorbed material to be proportional to its mole fraction 
in the surrounding medium (Cf. this with the Nernst Distribution 
Law XIV, 5) for “Ideal” or “dilute” surface solutions. As 
the concentration in the surrounding medium increases the 
amount adsorbed would probably eventually increase more 
slowly than the proportionality law requires until finally the 
surface film becomes saturated with the adsorbed material (Cf. 
XIII, 5 and XIV, 18). If the surface film is saturated, then 
further increase in concentration in the surrounding medium 
can produce no increase in the amount adsorbed, until this 
concentration has reached a point where a second layer begins 
to form on top of the first one. Such a layer would be held 
partially by the force of attraction of the adsorbent molecules, 
which might in some cases extend beyond the first layer, and 
partially by the attractions of the adsorbed molecules for others 
of their own kind, that is, by forces of attraction similar to those 
which would exist in the liquified or crystallized adsorbed 
material. 
As the concentration in the surrounding medium continues to 
increase, additional adsorbed layers will form, but each succeed- 
ing layer will probably be held by gradually weakening forces as 
the layers increase in number. Each successive increment of 
concentration in the surrounding medium will now produce 
successively smaller increments in the amount adsorbed until 
the number of adsorbed layers becomes so great that the attrac- 
tive force of the adsorbent is inappreciable and succeeding layers 
can only be held by the attractions of the adsorbed molecules 
for each other. There will thus gradually be produced a kind 
of liquid film (the ‘‘wetting film”’), each layer of which is pulled 
down and consequently compressed more than the layer im- 
mediately above it until finally the upper layers will be subjected 
only to the normal internal pressure of the liquid in question. 
The film of water which remains on a glass rod after dipping it 
in the liquid and allowing it to drain completely must evidently 
be of this character. If the temperature of experiment is below 
the freezing point of the substance, we should expect the film 
which is formed to be typically crystalline in its upper layers
-P-A-G-E-456
ye en rrr rn eee 
428 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
becoming more and more amorphous or modified in crystalline 
structure as the adsorbent is approached, owing to the disturbance 
of the crystalline forces by the force fields of molecules of the ad- 
sorbent. 
In the case of a gas, as the pressure approaches the saturation 
pressure liquification will begin considerably below the normal 
saturation pressure, if the adsorbent is a porous material, such 
as charcoal, and if the liquid “wets” the absorbent. This

capillary condensation takes place in such a way that the smallest 
pores become filled with liquid first, the larger pores being filled 
after normal saturation pressure is attained. (Cf. Probs. 2 and 
3 above.) 
The above description of the adsorption process may be re- 
presented graphically by the curve in Fig. 75. This would be 
the type of curve which we would expect to obtain, and which as 
a matter of fact is obtained, with such a gas as nitrogen in con- 
tact with charcoal. At very low pressures the adsorption is 
proportional to the pressure, Eventually, however, the curve
-P-A-G-E-457
  
Src. 5] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 429 
becomes concave toward the pressure axis and remains so until 
the saturation pressure is approached when capillary condensa- 
tion begins and the curve becomes convex to the pressure axis. 
With certain vapors such as water vapor at room temperature, 
adsorption curves such as that shown in the lower part of the 
figure are obtained?, that is, the whole curve is apparently of 
the capillary condensation type. This is only an apparent be- 
havior however and simply means that the portion of the curve 
covering the other two ranges lies at such low pressures that it 
cannot, or at all events has not, been studied. 
In certain cases such as the adsorption of water vapor by 
glass and possibly also the adsorption of hydrogen by palladium, 
the first layer adsorbed gradually diffuses downward into the 
adsorbent and is replaced by a second layer which diffuses down- 
ward in the same manner, that is, the adsorption process is accom- 
panied by a slow solution of adsorbed gas in the solid material. 
Except for the time element, the behavior of water vapor in con- 
tact with a glass surface is thus in no essential respect different 
from its behavior in contact with an alcohol surface or the surface 
of any other liquid in which it dissolves more or less freely. 
If a given liquid does not wet a solid we should expect that the 
vapor of that liquid would show practically no appreciable 
adsorption by the solid unless some stable adsorption compound 
were formed, in which‘case an absorption layer one molecule 
deep would form, after which adsorption would practically 
cease unless the new surface produced by the chemical adsorp- 
tion was one which was wetted by the liquid whose vapor was 
being investigated. We should expect therefore to find all types 
of behavior from practically zero adsorption up to an eventual 
complete solution. 
An investigation by Lamb* and Coolidge’ of the heats of wet- 
ting of charcoal by a number of organic liquids showed that 
these heats are proportional to the heats of compressions of the 
liquids, thus indicating that each of these liquids is attracted 
by the charcoal with substantially the same force, the heat of 
wetting corresponding simply to a heat of compression.

tion equilibria has shown that the following empirical equation 
proposed by Freundlich is in many cases a fairly satisfactory 
expression for the adsorption isotherm: 
y = Wh 55 =kCV (3) 
where y is the amount of a given material adsorbed by m grams 
of the adsorbent and C is the concentration of this material in 
the (dilute) solution, when adsorption equilibrium has been 
attained; k and h are characteristic empirical constants. 
The constant h varies in different cases between the compara- 
tively narrow limits h = 2 and h = 10, that is, within these 
limits it is independent of the temperature and of the natures of 
the adsorbent and the absorbed material. The constant k, 
however, varies over a wide range, but usually the values of this 
constant for a series of substances in a given solution lie in the 
same relative order irrespective of the nature of the adsorbent.* 
6. The Optical Properties of Disperse Systems.—Many col- 
loidal solutions have a turbid or semiturbid appearance when 
examined by transmitted light, while others appear to be per- 
fectly clear. Colloidal solutions of the metals in water are 
frequently beautifully colored, the color for a given metal de- 
pending upon its degree of dispersion. Many of them show also 
a pseudofluorescence. As a general rule the color (7.e., absorp- 
tion maximum) shifts towards the violet end of the spectrum with 
increasing degree of dispersion. 
When a strong beam of light is sent through a colloidal solu- 
tion a diffuse cone of light (the ‘Tyndall? cone’’) is observed 
when the solution is viewed from the side against a dark back- 
ground. This reflected, or more accurately diffracted, light is 
plane polarized and is always produced when light passes through 
any medium containing particles whose diameter is small in 
comparison with the wave length of light. This principle of 
dark background illumination is made use of in the ultra-micro-

scope, devised by Siedentopf* and Zsigmondy,’ with the aid of 
which individual colloidal particles as small as 3uu in diameter 
can be seen as small points of light against the dark field. 
7. Degree of Dispersion and Solubility—The solubility of a 
given crystalline substance in a given liquid increases with the 
degree of dispersion of the crystalline substance. That is, a 
substance in the form of very small crystals is more soluble than 
the same substance in the form of larger crystalline aggregates. 
This is well illustrated by the experiments of Hulett* with barium 
sulphate. He found that water shaken with fine BaSO, powder 
dissolved 3.67 mg. of BaSO, per liter in 5 minutes, but at the end 
of 24 hours the dissolved BaSO, amounted to only 2.89 mg. per 
liter. The solution which was saturated with respect to the fine 
crystals was supersaturated with respect to larger ones and the 
excess had slowly crystallized out of the solution in the form of 
the larger crystals. 
This behavior is taken advantage of in analytical chemistry, 
where it is customary to digest or boil a BaSO, precipitate with 
the solution for some time before filtering, in order that the fine 
crystalline precipitate (which would pass through the pores of 
the filter) may have an opportunity to dissolve in the solution and 
recrystallize out again in the form of the less soluble larger 
erystals. The curve showing the relation between size of crystal 
and solubility will resemble in general the graph of equation 
(2). (See problem 1, above.) 
8. Methods of Preparing Colloidal Solutions.——Apparently 
any pure substance can be obtained in any desired degree. of 
dispersion, from molecular dispersion (true solution) up to a 
coarse suspension whose particles settle rapidly under the influ- 
ence of gravity. The details of the large variety of methods 
which are available for this purpose cannot be entered into here. 
The various methods may, however, be grouped into two classes: 
(1) dispersion methods and (2) condensation methods.

432 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXV 
As examples of the first class may be mentioned (a) progress- 
ive mechanical division and (b) dispersion with the aid of the 
electric arc. The method of mechanical division consists in re- 
peatedly grinding the desired substance in a mill, together with 
some suitable inert material, and finally taking up the product 
with a solvent in which the inert material forms a true solution. 
The inert material can then be removed by dialysis. (See Sec. 
15, below.) This method has been successfully employed by von 
Veimarn and Stein in a large number of cases. According to 
Gurvich and Wegelin the same result can be obtained by rotating 
small particles of the substance in contact with an “active” 
(z.e., strongly pulverising) liquid such as water or an alcohol.® 
In the case of metals, Bredig* found that if an electric are 
between two pieces of metal be formed within a liquid, the 
cloud of metallic vapor sent off from the arc remains in the liquid 
in the form of a colloidal solution of the metal. ‘Direct dispersion 
processes are frequently accompanied by and assisted by various 
“‘peptization’”’ processes as described more fully below (Sec. 14). 
The class of condensation methods includes all processes in 
which the dispersed phase is “precipitated” out of a super- 
saturated true solution. The precipitation may be the result 
(a) of lowering the temperature, (b) of changing the thermo- 
dynamic environment (XIII, 1,) (c) of bringing about a chem- 
ical reaction, or (d) or any two or more of these processes taking 
place simultaneously.

9. Von Veimarn’s Law of Corresponding States.—<Aside from 
its importance as a practical means for obtaining substances in 
the disperse condition, the condensation method merits a rather 
detailed treatment because of the light which it throws upon 
the relationships between the different types of colloids and the 
conditions which control their formation and existence. The 
principles governing these conditions should apply to all cases 
where a precipitate is produced in a fluid, irrespective of the 
means by which the precipitation is brought about, but for the

sake of concreteness we shall consider here only the production 
of a precipitate by a chemical reaction in a liquid. 
Suppose we mix together V liters of an n-normal solution of 
the substance AB with V liters of an n-normal solution of the 
substance MN, which reacts with AB to produce nV equivalents 
of the slightly soluble substance AM and the same number of 
equivalents of the very soluble substance BN. The character 
of the AM precipitate obtained, its degree of dispersion and 
general appearance, can be accurately described with the aid of 
a quantity which we shall call the dispersion coefficient, 5, of the 
precipitate. A great variety of experiments carried out by von 
Veimarn have shown that this descriptive coefficient is expressed 
by the following equation which holds (qualitatively, at all 
events) for all substances deposited as crystals by condensation 
out of any liquid (III, 6): 
6 = ahi Baa ae (a) 
Sp is the solubility, in equivalents per liter, of the precipitated 
substance AM (in the aggregated condition), Np is the number of 
equivalents of the precipitate AM which must be deposited out 
of each liter of the solution in order that its concentration shall 
be reduced to Sp equivalents per liter, 7 is the viscosity of the 
solution, and ky, kyx, etc., are coefficients expressing the de- 
gree of complexity (either chemical or physical, or both) of the 
various substances (in solution) which are involved in the pre- 
cipitation reaction. For substances having a comparatively 
simple chemical structure and which are not associated in the 
solution, the above equation could be written in the approximate 
form 
_Ne iad Se? (5) 
These equations postulate a law, called by von Veimarn? 
the law of corresponding states for the crystallization process, which 
may be expressed in words as follows: The degree of dispersion 
and the general physical appearance of crystalline precipitates 
are always the same irrespective of the chemical nature of these

precipitates, provided that the precipitation takes place under 
“corresponding conditions.’ The conditions of two precipita- 
tions are said to be “corresponding”? when the expression on 
the right-hand side of equation (5) (or, more generally, equation 
(4)) has the same value in both precipitations. The most im- 
portant quantity in these equations is the ratio aS, which is 
called the degree of supersaturation of the solution. 
Von Veimarn has brought forward an abundance of experi- 
mental material for demonstrating the general validity of the 
above law. Using it as a guide, he has been able to prepare 
precipitates of such materials as NaCl, BaSOu, Al(OH)s, AgCl, 
AgI, and many others, with almost any desired degree of dis- 
persion ranging in each instance all the way from coarse and very 
obviously crystalline precipitates to gelatinous precipitates and 
thick transparent colloidal jellies. Bancroft* has shown,® how- 
ever, that von Veimarn’s law is applicable only if the solution is 
not stirred during the precipitation. 
In order to make clear the action of the different forces which 
control the degree of dispersion and behavior of precipitates 
formed by the condensation method, we shall illustrate the 
application of equation (5) to the precipitation of BaSO, by 
means of a chemical reaction in aqueous solution. The experi- 
mental data employed will be those obtained by von Veimarn 
for this purpose and the interpretation and description of the 
results will be those given in his book, to which the student is 
referred for further details and also for a beautiful series of photo- 
micrographs illustrating the appearance of the different types of 
precipitates. 
The precipitate of BaSO, is obtained by mixing together equal 
volumes of equivalent solutions of Ba(CNS)2 and MnSO.. The 
concentrations in the different experiments vary all the way from 
n : 4 30,000 to 7n but the volumes chosen in each experiment are 
such that the condition VC=constant is always maintained. 
In other words, the total amount of BaSO, precipitated after final 
equilibrium is reached is the same in all of the experiments.

For convenience in presenting and discussing the results of 
the experiments, the above concentration range is arbitrarily 
divided into five regions, including respectively the concentration 
n n n n on 
ranges, 30,000 to 7000’ 7000 to 600’ 600 to 0.75n, 0.75n to 3n and 
3n to 7n, approximately. Since the solubility of BaSO, in 
water at room temperature is about 10-* moles per liter, these 
ranges correspond to the following degrees of supersaturation: 
0 to 3, 3 to 48, 48 to 21,900, 21,900 to 87,600 and 87,600 to 
204,000, respectively. 
10. Precipitation from Solutions having Small Degrees of 
‘ n Supersaturation. (a) RangeI. Concentrations between 20,000 
a Values of a between 0 and 3.—The BaSO, mole- 
cules produced by mixing these extremely dilute solutions will 
be distributed through a very large volume of liquid. The 
number of crystal nuclei (VII, 1) which can form will therefore 
be comparatively small and they will be very far apart. The 
solubility of these first crystal nuclei will, moreover, be almost 
equal to the concentration of the solution surrounding them 
(XXV, 7), and they will hence (see equation (14), XXI) have 
very little tendency to grow and are likely to be frequently broken 
up by the collisions which they will experience owing to their 
rapid Brownian movement (IX, 1). At a few points in the solu- 
tion, however, especially around dust particles or inequalities 
such as scratches on the surface of the containing vessel, a few 
crystal nuclei of large size and hence smaller solubility and less 
mobility will be formed. These will be comparatively stable and 
will grow slowly into larger crystals. 
The final result of the precipitation under these conditions 
will thus be the production, after a very long period of time, of a 
comparatively small number of coarse crystals. The smaller 
the degree of supersaturation the longer will be the time required 
for complete precipitation and the larger and fewer in number 
will be the crystals finally obtained. For concentrations lying and 
n n " 
between 50,000 and 70,000 several years would probably be 
required before the appearance of any precipitate could be 
detected. The large BaSO, crystals found in nature are probably

produced in this way. Large crystals are also produced when 
the two solutions are mixed together very gradually, the mixing 
process extending over months or years.

hours and precipitation is nearly complete at the end of 24 hours, 
At C= Sau! the opalescence appears after 2-3 hours and 10-12 
hours are required for the completion of the precipitation. At 
C= na opalscence appears in 3-5 minutes and the precipita- 
tion continues through 2-3 hours. At C= ae opalescence is 
observed after a few seconds and the precipitation is nearly 
complete at the end of an hour. The degree of dispersion of 
the precipitate increases steadily with increasing concentration 
of the two precipitating solutions. The initial appearance of 
the precipitate in the form of a very large number of very small 
crystals, as the value of Np increases, is due to the fact that the 
chances of formation of crystal nuclei obviously increase under 
these conditions. 
(c) Suspension Colloids or Suspensoids.—When N>p is great 
enough the large number of nuclei formed in the solution give it 
a perceptible opalescence (see above, Sec. 6) and we have a typical 
example of a colloidal solution of the type known as a suspension 
colloid or a suspensoid. When water is the dispersion medium 
this type of colloid is also sometimes called a lyophobic colloid. 
The disperse phase is called a sol, or in water a hydrosol. 
The most general distinguishing characteristics of this type of 
colloid seem to be the relatively small per cent. of disperse
-P-A-G-E-465
  Src. 10] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 437 
material in the system and the fact that the solution will, under 
suitable conditions, exhibit the phenomenon of cataphoresis. 
(See below, Sec. 12a.) As will appear more clearly later (Sec. 
llc), however, no sharp distinction can be drawn between the 
suspension colloids and the emulsion colloids or gels, or between 
either type of colloid and a true solution, since they shade off 
gradually into one another. 
(d) The Stability of Suspension Colloids——In the case of 
the BaSO, sol produced in the experiments described above, the 
stability of the colloidal solution is not very great. The small 
colloidal crystals gradually dissolve in the dispersion medium 
and recrystallize out as larger ones, which then fall to the bottom 
of the vessel in a fine powder. This “molecular recrystallization” 
is also assisted somewhat by a process of “aggregation crystalliza- 
tion”? which consists in a direct union of the small crystals to 
form larger ones. It is thus clear that anything which will 
decrease the rate at which these two processes occur will increase 
the stability of the suspensoid. 
Decreasing the solubility of the BaSO, in the dispersion 
medium (by pouring alcohol into the solution, for example) 
will evidently retard the recrystallization process and will in 
fact give a very stable BaSO, sol. It is for a similar reason that 
an Ag] sol prepared by precipitation in aqueous solution is much 
more stable than the corresponding BaSO, sol. The stability of 
a sol can also obviously be increased by increasing the viscosity 
of the solution in which it is formed or by decreasing the tem- 
perature because the solubility of the sol is usually thereby de- 
creased while the viscosity of the dispersion medium is at the 
same time increased. The stability is also increased by adding 
to the solution something which is adsorbed by the colloid par- 
ticles so as to partially cover them and protect them against the 
solvent action of the dispersion medium. Or the adsorbed sub- 
stance (especially if it is an ion) may actually lower the solubility 
of the dispersed substance. Such a lowering of solubility is 
associated with a lowering of the surface tension at the interface 
and it can be shown’ that in a thermodynamically stable 
colloidal solution the surface tension at the interface must 
be zero. If it is less than zero, the colloidal particles tend to 
decrease in size by further dispersion until the surface tension
-P-A-G-E-466
    438 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
becomes zero or until the particles completely dissolve. If on 
the other hand the surface tension is greater than zero, the 
particles tend to grow in size until the surface tension becomes 
zero or until flocculation occurs. 
The suspensoid stage in condensation processes can be realized 
(in principle, at least) for every substance which can be produced 
by precipitation from a liquid. All that is necessary is to make 
the precipitation under the conditions which define the desired 
dispersion coefficient. These conditions are described by equa- 
tion (4) or in simple cases by equation (5). It is thus clear that 
suspension colloids do not represent any particular class or kind 
of substances. Instead they correspond simply to a condition 
of dispersion which can be realized (at least in principle) with 
any substance whatever. 
(e) Range III. Concentrations between 300 and 0.75n. 
Values of a between 48 and 22,000.—The precipitates obtained 
in this range of concentrations are secondary growths, such as 
needles, skeletons and star-shaped masses. The suspensoid 
stage has only a very brief existence and is entirely inappreciable 
at the higher concentrations. At C = 0.75n the small needle- 
shaped crystals can barely be recognized as such under highest 
powers of the microscope. 
11. Precipitation from Solutions having Large Degrees of 
Supersaturation. (a) Range IV. Concentrations between 
0.75n and 38n. Values of = between 22,000 and 87,600.—As the 
concentrations of the solutions increase within this range, the pre- 
cipitate, at first granular, becomes curdy, then flaky and finally 
gelatinous in character. These so-called amorphous precipitates 
(Cf. VII, 3) are, however, composed of crystals too small to be 
identified even with the highest powers of the microscope, as 
von Veimarn has succeeded in proving. 
(b) Range V. Concentrations between 3n and 8n. Values 
of = between 87,600 and 204,000.—The drops of the Ba(CNS). 
solution which fall into the MnSO, solution cover themselves 
quickly with a clear transparent gelatinous membrane which
-P-A-G-E-467
  
Src. 11] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 439 
gradually clouds up and then falls to pieces in a voluminous 
flaky cloud of precipitate. At C = 4n, this cloudiness appears 
very quickly. At C = 5n, the drops settle to the bottom and if 
the solution is shaken or stirred, it sets completely to a stiff: jelly. 
This behavior is even more pronounced at C = 6n and at C = 7n 
and the jelly remains clear and transparent for hours, but 
eventually clouds up and falls to pieces in a white cloud of flaky 
precipitate, owing to the gradual decrease in the degree of dis- 
persion. 
If the Ba(CNS), solution is added.drop by drop without shak- 
ing, the drops, covered with the transparent gelatinous mem- 
brane, collect in the bottom of the vessel in the form of a coarsely 
cellular jelly. The gelatinous cell walls in this jelly constitute 
semipermeable membranes (XII, 7). Osmosis through these 
gelatinous wails therefore takes place and the whole mass swells 
up and appears to suck up all or a large part of the liquid in the 
vessel, like a sponge. This phenomenon of “swelling” in 
contact with liquids is exhibited by many colloidal gels. The 
ordinary rubber cement of commerce is produced by allowing 
rubber, which is a colloidal gel, to ‘swell’ in contact with 
benzene or other suitable liquid. Theories of the mechanism of 
colloidal swelling have been given® by Donnan‘ and by Tolman.® 
(c) Emulsion Colloids.—A colloid whose solutions possess 
the power of gelatinizing or forming a jelly (more especially if the 
process is reversible with respect to the temperature) is frequently 
called an emulsion colloid or an emulsoid. These terms are 
rather loosely used, however, and according to von Veimarn 
should be restricted to colloidal solutions in which the particles 
of the sol are in the liquid state of aggregation. The high con- 
centration of the disperse phase and the high viscosity imparted 
to the solution seem to be the most common characteristics of 
the type of gel-forming colloids. Many organic substances, 
such as gelatine, agar-agar, and albumin, form colloidal solutions 
of this character in water. They are also called lyophillic colloids 
and hydrogels. The hardening of Portland cement seems also to 
be due largely to the slow formation of a colloidal gel by the 
hydration of the dicalcium silicate.

440 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
In this case also it should be remembered, however, that in 
principle any substance whatever can be obtained in the form of 
a jelly by condensation under the proper conditions. The sub- 
stances, such as gelatine and agar-agar, which we most commonly 
associate with this gel formation do not constitute a particular 
class of substances in this respect, but rather a gel or an emulsion 
colloid represents a condition of dispersion and concentration 
which any substance may assume. Similarly gelatine, agar-agar, 
and other like substances can and have been obtained in the 
form of typical suspension colloids and some of them even in 
the form of comparatively coarse crystals. The behavior of 
emulsoids is considered further below. 
Tue Proprertins AND BEHAVIOR OF COLLOIDAL SOLUTIONS 
12. The Electrical Properties of Colloids. (a) Electrosmosis.— 
By the adsorption of ions of electrolytes present in the disper- 
sion medium and in some instances apparently by ionization of 
the colloid itself, the particles of a colloidal solution are usually 
electrically charged (either positively or negatively) and the solu- 
tion may therefore possess a higher conductance than the dis- 
persion medium (the “intermicellular liquid”) alone. The 
particles of the disperse phase will therefore behave like ions 
and will migrate through the solution under the influence of an 
E.M.F. This electrical migration is called cataphoresis and 
can be advantageously employed in many cases to concentrate 
and partially separate the disperse phase from the bulk of the 
dispersion medium. It has been employed in this way for puri- 
fying and dewatering clay. 
If the small colloidal particles are packed so closely together 
that they are not free to move, as for example in a mass of plastic 
clay or in the case of a porous wall consisting of small particles 
separated by capillary pores, then the application of an E.M.F. 
will cause the liquid to flow through the porous mass. This 
process is usually called electrical endosmose. Since it does not 
differ in principle from cataphoresis the two processes are usually 
classed together under the term electrosmosis. Electrosmosis has 
 
-P-A-G-E-469
  
Src. 12] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 441 
been applied to the purification of clay, to the dewatering of clay 
and peat, to the tanning of hides, to the impregnation of timber 
with preservatives, to the lubrication of dies and the prevention 
of lamination in the manufacture of brick by the stiff mud process, 
and to the production of local anaesthesia. 
(b) Coagulation by Electrolytes.—If to a solution of a sus- 
pensoid an electrolyte be added, the two ions of the electrolyte 
will be adsorbed by the suspensoid particles, but both ions will 
not be adsorbed to the same extent. With increasing concen- 
tration of the electrolyte a point will therefore eventually be 
reached where the original charge of the colloidal particles will 
become neutralized by the adsorption of the oppositely charged 
ions of the added electrolyte. As this point is approached the 
stability of the sol decreases and at a certain definite concen- 
tration of the added electrolyte, coagulation or flocculation of 
the sol will take place. (Cf. Sec.2.) The optimum coagulating- 
concentration of the electrolyte is more sharply defined the more 
uniform in size the particles of the sol are, and its value varies 
with the nature of the sol and the nature of the added electrolyte. 
The coagulating powers of electrolytes as a rule increase rapidly 
with the valence of the active ion (Schulze’s law). Thus the 
alkali cations are usually all about equally efficient in coagulating 
a negative colloid, but the efficiency of Ba** and still more that 
of Al**+ is much greater. This is illustrated by the data in 
Table XXXVI. Whitney? and Ober found that the amounts of 
the coagulating ion adsorbed by coagulated arsenic trisulphide

  were in the ratio of the equivalent weights of the metals constitut- 
ing the ions, thus indicating that the neutralization of the electric

Laboratory of the General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y,
-P-A-G-E-470
442 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
charge on the colloid particles is the factor responsible for the 
coagulation. 
If more than the optimum coagulating concentration of the 
added electrolyte is used the colloid is again stabilized but its 
particles then have charges of the opposite sign. 
The coagulation of suspensoids by electrolytes is a reversible 
process, that is, on washing out the adsorbed electrolyte, the 
suspensoid goes into solution again. The coagulation of the 
emulsoids, on the other hand, is frequently irreversible or diffi- 
cultly reversible and usually requires much larger quantities of 
the electrolyte. 
Colloids of opposite signs also possess the power of coagulating 
each other when their solutions are mixed together. Thus 
coagulation takes place when a solution of the positive suspensoid 
ferric hydroxide is mixed with a solution of the negative sus- 
pensoid arsenic trisulphide. Coagulation by heating, cooling, 
and by evaporation of the dispersion medium also occurs. 
13. Protective Colloids.—Emulsion colloids, such as agar-agar 
and gelatine, when coagulated by evaporating off the water 
will dissolve again on the addition of water, while the suspension 
colloids, such as the metal hydrosols, when treated in the same 
way do not pass into solution again. A distinction between 
“reversible” and ‘‘irreversible” colloids is sometimes made on 
this basis. The addition of a small quantity of a reversible col- 
loid to a solution of an irreversible colloid confers upon the latter 
the property of reversibility. It also renders it more stable in 
every way, even protecting it to a considerable extent against 
the coagulating effect of electrolytes. The protective action is 
probably due to the formation of an adsorption layer of the emul- 
sion colloid over the surface of the particles of the suspension 
colloid. The use in this way of “protective colloids” for in- 
creasing the stability of solutions of suspensoids is a very im- 
portant one and finds frequent application. Thus the gelatine 
on a photographic plate acts as a protective colloid for the silver 
chloride sol. 
The relative amounts of different protective colloids necessary 
in order to protect a standard gold hydrosol against coagulation 
by a standard NaCl solution are called the ‘gold numbers” 
of the protective colloids. These gold numbers vary all the way 
from 0.005 for gelatine to 12 for potato starch. 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
  
Sec. 14] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 443 
14. Peptization.—When a finely divided coagulated precipi- 
tate, such as AgCl, is brought into contact with an aqueous solu- 
tion containing a suitable substance at the proper concentration, 
it will pass into solution again as a colloid. This process, which 
is the reverse of coagulation, was given the name “peptization” 
by Graham,‘ because of its apparent analogy to the solvent action 
of the digestive fluids. It is also frequently called deflocculation 
and is not infrequently made use of in preparing colloidal solu- 
tions. According to von Veimarn the process of peptization is 
governed by the following conditions: (1) The particles of the 
precipitate to be peptized must be sufficiently small. (2) The 
peptizing substance must possess the property of forming asoluble 
compound or complex with the precipitate, and this compound 
must be in equilibrium with its dissociation products in the solu- 
tion. (3) The precipitate must be practically insoluble in the 
absence of the peptizing material. Another more general manner 
of stating the second condition is that the peptizing agent must 
be one which causes (probably by adsorption) the surface tension 
at the interface to be negative. 
Thus a precipitate of AgI can be peptized by a solution of 
AgNO; or of KI. The most effective concentration of the KI for 
this purpose is about 0.03n. Similarly clay can be deflocculated 
into a thin “slip” by the addition of any agent which will produce 
hydroxyl ions in the solution. 
15. Dialysis and Ultrafiltration—The property possessed by 
the colloidal jellies and by many membranes, such as parchment 
paper and gold-beater’s skin, of acting as semipermeable mem- 
branes is made use of in removing impurities, such as electrolytes 
and other substances, which may be present as solutes in the dis- 
persion medium of a colloidal solution. When this process of 
purifying the colloid is carried out by simply allowing the im- 
purities to diffuse through the membrane into the pure dispersion 
medium on the other side, the process is known as dialysis. 
By impregnating a supporting medium, such as filter paper, 
with a solution of a suitable colloidal jelly (as for example an

acetic acid solution of collodion) filters of different degrees of 
porosity can be prepared. These uwltrafilters, as they are called, 
have been used for separating colloidal particles of different 
degrees of dispersion from one another. 
16. Some Properties of Emulsion Colloids and of Solutes of 
very High Molecular Weight.—According to the theory of von 
Veimarn any substance will be obtained in the form of a clear 
transparent colloidal jelly, if a sufficiently large quantity of it 
is precipitated in any way from a small volume of a medium in 
which its solubility is sufficiently slight. The individual col- 
loidal particles of these gels are so small, that is, they consist 
of so few molecules, that the adsorbed layer of dispersion medium 
upon the surface of each particle constitutes relatively such a 
considerable proportion of the particle as to confer upon it to 
an appreciable degree the properties of a liquid particle. For 
this reason it is frequently very difficult to decide in a given case 
whether the particles of the gel are in the crystalline state of 
aggregation or in the liquid state of aggregation, and indeed with 
increasing degree of dispersion the one state may pass gradually 
over into the other and the distinction loses its significance. If 
a decrease in degree of dispersion results in the formation of an 
emulsion (Sec. 3), the gel would be classed as a true emulsoid. 
On the other hand, if a suspension or a precipitate of small crys- 
tals resulted, the gel would be more properly called a pseudo- 
emulsoid, if indeed the term emulsoid should be applied to it 
at all. 
True emulsoids are usually more stable than pseudo-emulsoids 
owing to the absence of crystal forces which cause the particles 
of the latter to gradually increase in size. Some pseudo-emul- 
soids composed of complex organic substances are also very 
stable owing to the weakness of the crystal forces. Lowering the 
temperature will obviously increase the stability of a gel com- 
posed of crystalline particles, and the more the surface of the 
colloidal particles is contaminated with adsorbed impurities, 
the more difficult will it be for the crystal forces to act and render 
the gel unstable. A typical example of gelatinization by fall 
in temperature occurs in cooling a hot saturated solution of 
chrome-alum. The solution gradually increases in viscosity as 
the temperature falls and eventually sets to a stiff transparent
-P-A-G-E-473
Src. 16] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 445 
jelly which on heating again passes gradually over into solution. 
A similar behavior is shown by the more stable gels, agar-agar 
and gelatine. 
The behavior of agar-agar solutions and many other organic 
gels of high molecular weight is frequently very much com- 
plicated by the fact that the sol is not a pure substance but a 
mixture of closely related substances. Thus an agar-agar 
solution consists of at least two substances, a-agar-agar and 
B-agar-agar, which go over into each other under different 
conditions. The a-agar-agar (which can be obtained by pre- 
cipitation with alcohol from a water solution) is practically 
insoluble, as such, in water. On warming with water, however, 
it gradually changes over into the very soluble 6-form and 
thus passes into solution. Owing to this gradual change of 
one of these forms into the other, the properties and behavior 
of an agar-agar solution depend to a pronounced degree upon 
the previous history of the solution. The same is true of gelatine 
solutions. 
Molecularly dispersed, and therefore “true,” solutions of sub- 
stances of very high molecular weight display many of the 
properties of colloids (including the property of gel formation) 
owing to the fact that the individual molecules are so large. 
In fact a series of solutions of the sodium salts of the fatty acids 
of progressively increasing molecular weight shows a continuous 
series of properties ranging from true solutions, displaying no 
colloidal properties, to typical colloidal solutions. The ordinary 
soap solutions are of this character. 
These solutions have been extensively investigated by Mac 
Bain* who has shown” that in dilute solutions the soaps consist 
of the metallic cation, the organic anion, the undissociated 
molecules of the salt, and a small quantity of colloid consisting 
of the free acid resulting from the partial hydrolysis of the salt 
together with some of the salt itself. The colloidal particles 
doubtless also adsorb some of everything present in the solution. 
With increasing concentration and with increasing molecular 
weight the amount of colloidal material increases until in the 
moderately concentrated solutions of the salts of the higher acids 
«J. W. Mac Bain, Lecturer in Physical Chemistry in the University of 
Bristol. 
   
-P-A-G-E-474
  446 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuar. XXV 
(the soaps) the solution appears to consist almost entirely of 
the metal cations and large colloidal particles whose net com- 
position is expressed by the formula (A7)m (H2O),, where A- 
represents the anion of the salt. Whether these ‘ionic micelle” 
are to be considered as produced by the adsorption of hydroxyl 
ion and water by the free acid resulting from the hydrolysis or 
whether they are formed simply by the agglutination of a number 
of anions into larger groups could not be definitely determined. 
Solutions containing still higher concentrations of soap up to 
the limit of pure liquid soap itself have been studied and dis- 
cussed" by Fischer.* 
17. Emulsions.—In an emulsion both the dispersion medium 
and the dispersed phase are in the liquid state of aggregation. 
If the emulsion is dilute with respect to the disperse phase 
the solution is a typical colloidal solution of the suspensoid type 
and displays -all of the properties of that type. If dispersion 
medium and dispersed phase are present in substantially equal 
amounts, however, we obtain an emulsion in which both phases 
are as a matter of fact in a dispersed condition, the only difference 
being that one phase, the outer phase, is present in connected 
films having surfaces which are convex toward the phase itself, 
while the other phase, the inner phase, is present in disconnected 
droplets which are concave toward the phase itself. Thus in 
milk or cream, water is the outer phase and fat the inner 
phase, while in butter the fat is the outer and the water the 
inner phase. 
The condition for the stability of such an emulsion is alow 
interfacial tension between the two phases and the term emulsi- 
fiers is given to substances which when added to a mixture of 
two insoluble liquids, produce this low interfacial tension. 
Soaps are most commonly used for this purpose. 
A reversible reversal of inner and outer phases can be pro- 
duced by adding to an emulsion a substance which will reverse 
the sign of the interfacial tension. Thus Clowes’ has shown 
that an emulsion prepared by shaking olive oil with a dilute 
solution of NaOH has the oz! as the inner phase, but that if a 
quantity of CaCl, slightly in excess of the NaOH be added to this

  Sec. 18] DISPERSE SYSTEMS 447 
emulsion, it transforms spontaneously into one having the water 
as the inner phase. Addition of more NaOH will cause it to 
revert again to the original condition and the reversal can then 
be repeated. Salts of magnesium, iron and aluminum have a 
similar influence which is doubtless due to the fact that being 
more soluble in the oil than in the water they form a surface 
solution at the boundary between the phases which reverses 
the sign of the interfacial tension. A reversible emulsion has 
been compared to a lake containing a large number of small 
islands connected with one another by submerged ridges. Here 
the land is the inner phase and the water the outer phase. If 
now the water level is lowered, the system will be transformed 
into a land surface filled with a large number of ponds, that is, 
the water becomes the inner and the land the outer phase. 
18. Classification of Disperse Systems with Reference to 
Degree of Dispersion.—As pointed out in the foregoing pages, 
it is possible to realize almost a continuous series of systems with 
degrees of dispersion ranging all the way from the ordinary non- 
dispersed heterogeneous systems to the molecularly dispersed 
homogeneous systems which we call true solutions. Any scheme 
for classifying systems with respect to degree of dispersion must 
therefore include and exhibit this gradual change in the character 
of the system which accompanies the gradual increase in degree 
of dispersion. The following schematic representation of disperse 
systems from this point of view fulfills this condition. The 
arrangement and nomenclature are due principally to Wolfgang 
Ostwald? and to P. von Veimarn.

RADIOACTIVITY}? 
1. Radioactive Change.—In 1896 Becquerel* observed that the 
element uranium gave out a radiation or emanation of some char- 
acter which was able to penetrate a sheet of metal and to affect a 
photographic plate. The air in the neighborhood of this ‘‘radio- 
active’ matter was found to be ionized as shown by its discharging 
effect upon an electroscope. Shortly afterward the Curies? dis- 
covered two new radioactive elements, radium and polonium, in 
the mineral pitchblende, and Debierne* found a third, actinium, 
in the same material. Since these pioneer discoveries, many 
workers have entered this field and as a result of their labors some 
thirty new radioactive elements have been discovered. 
The researches of Sir Ernest Rutherford? showed that the 
radiation given out by radioactive substances consists of three 
distinct classes of rays, which he named a-, 6-, and y-rays, 
respectively. He also advanced the theory, which all subsequent 
research has confirmed-and which is now universally accepted, 
that the process of radioactive change is the result of a sponta- 
neous decomposition of the atoms of the radioactive elements, as 
a consequence of which new elements, frequently even less stable 
than the parent element, are produced. (Cf. I, 2f.) These new 
radioactive elements decompose in turn and produce others, and 
this process continues through many stages until finally a stable 
element is produced as the end product of the series of changes. 
This stable end product appears in each case to be an isotope 
(I, 2c) cf lead.

2. The Nature of a-Rays.—These rays consist of a stream of 
positively charged particles shot out from the atom of the radio- 
active element with a velocity about one-tenth as great as that of 
light. Each particle carries two atomic charges of positive elec- 
tricity and these particles have been proved to be helium atoms 
with two electrons (I, 2e) missing. 
When a-rays are allowed to pass through any homogeneous 
material, they collide with the atoms in their path, ionize a 
certain number of them, are themselves slowed up as a conse- 
quence, and when their velocity falls to a “critical” value, which is 
about 2.7 per cent. of that of light, their ionizing power ceases 
and they can no longer be detected by electrical means. They 
are then said to be “absorbed” by the material and the distance 
which they cover previous to this absorption is called their 
“range.” This range is proportional to the cube of the initial ve- 
locity and is a characteristic property of the radioactive element 
giving rise to the a-particles. The absorptive powers of different 
materials whether elements, compounds or mixtures, for the a- 
rays have been found by Bragg to be quite closely proportional 
to the mean of the square roots of the atomic weights of the ele- 
ments composing the absorbing material. The absorption coeffi- 
cient of a compound for X-rays of any given wave length has 
also been found? to be strictly an additive property of the ab- 
sorption coefficients of its elements irrespective of the state of 
aggregation and the valence condition. 
3. The Scattering of a-Particles——Most of the a-particles in 
passing through a given material move in straight lines, but some 
of them are deviated in one direction or the other and this 
deviation or “scattering” is produced, according to Sir Ernest 
Rutherford, whenever an a-particle passes near enough to the 
nucleus of an atom to be appreciably acted upon by the electric 
charge of the nucleus. The magnitude of this central positive 
charge of a given atom is called its atomic number, and Sir Ernest 
Rutherford has calculated from measurements of the scattering 
effect that the nuclear positive charge of an atom is approximately 
equal to one-half its atomic weight multiplied by the charge of 
an electron. The scattering effect also indicates that practically 
all of the mass of an atom is concentrated in this positively 
charged nucleus, whose diameter in the case of hydrogen has
-P-A-G-E-479

Suc. 4] RADIOACTIVITY 451 
been calculated to be only about 10-18 cm., the total diameter of 
the hydrogen atom being of the order of magnitude of 10-8 cm. 
4. The Nature of the 8-Rays.—The 6-rays consist of a stream 
of electrons moving with velocities ranging up to a maximum 
almost equal to the velocity of light. While all the a-particles 
shot out by the decomposing atoms of a given radioactive element 
move with the same velocity, the f-rays consist of particles 
moving with a great variety of velocities. 
The ionizing power of the 6-rays is much weaker than that of 
the a-rays. Their penetrating power increases with their ve- 
locity and is very great for the very rapid ones. They are most 
conveniently detected with the aid of the photographic plate. 
5. The Nature of the y-Rays.—These rays are identical with 
X-rays, that is, they are ordinary light rays of extremely short 
wave lengths. The wave length‘varies from about 10-8 em. for 
the ‘‘soft’’ or feebly penetrating rays to 0.7-10-!° cm. for the 
“hard” or very penetrating rays. Since these rays do not con- 
sist of charged particles they are not deflected by electromagnetic 
or electrostatic fields as are the a- and f-rays. 
6. The Radioactive Constant and the Period of Half Change. 
The number of atoms of a redioactive element which decom- 
pose per second at any time ¢ is proportional to the number in 
existence at that time, or mathematically (Cf. equation 6, XX1), 
8 oan (1) 
where \, the proportionality constant,.is called the radioactive 
constant and is an important characteristic of the decomposing 
element. The reciprocal of this quantity is called the average 
life period of the element, and the time required for one-half of a 
given quantity of a radioactive element to decompose is called 
its period of half change or its half-value period. 
Problem 1.—Show that the period of half change of a radioactive element 
: 0.6932, is equal to x   
The periods of half change of the different radioactive ele- 
ments vary all the way from thousands of millions of years for the 
longest lived primary elements to less than a millionth of a second 
for the shortest lived one. 
An important empirical relation between the radioactive con-

stant and the range R of the a-particles emitted by a decomposing 
element has been discovered by Geiger* and Nuttall.’ This rela- 
tion is expressed by the equation 
d=ak? (2) 
where 0 is a general constant and a is a constant characteristic 
of the series to which the element belongs. This relationship is 
especially valuable for the calculation of the radioactive con- 
stant of the very long or very short lived elements for which 
most of the other methods fail. 
7. The Disintegration Series.—Probably all of the thirty odd 
radioactive elements are decomposition products of one of the 
two parent elements, uranium and thorium. In order to show 
the chief characteristics of the radio-elements and their relations 
to one another, it is customary to arrange them in a disinte- 
gration series starting with the parent element and showing all 
the successive steps in its disintegration up to the production of 
the stable end produce of the series. 
Fig. 76 shows the three disintegration series. The numbers in 
the circles are the atomic weights of the elements. The nature of 
the rays (whether a or 8) given out in each decomposition is 
indicated by the small circles or dots at the side of the larger 
circles. The Roman numerals indicate the group to which the 
element belongs in the periodic system, and hence from these 
numerals the chemical properties of the element can be inferred. 
Below the name of each element appears the value of 1/\, the 
‘Caverage life period”’ of the element. 
8. Radioactive Equilibrium.—aA radioactive material is said to 
be in radioactive equilibrium when the rate of production of each 
radioactive element from its parent is just balanced by its rate 
of decomposition into the next lower element of the series. The 
equilibrium quantities of the different elements in any such radio- 
active material are inversely proportional to their radioactive 
constants.

screen covered with zinc sulphide (such a screen is called a

spinthariscope), it produces a small flash of light which is easily 
visible under a microscope. By counting the number of flashes 
observed on such a screen, one can find the number of a-particles 
which strike it in a given period of time. Instead of the spin- 
thariscope an ionization vessel may also be employed for the same 
purpose. An apparatus arranged for this purpose by Rutherford 
and Geiger is shown in Fig. 77. The radioactive material was 
placed upon a suitable support (not shown) in the evacuated tube, 
E, at a known distance, R, from the small opening, D, of known 
area, A. This opening consisted cf a thin mica plate through

which the a-particles could pass without difficulty into the detect- 
ing vessel, B, which was filled with air at a low pressure and was 
provided with two electrodes charged at a high potential and 
connected to a sensitive electrometer, an instrument for indicating 
the passage of a current. Hence whenever an a-particle passed 
through the small opening at D into the detecting vessel, it 
ionized the air and a momentary current of electricity flowed 
from one of the electrodes to the other and the passage of this 
current was indicated by a sudden throw of the electrometer 
needle. The observer has only to count the number of throws cf 
the electrometer needle which occur in a given time interval and 
he has at once the number of a-particles which passed through the 
area D in that time; or the throws of the galvanometer may be 
registered photographically on a moving film, if desired. Know- 
ing the area of the opening D and its distance from the radioactive 
source, it is easy to compute the total number of a-particles given 
off by the radium in that time, for they are given off uniformly in 
all directions. In this way, Rutherford and Geiger found that 
the a-particles are given off by radium at the rate of about 
107-10*° (+8 per cent.) particles per year, per gram of radium.
-P-A-G-E-483
  Src. 10] RADIOACTIVITY 455 
In a similar way, but using a spinthariscope and microscope 
in place of the ionization vessel, Regener has determined the rate 
of emission of a-particles from polonium. About 20,000 par- 
ticles in all were counted in the different experiments and the 
average of all experiments gave a rate of emission of 3.94-10° 
(+0.3 per cent.) a-particles per second. By collecting the 
a-particles in a suitable measuring vessel the total charge carried 
by them was also determined by Regener. This charge was 
found to be 37.7-10- electrostatic units for the a-particles shot 
out from the polonium in 1 second. 
10. The Rate of Production of Helium by Radium.—Ruther- 
ford and Boltwood? carefully collected and measured all of the 
helium (10.38 + 0.05 cu. mm.) produced from a sample of radium 
in 4 months and found in this way that the helium produced by 
the decomposition of the radium atoms amounted to 39 cu. mm. 
per year, per gram of radium. 
11. The Calculation of Avogadro’s Number from Radioactive 
Data.—By combining Rutherford and Geiger’s value for the rate 
of emission of a-particles by radium with Rutherford and Bolt- 
wood’s value for the rate of production of helium from radium, 
the value (61.5 + 2)10” is obtained for Avogadro’s number. 
Similarly Regener’s value for the rate of emission of e-particles 
by polonium, combined with his determination of the total charge 
carried by these particles, gives (60,5 + 2)-10? for the value of 
this constant. These values agree, within the accuracy of the 
measurements involved, with the value of this constant computed 
by more accurate methods of entirely different character. (Cf. 
IX, 3 and 4, and XVI, 6.) 
Problem 2.—Carry out the calculations indicated above.

  CHAPTER XXVII 
ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND THE PERIODIC SYSTEM 
1. The Structure of the Atom.'?,5—As a result largely of in- 
vestigations published since 1912, a theory of atomic structure has 
been evolved which is able to interpret satisfactorily a consid- 
erable number of important relationships concerning the chemical 
elements. According to this theory every atom is supposed to 
be made up of a positively charged nucleus, in which most of 
the mass of the atom resides, surrounded by a system of “plane- 
tary’’ electrons. The nucleus is itself composed of a definite 
number of units of positive electricity associated with a certain 
number of nuclear electrons, the positive electricity being always 
in excess, however. The elementary units of positive electricity 
or the “positive electrons” are supposed to be identical with the 
nucleus of the hydrogen atom, that is, they are hydrogen atoms 
minus one electron each. 
The mass of an atom, while due chiefly to the number of 
hydrogen nuclei which it contains, will not necessarily be an 
integral multiple of the mass of the hydrogen atom (Prout’s* 
Hypothesis), because according to electromagnetic theory the 
total mass of a body made up of positive and negative units will 
depend somewhat upon the manner in which they are packed 
together, and upon the energy change accompanying the forma- 
tion of the atom. If proper allowance® be made for this “‘ pack- 
ing effect” however, a very exact multiple relationship can be 
shown to hold for a considerable number of elements as explained 
in section 4 below. 
The appearance of the helium atom almost intact in so many 
radioactive changes indicates that the nucleus of this atom con- 
stitutes a secondary unit of positive electricity of great stability

is supposed to be made up of four hydrogen nuclei united with 
two nuclear electrons. 
There is also some evidence that a third combination, namely, 
one composed of three hydrogen nuclei associated with two nega- 
tive electrons, appears also as a rather stable secondary unit in 
the nuclei of certain atoms. This combination has been called 
the nucleus of ekahydrogen since, if it existed alone, it would 
obviously be the nucleus of an atom of an isotope of hydrogen. 
Since an atom as a whole is electrically neutral, the net positive 
charge carried by its nucleus must be equal to the number of 
electrons exterior to the nucleus. This number is called the 
atomic number of the element and is a very important and char- 
acteristic constant, more characteristic even than its atomic 
weight, since the principal physical and chemical properties of 
the elements are determined by their atomic numbers, not by 
their atomic weights. Starting with hydrogen, the atomic num- 
bers of the elements run from H = 1, He = 2, C = 6, O = 8, 
etc., up to U = 92. 
2. Atomic Numbers and X-Ray Spectra.—A very important 
and valuable relation connecting the atomic number of an ele- 
ment with its X-ray spectrum has been discovered by Moseley.* 
The spectrum of the characteristic X-ray radiation (VIII, 4) of 
an element is very simple, consisting of two groups of lines called 
the ““K” radiation and the ‘“‘L” radiation, respectively. Mose- 
ley made a systematic study of the ““K”’ radiations of the ele- 
ments from Al to Au and found that these radiations consist 
of two strong lines whose frequencies (v) increase with increasing 
atomic weight of the element in accordance with the very simple 
relation, 
y = k(Ay — 1)? (1) 
where k is a constant and Ay is the atomic number of the element. 
More recent experiments® by Duane? show that the equation 
of Moseley is not exactly true, the values of v increasing with the 
atomic number somewhat more rapidly than required by that

equation. The graph of ~/» against Ay gives, however, a gently 
sloping curve (Fig. 78) which can be safely employed for inter- 
polating either Ay or v for any element. Moseley’s arrangement 
of the elements in accordance with their atomic numbers has 
brought to light several interesting relationships which will be

discussed below in connection with the consideration of a periodic 
system of the elements arranged in accordance with their atomic 
numbers. 
3. The Radio-elements and the Periodic System.'—For a 
long time the relation of the radio-elements to the periodic system 
remained an unsolved problem, but in 1913 the solution of the 
problem was finally obtained through the independent effort of 
Fajans, Soddy and others, who perceived an important generali- 
zation with regard to the changes in chemical properties resulting
-P-A-G-E-487

from successive steps in a radioactive disintegration. This gen- 
eralization is in complete accord with, and a necessary conse- 
quence of, the theory of atomic structure outlined in section 1. 
It may be formulated in terms of that theory as follows: 
1. In a radioactive transformation in which a-particles are 
expelled, the resulting new element must be composed of atoms 
with a nuclear charge 2 units less and with an atomic weight 
approximately 4 units less (Cf. Fig. 76) than that of the par- 
ent element. The atomic number therefore undergoes a decrease 
of 2 units and the new element will occupy a position in the peri- 
odie system two groups lower down than the one occupied by its 
parent. 
2. In a B-ray decomposition the atomic weight of the new ele- 
ment will be practically the same as that of its parent, since the 
mass of the electron lost is a negligible portion of the mass of the 
whole atom. (Cf. Fig. 76.) Thiselectron comesfrom the nucleus 
of the parent atom, however, so that the nuclear charge and thus 
the atomic number of the new element will be 1 unit larger than 
that of its parent and it will thus occupy a position in the periodic 
system one group higher up than its parent. 
By means of this simple generalization the atomic numbers 
and the chemical and physical properties of all the elements of a 
given disintegration series can be predicted, if the atomic number 
of one of the elements is known. The arrangement of all the 
known radioactive elements in the Mendelejeff table in accord- 
ance with the above scheme is shown in Fig. 79. If we start 
with the radium series, for example, we find Ui, an element in 
Group 6A. It undergoes an a-ray disintegration and produces 
U-Xi, an element belonging to Group 4A. This in turn 
undergoes $-ray decomposition and produces U-X2 which be- 
longs to Group 5A, ete., the final product being an’ element in 
Group 4B. The atomic numbers of the elements are shown at 
the bottom of the table. 
The most striking feature of this table is the fact that a single 
place in the periodic system is filled by several different elements. 
Thus the place occupied by Pb in the table is also filled by Ra-B, 
Ra-D, Th-B, and Ac-B, together with five other unnamed ele- 
ments which are the stable end products of the different disinte- 
gration series, These other elements are all isotopes (1, 2c) of

Pb, that is, they are chemically indistinguishable from Pb, and 
non-separable from it by any chemical means. They all have 
substantially identical spark and are spectra (cf. I, 2c) and, except 
for differences in atomic weight and the behavior determined 
thereby, are identical elements. The atomic weights of the diff- 
erent isotopes as far as they have been determined or can be 
inferred are shown in Fig. 76. 
All of the known facts concerning the chemical and physical 
properties of the thirty odd radio-elements are in complete 
harmony with their arrangement in the periodic system as shown 
in Fig. 79. All of the elements fit readily into the system and 
the only vacant space in a disintegration series which existed 
at the time the table was first prepared was later filled by the dis- 
covery of U-X, or ‘‘Brevium” by Fajans and Goéhring. 
4. Hydrogen and Helium Nuclei as Units of Atomic Struc- 
ture.7,8—We have seen in the preceding section that in the case of 
the heavy radio-elements the loss of an a-particle of mass four 
shifts the element two groups to the left in the periodic table and 
decreases its atomic number by 2. If a similar relation held true 
for the lighter elements, then beginning with helium the addition 
of 4 to the atomic weight for each increase of 2 in the atomic 
number ought to give the atomic weights of the elements belong- 
ing to the even numbered groups of the periodic table, provided 
the changes in mass due to variations in the manner and degree 
of packing (XXVII, 1) in the nuclei of the successive elements 
could be neglected. 
From this point of view a careful examination of the atomic 
weights of the elements has been made by Harkins* and Wilson 
who find that the above rule holds very closely, with but few 
exceptions, for all the elements with atomic weights less than 60. 
A similar rule also holds for the elements of the odd-numbered 
groups in the periodic table, if the assumption is made that the 
first of these elements, lithium, is built up from one helium and 
three hydrogen nuclei. The results of this point of view and the 
agreement between the observed and calculated atomic weights 
is shown in Table XXXVI, which also contains the formulas of 
the nuclei of the atoms according to the same hypothesis.

It will be noted that while the atomic weights marked “Calc.” 
in the table are computed on the basis H=1, those marked 
“Obs.” are the directly determined values on the basis H = 1.0078 
(i.e., O=16). That the agreement between the two is never- 
theless close is interpreted by Harkins and Wilson! as indicating 
that the packing effect in the formation of these elements from 
hydrogen nuclei and electrons must involve a constant decrease 
of about 0.77 per cent. in the mass of the resulting atom; and that 
nearly all of this decrease probably takes place when the helium 
atom is formed, which agrees with the great stability of the helium 
nucleus as a secondary unit of atomic structure. We thus have 
for the first time a reasonable explanation of the otherwise 
peculiar, but well-known fact that the whole-number relationship 
among the atomic weights is much more exact on the O=16 
than on the H=1 basis. The table shows elements correspond- 
ing to all possible multiples of He except 2He and 9He. In place 
of the 9He we, however, find 10He occurring twice, as A and Ca. 
These two elements are isomeric since they contain the same 
numbers of units of each kind of electricity. These units are 
differently distributed however. Thus the calcium atom con- 
sists of a nucleus composed of 10 a-particles surrounded by 20 
planetary electrons while the argon atom consists of a nucleus 
composed of 10 a-particles plus 2 cementing electrons surrounded 
by 18 planetary electrons. Other instances of isomeric atoms are 
also known. 
The numerical relationships between the atomic weights of the 
clements displayed by Table XX XVII were first discovered em- 
  
*Increment from Series 2 to Series3 =4He. Increment from Series 3 to 
Series 4 = 5He (4He for K and Ca). Increment from Series 4 to Series 
5 = 6He. 
“This table gives Series 2, 3 and 4 of the periodic system, built up by 
adding the weight of one helium atom for each change of two places to the 
right, and by adding enough multiples of the weight of a hydrogen atom to 
make up the atomic weight. In order to make the relationship apparent a 
symbolical representation has been used, He being taken to stand for the 
weight 4, and H for the weight 1.00. Built up in this way, the atomic 
weights of all of the members of the even numbered groups (with the excep- 
tion of glucinum) may be represented by a whole number of symbols He, 
while all of the atomic weights in the odd groups [with the exception of 
Cl and Sc] may be represented by 3H plus a whole number of symbols He.”

pirically by Rydberg* as early as 1886 and his paper, in fact, con- 
tains a purely empirical presentation of nearly all the periodic 
relationships which are today finding physical interpretations in 
terms of atomic structure. His mathematical representation* 
of these relationships involved certain empirical constants which 
are interpreted by our modern theory in terms of hydrogen and 
helium units, the charge on the nucleus, and the packing effect, 
respectively. 
The relation connecting atomic weight with atomic number for 
the elements shown in Table XXXVII can be expressed mathe- 
matically by the equation 
Aw = 2Av +o +44(- 1471 (2) 
Beginning with the element Ni, this relation ceases to hold accu- 
rately for the elements of higher atomic weights until we reach 
the radioactive elements where it again holds. Its apparent 
failure for many of the elements of atomic numbers between 28 
and 80 may well be due to the presence of two or more isotopes 
in the element as it occurs in nature. The apparently excep- 
tional behavior of Cl, Mg, and Si is also due to the fact that 
these elements are isotopic mixtures. The formula given in the 
table is for one of these isotopes only in each instance. 
Problem 1.—To what elements would atoms having the following nuclear 
formulas belong. ase2, azhse2, asAhze2, ash, ashe? Calculate the atomic 
weight of each of these atomic species. What elements would be produced, 
if the bombardment of nitrogen by a-particles resulted in driving out of 
the nucleus, h in part of the collisions and hz in others? 
5. The Arrangement of the Electrons Exterior to the Nucleus. 
Two types of theories have been advanced for the purpose of 
correlating the known properties of an atom with the arrangement 
of its non-nuclear electrons. The first type of theory is mainly 
due to the work of the physicists—Thomson, Rutherford, 
Bohr,’ Nicholson’ and Kossel? and assumes that the non-nuclear 
electrons rotate or vibrate in orbits about the nucleus. This

type of theory has been most successful in connection with the 
quantitative interpretation of radiation phenomena, specific 
heats, the photo-electric effect, and characteristic X-rays, but 
has found very little application in the interpretation of the 
chemical properties of the atom. 
The second type of theory is based mainly upon the known 
chemical behavior of the elements as depicted by the periodic 
system, and the atom model of this theory has been highly suc- 
cessful in interpreting all of the chemical and many of the physical 
properties of the elements. This theory, originated by G. N 
Lewis and developed and extended by Langmuir, has been vari- 
ously called the theory of the ‘cubical atom,” the theory of the 
“static atom,” and the “‘octet theory.” 
In this theory the electrons are assumed to oscillate or vibrate 
about certain fixed positions in such a way that the whole sys- 
tem of planetary electrons of a given atom constitutes a sym- 
metrical arrangement in space. The electrons are assumed to 
be arranged in a series of concentric shells, the first shell contain- 
ing two electrons, while all of the others tend to hold eight, these 
eight being placed symmetrically at the corners of a cube or in 
pairs at the corners of a regular tetrahedron. No shell can 
contain more than 8 electrons but the outer shell may contain 
2, 4 or 6 depending upon the total number of electrons in the 
atom. When atoms combine this process usually consists in 
the sharing of two outer electrons by the two atoms. These two 
electrons constitute the chemical bond, that is, in the molecule . 
each bond-electron is a part of the outer shell of both atoms. 
The various hypotheses which make up this theory have been 
summarized by Langmuir in the following postulates: 
1. The electrons in atoms are either stationary or rotate, 
revolve or oscillate about definite positions in the atom. The 
electrons of the most stable atoms, namely, those of the inert 
gases, have positions symmetrical with respect to a plane called 
the equatorial plane, passing through the nucleus at the center 
of the atom. No electrons lie in the equatorial plane. There is 
an axis of symmetry (polar axis) perpendicular to the plane 
through which four secondary planes of symmetry pass, form- 
ing angles of 45° with each other. These atoms thus have the 
symmetry of a tetragonal crystal. 
30 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
  466 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXVII 
2. The electrons in any given atom are distributed through a 
series of concentric (nearly) spherical shells, all of equal thickness. 
Thus the mean radii of the shells form an arithmetrical series 
1, 2, 3, 4, and the effective areas are in the ratios 1:27: 37:4%. 
3. Each shell is divided into cellular spaces or cells occupying 
equal areas in their respective shells and distributed over the 
surface of the shells according to the symmetry required by 
postulate 1. The first shell thus contains 2 cells, the second 8, 
the third 18, and the fourth 32. 
4. Each of the cells in the first shell can contain only one elec- 
tron, but each other cell can contain either one or two. All the 
inner shells must have their full quotas of electrons before the 
outside shell can contain any. No cell in the outside layer can 
contain two electrons until all the other cells in this layer contain 
at least one. 
5. Two electrons in the same cell do not repel or attract one 
another with strong forces. This probably means that there is a 
magnetic attraction (Parson’s magneton theory) which nearly 
counteracts the electrostatic repulsion. 
6. When the number of electrons in the outside layer is small, 
the arrangement of the electrons is determined by the (magnetic?) 
attraction of the underlying electrons. But when the number of 
electrons increases, especially when the layer is nearly complete, 
the electrostatic repulsion of the underlying electrons and of 
those in the outside shell becomes predominant. P 
7. The properties of the atoms are determined by the number 
and arrangement of the electrons in the outside layer and the ease 
with which they are able to revert to more stable forms by giving 
up or taking up electrons, or by sharing their outside electrons 
with atoms with which they combine. The tendencies to revert 
to the forms represented by the atoms of the inert gases are the 
strongest, but there are a few other forms of high symmetry 
such as those corresponding to certain possible forms of nickel 
palladium, erbium and platinum atoms towards which atoms 
have a weaker tendency to revert (by giving up electrons only). 
8. The stable and symmetrical arrangements of electrons cor- 
responding to the inert gases are characterized by strong internal 
and weak external fields of force. The smaller the atomic 
number, the weaker the external field.
-P-A-G-E-495
  Suc. 5] ATOMIC STRUCTURE 467 
9. The most stable arrangement of electrons is that of the 
pair in the helium atom. A stable pair may also be held by: (a) a 
single hydrogen nucleus: (6) two hydrogen nuclei; (¢) a hydro- 
gen nucleus and the kernel of another atom; (d) two atomic 
kernels (very rare). 
10. The next most stable arrangement of electrons is the octet, 
that is, a group of eight electrons like that in the second shell of 
the neon atom. Any atom with atomic number less than twenty, 
and which has more than three electrons in its outside layer tends 
to take up enough electrons to complete its octet. 
11. Two octets may hold one, two, or sometimes three pairs 
of electrons in common. One octet may share one, two, three or 
four pairs of its electrons with one, two, three or four other octets. 
One or more pairs of electrons in an octet may be shared by the 
corresponding number of hydrogen nuclei. No electron can be 
shared by more than two octets. 
This theory explains the periodic properties of all the elements, 
including those of the eighth group and the rare earths. It also 
meets with success in explaining the magnetic properties of the 
elements, and, in fact, it applies as well to the so-called physical 
properties, such as boiling points, freezing points, electric conduc- 
tivity, etc., as it does to the “chemical” properties. It leads to a 
simple theory of chemical valence applying equally well to polar 
and to non-polar substances. In the case of organic compounds 
the results are identical with those of the ordinary valence theory, 
but with oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, sulphur and phosphorus 
compounds the new theory applies as well as to inorganic com- 
pounds, where the ordinary valence theory fails completely. 
This theory explains also the structure of compounds which, 
according to Werner’s theory, are second order compounds with a 
coérdination number equal to four. According to the present 
theory such compounds are to be regarded rather as typical 
primary valence compounds. 
This valence theory is based on the following simple equation: 
e = 8n — 2p 
where e is the total number of available electrons in the outside 
shells of all the atoms in a molecule; n is the number of octets 
forming the outside shells, and p is the number of pairs of elec-
-P-A-G-E-496
468 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXVII 
trons held in common by the octets. This equation is a complete 
mathematical statement of the primary valence requirements, 
not only in organic but also in inorganic chemistry. 
The inert gases are those in which all the cells in the outside 
shell have equal numbers of electrons. Thus, according to the 
first four postulates, helium has two electrons, neon has ten, argon. 
eighteen, krypton thirty-six, xenon fifty-four and niton eighty- 
six. All atoms with an atomic number greater than that of 
helium (2) have as their first shell a pair of electrons close to the 
nucleus. The line connecting the two electrons establishes the 
polar axis for the atom. Neon has in its second shell eight elec- 
trons, four in each hemisphere (7. e., above and below the equa- 
torial plane), arranged symmetrically about the polar axis. The 
eight electrons are thus nearly at the corners of acube. In argon 
there are eight more electrons in the second shell. In all elements 
of higher atomic number the second shell is like that in argon. 
Krypton has in its third shell nine electrons in each hemisphere, 
symmetrically placed with respect to the polar axis and to the 
four electrons in the second shell. The ninth electron in each 
hemisphere goes into the polar axis. This fact accounts for the 
position and properties of iron, cobalt and nickel. Xenon is like 
krypton, except that it has twice as many electrons in its third 
shell. Niton has sixteen electrons in each hemisphere of its 
fourth shell. These are easily placed symmetrically with respect 
to the polar axis and the eight underlying electrons. 
This theory leads to very definite conceptions as to the posi- 
tions of the electrons in the molecules or space lattices of com- 
pounds. The structures of molecules of Ne, CO, HCN and NO 
prove to be exceptional in that the kernels of both atoms in the 
molecule are contained within a single octet. This accounts 
for the practically identical “physical” properties of nitrogen 
and carbon monoxide and for the abnormal inertness of molecular 
nitrogen. 
The results obtained by the use of the postulates are so striking 
that one may safely reason that they establish the fundamental 
correctness of the theory even though modifications may and 
doubtless will be made as it becomes more fully developed and 
tested. For the details of the application of this theory to 
numerous cases the student should consult the following papers;

The small numbers appearing in the table are the atomic numbers of 
the corresponding elements. The Roman numerals in the first column 
represent the serial numbers of the outer shell of the atom, the Italic let- 
ters indicating the outside layer of this shell. The numbers in the second 
vertical column represent the index number. In order to find the number 
of electrons in the unfilled outside layer of any atom in the table, subtract 
from its atomic number, the immediately preceding index number found 
in column 2. 
The hydrogen atom consists simply of one positive electron 
with one negative electron revolving about it, and is not repre- 
sented on the chart. The first atom represented on the chart is

  470 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY [Cuav. XXVII 
He, consisting of a nucleus of four positive electrons (hydrogen 
nuclei) ‘‘cemented’”’ by two (negative) electrons and having two 
electrons (the first ‘‘shell’’) exterior to the nucleus. In the next 
and all succeeding elements up to K, the atom consists of a 
kernel, pictured only in the case of Li, composed of a nucleus 
(composition not pictured, see Table XXXVII), and the He 
shell, surrounded by the second shell. This second shell contains 
the number of electrons indicated, its eight cells being filled with 
one electron each when we reach Ne and with two electrons each 
when we reach A. The chemical properties of the elements of 
the first two rows are determined by their tendencies to revert, 
by taking on or giving up electrons, to the stable form of the 
next preceding or following zero-group element. 
From K to Cs the kernel of the atom is identical with the argon 
atom except for its nucleus which is, of course, different for each 
element. This kernel is pictured (without its 18 electrons) only 
in the case of K, Ni, Kr and Xe, but is understood to be present 
in each case. The shell of the atom contains 18 cells and, begin- 
ning with K, electrons are added as shown, all the cells being 
filled only when we reach Kr. Atom number 26, Fe, while it has 
the same symmetry as Ne or Ar, thus does not otherwise resemble 
them, since it still contains 14 empty cells. Br and I, on the 
other hand, resemble Cl and F because they lack only one electron 
of having all their cells filled. As explained above, the 8 forms 
of Ni and Pd merely represent comparatively stable forms which 
the immediately succeeding atoms tend to revert to, by loss of 
electrons. Thus, this tendency gives Cu and Ag a positive val- 
ance of one but this is not exhibited to the same degree as that of 
the alkali metals where this valence is due to the tendency to 
revert to the very stable form of the immediately preceding zero 
group element. 
With Xe all the cells of the second shell are completely filled 
and with Cs the filling of the third shell begins. This shell 
contains 32 cells and the filling proceeds as before (see Table 
XXXVIII for the remainder of the elements). The filling 
of these cells once, takes us through the long series of rare 
earth metals, ending finally in the zero group element Nt. After 
Nt the second filling of the third shell begins but the periodic

For further details of this theory the papers of Langmuir should

produced here.

  APPENDIX 
THERMODYNAMIC DERIVATIONS 
Tue Prerrect THERMODYNAMIC ENGINE 
1. Introduction.—In the preceding pages it has been frequently 
necessary to employ various purely thermodynamic equations, 
the derivations of which were not given. It was merely stated 
that they were necessary consequences of the First and Second 
Laws of Thermodynamics. It is the purpose of the present chap- 
ter to indicate the methods by which these important and funda- 
mental relationships are derived. For this purpose we shall make 
use of a perfect thermodynamic engine (X, 8) arranged so that it 
can be driven by the physico-chemical reaction under considera- 
tion. The student who familiarizes himself with the use of this 
engine will find thermodynamic derivations greatly simplified and 
after a little practice will find that the desired result can usually 
be written down simply by inspection. Furthermore, the exact 
significance of each of the quantities involved in the result is 
made perfectly clear by the nature of the processes which accom- 
pany the operation of the engine. 
2. Description of the Engine.—Figs. 82 and 83 illustrate types 
of the engine, the essential parts of which are the following (see 
Fig. 82): 
Two reaction chambers, E and E’ (the ‘“‘boilers’”’), contain the 
system under consideration. Each chamber is placed in a reser- 
voir, R and R’, of infinite heat capacity, for the purpose of main- 
taining a constant temperature within the chamber. Each 
chamber is fitted with a set of cylinders, A, B, D, A’, B’, D’, etc., 
which connect with it, when necessary, through suitable sem7- 
permeable membranes, aa, a’a’. The cylinders are fitted with 
frictionless pistons, A, B, D, A’, B’, D’, etc., which may be semi- 
permeable or impermeable as required. Each corresponding 
pair of pistons is connected by a rigid piston rod, thus forming a 
compound piston, AA’, BB’, DD’, etc. The piston rods have zero

heat capacities and are non-conductors of heat and electricity, 
and the two reservoirs, R and R’, are otherwise insulated from 
each other so that no irreversible transfer of heat can take place 
between them. By irreversible transfer of heat is meant a flow 
of heat from a higher to a lower temperature without the produc- 
tion of maximum work (X, 7 and 8). 
3. The “Operation” of the Engine.—The ‘‘operation”’ of the 
engine consists in the movement of the compound pistons through 
finite distances, accompanied by corresponding processes which 
take place within the reaction chambers. These processes con- 
stitute the physico-chemical reaction under consideration and the 
process which takes place in chamber E must always be exactly 
the reverse of the process which occurs in chamber E’. 
During the operation of the engine the following conditions 
must be fulfilled: (1) The two reservoirs must never differ from 
each other in temperature by more than an infinitesimal amount: 
when such a difference exists, the temperature of R will be desig- 
. nated by TJ and that of R’ by 7 + dT: (2) the pressure differ- 
ence against the two heads of a compound piston must never 
exceed an infinitesimal amount; the pressures exerted against 
the pistons of E will be designated by p, P, II, etc., those exerted 
against the pistons of E’, by P+ dP, p+ dp, Il + dil, ete.; 
(3) each compound piston must always move so as to pro- 
duce the maximum amount of external work, there being applied 
to it a compensating external pressure substantially equal to the 
pressure difference on the two piston heads; and (4) the rates of 
motion of all the pistons must be so regulated that the equilibrium. 
within the reaction chambers remains undisturbed. In other 
words, the engine must always operate reversibly. 
4. The Work Performed by the Engine.—According to the 
Second Law of the work, dA, performed by a perfect heat engine 
operating between the temperatures 7 and T + dT is (see X, 8 
and 11) 
d4 = Qt (1) 
where Q, the heat absorbed at the higher temperature, represents 
the heat effect (reckoned as heat absorbed) of the physico-chemical 
reaction which takes place in the chamber E’. Just what this 
reaction is in a given case will be made perfectly clear by watching
-P-A-G-E-507
Suc. 5] - APPENDIX 477 
the operation of the engine. If d7’ = 0, that is, if the process is 
an isothermal one, then evidently dA = 0 also. After the opera- 
tion of the engine the desired result is obtained simply by writing 
down the work performed by each of the compound pistons and 
iT placing the sum equal to oF, or to zero, as the case may be. 
In reckoning the work performed by any given compound pis- 
ton it should be remembered that the piston always moves under 
an infinitesimal constant pressure difference and that hence the 
expression for the work which it performs will always be of the 
form vdp, where v is the volume through which the piston moves. 
(Cf. equation 3, X.) In some instances dp may be zero. 
It should also be noted that the algebraic expression for the 
work performed by any compound piston during the operation of 
the engine will have a positive sign when the motion is from right 
to left and a negative sign when the motion is from left to right. 
This convention with ‘regard to the sign of the work is of course an 
arbitrary one. The reverse convention would do equally well. 
5 The Method of Using the Engine.—The beginner will find 
it helpful to adopt a definite procedure to be employed in every 
instance. The following general procedure is recommended for 
this purpose. It is applicable to every case where it is desired 
to derive a differential equation which is a direct consequence of 
the Second Law of Thermodynamics alone. The procedure is 
conveniently divided into three stages which should be invariably 
followed in the order given. 
I. Filling the Engine.—Fill both chambers of the engine with 
the physico-chemical system under consideration and designate 
the vapor and osmotic pistons which it is desired toemploy. The 
pressures (p, Il, etc.) against these pistons will be the same on 
both sides of the engine. The lower piston DD’ will be used as 
the total-pressure piston in every case, that is, the pressure exerted 
against it from each side represents the total external pressure P 
applied to the systems in the two chambers. Bring the heat 
reservoirs R and R’ both to the temperature 7. The engine is 
now filled but is not yet ready for operation because the pressures 
against the opposite heads of each compound piston are exactly 
equal in every case and there is no tendency for any piston to 
move. Clamp each piston and proceed to step JZ, ~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-508
  478 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
IT. Changing the Variables—On the right-hand side of the 
engine, increase the value of the independent variable by an 
infinitesimal amount. The independent variable in any case is 
the quantity whose effect upon the system we wish to ascertain. 
Then indicate the corresponding increase in each of the dependent 
variables, that is, in each of the quantities whose variation with 
respect to the independent variable we wish to discover. ‘The 
changes in the dependent variables should always be indicated as 
increases without stopping to consider whether the change is really 
an increase or a decrease. This question will take care of itself. 
We are now ready for the operation of the engine. 
III. Operating the Engine—In the chamber E’ allow the 
physico-chemical reaction under consideration to proceed to com- 
pletion in the direction desired. At the same time move the neces- 
sary pistons reversibly in such directions as to maintain the 
physical condition and chemical composition of the system in 
chamber E’ exactly what it was at the moment of beginning the 
operation. The reaction in chamber E will be found to proceed 
in the reverse direction and the condition of the system in this 
chamber will also remain at all times just what it was at the 
beginning of the operation. If the student is careful to see that 
this condition is fulfilled, it will be impossible for him to operate 
the engine incorrectly. 
IV. Formulating the Result.—Write down the total work per- 
formed by the various pistons as directed in section 4 above and 
dT place the result equal to OT or to zero, as the case may be. 
In place of the letter Q, however, use a symbol indicating more 
specifically the nature of the heat effect of the process taking 
place in chamber E’. Finally rearrange the equation so that 
the left-hand side is a partial differential coefficient, indicating 
as subscripts the quantities or variables which are constant 
for the process under consideration. 
The use of the above method of procedure will be more clearly 
understood by considering some specific examples. The cases 
considered in what follows include the derivations of most of the 
thermodynamic equations employed in this book. In the first 
few cases considered the method of procedure outlined above will 
be gone through in detail, but afterward it will be sufficient to

indicate the condition of the engine just before beginning the 
operation: that is, the first two steps of the method of procedure 
will be left for the student to carry out. 
Vapor PRESSURE 
6. The Vapor Pressure of a Pure Substance. (a) Statement of 
the Problem.—The equilibrium between vapor and liquid (or 
vapor and crystal) in a one-component system may be altered; (a) 
by changing the total pressure on the liquid (or crystal) phase at 
constant temperature: (6) by changing the temperature of the 
system while keeping the pressure on the liquid (or crystal) 
phase constant: or (c) by changing the temperature of the sys- 
tem and at the same time allowing the total pressure on the 
liquid (or crystal) phase to vary in such a manner that it is 
always equal to the vapor pressure. We shall make use of the 
perfect thermodynamic engine in order to determine the separate 
effects of these different factors upon the vapor pressure of a 
pure liquid. The treatment for the case of a pure crystal is 
perfectly analogous, as is also the final equation obtained. 
(b) The Pressure Coefficient (7 = const.).—We shall use the 
engine shown in Fig. 82, omitting, however, pistons and cylinders 
BB’. 
I. The engine is filled as follows: Chamber E is filled with the 
liquid whose vapor pressure, acting through the membrane aa 
(permeable to the vapor only) against piston A, is p. The total 
pressure on the liquid, acting against piston D, is P. ‘Tempera- 
ture of R = 7. Chamber E’ is filled exactly as E. 
II, Change the pressure on piston D’ from P toP + dP. The 
pressure on piston A’ will then become p + dp, and the engine is 
ready for operation. 
III. Piston AA’ moves reversibly from right to left (under the 
pressure difference, dp), while one mole of the liquid in chamber E’ 
vaporizes through membrane a/a’ into cylinder A’ and one mole! of 
1 Strictly, the amounts of material which are vaporized and condensed 
respectively during the motion of the compound piston AA’ are not exactly 
equal but differ from each other by an infinitesimal amount. This difference 
need not be considered, however, as the amount of work involved in equaliz- 
ing it would be a differential of the second order and therefore negligible. 
(See Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc., 32, 472-474 (1910).)

    480 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
the vapor in cylinder A condenses through membrane aa into 
chamber E. At the same time piston DD’ moves reversibly from 
left to right (under the pressure difference, dP), through the 
volume, Vo, of one mole of the liquid. The work done by piston 
AA’ is vodp where v9 is the volume of one mole of the vapor at the 
temperature 7’ and pressure p. The work done by piston DD’ is 
—VodP. We have, therefore, 
vodp — VodP = 0 (2) 
or 
Op) _Vo (sp) r 0% (3) 
which is equation (7, XII). 
If the vapor obeys the perfect gas laws, equation (2) assumes 
the form 
  Dlog.p\ _ V'o(1 — BP) pene ee ©) 
where V’y is the molal volume of the liquid under zero pressure 
and B is the mean coefficient of compressibility of the liquid as 
yee 
defined by the equation 6 = nat) pe The equation can now   
be integrated. Since the right-hand member of equation (3) 
is necessarily positive, the vapor pressure always increases with 
increase in pressure on the liquid phase. The coefficient, 
(2) is is small for temperatures considerably removed from 
the critical temperature (thus for water at 0°, (28) ps 
= 3.6:10-° mm. per atmosphere) but increases with the tempera- 
ture and becomes equal to 1 at the critical temperature. 
(c) The Temperature Coefficient (P = const.).—Let us now 
consider the effect of temperature changes upon the vapor pres- 
sure of a liquid which is under constant external pressure P, 
such changes as would occur, for example, on heating the liquid 
in an open vessel exposed to the atmospheric pressure. As in 
the previous case, we will make use of the engine shown in 
Fig. 82, omitting cylinder BB’. 
I. The engine is filled as follows: Chamber E is filled with the 
liquid, whose vapor pressure, acting through the semipermeable

(i.e., only to the vapor) membrane against piston A, is p. Total 
pressure on liquid, acting against piston D, is P. Temperature 
of R = T. Chamber E’ is filled exactly as E. 
II, Change the temperature of reservoir R’ from 7 to T+ 
d7. The pressure against piston A’ will then become p + dp. 
The pressure against piston D’ remains P, however, by the

III. Piston AA’ moves reversibly from right to left (under the 
pressure difference, dp), while one mole of the liquid in chamber 
E’ evaporates through the membrane a’a’ into cylinder A’ and 
one mole? of the vapor in cylinder A condenses through membrane 
aa into chamber E. At the same time piston DD’ moves from 
left to right (under the pressure difference, zero) through the 
volume, Vo, of one mole of the liquid. This is necessary in order 
that the pressure upon the liquid in both chambers shall remain 
constant.

  482 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
IV. The work done by piston AA’ is vodp, where 2 is the molal 
volume of the vapor at the temperature 7’ and pressure p. The 
work done by piston DD’ is zero because the pressures are the 
same on both sides of it. The heat absorbed from reservoir 
R’ is the molal heat of vaporization L, of the liquid at the tem- 
perature 7’ and the constant pressure P, because vaporization of 
the liquid under these conditions is the physico-chemical reac- 
tion which takes place in chamber E’ during the operation of the 
engine. We have, therefore, 
dT 
  vodp = L, - (5a) 
or 
OD aie Ds 
(sn) Page (5b) 
which is equation (1, XII). 
(d) The Temperature Coefficient (P = p) —The latent heat of 
vaporization of a liquid is usually determined by condensing (in a 
calorimeter) the vapor of the boiling liquid. Under these condi- 
tions the liquid always forms, not under constant pressure at all 
temperatures, but under its own vapor pressure at each tem- 
perature. The temperature coefficient of the vapor pressure 
under these conditions can be at once written down, by using the 
engine shown in Fig. 82. The arrangement is exactly as in the 
preceding case except that the pressure against piston D is p and 
that against piston D’ is p + dp. The operation is exactly the 
same as before and we obtain at once the relation 
vodp — Vodp = iat (6a) 
or 
op pie eae ~(w—Vol (68) 
which is the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, equation (2, XII). 
Problem 1.—Carry out the above derivations using a crystalline sub- 
stance instead of a liquid. 
Problem 2.—Derive, with the aid of the engine, an expression for the coeffi- 
cient (Qe ), the rate of change of the freezing point with the external 
pressure: (1) when the pressure on both phases is the same; and (2) when 
the pressure on the crystalline phase, only, is varied.

7. The Vapor Pressures of the Constituents of a Solution.—If 
we are dealing with the partial vapor pressure of one of the con- 
stituents of a solution instead of with the vapor pressure of a 
pure liquid, the derivations are carried out exactly as above 
except that the chambers of the engine are made infinite in vol- 
ume. ‘This is necessary in order that the removal or insertion of 
one of the constituents, as a result of the motion of the vapor pis- 
ton AA’, shall not produce a change in the composition of the 
solution. ‘The final equations obtained will be identical in form 
with those given above except that for Vo we will write Vo, 
the partial molal volume (XII, 3) of the constituent in the 
solution, and for L, we will write L», the partial molal heat of 
vaporization of the constituent from the solution. The exact 
significance of these partial quantities will be clearly evident from 
the operation of the engine. 
Problem 3.—Derive equation (8, XII). (See Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc., 
32, 477-481.) 
Tur THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS CONNECTING THE COLLIGATIVE 
PROPERTIES OF A SOLUTION 
8. Description of the Engine-—The type of engine used is 
shown in Fig. 82. Both chambers are filled with the solution 7 
under investigation. Piston AA’ is a “vapor piston,” that is, as 
it moves reversibly toward the left, for example, it draws the 
vapor of the solvent out of chamber E’ and condenses it into 
chamber E. Piston BB’ is an “osmotic piston.” As it moves 
reversibly toward the left it allows solvent to enter chamber E’ by 
passing through the semipermeable head B’, while at the same 
time solvent is removed in a similar manner from chamber E, the 
space behind the two piston heads being filled with pure solvent. 
Piston DD’ is the total-pressure piston. It moves to the right or 
left during the operation of the engine whenever a volume change 
in the chambers renders it necessary, put since in the following 
treatment we shall deal always with a solution under constant 
external pressure (that of the atmosphere, for example), this 
piston will move only under a pressure difference of zero. Conse- 
quently no work is involved in its motion and it will not be neces- 
sary to pay any attention to it during the operation of the engine. 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
  484 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
For our solution we shall take any homogencous liquid mixture 
of any number of constituents, A, B, C, ete. Since the terms 
solvent and solute are perfectly arbitrary for such a solution 
(XI, 4), any constituent of the solution may be considered as the 
solvent in the following derivations. 
9. Osmotic Pressure and Vapor Pressure (P, J = const.).— 
To ask the question, “How does the vapor pressure of the solvent 
from any solution vary with the osmotic pressure?,’’ is equivalent 
to asking the question, ‘‘ How does the vapor pressure of the pure 
liquid solvent vary with the total pressure upon it?” (see defini- 
tion of osmotic pressure, equation (12, XII)) and this relation 
has already been derived. It is equation (3), which may be writ- 
ten as follows (since by definition dII = — dP: 
oe @ This is equation (15, XII). See problem 6, XII, for its integ- 
ration. 
Problem 4.—Derive equation (7) directly by means of the engine. 
10. Osmotic Pressure and Freezing-point Lowering (P = 
const).—The problem may be stated thus: ‘‘How does the 
osmotic pressure of a solution change with the temperature at 
which the solution is in equilibrium with the pure crystalline 
solvent?’ ‘The arrangement of the engine, ready for operation, 
is as follows: 
Chamber E: Filled with a solution in equilibrium with an 
excess of pure crystalline solvent and therefore (XI, 8) at the 
temperature of its freezing point, Ty. The mole fraction of the 
solvent is x. The pure liquid solvent (in cylinder B) is in equi- 
librium with the solution through the osmotic membrane of 
the piston head, the pressure difference on the two sides of the 
membrane being II. 
Chamber E’: Exactly as chamber E except that the mole frac- 
tion of the solvent is x + dz, the freezing point 7p + d7'p and 
the osmotic pressure II + dII. 
dII in this instance is given by the expression 
orl oT y orl 
at = (37), (or) At + (a¢),@2 . ®)
-P-A-G-E-515
  
Suc. 11] APPENDIX 485 
To operate the engine allow one mole of crystalline solvent to 
melt in chamber E’.and remove the resulting liquid osmotically 
with piston BB’ which moves reversibly toward the right. The 
reverse operation occurs in chamber E. The work done by piston 
BB’ is — VodIl. The heat absorbed at the higher temperature 
(i.e., from reservoir R’) is the molal heat of fusion (Ly) of the 
crystalline solvent, under the pressure P, to form liquid solvent 
under the pressure P — II, when this process takes place rever- 
sibly. This heat of fusion differs from the ordinary one merely 
by the value of the heat of compression of the liquid from P to 
P-—TIl. This difference is negligible for most practical purposes. 
We have, therefore, 
  
—vean = Leite (9) F 
or 
aml he (31) =~ Vat - 
which is equation (17, XII). For the integration of this equation 
see Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc., 32, 498 and 1636 (1910). 
11. Vapor Pressure and Freezing Point (P = const.).—The 
problem may be stated as follows: ‘‘How does the vapor pres- 
sure of the solvent from a solution vary with the temperature at 
which the solution is in equilibrium with the pure crystalline 
solvent?’”? Now the vapor pressures from the solution and the 
crystalline solvent are equal when the two are in equilibrium 
(X, 10); consequently this question is the same as inquiring, 
“How does the vapor pressure of the pure crystalline solvent 
vary with the temperature?” and this relation has already been 
derived. It is equation (5) which we may write as follows (using 
Ty in place of T to indicate that we mean the absolute tem- 
perature of the freezing point of the solution): 
Op nettle \

which is equation (14, XII). 
In this equation L, is the molal heat of sublimation of the pure 
crystalline solvent under the pressure P to form saturated vapor 
at the pressure p. dp is expressed by the equation.

Problem 5.—Derive equation (11) directly by means of the engine. 
Integrate the equation for water, on the assumption that the specific heat 
capacities of ice and its saturated vapor are equal. (Cf. equation (21, XX).) 
12. Surface Tension and Vapor Pressure.—The problem may 
be stated thus; ‘‘How does the surface tension of a solution 
vary with the partial vapor pressure of one of its constituents, 
At 
We shall use the engine shown in Fig. 82 except that piston 
BB’ will be a surface piston instead of an osmotic piston, that is, 
when it moves from right to left it increases the surface of the solu- 
tion in E by working against its surface tension y, while the 
surface of the solution in E’ is allowed to decrease under the pull 
of its surface tension. The particular mechanism by which the 
surface-piston functions in this way is obviously of no importance. 
I. The chambers of the engine which are infinite in volume 
are filled as follows:—Chamber E is filled with a solution of com- 
‘position 24, %, . . . ete. The partial vapor pressure, p, of 
‘constituent A acts through the membrane aa’ against the piston 
A. The total pressure on the solution, acting against piston D 
is P. The surface tension of the solution acting against piston 
B is y. Temperature of R= 7. Chamber E’ is filled exactly 
as E. 
II. Change the mole fraction of A in chamber E’ from a, to 
xz, +dz,. Its partial vapor pressure then becomes py + dp,, 
the surface tension of the solution becomes y + dy and the en- 
gine is ready to operate. 
III. Piston AA’ moves reversibly from right to left (under the 
pressure difference dp,) until one mole of A has been vaporized 
from E’ and condensed into E. At the same time surface-piston 
BB’ moves reversibly from right to left (under the force difference, 
dy) until the superficial area of the solution in E’ has decreased 
by S. sq. ems. and that of the solution in E has increased by the 
same amount, where S, is that surface which contains one mole 
of A in the adsorbed condition, that is, in excess of the amount 
necessary to give the surface film the same composition as the 
interior of the solution. S, may, of course, be either a positive 
or a negative quantity. 
The work done by piston AA’ is v.dp, and that by surface- 
piston BB’ isS,dy. That done by piston DD’, which moves from

13. Statement of the Problem.—Let us consider any chemical 
equilibrium, expressed by the equation 
aA + bB+....5mM+4+nN+.... (16) 
in which a mols of the substance A react with 6 mols of the sub- 
stance B, etc., to form m mols of the substance M and n mols of 
the substance N, etc. The substances entering into the reaction 
are in equilibrium with each other in any homogeneous phase and 
there may or may not also be present in the phase one or more 
other substances which do not take part in the reaction, a solvent 
or an indifferent gas, for example. The composition of the phase 
is represented by the equation 
mtept.... taom+ on ..s. it foe + .3.. = 17) 
where zg is the mole fraction of the constituent A, etc., numerical 
subscripts referring to substances which do not take part in the 
chemical equilibrium. 
Our problem is to determine in what direction and to what 
extent the chemical equilibrium is displaced by: (1) increasing 
the concentration (z.e., the mole fraction) of one of the reacting 
substances; (2) increasing the total pressure on the phase; and 
(3) increasing the temperature of the system. In deriving our 
fundamental equations it will be simpler to fix our attention 
chiefly upon some particular phase, and we shall choose a gaseous 
phase which, in addition to the reacting substances, contains also 
an indifferent gas which we shall call constituent 1. It would 
correspond to a solvent, if we were dealing with a liquid solution.

14. Arrangement of the Engine.—We shall make use of the 
engine shown in Fig. 83. The arrangement when ready for

The substances A, B,.. M, N,.. are in chemical equilibrium as 
expressed by the equation 
aA + 6B+ ...5mM+nN+.... 
The partial pressures of the substances taking part in the equi- 
librium act through suitable semipermeable membranes against 
the pistons as follows: pa against piston A, pp against piston B, 
pm against piston M, and py against piston N. The total pres- 
sure on the system as applied by piston D is P. 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
  Sec. 15] APPENDIX 489 
Chamber E’: Analogous in every respect to chamber E except 
that the equilibrium has been slightly displaced by some cause 
so that the partial pressures from this chamber have become 
pa + dpa against piston A’, pp + dpz against piston B’, etc. 
15. Operation of the Engine.—The operation of the engine 
consists in the movement of pistons AA’ an BB’ toward the right 
until a moles of A and 6 moles of B have been forced into E’ and 
drawn out of E; and the simultaneous movement of pistons 
MM’ and NN’ toward the left, removing m moles of M and n 
moles of N from E’ (as fast as they are formed by the reacting 
of the A and B which are being introduced by pistons AA’ and 
BB’) and forcing them into E (as fast as they are required to re- 
place, by reaction, the A and B which are being removed by 
pistons AA’ and BB’). The equilibrium is thus not disturbed 
in either chamber. Piston DD’ does not move, because all the 
material which is forced into a chamber by one pair of pistons is 
removed by the other pair and hence no volume change occurs 
in either chamber during the operation of the engine. It is 
therefore immaterial whether the total pressures are the same 
in both chambers or not.

i dT Q i is equal to (1) zero, or (2) QT according as the displacement 
of the equilibrium in chamber E’ is brought about by changing 
(1) the composition, or the total pressure, or both; or (2) the 
temperature. 
In the former case we have, therefore, 
D*mvydpy=0 (18) 
which is equation (4, XXII). In this equation dp for each

(32) az, P being the total pressure on the system and x the 
mole fraction of any constituent of the system whether it be con- 
cerned in the chemical reaction or not. In other words, if the 
chemical equilibrium be displaced in one direction or the other 
by changing either the pressure or the composition of the gas or 
both, the corresponding changes in the partial pressures of the 
molecular species concerned in the equilibrium must occur in such 
a way as to fulfill the condition represented by equation (18). 
If the shift in the equilibrium is brought about by changing the 
temperature of chamber E’ from T' to 7'+dT, we obtain equation 
(47, XXII) which is 
@ —, _ Hp (19) oT or 
where Hp, the heat-of-the-reaction (XIX, 5), is the heat evolved 
when the reaction as written takes place at constant pressure, from 
right to left, that is, so as to produce the substances A and B. 
In the operation of the engine it will be noted that in chamber 
E’ the reaction proceeds from left to right, that is, so as to produce 
M and N, and hence, according to section 4 above, Hp is the 
heat absorbed during this process. 
17. Chemical Equilibrium in Solution—The thermodynamic 
laws governing chemical equilibrium in solution may be conven- 
iently derived in terms of the osmotic pressures of the substances 
concerned in the equilibrium. The operation of the engine is very 
similar to that described above for gases, the chief difference being 
that the substances involved in the equilibrium are removed 
from and introduced into the chambers by means of osmotic pis- 
tons instead of vapor pistons. Thus if the chambers contain a 
dilute solution of the substances A, B, M, and N in chemical 
equilibrium with one another, then cylinder A will be separated 
from chamber E by means of a membrane permeable only to the 
substance A and will contain (in front of the piston) a dilute solu- 
tion of A at such a concentration, C,, that it is in osmotic 
equilibrium with the solution in chamber E. The piston A is an 
osmotic piston permeable only to the pure solvent and only the
-P-A-G-E-521
Src. 17] APPENDIX 491 
pure solvent is contained in that portion of the cylinder behind 
the piston head. Piston and cylinder A’ are similarly arranged. 
Now then, if piston AA’ be moved reversibly toward the right, 
the solvent will flow through the semipermeable head of piston 
A and will thus dilute the solution of A contained in the cylinder. 
This solution will then no longer be in osmotic equilibrium with 
the solution in chamber E and in order to restore the equilibrium 
the substance A will pass through the membrane aa from cham- 
ber E into cylinder A. The reverse operation occurs on the other 
side of the engine and we thus see that the motion of the osmotic 
piston AA’ from left to right results in the removal of A from 
chamber E and the introduction of A into chamber E’, just as in 
the case of a vapor piston moving in the same direction. The 
other three pistons are arranged similarly and if, for example, 
reservoir R is at the temperature 7 and reservoir R’ at the tem- 
perature 7+ dT, the operation of the engine gives us 
=+ mVudIIy = Q oq (20) 
where Q is the heat absorbed when the reaction, aA+bB=mM-+nN, 
takes place in dilute solution under such conditions that it per- 
forms the maximum amount of external work, for this is what 
happens in reservoir R’ during the operation of the engine. 
Now the work performed by chamber E’ during the operation 
is (neglecting differential quantities) 
W maz = MV ylly + NV ylly — aV,T,.— bV,05 (21) 
and for a dilute solution, according to equation (28, XIV), ITV = 
RT for each mole of solute, thus giving us 
W max = (m+n —a—b)kT (22) 
According to the First Law of Thermodynamics we have 
AU =Q-—W (23) 
and hence 
Q=AU+ (m+n—a—b)RT (24) 
Now by definition 
pee AC. 
and from equation (28, XIV) we obtain 
I= CRT (25)

  492 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
and by differentiation 
dil = RTdC + RCAT (26) 
and 
Vall = RTdlog.C + RAT (27) 
Combining this with equation (20) above gives

Problem 17.—At 18° the specific conductance of a 0.1250 formal solution 
of the weak acid diketotetrahydrothiazole (C;NH;O8) is 47.1-10-* reciprocal

to form bicarbonate with the base present. Assume that this excess car- 
ponie acid (‘free carbonic acid”) amounts to about 0.0003 mole of CO, per 
liter (an ‘acidity of 30 parts per million’) and the total carbonate (i.e., 
CO, as acid or normal carbonate) to about 0.007 mole of CO: per liter (an

Problem 21.—Determine the change in total energy which occurs when 
one mole of orthonitrobenzoic acid changes from the ionized state to the 
crystalline state at 20°, using the following experimental data: (1) 500 grams 
of a 14 wt. normal solution of KOH were first saturated with the ortho- 
nitrobenzoic acid at 19° and this solution was removed from the excess 
solid and placed, together with a piece of thin gold foil, in an adiabatic 
calorimeter at 19.20°. 573 grams of a 14 wt. normal solution of HNO; at 
19.20° were then run in and after stirring, the temperature rose to a constant 
maximum value of 20.00 + 0.01°. (2) The precipitate in the calorimeter 
was collected, dried and enclosed in the piece of gold foil so as to form a 
flat compact capsule. This was placed in the clean calorimeter together 
with 500 grams of the KOH solution and the whole brought to 17.00°. 573 
grams of the HNOssolution at the same temperature were then run in and a 
maximum temperature of 20.05° attained. The heat of neutralization of 
KOH by HNO; (}4n) at 20° is 13,720 cal. per mole. The solubility of 
orthonitrobenzoic acid in water at 20° is 0.0379 mole per 1000 g. and the 
degree of ionization of the saturated solution, as obtained from conductance 
measurements, is 33.6 per cent. The laws of mass action and of solubility

whose initial temperature is 20°. After the explosion it is found that for 
each gram of hydrogen in the bomb 342 grams of ice must be added to the 
calorimeter in order to restore its temperature to 20°. The heat of fusion 
of ice at 0° may be taken as 79.6 cal. Assuming (1) that at the end of the 
experiment all of the water produced by the explosion is in the liquid form,

walls of the bomb until the reaction is complete, and (3) that the reaction 
goes to completion at all temperatures, what would be the maximum tem-

direction will the transition temperature be changed per atmosphere in- 
crease in pressure? Use Reicher’s value for the heat of transition. The 
difference between the specific volumes, v,, and v, of monoclinic and rhombic 
sulphur at the transition point was determined by means of adilatometer 
and found to be vm — v, = 0.0126 c.c. (Reicher found experimentally that 
the transition temperature changed 0.04° — 0.05° for each atmosphere 
inerease in pressure.)

passed slowly over a long layer of the spongy platinum at 300° and then after 
cooling to 0° is passed through a glass spiral immersed in liquid air. This 
process is repeated several times. For additional data see problem 27 above

The initial concentration of the dibromsuccinic acid is 5.11 units per liter. 
At the end of the first ten minutes it has fallen to 3.77 and at the end of the 
next ten minutes to 2.74 units per liter. From these data calculate two

Problem 31.—At 18° the solubility product for AgCl is 1.11-10-1°. If 
conductivity water having a specific conductance of 0.4-10~® mhos at 18° is 
saturated with AgCl at this temperature, what will be the specific conduct- 
ance of the saturated solution?

a mixture of 0.1 mole of KCl and 0.01 mole of HCl is added and the initial 
rate of inversion found to be R moles of sugar per second. What will be

Problem 33.—Two substances, A and B, have the same melting point

SO.-hydrate, ice, soln. of water in liquid SOz2, soln. of SO2 in water, vapor. 
Problem 35.—Mr. A claims to have found an exception to the Second 
Law of thermodynamics, based upon the following data: He prepared in a 
high state of purity a new and very stable crystalline substance. Three 
very careful determinations of the melting point by the capillary tube 
method gave 103.22°, 103.21° and 103.23°, respectively. The vapor pressure 
of the crystals was determined at 99°, 100°, 101°, 102° and 103°, using the 
differential tensimeter, in a thermostat regulated to 0.01°, the tensimeter 
being kept a week at each temperature previous to making the reading. 
The vapor pressure of the liquid was then determined at 103.25°, 104°, 105° 
and 106° without opening the apparatus. Both sets of measurements were 
then repeated in the reverse direction. On plotting the data the two series 
on the crystals and the two on the liquid checked very closely. The two 
vapor pressure curves, however, intersected at 101.13°. The same thermom- 
eter was used throughout the work and all corrections to it were properly 
made, The substance did not form a second crystal phase but melted 
sharply to a clear liquid. The heat of fusion was about 40 cal. per gram 
and the change in volume on melting (determined by melting under oil) was 
0.1 ce. per gram. State whether you agree or disagree with Mr. A’s claim

  500 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
INDUSTRIAL HYDROGEN 
The following set of problems illustrates the application of 
physico-chemical principles to certain of the processes used or 
proposed for manufacturing hydrogen for industrial purposes.! 
For the sake of illustration the computed values are carried out 
to more significant figures than the accuracy of the data now 
available would justify. The figures which are not significant 
are, however, given in Italics. Parenthetical references to 
Martin, (M.) refer to Martin’s Industrial Chemistry, Ist. Ed., 
Crosby, Lockwood and Son. 
A. BY THE LANE PROCESS. (M.I. 111) 
In the Lane Process for manufacturing hydrogen, steam is 
passed over metallic iron at 900-1000°. The FesO4 produced is 
then reduced by passing CO (i.e. producer gas) over it at the 
same temperature. The reactions are as follows: 
  3Fe+4H,0 = Fes0.+4H2 () 
Fes0.+4C0 =3Fe+4COz (2) 
  
1. Percentage yield at 900°.—Assuming that equilibrium is 
obtained at 900° and that the gas issues from the furnace at a 
pressure of 1 atmosphere, calculate in per cent. by weight the 
amount of water and the amount of hydrogen which it will 
contain. (XXII, Prob. 29.) 
Ans. Per cent. H,O0 = 86.3 Per cent. He = 13.7 
2. Derive the thermo-chemical equations for reactions (1) and 
(2) and show that the percentage yield of hydrogen will increase 
as the temperature employed decreases. Show also that the 
equilibrium in reaction No, 2 is nearly independent of the 
temperature. 
Ans. 3Fe+4H0 =Fes0.+4H,+19900 
3Fe+4C02 =Fes0.+400 —3100 
3. Given, Cy = 6.50 + 0.00097 for H». and Cp = 8.81 — 
1 Every important industrial chemical process should receive a searching 
analysis at the hands of a competent physical chemist and steps taken to 
secure any requisite missing numerical data. Only after such knowledge 
1s available will it be possible to place the chemical industries upon a truly 
scientific basis. (Cf. Washburn, Chem. Met. Eng., 23, 485 (1920).

0.00197 + 0.0000022T? for H,O, calculate the value of 
" 4(C% — C#°) for t = 600°, and for t = 300°. 
Ans. —0.53 and —1.04 cal. 
4. Given (L-B-R), cp (24°-99°) = 0.1678 cal. for FesOs 
and cp (18°-100°) = 0.113 cal. for Fe, calculate the value of 
crs — 3C* for this temperature range. 
Ans. 19.9 cal. 
5. Assuming that the value 19.9 cal. does not change with 
the temperature calculate the value of AC, for reaction (1). 
Ans. 20.0 cal. 
6. Calculate the heat of the reaction at 100° and at 900°. 
Ans. Hp = 18300 cal. at 100° 
p = 3500 cal. at 900° 
7. Variation of the equilibrium constant with temperature.— 
Using the above value. for AC, compute a general expression for 
RT log K, for reaction (1) (XX eq. 21, XIX eq. 37; XXII eq. 
45). 
Ans. RT log, Kp = 4.573 T log Kp = —160.51T + 25760 
+ 46.06 T logio T; and logio Kp = —35.10 + one + 10.06 logis T 
8. Percentage yield theoretically obtainable by operating 
at 300° and at 100° respectively—Repeat the calculation in 
problem 1 for 100° and for 300° respectively. In view of the 
higher yield theoretically obtained at the lower temperature 
why is the Lane Process carried out industrially at 900°-1000°? 
Ans. mz, = 25.6 per cent. at 100° = 68.2 per cent. at 300°. 
B. BY THE BERGIUS MODIFICATION OF THE LANE 
PROCESS. (M.I. 111) 
9. Advantages of using liquid water instead of steam.—What 
effect would increase of pressure (i.e. pz, + pu.o) at constant 
temperature have upon the equilibrium of reaction (1); (a) if 
the water is present as vapor only; and (b) if the water is present 
as liquid? 
10. Compute the thermo-chemical equation for reaction (1) 
with water present as liquid and show that in this case the 
yield of hydrogen at first increases with rising temperature 
instead of with falling temperature as was the case with the 
Lane Process,
-P-A-G-E-532
  502 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 
Above a certain temperature, however, the sign of the tem- 
perature influence will change and thereafter the yield of He will 
decrease with rising temperature. Calculate this ‘“inversion’’ 
temperature. 
Ans.3Fe-+4H,0 =Fe,0.+4H2—20060 
t = 710°, inversion temperature. 
1014. Calculate Hp for the Bergius reaction. 
Ans. 22400 cal. 
11. Maximum pressure developed.—Iron is heated in contact 
with liquid water in a closed vessel until equilibrium is obtained. 
What is the order of magnitude of the maximum pressure which 
will be developed at equilibrium (a) at 100° and (b) at 300°? 
What is the partial pressure of the hydrogen? 
Note:—In solving this problem take account of the variation 
of the vapor pressure of the water with the pressure which the 
hydrogen exerts on it, and also the influence of the dissolved hy- 
drogen upon the vapor pressure of the water. 
Ans. pu, = 26.4 at. at 100° 
Pax. = 27.4 at. at 100° 
Py, = 508 at. at 300° 
Pyax. = 623 at. at 300°. 
12. Percentage yield of hydrogen in the Bergius Process.—If 
the Bergius Process is operated at 300° and the resulting hydrogen 
allowed to escape through a valve at 120 atmospheres what 
per cent. of water will it contain? 
Ans. my,0 = 95.6 per cent H.O 
13. What could you add to the reaction vessel in the Bergius 
Process to ‘‘catalyse” the reaction? 
14. Could you design an apparatus which would permit the 
eseape of the hydrogen from the reaction vessel without permit- 
ting the water to escape? What effect would such an arrange- 
ment have upon the efficiency of the process, assuming that the 
device permitted the hydrogen to escape with sufficient rapidity? 
15. How would the efficiency of the Bergius Process be in- 
fluenced by use of a strong salt solution, such as a concentrated 
solution of calcium chloride, in place of water?

  Nortr.—Since Figs. 82 and 83 will need to be referred to fre- 
quently, it was deemed advisable to print them on a separate, 
perforated sheet, which is bound at the back of the book, so

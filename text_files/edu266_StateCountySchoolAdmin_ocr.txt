INTRODUCTION 
In a companion volume of Principles, to be issued shortly, the 
authors of this volume of Sources have elaborated the principles 
underlying state educational control which have grown out of 
American experience with the public school systems of the states. 
These principles, promising, as they do, to become a guide for the 
solution of the difficult political problem of adapting the form 
and operation of educational institutions to the changes constantly 
demanded by the progressive evolution of our civilization, are, 
we feel, entitled to the serious study of both educationalists and 
publicists. 
The present volume of Sources seeks to make readily accessible 
to students of educational administration some of the more im- 
portant material illustrative of the principles of proper state 
and county school administration. No attempt has been made 
to include material that, would comprehend all of the varied fea- 
tures of educational administration, but rather to parallel the 
book of Principles with a few of the more pertinent documents, 
arranged under the same divisions and chapter headings into 
which the book of Principles will be divided. It is believed that 
the present volume contains typical records reflecting the ideas 
and practices that have molded and still continue to influence 
the form of our educational organization, the manner of our 
educational administration, and, without question, the ultimate 
results of the school systems of the United States. 
The underlying purpose of the two volumes on State and 
County School Administration will be to distinguish, in what 
appears to be a conglomerate mass of hit-and-miss experiments, 
those fundamental principles of educational organization and 
administration which American democracy has developed for 
the operation and control of its systems of public education. 
The material contained in this volume, as well as the subject

  xx INTRODUCTION 
matter of the companion volume, has been collected and tested 
in class use in the two institutions which the two authors repre- 
sent. Portions of the material have also been used with summer- 
session classes in other institutions. 
The first of the authors of this series has also further elabo- 
rated the principles underlying proper state and county school 
administration in his State and County Educational Reorganiza- 
tion. In this volume the principles set forth in this series have 
been given concrete expression in the form of a Constitution and 
detailed School Code for a hypothetical American state. The 
second of the authors of this series expects to publish in the 
immediate future a volume of Legal Decisions relating to Educa- 
tion, in which the fundamental questions of public educational 
policy and of administrative procedure, as interpreted by our 
highest courts, are set forth. These two volumes may be con- 
sidered as additional source books, each of a different type, to 
illustrate the forthcoming volume of Principles. 
The authors desire to record their indebtedness to those many 
educational officers from whose official reports material has been 
freely taken. It is very appropriate, furthermore, to acknowledge 
with appreciation the timely assistance given by President 
Henry S. Pritchett of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance- 
ment of Teaching, Professor John Dewey of Columbia University, 
Professor John A. Fairlie of the University of Illinois, Professor 
W. A. Rawles of the University of Indiana, Professor Thomas H. 
Reed of the University of California, Honorable Julius A. Schmahl, 
Secretary of State of Minnesota, Judge Julian W. Mack, formerly 
judge of the Chicago Juvenile Court, Dr. Leonard P. Ayres of 
the Russell Sage Foundation and President Charles R. Van Hise 
of the University of Wisconsin, through their courteous per- 
mission to incorporate, in this volume, selections from their 
writings and public addresses. The publishers of McKechnie’s 
The State and the Individval—James Maclehose and Sons of 
Glasgow —and of Wilson’s The State—D. C. Heath and Com-

CHAPTER I 
EDUCATION AS A STATE FUNCTION 
I. Epvcation anp Sociat THEORY 
  Democracy and Education. — The twentieth century seeks 
consciously to express the reality of democracy in terms of 
education; to humanize education through the mechanisms 
of democracy. The foremost efforts and the dominant ideals 
of our civilization are symbolized through these two ideas — 
democracy and education. The former represents the goal 
of social progress; the latter, the chief instrument for the at- 
tainment of individual development as the necessary condi- 
tion for carrying the load of common social obligations. 
The easily discernible tendency in the evolution of the 
modern state is toward an increased state foundation of a 
universal system of education. The state approaches democ- 
racy in direct proportion to the universality of its education ; 
education becomes universal just to the degree to which it is 
regarded as one of the essential functions of the state. 
The growth of democracy as a modern social order has 
resulted in a remarkable increase and extension of the func- 
tions of the state, little anticipated by the political pioneers 
of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Education, 
naturally seized upon .by the interpreters and leaders of 
democracy as the chief instrumentality for the realization of 
the human purposes residing in free constitutions and in 
representative government, exhibits both in form and magni- 
tude its intimate relationship to the state. No other of the 
fundamental social enterprises bears more clearly the stamp 
of state authority, of state power, and of state stimulation 
and dependence.

AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
While the direct responsibility of the political state for popu- 
lar education may be counted among the primary conceptions 
of democracy, it has required several generations of American 
life to overcome the antagonistic social circumstances. Even 
now it may be said that another generation or two will pass 
before education, by and through the state, will be generally 
accepted as the ordinary means for the accomplishment of the 
extraordinary ends of providing a complete individual basis 
for social stability and progress and also an enduring social 
environment for the exercise of individual capabilities. 
Out of the great mass of material dealing with state educa- 
tion, from the point of view of social theory, the following 
representative interpretations have been selected as illustrative 
of a positive attitude toward the question of education in the 
proper functioning of the state. 
  1. The Boundaries of State Action 
[From Wilson, Woodrow, The State (Boston, 1900, Rev. Ed.), 
pp. 637-639. ] 
Natural Limits to State Action. — And that there are natural and 
imperative limits to state action no one who seriously studies the 
structure of society can doubt. The limit of state functions is 
the limit of necessary codperation on the part of society as a whole, 
the limit beyond which such combination ceases to be imperative 
for the public good and becomes merely convenient for industrial 
or social enterprise. Codéperation is necessary in the sense here 
intended when it is indispensable to the equalization of the condi- 
tions of endeavor, indispensable to the maintenance of uniform 
tules of individual rights and relationships, indispensable because 
to omit it would inevitably be to hamper or degrade some for the 
advancement of others in the scale of wealth and social standing. 
There are relations in which men invariably have need of each 
other, in which universal codperation is the indispensable condi- 
tion of even tolerable existence. Only some universal authority 
can make opportunities equal as between man and man. The 
divisions of labor and the combinations of commerce may for the 
most part be left to contract, to free individual arrangement, but 
the equalization of the conditions which affect all alike may no 
more be left to individual initiative than may the organization of 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
   
      
EDUCATION AS A STATE FUNCTION 5 
     
  government itself. Churches, clubs, corporations, fraternities, 
guilds, partnerships, unions, have for their ends one or another 
special enterprise for the development of man’s spiritual or mate- 
rial well-being: they are all more or less advisable. But the 
family and the state have as their end a general enterprise for the 
betterment and equalization of the conditions of individual devel- 
opment: they are indispensable. 
The point at which public combination ceases to be imperative 
is not susceptible of clear indication in general terms; but it is 
not on that account indistinct. The bounds of family association 
are not indistinct because they are marked only by the immaturity 
of the young and by the parental and filial affections, — things 
not all of which are defined in the law. The rule that the state 
should do nothing which is equally possible under equitable con- 
ditions to optional associations is a sufficiently clear line of distinc- 
tion between governments and corporations. Those who regard 
the state as an optional, conventional union simply, a mere partner- 
ship, open wide the doors to the worst forms of socialism. Unless 
the state has a nature which is quite clearly defined by that in- 
variable, universal, immutable mutual interdependence which 
runs beyond the family relations and cannot be satisfied by family 
ties, we have absolutely no criterion by which we can limit, except 
arbitrarily, the activities of the state. The criterion supplied by 
the native necessity of state relations, on the other hand, banishes 
such license of state action. 
The state, for instance, ought not to supervise private morals 
because they belong to the sphere of separate individual respon- 
sibility, not to the sphere of mutual dependence. Thought and 
conscience are private. Opinion is optional. The state may 
intervene only where common action, uniform law, are indispen- 
sable. Whatever is merely convenient is optional, and therefore 
not an affair for the state. Churches are spiritually convenient ; 
joint-stock companies are capitalistically convenient; ‘but when 
the state constitutes itself a church or a mere business association 
it institutes a monopoly no better than others. It should do 
nothing which is not in any case both indispensable to social or 
industrial life and necessarily monopolistic. 
The Family and the State. — It is the proper object of the family 
to mold the individual, to form him in the period of immaturity 
in the faiths of religion and in the practice of morality and obedi- 
ence. This period of subordination over, he is called out into an 
independent, self-directive activity. The ties of family affection 
still bind him, but they bind him with silken, not with iron bonds. 
He has left his “minority” and reached his “majority.” It is        
-P-A-G-E-28
6 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
  the proper object of the state to give leave to his individuality, 
in order that that individuality may add its quota of variety to 
the sum of national activity. Family discipline is variable, selec- 
tive, formative: it must lead the individual. But the state must 
not lead. It must create condition, but not mold individuals. 
Its discipline must be invariable, uniform, impersonal. Family 
methods rest upon individual inequality, state methods upon 
individual equality. Family order rests upon tutelage, state 
order upon franchise, upon privilege. 
The State and Education. — In one field the state would seem 
at first sight to usurp the family function, the field, namely, of 
education. But such is not in reality the case. Education is 
the proper office of the state for two reasons, both of which come 
within the principles we have been discussing. Popular educa- 
tion is necessary for the preservation of those conditions of free- 
dom, political and social, which are indispensable to free individ- 
ual developments. And, in the second place, no instrumentality 
less universal in its power and authority than government can se- 
cure popular education. In brief, in order to secure popular edu- 
cation the action of society as a whole is necessary; and popular 
education is indispensable to that equalization of the conditions 
of personal development which we have taken to be the proper 
object of society. Without popular education, moreover, no gov- 
ernment which rests upon popular action can long endure: the 
people must be schooled in the knowledge, and if possible in the 
virtues, upon which the maintenance and success of free institu- 
tions depend. No free government can last in health if it lose hold 
of the traditions of its history, and in the public schools these tradi- 
tions may be and should be sedulously preserved, carefully re- 
planted in the thought and consciousness of each successive gen- 
eration. 
Historical Conditions of Governmental Action. — Whatever view 
be taken in each particular case of the rightfulness or advisability 
of state regulation and control, one rule there is which may not be 
departed from under any circumstances, and that is the rule of 
historical continuity. In politics nothing radically novel may 
safely be attempted. No result of value can ever be reached in 
politics except through slow and gradual development, the careful 
adaptations and nice modifications of growth. Nothing may be 
done by leaps. More than that, each people, each nation, must 
live upon the lines of its own experience. Nations are no more 
capable of borrowing experience than individuals are. The his- 
tories of other peoples may furnish us with light but they cannot 
furnish us with conditions of action. Every nation must constantly
-P-A-G-E-29
EDUCATION AS A STATE FUNCTION 7 
keep in touch with its past; it cannot run towards its ends around 
sharp corners. 
Summary. — This, then, is the sum of the whole matter: the 
end of government is the facilitation of the objects of society. The 
tule of governmental action is necessary coéperation. The method 
of political development is conservative adaptation, shaping old 
habits into new ones, modifying old means to accomplish new 
ends. 
2. The Environmental Influence of the State 
[From McKechnie, W. S., The State and the Individual (Glasgow, 
1896), pp. 363-364] 
The child comes into the world a bundle of undeveloped po- 
tentialities, void of experience and thought. The environment 
and external circumstances necessary for the growth of his mind 
and body are all supplied by the state. This is true, although not 
all nor even the chief part of them are imparted to the child directly 
by the officials of the government or by the laws or other organs of 
the state. The immediate environment depends on the influence 
of the family and of other institutions and agencies included in 
and controlled by the state. The child may have “innate ideas” 
in the sense of that a priori element which is one of the prerequisites 
of all conscious existence; but the equally necessary a posteriori 
element can be got only from experience; and the sphere of the 
state, or of various parts of the state, is the only school where 
experience is possible for him. He is born into the commonwealth, 
and from the day of his birth the rights of citizenship, which he 
cannot actually enjoy till he has acquired full age, are held in trust 
for him by the state. It is true that it is the family whose influences 
at first surround him, molding his earliest tendencies and aspira- 
tions after its traditions, but the family itself would be empty of 
content except for what flows into it from society and the state. 
The community as a whole, then, is the environment of the individ- 
ual. It is the state which fills him with its own ideas and molds 
him after its own pattern. The English youth grows up with 
habits and ideas quite absent in the Zulu or even in the French- 
man. Allowing all due claims for heredity — though this too has 
been indirectly supplied by the state through ancestors who were 
oe its members — his environment has made him what 
e is. 
The state then — using the word in its widest sense — puts 
its stamp on the young individuality before he has reached man- 
hood and acquired the ability to choose his own surroundings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  8 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
Willingly or unwillingly, it educates the individual and so has a 
terrible responsibility thrust upon its shoulders. The young mind 
as well as the young body is thrown upon its care during the im- 
portant and impressionable years fated to mold the development 
of an immortal soul for time and for eternity. This trust, bur- 
densome and disquieting as it is, is yet one which the state dare 
not decline. 
Its duty to the young cannot be brushed aside or lightly treated. 
But it has also a duty to itself. In each helpless child lies a future 
citizen who will form an organic portion of the commonwealth, 
and may exercise a deep and lasting influence on its destinies. 
All children cannot become great statesmen, but all great statesmen 
once were children. 
On these two grounds the state has both a right and a duty to 
include the education of the young within its proper province. 
Indeed it must educate whether it will or no. The only question 
is whether it will do so consciously or unconsciously, systematically 
or at random, well or ill. Government need not undertake the 
work of education, but the supreme legislative sovereign is forced 
to assume some attitude towards that all-important question. 
There are three positions, any one of which Parliament may 
adopt. (I) It may repudiate all direct responsibility, leaving 
each child to scramble for itself. (II) It may compel parents to 
educate their offspring at their own expense. (III) It may enforce 
education upon all and pay for it out of the national purse. Each 
of these three courses has its adherents. 
3. Education and the Police Power of the State 
[Interstate Consolidated Street Railway Company ». Common- 
wealth of Massachusetts (United States Supreme Court; argued 
October 15-16, 1907; decided November 4, 1907), 207 U. S., 79.] 
In error to the superior court of the state of Massachusetts 
to review a conviction of a street railway company, on appeal 
from the first district court of Bristol County, in that state, 
for refusing to transport school children at a reduced rate, 
exceptions having been heard by the supreme judicial court 
and overruled. Affirmed. 
Mr. Justice Hotmss delivered the opinion of the court. 
This was a complaint against the plaintiff in error for refusing 
to sell tickets for the transportation of pupils to and from the public 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
EDUCATION AS A STATE FUNCTION 9 
  schools at one half the regular fare charged by it, as required by 
Massachusetts Revised Laws, chapter 112, section 72. At the 
trial the railway company admitted the fact, but set up that the 
statute was unconstitutional, in that it denied to the company 
the equal protection of the laws and deprived it of its property 
_ without just compensation and without due process of law. In 
support of this defense it made an offer of proof which may be 
abridged into the propositions that the regular fare was 5 cents ; 
that during the last fiscal year the actual and reasonable cost of 
transportation per passenger was 3.86 cents, or, including taxes, 
4.10 cents; that pupils of the public schools formed a considerable 
part of the passengers carried by it, and that the one street rail- 
way expressly exempted by the law transported nearly one half 
the passengers transported on street railways and received nearly 
one half the revenue received for such transportation in the com- 
monwealth. The offer was stated to be made for the purpose of 
showing that the plaintiff in error could not comply with the 
statute without carrying passengers for less than a reasonable 
compensation and for less than cost. The offer of proof was re- 
jected, and a ruling that the statute was repugnant to the four- 
teenth amendment was refused. The plaintiff in error excepted 
and, after a verdict of guilty and sentence, took the case to’ the 
supreme judicial court. (187 Mass., 436.) The court overrules 
the exceptions, whereupon the plaintiff in error brought the case 
here. 
This court is of opinion that the decision below was right. A 
majority of the court considers that the case is disposed of by the 
fact that the statute in question was in force when the plaintiff 
in error (ook its charter, and confines itself to that ground. 
* * * * * * * 
The objection that seems to me, as it seemed to the court below, 
most serious is that the statute unjustifiably appropriates the 
property of the plaintiff in error. It is hard to say that street 
railway companies are not subjected to a loss. The conventional 
fare of 5 cents presumably is not more than a reasonable fare, and 
it is at least questionable whether street railway companies would 
be permitted to increase it on the ground of this burden. It is 
assumed by the statute in question that the ordinary fare may 
be charged for these children or some of them when not going to 
or from school. Whatever the fare, the statute fairly construed 
means that children going to or from school must be carried for 
half the sum that wouid be reasonable compensation for their 
earriage, if we looked only to the business aspect of the question.
-P-A-G-E-32
  10 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
Moreover, while it may be true that in some cases rates or fares 
may be reduced to an unprofitable point in view of the business as 
a whole or upon special considerations (Minneapolis & St. Louis 
R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, 186 U. S., 256, 267), it is not enough to 
justify a general law like this, that the companies concerned still 
may be able to make a profit from other sources, for all that appears. 
(Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation 
Commission, 206 U. S., 1, 24, 25.) 
Notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, I hesitatingly 
agree with the state court that the requirement may be justified 
under what commonly is called the “police power.” The obverse 
way of stating this power in the sense in which I am using the 
phrase would be that constitutional rights, like others, are matters 
of degree, and that the great constitutional provisions for the pro- 
tection of property are not to be pushed to a logical extreme, but 
_ must be taken to permit the infliction of some fractional and rela- 
tively small losses without compensation, for some, at least, of 
the purposes of wholesome legislation. (Martin ». District of 
Columbia, 205 U. S., 135, 189; Camfield v. United States, 167 U. 
S., 518, 524.) 
If the fourteenth amendment is not to be a greater hamper upon 
the established practices of the states in common with other 
governments than I think was intended, they must be allowed a 
certain latitude in the minor adjustments of life, even though by 
their action the burdens of a part of the community are somewhat 
increased. The traditions and habits of centuries were not in- 
tended to be overthrown when the amendment was passed. 
Education is one of the purposes for which what is called the 
“police power” may be exercised. (Barbier v. Connolly, 113 
U. S., 27, 31.) Massachusetts always has recognized it as one of 
the first objects of public care. It does not follow that it would 
be equally in accord with the conceptions at the base of our con- 
stitutional law to confer equal favors upon doctors or working- 
men or people who could afford to buy 1000-mile tickets. Struc- 
tural habits count for as much as logic in drawing the line. And, 
to return to the taking of property, the aspect in which I am con- 
sidering the case, general taxation to maintain public schools is 
an appropriation of property to a use in which the taxpayer may 
have no private interest, and, it may be, against his will. It has 
been condemned by some theorists on that ground. Yet no one 
denies its constitutionality. People are accustomed to it and 
accept it without doubt. 
The present requirement is not different in fundamental prin- 
ciple, although the tax is paid in kind and falls only on the class
-P-A-G-E-33
EDUCATION AS A STATE FUNCTION 1 
  capable of paying that kind of tax — a class of quasi-public cor- 
porations specially subject to legislative control. Thus the ques- 
tion narrows itself to the magnitude of the burden imposed — to 
whether the tax is so great as to exceed the limits of the police 
power. Looking at the law without regard to its special operation 
I should hesitate to assume that its total effect, direct and indirect, 
upon the roads outside of Boston amounted to a more serious bur- 
den than a change in the law of nuisance, for example, might be. 
See further Williams v. Parker (188 U. S., 491). Turning to the 
specific effect, the offer of proof was cautious. It was simply 
that a “considerable percentage’’ of the passengers carried by the 
company consisted of pupils of the public schools. This might 
be true without the burden becoming serious. I am not prepared 
to overrule the decision of the legislature and of the highest court 
of Massachusetts, that the requirement is reasonable under the 
conditions existing there, upon evidence that goes no higher than 
this. It is not enough that a statute goes to the verge of constitu- 
tional power. We must be able to see clearly that it goes beyond 
that power. In case of real doubt a law must be sustained. 
Mr. Justice Harlan is of the opinion that the constitutionality 
of the act of 1900 is necessarily involved in the determination of this 
ease. He thinks the act is not liable to the objection that it 
denies to the railway company the equal protection of the laws. 
Nor does he think that it can be held, upon any showing made 
by this record, to be unconstitutional as depriving the plaintiff 
in error of its property without due process of law. Upon these 
grounds alone, and independent of any other question discussed, 
he joins in a judgment of affirmance. Judgment affirmed. 
II. Epucarion as a Civic RESPONSIBILITY 
Colonial Conceptions. — The first permanent outposts of 
public education were established by the colonials of New 
England; conspicuously by those of Massachusetts. The 
acts of the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony 
of 1642 and 1647 are illuminative in that they contain a defi- 
nite declaration in support of the principle of the responsibility 
of the commonwealth for the creation and maintenance of com- 
mon educational opportunities. From this germinal principle 
there came the potent influences that have ever been exercised 
by Massachusetts throughout the United States.
-P-A-G-E-34
12 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
Principles similar to those involved in the early Massa- 
chusetts laws were incorporated by Thomas Jefferson in his 
famous “ Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,” ° 
submitted to the Virginia legislature in 1779. The realization 
of Jefferson’s ideals awaited many years, and the actual 
acceptance on any large scale of the state responsibility for 
education was far more belated in the other states of the 
Union than in New England. The New York statutes of 
1791, being the first relating to elementary schools, and 
that of 1795 establishing a school system temporarily reveal 
this. 
All of the sources mentioned above are necessarily elimi- 
nated from this collection, since they are to be incorporated. 
in a companion piece to this source book, on Sources in the 
History of Education in the United States. 
Ill. Epvcation Lerr to THE STaTEs 
Education was left unmentioned in the new Federal Con- 
stitution, and the tenth amendment left the matter entirely 
to the states. This amendment reads: 
Art. X. The powers not delegated to the United States by 
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people. 
During the period from the adoption of the Declaration of 
Independence to the close of the eighteenth century (1776- 
1800), all of the states, except Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
which considered their Colonial Charters sufficient, adopted. 
new constitutions, and a number revised or amended their 
constitutions one or more times. Three new states, Vermont, 
Kentucky, and Tennessee, were also admitted during this period. 
Some idea of the conception as to the importance of education, 
held at this time by the people of the states, may be obtained 
by an examination of these early state constitutions. 
Of these, the state constitutions of New Hampshire, New

Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, in 
1776; New York, in 1777; South Carolina, in 1778 and 1790; 
and Kentucky in 1792 and 1799 were silent on the matter. 
Connecticut did not adopt a state constitution until 1818, 
and Rhode Island until 1842, and were likewise silent. Mary- 
land amended its constitution four times, and some of the other 
states one or more times, without including any mention of 
education. Of the sixteen states before 1800, half had made 
no mention whatever of education up to that time. The other 
half included short sections, which were as follows: 
Vermont, 1. Constitution of 1777 
Src. XL. A school or schools shail be established in each town, 
by the legislature, for the convenient instruction of youth, with 
such salaries to the masters, paid by each town; making proper 
use of school lands in each town, thereby to enable them to instruct 
youth at low prices. One grammar school in each county, and 
one university in this State, ought to be established by direction 
of the General Assembly. 
Sec. XLI. Laws for the encouragement of virtue and preven- 
tion of vice and immorality, shall be made and constantly kept 
in force; and provision shall be made for their due execution; and 
all religious societies or bodies of men, that have or may be here- 
after united and incorporated, for the advancement of religion and 
learning, or for other pious and charitable purposes, shall be en- 
couraged and protected in the enjoyment of the privileges, im- 
munities and estates which they, in justice ought to enjoy, under 
such regulations, as the General Assembly of this State shall 
direct.

Cuap. II, Src. 38. Laws for the encouragement of virtue, and 
prevention of vice and immorality, ought to be constantly kept

ought to be maintained in each town for the convenient instruc- 
tion of youth; and one or more grammar schools be incorporated, 
and properly supported in each county in this State. And all

estates, which they in justice ought to enjoy under such regulations

This section was also incorporated in the constitution of 
1793 unchanged, and is still in force: 
Massacuusetts, Constitution of 1780 
[Part II, Chap. V, The University at (Cambridge, and Encour- 
agement of Literature, etc.] 
Section 1.— The university 
Art. 1. Whereas our wise and pious ancestors, so early as 
the year 1636, laid the foundation of Harvard College, in which 
university many persons of great eminence have, by the blessing 
of God, been initiated in those arts and sciences which qualified 
them for public employments, both in church and state; and 
whereas the encouragement of arts and sciences and all good liter- 
ature, tends to the honor of God, the advantage of the Christian 
religion, and the great benefit of this and the other United States 
of America, it is declared, that the president and fellows of Harvard 
College, in their corporate capacity, and their successors in that 
capacity, their officers and servants, shall have, hold, use, exercise, 
and enjoy all the powers, authorities, rights, liberties, privileges, 
immunities, and franchises which they now have, or are entitled 
to have, hold, use, exercise, and enjoy; and the same are hereby 
ratified and confirmed unto them, the said president and fellows 
of Harvard College, and to their successors, and to their officers 
and servants respectively, forever. 
Art. 2. And whereas there have been, at sundry times, by divers 
persons, gifts, grants, devises of houses, lands, tenements, goods, 
chattels, legacies, and conveyances heretofore made, either to 
Harvard College, in Cambridge, in New England, or to the presi- 
dent and fellows of Harvard College, or to the said college by some 
other description, under several charters successively, it is declared 
that all the said gifts, grants, devises, legacies, and conveyances 
are hereby forever confirmed unto the president and fellows of 
Harvard College, and to their successors, in the capacity aforesaid, 
according to the true intent and meaning of the donor or donors, 
grantor or grantors, devisor or devisors. 
Art. 3. And whereas by an act of the general court of the colony 
of Massachusetts Bay, passed in the year 1642, the governor and 
deputy governor, for the time being, and all the magistrates of

that jurisdiction, were, with the president, and a number of the 
clergy, in the said act described, constituted the overseers of Har- 
vard College, and it being necessary, in this new constitution of 
government, to ascertain who shall be deemed successors to the 
said governor, deputy governor, and magistrates, it is declared 
that the governor, lieutenant-governor, council, and senate of 
this Commonwealth are, and shall be deemed, their successors ; 
who, with the president of Harvard College, for the time being, 
together with the ministers of the Congregational churches in the 
towns of Cambridge, Watertown, Charlestown, Boston, Roxbury 
and Dorchester, mentioned in the said act, shall be, and hereby 
are, vested with all the powers and authority belonging or in any 
way appertaining to the overseers of Harvard College: Provided, 
That nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the legislature 
of this Commonwealth from making such alterations in the gov- 
ernment of the said university as shall be conducive to its advantage 
and the interest of the republic of letters, in as full a manner as 
might have been done by the legislature of the late province of the 
Massachusetts Bay. 
Srcrion 2. — The encouragement of literature 
Cuap. V, Sec. 2. Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, 
diffused generally among the body of the people, being necessary 
for the preservation of their rights and liberties; and as these 
depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of edu- 
cation in the various parts of the country, and among the different 
orders of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislatures and 
magistrates, in all future periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish 
the interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of 
them; especially the university at Cambridge, public schools, 
and grammar-schools in the towns; to encourage private societies 
and public institutions, by rewards and immunities, for the pro- 
motion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manu- 
factures, and a natural history of the country; to countenance 
and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, 
public and private charity, industry and frugality, honesty and 
punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good humor, and all 
social affections and generous sentiments among the people.

through the various parts of the country being highly conducive 
to promote this end, it shall be the duty of the legislatures and 
magistrates, in all future periods of this government, to cherish 
the interest of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries and 
public schools; to encourage private and public institutions, 
rewards and immunities for the promotion of agriculture, arts, 
sciences, commerce, trade, manufactures, and natural history of 
the country; to countenance and inculcate the principles of 
humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, 
industry and economy, honesty and punctuality, sincerity, 
sobriety, and all social affections and generous sentiments among 
the people. 
PENNSYLVANIA, 1. Constitution of 1776 
Src. 44. A school or schools shall be established in each county

charitable purposes, shall be encouraged and protected in the 
enjoyment of the privileges, immunities, and estates which they 
were accustomed to enjoy, or could of right have enjoyed, under 
the laws and former constitution of this State. 
2. Constitutions of 1790 and 1838

With the admission of Ohio, in 1802, the national govern- 
ment began a land-grant policy (see Chap. II) which began to 
stimulate an interest in public education, and the constitution 
of Ohio of 1803 (see Chap. V), is the first of the states to show 
this new interest.

CHAPTER II 
NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 
I. Lanp Grants ror Common ScHOOLS 
  1. Disposal of the National Lands 
Tue Revolutionary War ended in 1783, but it was six years 
before the national goverriment was instituted under the new 
Constitution. During this interval the Congress carried on 
the government, as best it could, but without any settled policy. 
As the War drew to a close both soldiers and statesmen began 
to turn their attention to the new west asa field for colonization, 
but this large territory was disputed as to title, and not open 
as yet to settlement. A number of the states claimed that 
their titles extended to the Mississippi, and the claims over- 
lapped. Indian tribes populated the land, and Indian titles 
also remained to be extinguished before settlement could take 
place. Gradually the idea of the nationalization of these lands, 
and the uniting to win from a common enemy, took the place’ 
of the idea of state ownership and control, and state after state 
ceded the lands in question to the national government. 
Everything north of the Cumberland River had been ceded 
before the Federal Constitution had been ratified by the 
requisite number of states. 
In the meantime colonists were pushing westward, and the 
demand for the opening of these lands to purchase and coloniza- 
tion became more insistent. In 1783 Col. Thomas Pickering 
submitted a series of propositions to Congress for organizing 
a new state which would comprise about the eastern four fifths 
of the present state of Ohio, which was to be settled by officers 
and soldiers of the Federal army, associated for the purpose. 
18
-P-A-G-E-41
NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 19 
Pickering proposed that the Congress should purchase this 
tract from the Indians, and then make grants to the soldiers, 
according to a schedule. One of his propositions contained 
the first suggestion we have as to a future national policy of 
making grants for educational purposes. It read : — 
7. These rights being secured, all of the surplus lands shall be 
the common property of the State, and to be disposed of for the 
common good; as for laying out roads, building bridges, creating 
public buildings, establishing schools and academies, defraying 
the expenses of government, and other public uses. 
The First Survey. — This suggestion seems to have borne 
fruit in the legislation of the two years later, ordering a survey 
and fixing a method of disposing of the western lands. This 
act reads as follows: 
  An OrpINANCE for ascertaining the mode of disposing of lands 
in the Western territory, Adopted by the Congress of the Con- 
federation, May 20, 1785. 
Be it ordained by the United States in Congress assembled, That 
the territory ceded by individual States to the United States, 
which has been purchased of the Indian inhabitants, shall be dis- 
posed of in the following manner: The surveyors, as they are 
respectively qualified, shall proceed to divide the said territory 
into townships of six miles square, by lines running due north and 
south, and others crossing them at right angles, as near as may be. 
“ The plats of the townships, respectively, shall be marked by 
subdivisions into lots of one mile square, or 640 acres, in the same 
direction as the external lines, and numbered from 1 to 36, always 
beginning the succeeding range of the lots with the number next 
to,that with which the preceding one concluded. 
There shall be reserved the lot No. 16 of every township, for 
the maintenance of public schools, within the said township. 
The only lands surveyed under this plan were the “ Seven 
Ranges ” in southeastern Ohio, and in 1796 a different plan of 
numbering (Section 1 being at the northeast corner of the town- 
ships, instead of at the southeast) was adopted. This plan 
has been followed generally since. In the meantime, six dif- 
ferent types of survey had been instituted in Ohio.
-P-A-G-E-42
20 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
Ordinance of 1787.— In July, 1787, a New England company, 
known as The Ohio Company of Associates, applied to Congress 
for the purchase of 1,500,000 acres of land on the Ohio. After 
some negotiation the sale was effected, and just preceding it 
the famous Ordinance of 1787 was adopted. The Ordinance 
contained one famous provision : — 
  An OrpinaNncE for the Government of the territory of the United 
States northwest of the River Ohio. Adopted by the Congress 
of the Confederation, July 13, 1787. 
Be it ordained by the United States in Congress assembled, That 
the said territory, for the purposes of temporary government, be 
one district, subject, however, to be divided into two districts, 
as future circumstances may, in the opinion of Congress, make it 
expedient. * * * 
It is hereby ordained and declared by the authority aforesaid, 
That the following articles shall be considered as articles of com- 
pact between the original States and the people and States in the 
said territory and forever remain unalterable, unless by common 
consent, to wit: * * * 
Arr. 3d. Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary 
to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and 
the means of education shall forever be encouraged. 
Ten days later Congress adopted an ordinance for the drawing 
up of the contract for the sale, which was signed three months 
later. This ordinance contained the following provisions: 
Powers to the Board of Treasury to contract for the sale of the 
Western Territory. Adopted by the Congress of the Confedera- 
tion, July 23, 1787. 
The lot No. 16 in each township, or fractional part of a town- 
ship, to be given perpetually for the purposes contained in the 
~ said (1785) Ordinance. The lot No. 29, in each township, or 
fractional part of a township, to be given perpetually for the pur- 
poses of religion. Lots No. 8, 11, and 26 to be reserved for the 
future disposition of Congress. . . . Not more than two complete 
townships to be given perpetually for the purpose of a university, 
to be laid off by the purchaser or purchasers, as near the center 
as may be, so that the same shall be good land, to be applied to 
the intended object by the legislature of the state.
-P-A-G-E-43
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 21 
This settled the question of the control of the university 
sections and endowment, but left the control of the common 
school system undecided. Similar terms, with the exception 
that no university grant was made, were inserted in the contract 
for the sale of 1,000,000 acres of land in southwestern Ohio, 
to John C. Symmes, in 1788. 
In 1788 the requisite nine states had ratified the Federal 
Constitution, and with the inauguration of the national govern- 
ment in 1789 the following article of the Constitution was 
brought into effect : — 
Arr. IV, Sec. 3, § 2. — The Congress shall have Power to 
dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting 
the Territory belonging to the United States; and nothing in 
this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims 
of the United States, or of any particular state. 
  Petitions for Land. — Not until the admission of Ohio, in 
1802, at least, can we consider any national policy as to educa- 
tional grants to have been in any way decided upon. In the 
meantime petitions for grants were sent to Congress from various 
quarters. The following petition from the Mississippi Territory, 
as reported in the Annals of Congress, is illustrative : 
House of Representatives, Monday, December 23, 1799. — 
A petition of Thomas Burling and others, inhabitants of the Missis- 
sippi Territory, in behalf of themselves and the people of thé said 
Territory, was presented to the House and read, praying the con- 
firmation of all grants of land legally and justly obtained from the 
Spanish Government, prior to the ratification of the late treaty 
between the United States and her Catholic Majesty. 
Also a petition of John Henderson, and others, inhabitants 
of Natchez, in the said Territory, praying the aid and patronage 
of Congress in the establishment of a regular ministry of the Gospel 
among them, and of schools for the education of their youth. 
Ordered, That the said petitions do lie on the table. 
House of Representatives, Tuesday, December 24, 1799. — 
Ordered, That the petitions of John Henderson and others, and of 
Thomas Burling and others, inhabitants of the Mississippi Terri- 
tory, presented yesterday, be referred to Messrs. Sewall, Chauncey,
-P-A-G-E-44
22 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND. STATE POLICY 
  Wall, Evans and Hill; that they do examine the matter thereof, 
and report the same, with their opinion thereupon, to the House. 
The committee reported, later, adversely on the confirmation 
of the grants, but made no mention of the proposition of lands 
for the Gospel and for schools. No action taken on such by the 
House during this Congress. In the Senate the following 
action was taken: 
Senate, Tuesday, December 24, 1799. — Mr. Tracy presented 
a petition of Thomas Burling and others, inhabitants of certain 
lands on the borders of the Mississippi, praying confirmation of 
their grants made by the Spanish Government; and also that a 
disposal be made of the vacant lands in that Territory. . . . 
Ordered, That the petitions and papers above mentioned be 
referred to Messrs. Tracy, Gunn, and Ross, to consider and report 
thereon to the Senate. 
Senate, Tuesday, April 8, 1800. — The Senate took into con- 
sideration the report of the committee on the petition of Thomas 
Burling and others, inhabitants of the Mississippi Territory; and 
the report was adopted, as follows : 
That the petitioners solicit an Act of Congress for the confirma- 
tion of grants of land made by the Spanish Government, prior 
to the Treaty of April, 1796; and likewise for confirming the 
claims for land to those who were occupants before that time. . . . 
The committee are of the opinion it would be improper for the 
Legislature of the Union to do anything upon the subject of said 
petition, while the interfering claims to the lands in said Terri- 
tory remain unsettled. They therefore report that the prayer 
of said petition is unreasonable. 
The Senate also took into consideration the report of the same 
committee, on the letter of John Henderson to Winthrop 
Sargent, and the extract of a letter from Governor Sargent, 
and the report was adopted as follows: 
That the inhabitants of the Mississippi Territory, request an 
appropriation of lands in the Territory, by Congress, for the sup- 
port of “clergymen and seminaries of learning, and such like pur- 
poses,” in the same manner that appropriations have been made 
in the Northwest Territory. 
‘The committee are of the opinion that the unsettled condition
-P-A-G-E-45
            NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 23 
of claims to lands in the Mississippi Territory renders it improper 
at this time to make appropriations of lands for any purposes. 
They therefore report that the request of said inhabitants is 
unreasonable.        
        2. Ohio establishes a Type, and a Policy 
With the admission of Ohio as a state a definite precedent 
was established, and this was followed in the matter of educa~ 
tional grants thereafter. 
               [Poore, B. P., Federal and State Constitutions, II, 1454.] 
AN ACT, to enable the people of the eastern division of the territory 
northwest of the river Ohio to form a constitution and State govern- 
ment, and for the admission of such State into the Union on an equal 
footing with the original States, and for other purposes. Approved, 
April 30, 1802. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled; * * * 
Sec. 7. And be it further enacted, That the following propositions 
be, and the same are hereby, offered to the convention of the east- 
ern State of the said territory, when formed, for their free accept- 
ance or rejection, which, if accepted by the convention, shall be 
obligatory upon the United States : 
First. That the section, numbered sixteen, in every township, 
and, where such section has been sold, or disposed of, other lands 
equivalent thereto and most contiguous to the same, shall be 
granted to the inhabitants of such township, for the use of schools. 
Second. That the six miles reservation, including the salt- 
springs, commonly called the Scioto salt-springs, the salt-springs 
near the Muskingum River, and in the military tract, with the 
sections of land which include the same, shall be granted to the 
said state for the use of the people thereof, and the same may be 
used under such terms and conditions and regulations as the legis- 
lature of the said State shall direct; Provided, The said legislature 
shall never sellor lease the same for alonger period than ten years. 
Third. That one-twentieth part of the net proceeds of the lands 
lying within the said State sold by Congress, from and after the 
thirtieth day of June next, after deducting all expenses incident 
to the same, shall be applied to the laying out and making public 
roads, leading from the navigable waters emptying into the Atlan- 
tic, to the Ohio, to the said State, and through the same, such 
      
                                          
                                   
-P-A-G-E-46
24 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
roads to be laid out under the authority of Congress, and with 
the consent of the several States through which the road shall 
pass: Provided always, That the three foregoing propositions herein 
offered are on the conditions that the convention of the said State 
shall provide, by an ordinance irrevocable without the consent 
of the United States, that each and every tract of land sold by 
Congress after the thirtieth day of June next, shall be and remain 
exempt from any tax laid by order or under authority of the State, 
whether for State, county, township, or any other purpose what- 
ever, for the term of five years from and after the date of sale. 
We have here a definite bargain on the part of the national 
government, for the purpose of enabling it to more readily sell 
its lands, and also the beginning of the grants of salt springs 
_ and five per centum of the proceeds of the sale of the public 
lands within the state. Both of these grants were later applied 
to education by the states. The control of the school section 
was still left indefinite, but the next year Congress, by law, 
vested its control definitely in the legislature of the state, thus 
settling the question of control of the school system. 
  [U. S. Statutes at Large, Il, 225.] 
AN ACT in addition to, and in modification of, the propositions 
contained in an act entitled “ An Act to enable the people of the Eastern 
division of the territory northwest of the river Ohio, to form a Consti- 
tution and state government, and for the admission of such state into 
the Union, on an equal footing with the original States, and for other 
purposes.”” Approved, March 3, 1803. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That the following 
several tracts of land in the state of Ohio, be, and the same are 
hereby appropriated for the use of schools in that state, and shall, 
together with all of the tracts of land heretofore appropriated for 
that purpose, be vested in the legislature of that state, in trust for 
use as aforesaid, and for no other use, intent or purpose whatever, 
that is to say: 
First. (A number of quarter townships, being one thirty-sixth 
of the “United States military tract.’’) 
Secondly. (A number of quarter townships in the Connecticut 
reserve.)
-P-A-G-E-47
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 25 
Thirdly. So much of that tract, commonly called the “ Virginia 
military reservation,” as will amount to one thirty-sixth part of 
the whole. . .. 
Fourthly. One thirty-sixth part of all lands of the United States 
lying in the state of Ohio, to which the Indian title has not been 
extinguished, which may hereafter be purchased of the Indian 
tribes by the United States, which thirty-sixth part shall consist 
of the section numbered sixteen in each township, if the said lands 
shall be surveyed in townships of six miles square, and shall, if 
the lands be surveyed in a different manner, be designated by lot. 
Sec. 2. (Directing the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the 
State three per centum on the sale of all lands of the United States, 
for laying out, opening, and making roads within the state.) 
Src. 3. (Directing the Secretary of the Treasury to select lieu 
lands for sections sixteen, heretofore promised, but found sold.) 
Sec. 4. (Granting one complete township, in the district of 
Cincinnati, for the purposes of establishing an academy, and vest- 
ing same in the legislature, in lieu of the one previously granted 
to John Cleves Symmes and associates, in the Symmes purchase, 
provided Symmes has not or does not within five years locate 
the one granted him.) 
Sec. 5. (Directing that the Symmes trust be executed, but 
providing for his release and granting him the township in payment 
of $15,360.) 
Extension of the Ohio Provisions. — At the same time that 
the above act was passed Congress extended the educational 
provisions of the Ohio Act to the Mississippi Territory. 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, II, 229.] 
AN ACT regulating the granting of land, and providing for the dis-

lations, for the same price, and on the same terms and conditions

Tennessee. — In 1806, in settling a dispute as to the 
possession of lands within the state of Tennessee, Congress 
made an exception to the policy of not granting lands for 
education to the older states, and granted lands to Tennessee 
for two universities and for county academies, and also pro- 
vided for the reservation of one section in each township for 
schools. The act reads: 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, Il, 381.] 
AN ACT to authorize the State of Tennessee to issue grants and per- 
fect titles to certain lands therein described, and to settle the claims to 
the vacant and unappropriated lands within the state. Approved, 
April 18, 1806. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States in Congress Assembled, That for the purpose of de- 
fining the limits of the vacant and unappropriated lands in the 
state of Tennessee, the following line be drawn. (See map.) 
Sec. 2. (Recites act whereby Tennessee cedes to the United 
States all rights to the vacant and unappropriated lands within 
the state. In return the United States cedes to Tennessee “all 
rights, title and claim to the lands lying east and north of the line,” 
with full power to perfect titles), subject nevertheless to the 
following express conditions; that is to say, 
Secondly. That the State of Tennessee shall appropriate one 
hundred thousand acres, which shall be located in one entire tract, 
_ within the limits of the lands reserved to the Cherokee Indians, 
by an act of the State of North Carolina, passed in 1783; and 
shall be for the use of two colleges, one in East, and one in West

Tennessee, to be established by the legislature thereof. And one 
hundred thousand acres in one tract within the limits last afore- 
said, for the use of academies; one in each county in said state 
to be established by the legislature thereof; which several tracts 
shall be located on lands to which the Indian title has been ex- 
tinguished, and subject to the disposition of the legislature of the 
state, but shall not be granted or sold for less than two dollars 
per acre, and the proceeds of the sales of the lands aforesaid, shall 
be vested in funds for the respective uses aforesaid, for ever. 
And the State of Tennessee shall moreover, in issuing grants and 
perfecting titles, locate six hundred and forty acres to every six

miles square in the territory hereby ceded, where existing claims

Suc. 3. And be it further enacted, That if the territory herein 
before ceded to the State of Tennessee, shail not contain a suffi- 
cient quantity of land fit for cultivation, according to the true 
intent and meaning of the original act of cession, including the 
lands within the limits reserved by the State of North Carolina, 
to the Cherokee Indians, to perfect all existing legal claims charged 
thereon by the conditions contained in this act of cession, Congress 
will hereafter provide by law for perfecting such as cannot be lo- 
cated in the territory aforesaid, out of the lands lying west or south 
of the before described line. 
The Enabling Act for Indiana, passed in 1816, follows the 
same lines as that for Ohio, except that the five per cent from 
_ the sales of public lands is to be used for roads and canals, 
two fifths without and leading to the state, and three fifths 
within the state. Four sections are also given for the purpose 
of locating the seat of government.

3. Later Types of Grants 
The Illinois Type. — With the admission of Illinois, in 1818, 
a new type for the granting of school lands, and the five per cent 
fund, was established, The enabling act provides: 
[Poore, B. F., Federal and State Constitutions, I, 436.] 
AN ACT, to enable the people of the Illinois Territory to form a con- 
stitution and a state government, and for the admission of such State 
into the Union on an equal footing with the original States. Approved 
April 18, 1818. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled; * * * 
Sect. 6. And be it further enacted, That the following prop- 
ositions be, and the same are hereby, offered to the convention of 
the said Territory of Illinois, when formed, for their free accept- 
ance or rejection, which, if accepted by the convention, shall be 
obligatory upon the United States and the said State : 
First. That section numbered sixteen, in every township, and 
when such section has been sold or otherwise disposed of, other 
lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall be 
granted to the State, for the use of the inhabitants of such town- 
ship, for the use of schools. 
Second. That all salt-springs within such State, and the land 
reserved for the use of the same, shall be granted to the said State, 
for the use of said State, and the same to be used under such terms, 
and conditions, and regulations as the legislature of said State 
shall direct: Provided, The legislature shall never sell or lease 
the same for a longer period than ten years at any one time. 
Third. That five per cent of the net proceeds of the lands lying 
within such State, and which shall be sold by Congress, from and 
after the first day of January, 1819, after deducting all expenses 
incident to the same, shall be reserved for the purposes following, 
viz.: two-fifths to be disbursed, under the direction of Congress, 
inmakingroadsleading to the State; the residue to be appropriated, 
by the legislature of the State, for the encouragement of learning, 
of which one-sixth part shall be exclusively bestowed on a college 
or university. 
Fourth. That thirty-six sections, or one entire township, which 
shall be designated by the President of the United States, together 
with the one heretofore reserved for that purpose, shall be re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-51

       served for the use of a seminary of learning, and vested in the 
legislature of the State, to be appropriated solely to the use of such 
seminary by said legislature: Provided always, (Here follows the 
exemption from taxation of lands sold clause, as in the case of 
Ohio.) 
Alabama, admitted the year following Illinois, reverted to the 
Ohio type of the sixteenth section grant, the lands being given 
to the people of the townships for the use of schools, but with 
Missouri, in 1820, and Arkansas, in 1836, the lands were given 
to the state, for the use of the inhabitants of the townships, 
as in the case of Illinois. The Illinois plan of devoting a part 
of the five per cent fund to education was not repeated again 
until after the states began to request Congress to be permitted 
to so appropriate it, which was not until about 1850. 
The Michigan Type. — By 1835 the bad effects of granting 
the sixteenth section to the townships by either the Ohio or 
the Illinois form of grants had become apparent, and the con- 
vention which framed the constitution for the new state of 
Michigan petitioned Congress for a new form of grant, as 
follows:

                           [Poore, B. P., Federal and State Constitutions, I, 993.] 
Be it ordained by the convention assembled to form a constitution 
for the State of Michigan, in behalf and by authority of the people of 
said State, That the following propositions be submitted to the 
Congress of the United States, which, if assented to by that body, 
shall be obligatory on this State : 
1. Section numbered sixteen in every surveyed township of the 
public lands, and, where such section has been sold or otherwise 
disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as 
may be, shall be granted to the State for the use of schools. 
2. The seventy-two sections of land set apart and reserved for 
the use and support of a university, by an act of Congress 
approved the twentieth day of May, 1826, entitled “ An act concern- 
ing a seminary of learning in the Territory of Michigan,” shall, to- 
gether with such further quantities as may be agreed upon by Con- 
gress, be conveyed to the State, and shall be appropriated solely 
to the support of such university, in such manner as the legisla- 
ture shall prescribe.   
-P-A-G-E-52
30 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
  8. Four entire sections of land, to be selected under the direction 
of the legislature, from any of the unappropriated lands belonging 
to the United States, shall be granted for its use in establishing 
a seat of government. 
This request was assented to by Congress, and the control 
of the school lands was vested in the state, without reference 
to township lines. The wisdom of this has been so apparent 
that this form of grant has since been followed.* 
Fractional Townships. — By 1825 the policy of granting 
one section in each township for educational purposes had 
become established, and Congress now began to make grants 
to cover omissions made in the earlier grants. The Virginia 
Military Reserve, the Gallipolis tract, and the western half of 
the Connecticut Reserve, all in Ohio, received specific grants 
by or before 1834, and in 1826 the Fractional Township Act 
was passed. This applied to all states. 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, IV, 179.] 
AN ACT to appropriate lands for the support of schools in certain 
townships and fractional townships, not before provided for. Ap- 
proved, May 20, 1826. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States in Congress assembled, That to make provision for 
the support of schools, in all townships or fractional townships for 
which no land has been heretofore appropriated for that use in those 
States in which section number sixteen, or other land equivalent 
thereto, is by law directed to be reserved for the support of schools 
in each township, there shall be reserved and appropriated, for 
the use of schools, in each entire township, or fractional township, 
for which no land has been heretofore appropriated or granted 
for that purpose, the following quantities of land, to wit, for each 
township or fractional township containing a greater quantity of 
land than three-quarters of an entire township, one section; for a 
fractional township containing a greater quantity of land than one- 
half, and not more than three-quarters of a township, three-quar- 
1 Florida forms an exception, the Illinois form of grant being used. A few 
years later, however, Congress gave permission to the state to consolidate 
the different township funds into one state school fund. 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
    NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 31 
ters of a section; for a fractional township containing a greater 
quantity of land than one-quarter, and not more than one-half a 
township, one-half section; and for a fractional township contain- 
ing a greater quantity of land than one entire section, and not 
more than one-quarter of a township, one-quarter section of land. 
And be it further enacted, That the aforesaid tracts of land. shall 
be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury, out of any unappro- 
priated public land within the land district where the township 
for which any tract is selected may be situated; and when so se- 
lected, shall be held by the same tenure, and upon the same terms, 
for the support of schools in such township, as section number 
sixteen is, or may be held, in the State where such township shall 
be situated. 
The New Oregon Type.— The sixteenth section in each 
township was granted uniformly to each new state up to 1850. 
In 1848 a new departure was made, in the organization of the 
Territory of Oregon. 
[Poore, B. P., Federal and State Constitutions, II, 1491.] 
AN ACT to establish the territorial government of Oregon. Ap- 
proved, August 14, 1848. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States in Congress assembled, That from and after the pas- 
sage of this act, all that part of the Territory of the United States 
which lies west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains, north of 
the forty-second degree of north latitude, known as the Territory 
of Oregon, shall be organized into and shall constitute a temporary 
government, by the name of the Territory of Oregon. . . . 
Suc. 20. And be it further enacted, That when the lands of said 
Territory shall be surveyed under the direction of the Government 
of the United States, preparatory to bringing the same into the 
market, sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in each township 
in said Territory shall be, and the same is hereby, reserved for the 
purpose of being applied to schools in said Territory, and in the 
States and Territories hereafter to be erected out of the same. 
Three states, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, have been 
carved from this Territory, and have received the two sections 
for schools. California was the first state to enter the Union 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  32 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
(1850) under the new arrangement, and all states admitted 
afterward received two sections up to the admission of Utah, 
in 1896, which received four sections. 
The Utah Type.— The enabling act for the admission of 
Utah. contained a new provision, which has since been followed 
in the acts for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico. This 
new provision provided for the reservation and grant of four 
sections, as follows: 
[U. 8. Statutes at Large, 1893-1894, p. 107.] 
AN ACT to enable the people of Utah to form a constitution and State 
government, and to be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with 
the original states. Approved, July 16, 1894. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and’ House of Representatives of the 
United States in Congress assembled, 
Sec. 6. That upon the admission of said State in the Union, 
sections numbered two, sixteen, thirty-two and thirty-six in every 
township of said proposed State, and where such sections or any 
part thereof have been sold or otherwise disposed of by or under 
the authority of any Act of Congress other lands equivalent thereto, 
in legal subdivisions of not less than one-quarter sections and as 
contiguous as may be to the section in lieu of which the same is 
taken, are hereby granted to such State for the support of common 
schools, such indemnity lands to be selected within said State in 
such manner as the legislature may provide, with the approval 
of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the second, six- 
teenth, thirty-second and thirty-sixth sections embraced in perma- 
nent reservations for national purposes shall not, at any time, be 
subject to the grants nor to the indemnity provisions of this Act, 
nor shall any lands embraced in Indian, military, or other reserva- 
tions of any character be subject to the grants or to the indemnity 
provisions of this Act until the reservation shall have been extin- 
guished and such lands be restored to and become a part of the pub- 
lic domain. 
Arizona and New Mexico (1911) followed the Utah form 
of grant, while Oklahoma (1907) was given a new and differ- 
ent form of grant. (See Enabling Act, pp. 67-71.)

4. Lease and Sale of the Lands 
By the terms of all of the early grants the lands were given 
to the townships or to the states for the use of schools. Nothing 
was said about their sale, and they were put under lease. The 
great quantity of cheap land made leasing unprofitable, and, 
in 1824 and again in 1825, Ohio applied to Congress for permis- 
sion to sell her school lands. The essentials in the Ohio petition 
were: 
RESOLUTION AND MeEMorIAL TO CoNGRESS ON THE SUBJECT OF 
Scooot Lanps 
[American State Papers, Public Lands, II, p. 654.] 
Communicated to the Senate on March 10, 1824 
Resolved, That the following memorial be submitted to the 
Congress of the United States, during the present session, or as soon 
as may be practicable. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in 
Congress assembled: The memorial of the State of Ohio, in General As- 
sembly, respectfully represents : 
(Here follows a detailed recital of all land grants for schools, 
and a request for a grant in the western part of the Connecticut 
Reserve, to complete the one-thirty-sixth part grant to the state. 
The memorial then continues :) 
That, in relation to the lands already appropriated as above 
described, the Legislature of the State of Ohio, in pursuance of the 
trust aforesaid, and in aid of the great and important object con- 
templated, have resorted to various methods of rendering them 
productive, and, in particular, that of leasing them to such individ- 
uals as have applied therefor; that experience, however, has fully 
demonstrated that this fund will be wholly unavailing in their hands 
in its present shape. 
That, in order that the beneficial and laudable objects contem- 
plated by the grants aforesaid may be secured to the people of the 
State of Ohio, it will, as your memorialists conceive, be necessary 
that the Legislature should possess the unlimited control over the 
lands aforesaid, with the power of disposing of them in fee. 
The objections which are urged against the present mode of ad- 
ministering that fund are, in the first place, that, by reason of the 
facilities which the State of Ohio affords of acquiring a property
-P-A-G-E-57
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 35 
  in real estate, a necessity exists of leasing the lands in question 
to persons almost wholly destitute of pecuniary means, whereby 
the avails of these lands are rendered at least uncertain. In con- 
sequence, also, that,,as these lands are detached over the whole 
State of Ohio, the expense which must necessarily be incurred by 
creating a superintendence over them, render them much less pro- 
ductive than your memorialists conceive they might be rendered 
if the lands were sold, and the proceeds concentrated in one fund. 
The fact, also, before adverted to, that these lands must neces- 
sarily be entrusted to the possession of those of the lowest class 
of the community, and who possess no permanent interest in the 
soil, has produced a waste upon these lands of their timber, and 
otherwise, equal, perhaps, to the whole revenue which may have 
been derived from them. 
The fact, also, that, by holding them under the present tenure, 
your memorialists are compelled to offer, upon lease, so great a 
proportion of their soil as will invite and retain a population within 
her boundaries of a character not to be desired, and in amount 
so great as to create an evil which can only be conceived of in a 
country where every individual, possessing a very moderate por- 
tion of industry and economy, may, within a single year, appro- 
priate to himself, in fee, a quantity of land sufficient to furnish the 
means of support for an ordinary family, is also a circumstance 
which your memorialists conceive is not undeserving of considera- 
tion. 
While the State of Ohio, in common with her sister States, shall 
have her ordinary proportion of idle and unprofitable members, this 
great proportion of land which must be held by lease, must, of ne- 
cessity, produce a corresponding feature in her population. Al- 
though many industrious and valuable citizens may be found among 
the lessees of school lands, yet it must be admitted that the great 
body of those who constitute the strength and basis of every Govern- 
ment, and who are to be considered as the friends of good order and 
public improvement, are among those who are the owners as well 
as the occupiers of the soil. 
These evils, ‘as your memorialists conceive, arise wholly from the 
system of granting these lands upon leases and are such as cannot 
be remedied by any course of legislation whatever, if, as some have 
supposed, the State have not the power, under the term of the origi- 
nal grant, of disposing of these lands in fee. Notwithstanding your 
memorialists may be of the opinion that they already possess this 
right, yet, so long as the question shall admit of any doubt, it must, 
of necessity, have the effect to restrain its exercise. * * * 
Therefore, your memorialists represent that it would be of ad-
-P-A-G-E-58
  36 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
vantage, and conduce to the future prosperity of the State of Ohio, 
that a law of the United States be passed declaring the authority 
of the State of Ohio to dispose of the said lands granted for the 
use of schools within the State, in fee, and that the proceeds thereof 
be invested in some permanent fund, the proceeds of which shall 
be applied, under the direction of the Legislature, for the use of 
common schools within the townships or districts to which they 
were originally granted in said State, and for no other use or pur- 
pose whatever: Provided, That the sections numbered sixteen, 
granted as aforesaid for the use of schools, shall not be sold without 
the consent of the inhabitants of such original surveyed town- 
ship; and that they may be authorized and empowered to sell and 
dispose of the aforesaid six miles reservation, including the Scioto 
salt springs, the salt springs near Muskingum river, and in the 
military tract, with the sections of land which include the same, 
and apply the proceeds thereof to such literary purposes as the 
Legislature of the State of Ohio may hereafter direct. 
Resolved further, That the Governor be requested to forward the 
foregoing memorial to the Government of the United States, and 
take such order and disposition of the funds as may seem to him 
proper. 
JosepH Ricuarpson, Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
ALLEN TRIMBLE, Speaker of the Senate. 
Congress granted permission to Ohio to sell, as requested, in 
1826, and granted similar permission to Alabama in 1827, and 
to Indiana in 1828. The following act, granting permission 
to four states to sell, illustrated the nature of the permission 
granted :

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the legis- 
latures of Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee be, and 
they are hereby, authorized to provide by law for the sale and con- 
veyance in fee simple of all or any part of the lands heretofore 
reserved and appropriated by Congress for the use of schools within

said States, and to invest the money arising from the sales thereof 
in some productive fund, the proceeds of which shall be forever 
applied, under the direction of said legislatures, to the use and 
support of schools within the several townships and districts of 
country for which they were originally reserved and set apart, 
and for no other use or purpose whatever: Provided, Said land, or 
any part thereof, shall in no wise be sold without the consent of 
the inhabitants of such township or district, to be obtained in 
such manner as the legislatures of said states shall by law direct ; 
and in the apportionment of the proceeds of said fund each town- 
ship and district shall be entitled to such part thereof, and no more, 
as shall have accrued from the sum or sums of money arising from 
the sale of the school lands belonging to such township or district. 
Sect. 2. And be it further enacted, That the legislatures of said 
States be, and they are hereby, authorized to make such laws 
and needful regulations as may be deemed expedient to secure and 
protect from injury or waste the sections reserved by the laws 
of Congress for the use of schools to each township, and to pro- 
vide by law, if not deemed expedient to sell, for leasing the same 
for any term not exceeding four years, in such manner as to render 
them productive and most conducive to the object for which they 
were designed. 
Secr. 3. And be it further enacted, That if the proceeds accru- 
ing to any township or district from said fund shall be insufficient 
for the support of schools therein, it shall be lawful for said legis- 
latures to invest the same in the most secure and productive 
manner until the whole proceeds of the fund belonging to such 
township or district shall be adequate to the permanent mainte- 
nance and support of schools within the same: Provided, That the 
legislatures aforesaid shall in no case invest the proceeds of the 
sale of the lands in any township in manner aforesaid without 
the consent of the inhabitants in said township or district, to be 
obtained as aforesaid. 
Secr. 4. And be tt further enacted, That any sales of such lands, 
reserved as aforesaid, as have been made in pursuance of any of the 
laws enacted by the legislatures of said States, and not incon- 
sistent with the principles of this act, are hereby ratified and con- 
firmed so far as the assent of the United States to the same may be 
necessary to the confirmation thereof. 
5. Protests of the Older States 
In 1821 the legislature of the State of Maryland called at- 
tention to the grants made to the new states, and adopted a long
-P-A-G-E-60

and detailed report on the subject, which concluded with the 
following resolutions : 
  Resolved, by the general assembly of Maryland, That each of the 
United States has an equal right to participate in the benefit of 
the public lands, the common property of the Union. 
Resolved, That the States in whose favor Congress have not 
made appropriations of land for the purposes of education, are

portion, with those heretofore made in favor of the other States.

              of Congress, and the Legislatures of the several States, to the 
public lands, as a fund from which appropriations for the purposes 
of education may with justice be claimed by all of the original 
States, and some of the new ones. 
Your committee have, with much attention, examined the 
grounds upon which this claim is supposed to rest ; and, from this 
examination, are satisfied that the principles contended for are 
just and equitable, and, therefore, do concur in the opinion ex- 
pressed in the aforesaid documents. It is not, however, deemed 
necessary on this occasion to enter into an elaborate exposition of 
the principles on which this claim is founded, as this would lead 
merely to a repetition of the circumstances relied upon, and the 
arguments deduced by the committee, who matured the report 
and the resolutions now under consideration. It may be proper, 
notwithstanding, to present for consideration a few of the points 
brought to view in the report of that committee. 
It is alleged that, before the war of the revolution, these States 
were regal and not proprietary provinces, and that the right of 
disposing of them was claimed and exercised by the Crown in some 
form or other; that, by the treaty of peace of 1783, Great Britain 
relinquished “to the United States all claim to the government, 
property, and territorial rights of the same, and every part thereof ;” 
that, between 1783 and 1802 the United States acquired an indis- 
putable title to all of the public lands east of the Mississippi, by 
cessions from all of those States which had exclusively claimed 
the unsettled lands within their respective limits, except a small 
part of the territory which now constitutes a part of the States 
of Mississippi and Alabama, which was acquired under the treaty 
ceding Louisiana; that all the territory west of the Mississippi 
river, together with the southern extremity of the States of Missis- 
sippi and Alabama, was purchased of France for fifteen millions 
of dollars, and that all the sums of money required to pay France, 
to extinguish the Indian title to the land, and the like, was paid 
out of the treasury of the United States, the common fund of the 
whole Union. Forasmuch, therefore, as the property and juris- 
diction of the soil were acquired by the common means of all, it is 
contended that the public lands, whether acquired by purchase, 
by force, or by acts or deeds of cession from individual States are 
the common property of the Union, and ought to enure to the 
common use and benefit of all the States in just proportions, and 
not to the use and benefit of any particular State or States to the 
exclusion of the others, and that any partial appropriation of them, 
for State purposes, “isa violation of the spirit of our national com- 
pact, as well as the principles of justice and sound policy.”
-P-A-G-E-62
40 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
  On the inquiry whether the acts of Congress in relation to the 
appropriation of public lands have been strictly national, it is 
ascertained that, by the existing laws relating to the sale and 
survey of them, one-thirty-sixth part thereof has been reserved 
and appropriated in perpetuity for the support of common schools ; 
besides which, large appropriations have been made in the new 
States generally for the erection and maintenance of seminaries 
of learning of a higher grade than common schools, equal, it is 
calculated, to one-fifth part of the appropriations for common 
schools. 
It is said, on good authority, that all the States and Territories 
in whose favor appropriations have thus been and are to be made, 
according to the existing laws in support of literary institutions, 
contain 437,297,125 acres, and that the total amount of these 
literary appropriations in the new States and Territories will be 
14,576,5693 acres, which, at two dollars per acre, a sum less than 
the average price of all the public lands which have heretofore 
been sold, the amount in money will be $29,153,139.33. 
The State of New Hampshire contains 6,074,240 acres ; of course, 
her proportionate share of the public lands for literary purposes, 
on the principles above stated, would be 202,473 acres. 
It is admitted that, so far as the public lands have been sold, 
and the money paidinto the National Treasury, or appropriated for 
purposes of defense, all the States have derived a justly propor- 
tionate benefit from them. Nor is a spirit of envy attempted to be 
cherished toward the new States on account of the bountiful appro- 
priations made to them for literary purposes; but it cannot be 
denied that such appropriations in favor of any State or States, 
to the exclusion of the rest, where the appropriations would have 
been beneficial, and might have been extended to all alike, would 
be a departure from sound policy, as well as from impartial justice. 
These appropriations are of such a nature that they might have 
been, and still may be, extended to all the States. These States, 
therefore, for whose benefit such appropriations have not yet been 
made, will not be true to themselves if they do not make known to 
Congress, who alone possess the powers to make them, their re- 
quest for such appropriations, not as a matter of favor but of right. 
Whereupon, your committee beg leave to recommend the adop- 
tion of the following resolutions : 
Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State 
of New Hampshire in General Court convened, That each of the 
United States have an equal right to participate in the benefits 
of the public lands as the common property of the Union; and that 
the States, in whose favor Congress has not yet made appropria- 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 41 
tions of land for the purposes of education, are entitled to such 
appropriations as will be in just proportion with those heretofore 
made in favor of the other States. 
Resolved, That His Excellency the Governor be requested to 
transmit copies of the foregoing report and resolutions to each of our 
Senators and Representatives in Congress, with a request that they 
will use their endeavors to procure the passage of an act to appro- 
priate to the use of the State of New Hampshire, for the purposes of 
education, such quantity of the public lands as shall be equitable 
and just. 
Resolved, That His Excellency the Governor be also requested 
to transmit copies of the foregoing report and resolutions to the 
Governors of the several States of the Union, with a request that 
they will communicate the same to the legislatures thereof respect- 
fully, and solicit their codperation to carry into effect the just 
principles therein set forth. 
All of which is respectfully submitted by 
Neuemiau Eastman, for the committee.

[American State Papers; Public Lands, III, 503.] 
Communicated to the Senate, January 14, 1822 
Resolutions in relation to a portion of the public lands of the United 
States as a means of creating a fund for promoting education, and to 
the right of the several States of the Union to a part of the same for 
that purpose. 
The committee, to whom were referred the communications 
from the Legislatures of the States of Maryland and New Hamp- 
shire, ask leave to report : 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
42 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
  That the communications submitted to them embrace reports and 
resolutions thereupon adopted, by the legislatures of those States, 
and the objects of which are to direct the attention of Congress, and 
the legislatures of the several States of the Union, to the national 
lands as a source from which appropriations for the purposes of 
education may with justice be claimed by those States for which no 
such appropriations have yet been made. 
Your committee, highly sensible of the fact that the most effec- 
tual means of achieving or perpetuating the liberties of any country 
is to enlighten the minds of its citizens by a system of education 
adapted to the means of the most extensive class of the population, 
and, alive to any just means within their power for the achievement 
of this great object, not only within their own State, but alike to 
all members of the great political family of which they are a part, 
and for whose common interests they are thus united, have, with 
much interest, examined the facts stated, and the arguments used 
in said reports, and do not hesitate to concur in the opinions therein 
expressed, that the national lands are strictly a national fund, and, 
in just proportions, the property of all the States of the Union; 
and that, from the extent and nature of the fund, appropriations 
may, with great propriety, be extended to all the States of the 
Union. 
It is deemed unnecessary, in a report of this kind, to enter at 
large into all the arguments that might be used to establish the 
opinion above expressed. A few of the facts which have presented 
themselves in the investigation of the subject are submitted. 
It is ascertained that all the States and Territories, whose waters 
fall into the Mississippi, have been amply provided for by the 
laws of Congress relating to the survey and sale of the public 
lands, except the State of Kentucky. 
Why these appropriations should have stopped short of Ken- 
tucky, your committee are not able to see, especially when they take 
into consideration its situation in relation to the other States of the 
Union, the contest it has maintained in establishing itself, pro- 
tecting, at the same time, the Western borders of the old States, 
and extending the more Northern and Western settlements. Ken- 
tucky long stood alone in a forest of almost boundless extent, sepa- 
rated from her parent settlements by extensive ranges of mountains 
and forests, fit receptacles for her savage enemies, and from which 
she was cut off from the succor, and almost from the knowledge of 
her friends; yet maintaining her stand, and, at the same time, 
forming a barrier by which the more Eastern States were protected 
from the common enemy, she has not only established herself, but 
has also gone forward to the establishment and support of those
-P-A-G-E-65
ATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 
  States and Territories which now form the great national domain 
which is the subject of this report. 
Notwithstanding many arguments might be used which would 
go to prove that Kentucky has claims to appropriations of those 
lands without extending the system to all the States, yet your 
committee believe that such arguments are not necessary, and that 
a few facts here submitted will prove that those appropriations may 
be made generally without affecting the national revenue. 
Relying upon the apparent correctness of the able document be- 
fore the committee, received from the State of Maryland, it appears 
that the total amount of literary appropriations made to the new 
States and Territories will amount to 14,576,569 acres; that the 
additional amount required to extend the same system to those 
States for which no such appropriations have yet been made, would 
be 9,370,760 acres; that the State of Kentucky, as her part of such 
appropriation would be entitled to 1,066,665 acres, and estimating 
the whole quantity of unsold lands, yet owned by the United States, 
at 400,000,000 acres, that the additional amount required to ex- 
tend the same scale of appropriation to all the States which have not 
received any, would not amount to two and a half per cent upon the 
landed fund as above. 
Relying, therefore, upon the foregoing considerations as suffi- 
cient for their purpose, and believing that the magnanimity of their 
sister States in the West will produce a unanimity in the Congress 
of the United States upon this subject, your committee are pre- 
pared to close this report, and beg leave to recommend the adoption 
of the following resolutions : 
Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Common- 
wealth of Kentucky, That each of the United States has an equal 
right, in its just proportion, to participate in the benefit of the 
public lands, the common property of the Union. 
Resolved, That the Executive of this State be requested, as soon 
as practicable, to transmit copies of the foregoing report and reso- 
lution to the Governors of the several States, and to our Senators 
and Representatives in Congress, with a request that they will lay 
the same before their respective houses, and use their endeavors to 
procure the passage of a law to appropriate to the use of the State 
ot Kentucky, for the purposes of education, such a part of the public 
lands of the United States as may be equitable and just.

Ohio, through its legislature, protested against such grants, 
but before the Ohio protest or the resolutions of a number of 
the States had time to reach Congress, the following adverse 
report was made to the United States Senate, and no further 
action seems to have been taken. 
6. Proposition to grant Land to the Old States for the Purpose of 
Education 
[American State Papers, Public Lands, III, 496] 
Communicated to the Senate, February 9, 1821 
Mr. Thomas, from the Committee on Public Lands, being in- 
structed to inquire into the justice and expediency of granting land 
for the purposes of education within the limits of the old States, 
corresponding with the appropriations which have been made for 
the same object within the limits of the new States, reported : 
That, under the laws of the United States, lands have been 
granted for the purposes of education in the States of Ohio, Louisi- 
ana, Indiana, Mississippi, Illinois, and Alabama, in the proportion 
of one-thirty-sixth part of all the public lands within the State, with 
the addition of two townships, of forty-six thousand and eighty 
acres in each State, and to Louisiana an additional township, or 
twenty-three thousand and forty acres. The quantity which is 
already vested in each of the above States by the operation of this 
system, and which will vest in them, when the Indian title shall 
have been extinguished, and the whole of the lands are surveyed, 
will be exhibited sufficiently for all practical purposes by the an- 
nexed estimate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and 
which is a part of this report. The committee also remark that, 
by an act of the 18th of April, 1806, a donation of two hundred 
thousand acres of land were made to the State of Tennessee for the 
use of two colleges, and academies in each county of the State, to 
be established by the legislature thereof; and six hundred and 
forty acres in each six miles square, where it was practicable, for 
the use of schools; and that a township, or twenty-three thousand 
and forty acres was, on the 3rd of March, 1819, granted by the 
United States to the Connecticut Asylum for the education of 
deaf and dumb persons. 
The lands thus granted to the States for the above purposes are 
not subject to taxation by the State Government, and can only be 
settled in the manner pointed out by the States in which they    
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 45 
lie. If, therefore, corresponding quantities for the purposes of 
education are to be granted to all the old States, (under which term 
the committee believe all States will be included which have not re- 
ceived donations of land for that purpose), it would seem that the 
States and Territories which now contain public land would have 
an excessive proportion of their superfices taken up ‘with such 
donations, leaving but a small part of the land lying in each sub- 
ject to taxation, or to settlement, except at the will of other sover- 
eign States. In receiving donations of land for the purposes of 
promoting education in the States in which they have been granted, 
in the opinion of the committee, a consideration has been rendered 
therefor, on the part of those States, by the increased value which 
the population and improvement of the State gave to the unsold 
public lands, and by the compact not to tax the lands of the United 
States at any time before they were sold, nor until the lapse of five 
years thereafter. 
The lands, therefore, granted to some of the new States for the 
purposes of education, though distinguished in common parliance 
as donations, were in fact sales bottomed upon valuable considera- 
tions, in which the new States surrendered their right of sovereignty 
over the remaining public lands, and gave up the whole amount 
which might have been received in taxes before such lands were 
sold, and for five years thereafter. 
The committee are, therefore, of the opinion that it is inex- 
pedient to grant lands to the extent contemplated in the resolution ; 
but that it is just and expedient to grant a per centum, to a reason- 
able extent, on the amount of sales of public lands for the purposes 
of promoting education in such States as have not received the aid of 
the General Government, distributing the amount among the 
several States according to the population of each; and that jus- 
tice would require an equivalent from the United States to the 
States and Territories which contain public lands, if it should be 
deemed advisable to make the donation to the old States recom- 
mended in this report; and they are of the opinion that, in that 
event, it would be entirely just to subject to taxation, by such 
State or Territory, all lands sold by the United States therein, from 
and after the day on which they may be sold. 
Another Report from the Committee on Public Lands was 
made in 1826 on the same subject, in answer to a resolution 
of the House on the matter. The report recommended a dis- 
tribution of a portion of the proceeds from the sales of national 
lands, but no action seems to have been taken. The discussion 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    
  46 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
  of the subject now turned to the question of distributing the 
surplus revenue (see further on in this chapter) and then died 
out until after the Civil War. 
After the close of the Civil War the prostrate condition of 
the South, and the great percentage of illiteracy among the 
freedmen, again drew attention to the question of extending 
some form of national aid for education, virtually for the relief 
of the South. The matter was considered for many years, and 
~ attracted much attention, but no bill was ever able to secure 
the approval of both houses of Congress. Two main lines of 
aid were proposed, one the establishment of a national educa- 
tional fund from the proceeds of the land sales, and the other 
a temporary measure for the immediate relief of the situation. 
These proposals are considered further under subdivision V 
of this chapter. 
Il. Orser Grants ror Common ScHOOLS 
1. Saline Grants 
In the Enabling Act for the admission of Ohio Congress also 
made a grant of Saline lands (see Enabling Act, Sec. 2) which 
also served as a precedent, and in which nearly all of the Mis- 
sissippi Valley states later shared. Indiana was subsequently 
given thirty-six sections with the salt springs, and Illinois 
was given all of the salt springs in the state together with the 
land reserved for the same, but the grant was soon changed to 
limit it to a total of two townships. The following section 
from the Enabling Act of Wisconsin is typical :   [Poore, B. F., Federal and State Constitutions, II, 2025.] 
Srcr. 5. Fourth. That all salt-springs within said State, not 
exceeding twelve in number, with six sections of land adjoining, or 
as contiguous as may be to each, shall be granted to the State for 
its use; the same to be selected by the legislature thereof within 
one year after the admission of said State; and, when so selected, 
to be used or disposed of on such terms, conditions, and regula- 
tions as the legislature shall direct: Provided, That no salt-spring

This was begun with Ohio in 1802 (see Enabling Act, Sec. 3) 
and continued with each state having public land ever since. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  48 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
In the admission of Illinois in 1818, three fifths of the five 
per cent was set aside for schools, for the first time. After 
about 1845 states began to request the permission of Con- 
gress to so appropriate it, and since about 1860 it has been 
uniformly specified as for schools. (See Oklahoma Enabling 
Act, pages 67-71.)

3. The Surplus Revenue Distribution 
Between 1821 and 1841 the questions of how to dispose of 
the national lands and the surplus revenue received much 
attention. Of the reports, resolutions, and bills relating to 
these subjects, the following extracts from a long and eloquent 
report made to the House present the essentials of one of the 
proposed plans. 
[American State Papers, Vol. 31 (Public Lands, IV), p. 750.] 
Mr. Strong, from the Committee on Public Lands, to whom was 
referred the resolution of December 21, 1825, instructing them “to 
inquire into the expediency of appropriating a portion of the net 
annual proceeds of the sales and entries of the public lands exclu- 
sively for the support of common schools, and of apportioning the 
same among the several States in the proportion to the representa- 
tion of each in the House of Representatives,” reported : 
That . . . the resolution under consideration proposes to appro- 
priate a portion of the proceeds of the public lands to a new and 
specific object; to convert it into a permanent fund for the sole 
use and support of common schools in the several States; and 
to divide this fund among the several States in proportion to the 
representation of each in this House. 
Of appropriating a portion of these proceeds to a new and specific 
object. — A part of the public domain was acquired by the for- 
tunes of war, and a part by purchase. The whole constitutes a 
common fund for the joint benefit of the States and the people. 
This domain amounted to some hundred millions of acres, and of it 
probably some two hundred millions of acres of good land yet re- 
main unsold. It is true that the proceeds of these lands, together 
with those of the internal duties, and the duties on merchandise, 
and the tonnage of vessels, to the amount of ten millions of dollars 
annually, are appropriated and pledged to the “sinking fund.” 
But is this a valid objection to the appropriation of the whole or of 
any part of the proceeds of these lands to any other proper object ? 
Since the act of March, 1817, making this appropriation and pledge 
to the sinking fund, the annual average amount of the public revenue 
has been about twenty millions of dollars. So long, therefore, as 
ten millions of dollars are left to the sinking fund, the appropria- 
tion is answered and the pledge redeemed ; and the surplus revenue, 
E

  50 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
from whatever source derived, not having been appropriated or. 
pledged, remains to be disposed of in such way and for such pur- 
poses as the Congress may direct. 
Of apportioning this fund among the several States. — Equality 
of rights and privileges, both as it regards citizens and States, 
is the fundamental principle of our government. Hence the people, 
as far as the integrity and independence of the States will permit, 
are equally represented in the popular branch of the national legis- 
lature. Guided by this rule, the committee have no doubt that the 
apportionment should be made among the several States according 
to the representation of each in the House of Representatives. This 
will distribute the fund, and dispense the blessings resulting from 
it, upon the strictest principles of equality. The ordinary disburse- 
ment of the public money does not directly support all alike. . . . 
But the proposed appropriation for the benefit of common schools 
is an object general in its nature and benefits. It is an appropria~- 
tion in which every American citizen has a deep interest, and by 
the operation and influence of which the ignorant and the wise, the 
rich and the poor, the government and the governed, will receive 
direct and lasting benefits. 
The resolution before the committee does not indicate, in terms, 
whether the principal annually apportioned, or the interest on the 
principal only, shall be paid over to the States. Nor does it point 
out any mode, in case the interest only is to be applied, of investing 
the principal. This part of the subject merits some examination. 
It seems to be manifest, that the more certain and permanent 
the fund, the greater and more lasting will be the benefits flowing 
from it. To apportion and pay the principal annually to the 
several States will be doing equal and exact justice. But the 
principal, in that case, would be annually expended. The conse- 
quence of this will be, that, as the public domain diminishes by 
sales until the whole is sold, the fountain whence the fund is to be 
drawn will be gradually and finally exhausted, and the fund and its 
benefits, of necessity, diminish and cease altogether. As this do- 
main is not exhaustless, if the principal set apart for the use of 
these common schools be annually expended, its benefits will be 
chiefly confined to our own time; but by investing the principal, 
and dividing the interest only, the fund will accumulate, and its 
benefits may continue to future ages. The committee, therefore, 
propose that the sum annually appropriated shall be invested by 
the United States in some productive fund, the interest or other 
proceeds of which shall be annually apportioned among the several 
States according to the representation of each State in the House 
of Representatives of the United States.

  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION et 
No action was taken on this report, but the questions of 
national aid and the distribution of the surplus revenue came 
up for consideration many times during the succeeding fifteen 
years, The surplus revenue question reached a culmination 
in 1836, when the following bill was passed : 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, V, 55.) 
AN ACT To regulate the deposits of public money. Approved, 
June 23, 1836. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That * * * 
Sxcr. 13. And be it further enacted, That the money which shall 
be in the Treasury of the United States, on the first day of Janu- 
ary, 1837, reserving the sum of five millions of dollars, shall be 
deposited with such of the several States, in proportion to their 
respective representation in the Senate and House of Representa- 
tives of the United States, as shall, by law, authorize their Treas- 
urers, or other competent authorities, to receive the same on the 
terms hereinafter specified; and the Secretary of the Treasury 
shall deliver the same to such Treasurers, or other competent 
authorities, on receiving certificates of deposit therefor, signed by 
such competent authorities, in such form as may be prescribed 
by the Secretary aforesaid; which certificates shall express the 
usual and legal obligations, and pledge the faith of the State, for 
the safe keeping and repayment thereof, and shall pledge the faith 
of the States receiving the same, to pay the said moneys, and every 
part thereof, from time to time, whenever the same shall be re- 
quired, by the Secretary of the Treasury, for the purpose of defray- 
ing any wants of the public treasury, beyond the amount of the 
five millions aforesaid: Provided, That if any State declines to 
receive its proportion of the surplus aforesaid, on the terms before 
named, the same shall be deposited with the other States, agreeing 
to accept the same on deposit in the proportion aforesaid : And 
provided further, That when said money, or any part thereof, shall be 
wanted by the said Secretary, to meet appropriations by law, the 
same shall be called for, in rateable proportions, within one year, 
as nearly as conveniently may be, from the different States, with 
which the same is deposited, and shall not be called for, in sums 
exceeding ten thousand dollars, from any one State, in any one 
month, without previous notice of thirty days, for every additional 
sum of twenty thousand dollars, which may at any time be re- 
quired. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  52 . AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
Secr. 14. And be it further enacted, That the said deposits shall be 
made with the said States in the following proportions, and at the 
following times, to wit : one quarter part on the first day of January, 
1837, or as soon thereafter as may be; one quarter part on the first 
day of April, one quarter part on the first day of July, and one 
quarter part on the first day of October, all in the same year. 
Only the first three payments were ever made, as the Treas- 
ury was practically empty by October. In October, 1837, the 
power to recall or assign the obligation was taken from the 
Secretary of the Treasury and given to Congress, and the money 
has never been called for. The School Fund of a few states 
has profited by this “ deposit ”’ of public funds, though in most 
of the states the money was spent or lost.

4. The Internal Improvement Act of 1841 
In 1841 Congress inaugurated a policy in the matter of the 
distribution of the public lands, a part of which has ever since 
been followed. 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, V, 453.] 
AN ACT to appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the public 
lands, and to grant pre-emption rights. Approved, September 4, 
1841. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after 
the 31st day of December, in the year of our Lord 1841, there be 
allowed and paid to each of the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, 
Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Michigan, 
over and above what each of the said States is entitled to by the 
terms of the compacts entered into between them and the United 
States, upon their admission into the Union, the sum of ten per 
centum upon the nett proceeds of the sales of the public lands, 
which, subsequent to the day aforesaid, shall be made within the 
limits of each of said States respectively : Provided, That the sum so 
allowed to the said States, respectively, shall be in no wise affected 
or diminished on account of any sums which have been heretofore, or 
shall be hereafter, applied to the construction or continuance of the 
Cumberland road, but that the disbursements for said road shall 
remain, as heretofore, chargeable on the two per centum fund 
provided for by compacts with several of the said States. 
Scr. 2. And be it further enacted, That after deducting the said 
ten per centum, and what, by the compacts aforesaid, has hereto- 
fore been allowed to the States aforesaid, the residue of the nett
-P-A-G-E-80
58 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
proceeds, which nett proceeds shall be ascertained by deducting 
from the gross proceeds all expenditures of the year for the follow- 
ing objects: salaries and expenses on account of the General Land 
Office; expenses for surveying public lands; salaries and expenses 
of the surveyor-general’s offices; salaries, commissions, and allow- 
ances to the registers and receivers; the five per centum to new 
States ; — of all the public lands, wherever situated, which shall be 
sold subsequent to the said 31st day of December, 1841, shall be 
divided among the twenty-six States of the Union and the District of 
Columbia, and the Territories of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Florida, 
according to their respective federal representative population as 
ascertained by the last census, to be applied by the Legislatures 
of the said States to such purposes as the said Legislatures may 
direct: Provided, That the distributive share to which the District 
of Columbia shall be entitled, shall be applied to free schools, or 
education in some other form, as Congress may direct. . . . j 
Sect. 3. And be it further enacted, That the several sums of money 
received in the Treasury as the nett proceeds of the sales of public 
lands shall be paid at the Treasury half-yearly on the first day of 
January and July in each year, during the operation of this act, to 
such person or persons as the respective Legislatures of the said 
States and Territories, or the Governors thereof, in case the 
Legislatures shall have made no such appointment, shall authorize 
and direct to receive the same. 
Secr. 4. And be it further enacted, That any sum of money, which 
at any time may become due, and payable to any State of the 
Union, or to the District of Columbia, by virtue of this act, as the 
portion of the said State or District, of the proceeds of the sales of 
the public lands, shall be first applied to the payment of any debt, 
due, and payable from said State or District, to the United States : 
Provided, That this shall not be construed to extend to the sums 
deposited with the States under the act of Congress of June 23rd, 
1836, entitled “ An act to regulate the deposits of the public money,” 
nor to any sums apparently due to the United States as balances 
of debts growing out of the transactions of the Revolutionary war. 
Sect. 5. And be it further enacted, That this act shall continue 
and be in force until otherwise provided by law, unless the United 
States shall become involved in war with any foreign Power, in| 
which event, from the commencement of hostilities, this act shall] 
be suspended during the continuance of such war: Provided, never. 
theless, That if, prior to the expiration of this act, any new Stat 
or States shall be admitted into the Union, there be assigned t 
such new State or States, the proportion of the proceeds accruin; 
after their admission into the Union, to which such State or State:

NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 59 
may be entitled, upon the principles of this act, together with 
what such State or States may be entitled to by virtue of compacts 
to be made on their admission into the Union. 
Sxcr. 6 provided, that in case the minimum sale price of lands _ 
were increased, or in case the “imposition of duties on imports” 
be changed to a higher rate than twenty per centum “then the 
distribution provided for in this act shall be suspended.” 
A change in the tariff laws, taking effect on August 29, 1842, 
put an end to the ten per cent distribution provided for by the 
above act. In general the money was used to pay state debts 
and expenses, or for internal improvements, though in a few 
states it was put into the school fund. The distributive share 
of each State from January 1 to August 29 was as follows:

canals, bridges and water-courses, when made or improved, sha 
be free for the transportation of the United States mail, and mun’ 
tions of war, and for the passage of their troops, without the pa; 
ment of any toll whatever.   At first used for purposes of internal improvements, thegran’ 
were gradually changed and placed in the school fund, an| 
Enabling Acts in time came to so specify its use.

5. Swamp Land Grants 
In 1849, on the application of Louisiana, Congress granted 
to the state all the overflowed and swamp lands within the state, 
the proceeds to be used to construct levees and drains. The 
next year this act was made general, by the following law: 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, IX, p. 519.] 
AN ACT to enable the State of Arkansas and other States to re- 
claim the “Swamp Lands” within their limits. Approved, Septem- 
ber 28, 1850. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That to enable the 
State of Arkansas to construct the necessary levees and drains to 
reclaim the swamp and overflowed lands therein, the whole of those 
swamp and overflowed lands, made unfit thereby for cultivation, 
which shall remain unsold at the passage of this act, shall be, and 
the same are hereby, granted to said State. 
Szc. 2. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty 
of the Secretary of the Interior, as soon as may be practicable 
after the passage of this act, to make out an accurate list and 
plats of the lands described as aforesaid, and transmit the same to 
the Governor of the State of Arkansas, and, at the request of said 
Governor, cause a patent to be issued to the State therefor; and 
on that patent, the fee simple to said lands shall vest in said State 
of Arkansas, subject to the disposal of the legislature thereof : 
Provided, however, That the proceeds of said lands, whether from 
sale or by direct appropriation in kind, shall be applied, exclusively, 
as far as necessary, to the purpose of reclaiming said lands by means 
of the levees and drains aforesaid. 
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That in making out a list 
land plats of the land aforesaid, all legal subdivisions, the greater 
part of which is “wet and unfit for cultivation,” shall be included 
in said list and plats; but when the greater part of said subdivision 
is not of that character, the whole of it shall be excluded therefrom. 
Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That the provisions of this 
ct be extended to, and their benefits be conferred upon, each of the 
ther States of the Union in which such swamp and overflowed 
ands, known as designated aforesaid, may be situate. 
       
            
    
    
    
By an act passed in 1855, indemnity-lands for swamp-lands 
hich had been sold were granted; in 1857 all swamp-lands
-P-A-G-E-86
  64 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
so far selected and reported were confirmed to the states; in 
1860 the provisions of the act were extended to Minnesota 
and Oregon, but declared not to apply to Kansas, Nebraska, 
and Nevada; and in 1866 California was included. For all 
states admitted since, the grant has been declared not to 
apply, and specific grants of land have been made in lieu. 
(See table on page 62.) 
The following table shows the amount of these grants, and 
the use which has been made of them :

6. Forest Reserve Income 
In 1908 a new source of income was added for certain western 
states, by the following Act of Congress :
-P-A-G-E-87
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 65 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 35, Part I, p. 260.] 
AN ACT, Making appropriations for the Department of Agriculture 
forthe fiscal year ending Junethirtieth, 1909. Approved, May 23,1908. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That the following 
sums be, and they are hereby, appropriated out of any money in the 
Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated. . . . 
Forestry Service 
That hereafter twenty-five per centum of all money received 
from each forest reserve during any fiscal year, including the year 
ending June thirtieth, 1908, shall be paid at the end thereof by the 
Secretary of the Treasury to the State or Territory in which said 
reserve is situated, to be expended as the State or Territorial legis- 
lature may prescribe for the benefit of the public schools and public 
roads of the county or counties in which the forest reserve is situ- 
ated: Provided, That when any forest reserve is in more than one 
State or Territory or county the distributive share to each from the 
proceeds of said reserve shall be proportional to its area therein. 
The amounts so far paid under this provision have been: —

    7. Recent Enabling Acts 
For a long time the different Enabling Acts followed the 
ichigan, or later, the Oregon plan with respect to school land 
rants. With the increasing value of the lands granted, and the 
crease in importance of public education, Congress has not 
ade more liberal grants, but has at the same time provided 
reater safeguards against the waste or diversion of only the en- 
owments granted. A few recent Enabling Acts will show this. 
The Enabling Act for Colorado, approved March 3, 1875, 
contained the first restriction as to sale price. After re- 
roducing the Oregon type of grant it adds: 
F
-P-A-G-E-88
EE —_L 
66 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
[Poors, B. P., Charters and Constitutions, I, 219.] 
Src. 14. That the two sections of land in each township herein 
granted for the support of common schools shall be disposed of 
only at public sale and at a price not less than two dollars and 
fifty cents per acre, the proceeds to constitute a permanent school- 
fund, the interest of which to be expended in the support of com- 
mon schools. 
The next Enabling Act passed was the one for the admission 
of North and South Dakota, Montana, and Washington, in 1889, 
and this contained added conditions as to the sale of the lands, 
and a new provision relating to the control of the schools so 
endowed, as follows: 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 25, p. 679-80.] 
AN ACT to provide for the division of Dakota into two States and to 
‘enable the people of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and 
Washington to form constitutions and State governments and to be 
admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States, 
and to make donations of public lands to such States. Approved, 
Feb. 22, 1889. 
Sec. 11. That all lands herein granted for educational purposes 
shall be disposed of only at public sale, and at a price not less than 
ten dollars per acre, the proceeds to constitute a permanent school 
fund, the interest of which only shall be expended in the support 
of said schools. But said lands may, under such regulations as the 
legislatures shall prescribe, be leased for periods of not more than 
five years, in quantities not exceeding one section to any one per- 
son or company; and such land shall not be subject to pre-emp- 
tion, homestead entry, or any other entry under the land laws off 
the United States, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, but shall b: 
reserved for school purposes only. 
Sec. 14. The schools, colleges, and universities provided for i 
this act shall forever remain under the exclusive control of th 
said States, respectively, and no part of the proceeds arising fro’ 
the sale or disposal of any lands herein granted for educationa 
purposes shall be used for the support of any sectarian or denomi, 
national school, college, or university. 
             
    
   
     The Enabling Acts for Idaho and Wyoming, in 1890, followe 
practically the same lines, as did the one for Utah, in 189
-P-A-G-E-89
——————— ES 
NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 67 
except that the grants to Utah were larger. In the Enabling 
Acts for Oklahoma in 1906, and for Arizona and New Mexico 
in 1911, still further safeguards were inserted and larger grants 
made. This may be seen from the following reproduction 
of the educational sections of the Oklahoma Enabling Act. 
[U. S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 34, p. 270.] 
AN ACT To enable the people of Oklahoma and of the Indian Terri- 
tory to form a constitution and State government and be admitted 
into the Union on an equal footing with the original States. Ap- 
proved, June 16, 1906. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That . . . 
Src. 3. Fifth. That provisions shall be made for the estab- 
lishment and maintenance of a system of public schools, which 
shall be open to all of the children of said State and free from 
sectarian control; and said schools shall always be conducted in 
English: Provided, That nothing herein shall preclude the teach- 
ing of other languages in said public schools: And provided further, 
That this shall not be construed to prevent the establishment and 
maintenance of separate schools for white and colored children. . . . 
Sec. 7. That upon the admission of the State into the Union 
sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six, in every township in 
Oklahoma Territory, and all indemnity lands heretofore selected 
in lieu thereof, are hereby granted to the State for the use and 
benefit of the common schools: Provided, That sections sixteen and 
thirty-six embraced in permanent reservations for national purposes 
shall not at any time be subject to the grant nor the indemnity 
provisions of this Act, nor shall any lands embraced in Indian, 
military, or other reservations of any character, nor shall land 
owned by Indian tribes or individual members of any tribe be sub- 
jected to the grants or to the indemnity provisions of this Act 
until the reservations shall have been extinguished and such lands 
be restored to and become a part of the public domain: Provided, 
that there is sufficient untaken public land within said State to 
cover this grant: And provided, That in case any of the lands 
herein granted to the State of Oklahoma have heretofore been 
confirmed to the Territory of Oklahoma for the purposes specified 
in this Act, the amount so confirmed shall be deducted from the 
uantity specified in this Act. 
There is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the Treas- 
ry not otherwise appropriated, the sum of five million dollars for

Territory. Said appropriation shall be paid by the Treasurer of 
the United States at such time and to such person or persons as 
may be authorized by said State to receive the same under laws to 
be enacted by said State, and until said State shall enact such 
law said appropriation shall not be paid, but said State shall 
be allowed interest thereon at the rate of three per centum per 
annum, which shall be paid to said State for the use and benefit 
of its public schools. Said appropriation of five million dollars 
shall be held and invested by said State, in trust, for the use and 
benefit of said schools, and the interest thereon shall be used exclu- 
sively in the support and maintenance of said schools: Provided, 
That * * * [provision whereby the United States retains control 
of the Sulphur Springs reservations]. 
Sec. 8. That section thirteen in the Cherokee Outlet, the 
Tonkawa Indian Reservation, and the Pawnee Indian Reservation, 
reserved by the President of the United States by proclamation 
issued August nineteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, open- 
ing to settlement the said lands, and by any Act or Acts of Congress 
since said date, and section thirteen in all other lands which have 
been or may be opened to settlement in the Territory of Oklahoma, 
and all lands heretofore settled in lieu thereof, is hereby reserved 
and granted to said State, for the use and benefit of the University 
of Oklahoma and the University Preparatory School, one-third ; of 
the normal schools now established or hereafter to be established, 
one-third ; and of the Agricultural and Mechanical College and the 
Colored Agricultural Normal University, one-third. The said lands 
or the proceeds thereof shall be divided between the institutions 
as the legislature may prescribe: Provided, That the said lands so 
reserved or the proceeds of the sale thereof shall be safely kept or 
invested and held by said State, and the income thereof, interest, 
rentals, or otherwise, only shall be used exclusively for the benefit 
of said educational institutions. Such educational institutions 
shall remain under the exclusive control of said State, and no 
part of the proceeds arising from the sale or disposal of any lands 
herein granted for educational purposes, or the income or rentals 
thereof, shall be used for the support of any religious or sectarian 
school, college, or university. 
That section thirty-three, and all lands selected in lieu thereof, 
heretofore reserved under said proclamation and Acts for charitable 
and penal institutions and public buildings, shall be appropriated

of Oklahoma are valuable for minerals, which terms shall also in- 
clude gas and oil, such lands shall not be sold by the said State 
prior to January first, 1915; but the same may be leased for pe- 
riods not exceeding five years by the State officers duly authorized 
for that purpose, such leasing to be made by public competition 
after not less than thirty days advertisement in the manner to be 
prescribed by law, and all such leasing shall be done under sealed 
bids and awarded to the highest responsible bidder. The leasing 
shall require and the advertisement shall specify in each case a 
fixed royalty to be paid by the successful bidder, in addition to 
any bonus offered for the lease, and all proceeds from leases shall 
be covered into the fund to which they shall properly belong, and

any right in the assignee without the consent of the proper State 
authorities in writing: Provided however, That agricultural lessees 
in possession of such lands shall be reimbursed by the mining lessees 
for all damage done to said agricultural lessees’ interest therein 
by reason of such mining operations. The legislature of the State 
may prescribe additional legislation governing such leases not in 
conflict herewith. 
Src. 9. That said sections sixteen and thirty-six, and lands 
taken in lieu thereof, herein granted for the support of common 
schools, may be appraised and sold at public sale in one-hundred 
and sixty acre tracts or less, under such rules and regulations as

acre tracts or less, under such rules and regulations as the legis- 
lature of said State may prescribe, preference right to purchase 
at the highest bid being given to the lessee at the time of such sale,

terested appraisers, who shall be non-residents of the county where- 
in the land is situated, to be designated as the legislature of said 
State shall prescribe, and the said appraisers shall make a true 
appraisement of said lands at the actual cash value thereof, ex- 
clusive of improvements, and shall separately appraise all improve-

mon schools within said State. 
Sec. 12. That in lieu of the grant of land for purposes of in- 
ternal improvement made to new States by the eighth section of

Act. Said selections as soon as made shall be certified to the 
Secretary of the Interior, and the lands so selected shall be there- 
upon withdrawn from homestead entry. 
Til. Vatur or THE GRANTS FoR Common ScHOOLS 
As nearly as can be determined and estimated the value of 
these grants made for common schools is about as follows: 
I. STATES ADMITTED BEFORE 1825, — All received but one sec- 
tion of land. The five per cent fund used everywhere for internal 
improvements, except in Illinois. Land sold at low prices, with 
some large losses. No state with a large actual fund, and in no 
state have the national grants produced over eight millions of 
dollars for education. 
1. Tennessee. — Admitted in 1796. By the act of 1806 (p. 26) 
one section to be reserved for schools in about two-thirds of state. 
Often no reservation made, and where made lands frequently 
sold for from one to twelve and a half cents an acre. Proceeds 
used to start a school fund, though little was produced. In 
1836 the Surplus Revenue deposit of $1,433,757.58 invested in 
State Bank stock, the bank to pay $100,000 annually for schools 
and $18,000 for academies. By 1866 bank insolvent, and in 1873 
the debt to the School Fund, for all, recognized at $1,500,000, on 
which the state now pays six per cent interest from the proceeds 
of taxes. 
2. Ohio. — Admitted in 1802. Received the 16th section for 
schools, in all 704,488 acres. Permission to sell same granted 
in 1826. Also received 24,216 acres of saline lands, which pro- 
duced $41,024 for the school fund. In 1850 received 25,640 acres 
of swamp lands, which were also added to the school fund. Land 
sold early, much of it at low prices. In 1836 state received $2,007,- 
260.36 of Surplus Revenue, about half of which was added to the 
school fund. In 1912 the total school fund accumulated from 
all these sources, plus a few additions, was $2,610,245, while unsold 
lands were valued at $258,346. 
3. Louisiana. — Admitted in 1812. Some years later granted 
the 16th section for schools in all unsold regions (about ninety- 
eight per cent of the state), a total of 786,044 acres. Permission 
to sell same granted in 1843. Much land of little value, and 
uch still on hand. By 1859 the fund from land sales was $899,- 
00. In 1872 the legislature appropriated the fund and spent it.

72 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
In 1874 the state’s debt to the school fund recognized at $1,130,- 
867.51, and interest on this at four per cent paid now from state 
taxes. In 1876 the interest on the spent Surplus Revenue of 1837, 
amounting to $447,919.14 also put into the school fund, and this 
also is paid from taxation. 
4. Indiana. — Admitted in 1816. Received the 16th section 
for schools, a total of 650,317 acres. Permission to sell granted in 
1828, by township vote. All sold but 864 acres, producing a 
fund of $2,475,856.83, thus averaging about $3.75 for each acre 
of land. The state also received 28,829 acres of saline lands, 
which produced $48,943.13, and this was added to the school fund. 
The state also received 1,257,588 acres of swamp land, the net 
proceeds of which were to go into the school fund, but how much 
came from this source is not shown, though it is known that the 
amount was quite small. In 1836 received $860,254.44 of Surplus 
Revenue, which in 1851 was added to the school fund. Certain 
small annual additions have been made to the fund since 1851, 
and the total fund is now nearly eleven and a half million dollars, 
about half of which probably came from the national grants. 
5. Mississippi. — Admitted in 1817. Received the 16th sec- 
tion for schools, a total of 837,584 acres. Permission granted by 
Congress to lease for 99 years. Much mismanagement and loss. 
Swamp lands added to school fund after 1868, and five per cent 
fund after 1882. Amount received from swamp lands unknown. 
Five per cent fund has since produced only about $75,000, as 
nearly all public land has been sold. All spent; present fund 
recognized as $816,615, on which the state pays interest. 
6. Illinois. — Admitted in 1818. Received the 16th section 
for schools, a total of 985,066 acres. Permission to sell granted 
in 1843. All sold but 6,639 acres, but these are estimated as worth 
$12,598,670. The most valuable of these lands are located in 
the heart of the business district of Chicago, and belong to the 
City of Chicago rather than to the state. The state also received 
about four million acres of swamp lands, and all expended balances 
from these, after paying for drainage, was to go to the school 
fund. By 1885 it was estimated that the swamp lands had pro- 
duced $600,000 for education. This would leave about six million 
dollars in the township fund, presumably derived from the sale 
of school lands, or an average of about six dollars per acre. The 
three per cent fund for schools has produced $613,362.96, one- 
sixth of which ($156,613.32) has been used as an endowmen 
for normal schools. Theoretically $335,592.32 of the Surplu 
Revenue was added to the school fund, and on this the state pay 
interest at six per cent, by taxation. Total common school fund, 
in 1912, counting all unsold lands, $19,168,579.

7. Alabama. — Admitted in 1819. Granted the 16th section 
for schools, a total of 902,774 acres. Permission to sell granted 
in 1827. In 1848 the 500,000 acre grant added to school fund by 
permission of Congress. By 1855 $1,244,793.36 had been accumu- 
lated from land sales. About 250,000 acres still on hand, esti- 
mated as worth $12 per acre. In 1876 the spent Surplus Rev- 
enue fund of $669,088.95 included in name in the school fund, and 
interest at four per cent by taxation paid by the state. Present 
fund, including Surplus Revenue and minor additions within recent 
years, $2,135,313. 
8. Missouri. — Admitted in 1821. -Received the 16th section, 
in all 1,199,139 acres. The township fund from sale of these lands 
now $2,445,169, an average of a little over two dollars per acre. 
State also received 46,080 acres of saline lands, which were put 
into state school fund. This state fund was further increased in 
1837 by the addition of the Surplus Revenue fund, $383,335.30, 
and by $132,000 from sale of state tobacco warehouse in 1865. 
The state fund has had some other additions, and now stands at 
$3,159,281. The state also received 3,370,840 acres of swamp 
lands, which were put into a series of county school funds. These, 
increased by the sale of estrays, and by fines and forfeitures, now 
total $5,618,630. The various common school funds of the state 
have profited, probably, between six and seven millions of dollars 
from the national grants. 
Il. Srares ADMITTED AFTER 1825 aND BEFORE 1850. — All 
received but one section of land. Five per cent fund and 500,000 
acres of land used by many for education. All have small per- 
manent funds, though, except Texas. Much mismanagement 
and waste has characterized the management of the lands, and in 
some states the fund has been borrowed by the state and spent, 
leaving only a “perpetual obligation” upon which the state pays 
interest by means of taxation. 
1. Arkansas. — Admitted in 1836. Received the 16th section 
or schools, a total of 886,460 acres. Permission to sell granted in 
1843. In 1844 Congress granted permission to add the two town- 
hips of university land (46,080 acres) to the common school fund. 
‘he two townships of saline lands also so added, making a total 
f 978,620 acres. One-fifth sold before the Civil War, and the 
hole proceeds lost in the struggle. Debt never capitalized. 
ince the War a new fund of $1,134,500 built up. 
2. Michigan. — Admitted in 1837. Granted the 16th section 
lor schools, a total of 1,067,397 acres. By 1910 the fund from the 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
74 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
sale of these lands amounted to $4,345,820, with a few acres still 
unsold, an average of a little over four dollars per acre. In 1850 
and 1857 the state received 5,838,775 acres of swamp land, all 
but 6,961 acres of which was put into the school fund. This has 
so far produced $972,606 for the school fund, and $42,397 for the 
agricultural college. Both of these funds were spent by the state, 
and exist to-day as obligations, the state paying interest at seven 
per cent on the 16th section fund, and at five per cent on the swamp 
land fund. The state also received two townships of saline lands 
(46,080 acres). Of this 16,000 acres was used to start a normal 
school fund, which has since produced about $70,000 of endow- 
ment, and the remainder was put into an agricultural college fund. 
The national endowment for schools produced about five and a 
half millions of dollars for the school fund. 
8. Florida. — Admitted in 1845. Received the 16th section 
lands for schools, a total of 908,503 acres. The 500,000 acres of 
land granted by the law of 1841 was also put into the school fund. 
All the fund built up before the War was lost in that struggle. 
The five per cent fund was also put into the school fund, and had 
produced $130,141 by 1910. Nearly a quarter of a million acres 
are still on hand, much of it of little value. Anew fund of $1,415,- 
155 has been built up since the War, though only in part from the 
sales of land. 
4. Texas. — Admitted to the Union by annexation in 1845. No 
lands were granted it by Congress, but as early as 1839 the state 
itself had set aside school lands, three leagues of land to a county. 
In 1866 all alternate sections along railway grants were devoted 
to schools, and in 1869 the proceeds of the sale of all public lands 
were put into the school fund. The present school fund is approxi- 
mately $65,000,000, with additional county funds of over $11,000,- 
000. There are also about four millions of acres of unsold lands, 
estimated as worth $1.50 each now. Texas will probably in tim 
have a school fund of nearly $100, 000, 000, built up by itself fro: 
its own lands. 
' 6. Iowa. — Admitted in 1846. Received the 16th section foi 
schools, a total of 905,144 acres. The grant of 500,000 acres o 
land to new states, the five per cent fund, and the saline lands wer 
all put into the school fund, a total of 1,451,224 acres. The fiv 
per cent grant produced $633,638 for schools. All school land 
have been sold, except 200 acres, and the school fund, with certai: 
additions from other sources, now amounts to $4,799,722. Th 
school lands probably sold for an average of not over two dollar: 
per acre. 
6. Wisconsin. — Admitted in 1848. Received the 16th se 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
i 
NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 75 
tion for schools, a total of 958,649 acres. The 500,000 acres of 
land to new states was also added to the school fund, as was the 
five per cent fund. This latter had produced $586,046 up to 1910. 
The lands have all been sold, but produced little, due to gross 
mismanagement. The total fund at present is only $3,926,226. 
The school lands probably averaged little over $1.25 per acre. 
The 46,080 acres of saline lands were given to the university, and 
produced about $150,000. The two townships of university 
lands produced about the same amount. The state also received 
3,071,458 acres of swamp land, half of which was given to found 
a normal school fund. This is now about two millions of dollars, 
which means about the same average sale price. 
Ill. Srares apMirreD FROM 1850 ro 1880.— All of these 
states received two sections for schools, and nearly all added the 
five per cent fund and the 500,000 acres of land to the school 
fund. Much greater care of the school lands now characterizes 
the action of the state, and for the first time we meet a group hav- 
ing large and growing school funds. 
1. California. — Admitted in 1850. The first state to receive 
the 16th and 36th sections for schools. The 500,000 acres of land 
given to new states was also added to the school fund, as was the 
five per cent fund. The total grant for schools, including the 
new state lands grant, was 7,219,324 acres. The state still has 
much land unsold. Up to 1909 the sale price was $1.25 per acre, 
but since then sold by auction, and the price has averaged about 
$7 per acre. The five per cent fund had produced $1,032,896 by 
1910, and produced $17,754 that year. By 1876 the school lands 
had produced a fund of but $1,737,500. The total school fund 
now is about six millions, about two-thirds of which has come 
from the sale of school lands. The fund probably will reach about 
10,000,000, not counting additions made from other sources. 
ith better management it should have been three times this 
mount. 
2. Minnesota. — Admitted in 1858. Received the 16th and 
6th sections for schools, a total of 2,969,990 acres. The swamp 
and grant of 2,271,967 acres was devoted, one-half to the school 
und, and one-half to a fund for charitable and reformatory in- 
titutions. The land sales have brought in over ten millions of 
ollars. The permanent fund is now about $22,000,000, and 
creasing a million a year from sales of land and timber, mineral 
ases, and iron royalties. The minimum sale price was fixed at 
5 per acre in 1861, and present sales are much above this price.

Much of the land is underlaid with rich iron ore, and it has been 
estimated that in time a fund of $100,000,000 will be produced 
from these grants. | 
3. Oregon. — Admitted in 1859. Received the 16th and 36th 
sections for schools, a total of 3,329,706 acres. The grant of 500,- 
000 acres to new states, and the five per cent fund, were also added 
to the common school fund, as were a part of the swamp lands. 
The five per cent fund had produced $675,370 by 1910, and $41,145 
was added in that year. The fund at present is $6,211,805 and 
with about 500,000 acres of unsold land under lease. Probably 
nearly five millions of this has come from the sale of school lands, 
and probably a fund of nine to ten millions may be produced as 
a result of the Congressional grants for schools. 
4. Kansas. — Admitted in 1861. Received the 16th and 36th 
sections, a total of 2,801,306 acres. The 500,000 acre grant to 
new states was also added to the school fund by the constitution 
of 1859, but the State Superintendent of Instruction says that it 
was never put there. . The saline grant was used largely for a 
normal school fund. 
The school lands have all been sold, and the present state school 
fund is $9,100,000. ‘The five per cent fund was also devoted to 
schools, and had produced $1,112,246 by 1910. The lands prob- 
ably averaged about $2.50 per acre. 
§. Nevada. — Admitted in 1864. Received the 16th and 36th 
sections, but in 1880, after a few acres had been sold, the state ex- 
changed all remaining lands with the National Government for 
2,000,000 acres, to be located by the state. The 500,000 acres 
of land granted to new states, and the five per cent fund, at first 
granted for internal improvements, were later put into the school) 
fund by consent of Congress. The five per cent fund had pro- 
duced but $23,324 by 1910. The total school fund is only about 
$600,000 at present. Much of the school land is still on hand. 
Eventually, a fund of possibly two to three millions may be pro 
duced from the national grants. 
6. Nebraska. — Admitted in 1867. Received the 16th and 36t) 
sections, a total of 2,702,044 acres. The 500,000 acre grant t 
new states and the five per cent fund were also added to the schoo 
fund. In 1867 a minimum price of $7 per acre was fixed, an 
in 1875 this was raised to appraised value. About half of thi 
school lands have been sold, and a fund of about eight million: 
has been produced; 1,681,678 acres are now under lease, an 
estimated as worth ten dollars an acre, but probably will sel 
for more. A fund of $25,000,000 from the government grant 
for schools seems assured for the state. The five per cent fun 
had produced $540,377 by 1910, and is still increasing slowly.

  7. Colorado. — Admitted in 1876. Received the 16th and 36th 
sections, a total of 3,715,555 acres. A minimum price of $2.50 
per acre was fixed by Congress, and raised to $3.50 by the state 
in 1887. By 1908 only 187,402 acres had been sold, and three- 
fourths of the remainder was under lease. There were, at last 
reports, 2,553,598 acres under lease, estimated as worth $10 
per acre, and 811,008 acres not under lease. The five per cent fund 
was also added to the school fund. 
The present state fund consists of $1,601,907 in actual funds, 
and a debt of the state to the fund of $1,225,975, making a total of 
$2,827,882. It seems not improbable that a fund of $80,000,000 
will be produced, in time, from the national grants. 
IV. SrarEs ADMITTED SINCE 1880. — All received two sections 
and the five per cent fund for schools, while three states received 
four sections. These grants will be further increased as the title 
to Indian reservations is extinguished. — It is in this group of states 
that the largest schools funds may be expected. 
1. North Dakota. — Admitted in 1889. Received the 16th 
and 36th sections for schools, a total of 2,542,940 acres, with a 
minimum sale price of $10 per acre fixed by Congress. About 
two-fifths of the land has been sold, at an average of about $16 
per acre, though recent sales have been much higher. The five 
per cent fund was also added to the school fund, and had produced 
$433,905 by 1910, and is increasing rapidly. The increase for 
1909-10 was $55,167. The present school fund is $15,351,441, 
and is increasing rapidly. The 1,572,915 acres still on hand are 
estimated as worth about $22,000,000. Probably a fund of $50,- 
000,000 will in time be produced from the government grants for 
common schools. 
2. South Dakota, — Admitted in 1889. Received the 16th 
and 36th sections for schools, a total of 2,539,175 acres. Mini- 
mum sale price fixed at $10 per acre by Congress. About one- 
fifth of the land has been sold, and a fund of $8,357,817 has been 
built up. The five per cent fund for schools had produced $178,- 
438 by 1910, and increased $40,567 during the year 1909-10. 
The unsold lands (2,075,168 acres) are estimated as worth $20 an 
acre. Probably a fund of $60,000,000 will be produced from the 
government grants for common schools. 
8. Montana. — Admitted in 1889. Received the 16th and 
36th sections for schools, a total of 5,112,035 acres. Minimum 
sale price fixed at $10 per acre by Congress. In 1908 two million 
acres had not as yet been surveyed, and only one and a half mil- 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
EE 
78 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
lion acres were under lease. The permanent fund is now about six 
millions of dollars, with but a small part of the lands sold. The 
five per cent fund is also for schools, and this had produced $300,- 
651 by 1910, and is increasing about $25,000 per year at present. 
The future of the fund is problematical, but it should produce sixty 
to seventy-five millions, and may produce one hundred millions 
under wise management. 
4. Washington. — Admitted in 1889. Received the 16th and 
36th sections for schools, a total of 2,488,675 acres. Minimum 
sale price fixed at $10 per acre by Congress. The five per cent 
fund, given for schools, had produced $367,700 by 1910, and is 
increasing. A state school fund of over eight millions has been 
built up so far from a sale of about one-eighth of the land. This 
is at an average of about three times the minimum sale price. 
The 2,055,073 acres remaining unsold are estimated as worth $20 
an atre, and it seems not improbable that a school fund of sixty 
to seventy-five millions may be produced from the national grants 
for schools, if the lands are wisely managed. 
§. Idaho. — Admitted in 1890. Received the 16th and 36th 
sections for schools, a total of 3,068,231 acres. Minimum price 
fixed by Congress at $10 per acre. Sales so far have averaged 
twice this price. A fund of about three and a half million dollars 
has been built up so far from the sales of only a small part of the 
land, there still being 2,811,596 acres of unsold land. The five 
per cent fund, given for schools, had produced $206,723 by 1910, 
and is an increasing fund. It seems probable that the state may 
realize a fund of from forty to fifty millions from the national 
grants for schools. 
6. Wyoming. — Admitted in 1890. Received the 16th and 
36th sections for schools, a total of 3,480,281 acres. Minimum 
sale price fixed by Congress at $10 per acre. The five per cent 
fund was also given for schools, and had produced $160,185 by 
1910. By 1908 only 22,271 acres had been sold. The status of 
the fund in 1912 was stated as follows:   Permanent state fund ; $ 191,973 
8,758,010 acres unsold, estimated as worth _ 3,179,000 
$3,370,973 
What the fund will produce in time is problematical. If a sale 
price of $10 per acre could be realized, a fund of $35,000,000 
should be produced in time. If only $3 per acre, the minimum 
price fixed for Arizona, a fund of $12,000,000 should be produced| 
in time.

%. Utah. — Admitted in 1896. Received the 2d, 16th, 32d, 
and 36th sections for schools. No minimum sale price fixed, as 
the value of much of the land is problematical. The total grant 
was 6,007,226 acres. The five per cent fund was also given for 
schools, and this had produced $54,286 by 1910, one-fifth of which 
was received that year. The amount produced by 1912 was 
$1,173,975, while the total estimated value of lands and fund was 
$5,170,527. If the minimum sale price fixed for Arizona and New 
Mexico, $3 per acre, could be realized, a fund of $20,000,000 should 
eventually be built up from the national grants for common schools. 
8. Oklahoma. — Admitted in 1907. Received the 16th and 
36th sections, in Oklahoma proper, for common schools, a total 
of 1,240,242 acres, and $5,000,000 in lieu of grants in the Indian 
Territory. Minimum sale price fixed at appraised value. The 
five per cent fund also given for schools. This had produced, up 
to 1910, $38,644, the amount in 1909-10 being $24,041. The 
school lands were estimated as worth $20 per acre, and probably 
will average higher. If properly managed a fund of $30,000,000 
to $40,000,000 should be produced from the government grants 
for common schools alone. 
9. Arizona. — Admitted in 1911. Received the 2d, 16th, 32d, 
and 36th sections for common schools. Minimum sale price fixed 
at $3 per acre for ordinary lands, and $25 per acre for irrigation 
lands. Total grant for common schools, 8,100,694 acres. The 
five per cent fund also granted for common schools. One million 
acres granted to certain counties to pay off certain bonds, and 
any surplus also to go to the school fund. Value of the lands some- 
what uncertain, but a fund of from thirty to forty millions for 
schools should eventually be produced. 
10. New Mexico. — Admitted in 1911. Received the same 
grants as Arizona, a total of 8,618,736 acres. Minimum sale price 
fixed at $3 per acre in western New Mexico, $5 per acre in eastern 
New Mexico, and $25 per acre for irrigated lands. A fund of 
from thirty-five to forty-five millions should eventually be pro- 
duced for schools from these grants.

was granted 100,000 acres of land for two colleges. In the Ena- 
bling Act for Indiana, in 1816, the following clause occurs : 
Sec. 6, Fourth. That one entire township, which shall be desig- 
nated by the President of the United States, in addition to the 
one heretofore reserved for that purpose, shall be reserved for the 
use of a seminary of learning, and vested in the legislature of the 
said State, to be appropriated solely to the use of such seminary by 
the eh legislature. (Poore, B. P., Charters and Constitutions, I, 
499. 
All states have since received two townships (46,080 acres) 
and a few have received a larger amount. 
Beginning with 1889 a new policy was adopted, and the last 
ten states admitted have received large grants for higher educa- 
tion. (See Table of Specific Grants, page 62.) In the case of 
Oklahoma (see Enabling Act, Sec. 8) one section of land was 
granted for the aid of the university, normal schools, and 
agricultural and mechanical colleges, in addition to other 
liberal grants. Most of the new states have also received 
liberal grants of land for the aid of normal schools, and for 
charitable, penal, and reformatory institutions. (See Table 
of Specific Grants.) 
2. Proposition to grant Land for Universities 
In all of these grants the old original states of course did not 
share, and propositions have been made, from time to time, to 
grant land to them also for university purposes, but these met 
with no success until 1862. The following Report reveals 
the usual objections raised against such proposals. 
PROPOSITION TO GRANT ONE Hunprep THousaAnp ACRES OF 
Lanp to Each Stare ror THE ENDOWMENT oF a UNI- 
VERSITY 
Communicated to the House of Representatives, Jan. 18, 1819. 
[American State Papers, Public Lands, II, p. 363.] 
Mr. Poindexter, from the Committee on Public Lands, to whom 
as referred a resolution instructing said committee to inquire into 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  the expediency of appropriating one hundred thousand acres of land 
to each State, for the endowment of a university in each State, 
reported : 
That they are fully impressed with the propriety and impor- 
tance of giving every encouragement and facility to the promotion 
of learning, and the diffusion of knowledge over the United States, 
which can be done without a violation of the principle of the con- 
stitution, and the system of policy heretofore adopted for the ad- 
vancement of the general welfare. The proposition under con- 
sideration is, whether it be or be not expedient to authorize a grant 
of one hundred thousand acres of land to each State in the Union, 
making in the whole two million three hundred thousand acres, 
to be vested in bodies corporate, created by the several States 
having the care and management of their respective universities. 
Your committee have no specific knowledge of the necessity which 
exists for this appropriation, in reference to any particular State 
whose resources may not be adequate to the support of literary 
institutions, as no petitions or memorials have been referred to 
them on the subject. In the absence of these it is fair to presume 
that the internal wealth and industry of the population, composing 
the several States, have been found sufficient to answer all the 
purposes of public education and instruction, so far as they have 
deemed it prudent and necessary to apply the means they possess 
to those objects. But if the aid of the General Government should, 
at any time, be required to enable a particular State, or every 
member of the Union, to carry into effect a liberal and enlarged 
system of education, suited to the views, capacities, and circum- 
stances, of all classes of society ; and if it should be thought wise 
and constitutional to extend to them the national bounty, the 
donation of extensive tracts of lands in the unappropriated Terri- 
tories of the United States appears to your committee to be the 
most exceptionable form in which the requisite assistance could be 
granted. To invest twenty-three corporations, acting under 
State authority, with a fee simple estate in two million three 
hundred thousand acres of land, to be located in the Western States 
and Territories, would put it in their power to impede the settle- 
ment of that section of the Union by withholding these lands from 
market; to interfere with the general regulations now in force 
for the disposal of the public lands; to divide settlements which 
would otherwise be contiguous; and, consequently, to lessen the 
value of the lands offered for sale by the United States in the neigh- 
borhood of these large grants, which may remain unoccupied for 
any length of time, at the discretion of the Legislature of the State 
to which the donation is made. Your committee are of opinion
-P-A-G-E-105
NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 83 
that, besides these strong objections to the donations proposed 
in the resolutions submitted to their consideration, it does not 
comport with sound policy, or the nature of our republican insti- 
tutions, to grant monopolies of large and extensive tracts of the 
public domain, either to individuals or bodies corporate. The 
lands of the United States ought, as far as practicable, to be dis- 
tributed in small quantities among the great body of the people 
for agricultural purposes; and this principle ought in no instance 
to be violated, where the grantee is exempted from the payment 
of a valuable consideration to the Government. Your committee 
are sensible that it may be found necessary and useful, for the 
promotion of learning in this growing republic, either to endow 
2 national university, or to extend its benevolence in a reasonable 
and proper proportion to individual States; but, in either case, 
they are of opinion that the requisite aid should be given in money 
and not in the mode pointed out in the resolution referred to them. 
They, therefore, recommend the following resolution to the House : 
Resolved, That it is inexpedient to grant to each State one hun- 
dred thousand acres of land for the endowment of a university in 
each State. 
3. The Land-Grant Colleges 
In 1850 the legislature of Michigan petitioned Congress for 
grant of 350,000 acres of public land to found a college of 
griculture, and for the next twelve years this matter was before 
ongress, in one form or another, and from time to time. In 
858 Michigan repeated its petition. In 1859 a bill was passed, 
ranting 20,000 acres of land for each member in Congress to 
ach state for the purpose, but was vetoed by President Buchanan 
s unconstitutional and bad in principle. In 1862 a similar 
ill, granting 30,000 acres instead of 20,000, was passed by 
ongress and approved by President Lincoln. The policy 
us begun has been extended, from time to time, until to-day 
tional aid for the colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts 
rms an important and very significant feature of the relation 
the Federal Government to the educational work of the 
ates. 
The veto of President Buchanan, in 1859, is interesting, as 
esenting the old arguments against national aid, and as a 
ediction of evils which both did and did not come to pass.

Veto MEssaGE OF THE 1859 BrtL 
[House Mise. Docs., 2d Sess., 53d Cong., Vol. 37, Part V, p. 543.] 
Wasuineton City, February 24, 1859. 
To the House of Representatives of the United States : 
I return with my objections to the House of Representatives, 
in which it originated, the bill entitled “An act donating public 
lands to the several States and Territories which may provide 
colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts,” 
presented to me on the 18th instant. 
This bill makes a donation to the several States of 20,000 acres 
of the public lands for each Senator and Representative in the 
present Congress, and also an additional donation for any Repre- 
sentative to which any State may be entitled under the census of 
1860. 
According to a report from the Interior Department, based 
upon the present number of Senators. and Representatives, the 
lands given to the States amount to 6,060,000 acres, and their 
value, at the minimum Government price of $1.25 per acre, to 
$7,575,000... . 
I shall now proceed to state my objections to this bill. I deem 
it to be both inexpedient and unconstitutional. 
1. This bill has been passed at a period when we can with great 
difficulty raise sufficient revenue to sustain the expenses of the 
Government. Should it become a law the Treasury will be de- 
prived of the whole, or nearly the whole, of our income from thi 
sale of public lands, which for the next fiscal year has been esti 
mated at $5,000,000. 
A bare statement of the case will make this evident. The mini 
mum price at which we dispose of our lands is $1.25 per acre. Aj 
the present moment, however, the price has been reduced to thos 
who purchase the bounty warrants of the old soldiers to 85 cent 
per acre, and of these warrants there are still outstanding an 
unlocated . . . the amount of 11,990,391 acres. This has alread, 
diminished the current sales by the Government and diminishe 
the revenue from this source. If, in addition 33 states shall ent: 
the market with their land scrip, the price must be greatly reducer 
below even 85 cents per acre. . . . It is easy to perceive that wit 
this glut of the market Government can sell little or no lands 
$1.25 per acre, when the price of bounty-land warrants and scri 
shall be reduced to half this sum. . . . 
2. Waiving for the present the question of constitutional pow       
    
     
    
    
   
  
-P-A-G-E-107
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION 85 
vhat effect will this bill have on the relations established between 
he Federal and State Government? The Constitution is a grant 
o Congress of a few enumerated but most important powers, 
elating chiefly to war, foreign and domestic commerce, negotia- 
ion, and other subjects which can be best and alone exercised 
eneficially by the common Government. All other powers are 
eserved to the States and to the people. For the efficient and 
larmonious working of both, it is necessary that their several 
pheres of action should be kept distinct from each other. This 
lone can prevent conflict and mutual injury. Should the time 
ver arrive when the State governments shall look to the Federal 
[reasury for the means of supporting themselves and maintain- 
ng their systems of education and internal policy, the character 
f both Governments will be greatly deteriorated. 
3. This bill, should it become a law, will operate greatly to the 
njury of the new States. The progress of settlements and the 
nerease of an industrious population owning an interest in the 
oil they cultivate are the causes which will build them up into 
reat and flourishing commonwealths. Nothing could be more 
prejudicial to their interests than for wealthy individuals to acquire 
arge tracts of the public land and hold them for speculative pur- 
y0ses. The low price to which this land scrip will probably be 
educed will tempt speculators to buy it in large amounts. . . . 
4. It is extremely doubtful, to say the least, whether this bill 
vould contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the me- 
hanic arts — objects the value and dignity of which can not be 
oo highly appreciated. 
The Federal Government, which makes the donation, has 
onfessedly no constitutional power to follow it into the States 
nd enforce the application of the fund to the intended objects. 
s donors we shall possess no control over our own gift after it 
all have passed from our hands. It is true that the State legis- 
tures are required to stipulate that they will carefully execute 
e trust in the manner prescribed by the bill. But should they 
il to do this, what would be the consequence? The Federal 
overnment has no power to compel the execution of the trust. 
would be in as helpless a condition as if, even in this, the time 
great need, we were to demand any portion of the many millions 
surplus revenue deposited with the States for safe-keeping under 
e act of 1836. 
5. This bill will injuriously interfere with existing colleges in 
e different States, in many of which agriculture is taught as a 
jience and in all of which it ought to be so taught. These insti- 
tions of learning have grown up with the growth of the country,
-P-A-G-E-108
  86 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
under the fostering care of the States and the munificence of ind: 
viduals, to meet the advancing demands for education. The 
have proved great blessings to the people. Many, indeed mos' 
of them are poor and sustain themselves with difficulty. Wha 
the effect will be on these institutions of creating an indefinit 
number of rival colleges sustained by the endowment of the Fec 
eral Government it is not difficult to determine. . . . 
6. But does Congress possess the power under the Constitutio 
to make a donation of public lands to the different States of th 
Union to provide colleges for the purpose of educating their ow 
people ? 
I presume the general proposition is undeniable that Congre: 
does not possess the power to appropriate money in the Treasury 
raised by taxes on the people of the United States, for the purpos 
of educating the people of the respective States. It will not b 
pretended that any such power is to be found among the specifi 
powers granted to Congress nor that “it is necessary and prop¢ 
for carrying into execution”? any one of these powers. Shoul 
Congress exercise such a power, this would be to break down th 
barriers which have been so carefully constructed in the Const 
tution to separate Federal and State authority. We should the 
not only “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises ”’ f¢ 
Federal purposes, but for every State purpose which Congres 
might deem expedient or useful. This would be an actual cot 
solidation of the Federal and State Governments so far as the greé 
taxing and money power is concerned, and constitute a sort ¢ 
partnership between the two in the Treasury of the United State 
equally ruinous to both. . . . 
JAMES BUCHANAN. 
In 1862 the following bill, very similar to the one vetoed b 
President Buchanan, was passed by both houses and approv 
by President Lincoln : 
Tue First Morritit Act

so invested shall constitute a perpetual fund, the capital of whi 
shall remain forever undiminished (except so far as may be p1 
vided in section fifth of this act), and the interest of which sh 
be inviolably appropriated by each State, which may take a: 
claim the benefit of this act to the endowment, support, and mai 
tenance of at least one college where the leading object shall | 
without excluding other scientific-and classical studies, and i 
cluding military tactics, to teach such branches of learning

or buildings. 
Third. Any State which may take and claim the benefit of 
provisions of this act shall provide, within five years, at least 
less than one college, as described in the fourth section of 
act, or the grant to such State shall cease; and said State shall 
bound to pay the United States the amount received of any la: 
previously sold, and that the title to purchasers under the S

   By an Act approved July 23, 1866, the above law was amended 
as to give all States three years additional to express their 
ceptance, and five years after expressing their acceptance 
provide the college. This permitted the States formerly 
rebellion to share in the grant. This law was as follows:

In 1887 Congress began the policy of assisting these colleg 
to do more extended work, by the following Act, and this poli 
has been continued in subsequent Acts. This act of 188 
with subsequent amendments, is as follows:

V. PRoposaLs For SpectaL Grants For Pusiic ScHOOL 
Since the close of the Civil War two different attempts hav 
been made to extend national aid to the states for the improve 
ment of their public school systems. The first was the serie 
of efforts, made between 1870 and 1889, to establish a nations 
permanent school fund and temporarily to make direct grant 
to the states, the income to be distributed to the states at firs 
in proportion to the number of illiterates in each. The Hoa 
bill of 1870 proposed the establishment of a national fund, an 
the Blair bills of 1881 to 1887 the extension of temporary aid. 
The nature of the Blair bill, as well as some of the reasons fo 
its failure, are in part set forth in the following extract from a: 
address, by its author, before the Department of Superintendenc 
of the National Educational Association, in 1887. 
[From Circular of Information No. 3, 1887, U.S. Bureau 
Education, pp. 185-187.] 
I have been requested to say a little to the audience with refer 
ence to the education bill. This association of superintendent 
of the country has fathered it from the beginning. It has grow 
out of the wants of the people of all parts of the country, as the; 
have been brought to the attention of the superintendents of thi 
country. The census also was a revelation, but along with th 
cold figures of the census came the personal statements of tht 
superintendents of the various states. These statements hav, 
been laid before Congress for six or eight years. These statemen 
and some deductions from the census were brought to the atte 
tion of the different members of Congress, and finally to the tw 
Houses of Congress. There was for a.long time a bill which pr 
posed to give simply the interest of the annual accumulations 
the sales of public lands, to distribute this throughout the countr: 
upon the basis of population. It was found that this would n 
amount to much. For the present at least it was no help, an 
therefore it was that the present educational bill, which has o: 
thing as its leading feature, and that is the appropriation of enoug 
money now to do some good; therefore it was that this education 
bill was introduced into the Congress of the United States. Th: 
was in the month of December, 1881. It was introduced in tl 
Senate as a report from the Senate committee, but it got no furthe 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  NATIONAL AID FOR EDUCATION ~ 105 
It was discussed, however, and the idea was brought out. 
The next was the Forty-eighth Congress (1883-5), in which the 
pill was fully discussed and finally passed the Senate. It appro- 
priated $77,000,000 to be distributed throughout the country 
upon the basis of illiteracy, during the eight years following its 
enactment into law. It was just about an average of $10,000,000 
1 year. It began at 7 millions; went to 10, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, and 
) millions, during which time the whole amount would have been 
listributed. The bill was very carefully and fully discussed dur- 
ing several weeks of the Congress, and was finally passed by a vote 
of 33 to 11. It was not passed by a two-thirds vote or as a party 
measure. Perhaps it was more generally supported upon the 
Republican than upon the Democratic side of the Senate, but the 
difference was so slight that it was not a party measure. The 
tates of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi gave two votes 
‘or it in the Senate; there was one from Alabama, two from Florida, 
wo from Georgia, one from South Carolina, two from North 
arolina, one from West Virginia, one from Kentucky, one from 
‘ennessee, etc. As you see, the South as a section really gave 
ore votes than were given against it. 
It passed in the Forty-eighth Congress, on the 7th of April, 
y a vote of 33 to 11. It went to the House, and, notwithstanding 
lhe strenuous efforts of Mr. Willis and other members of the 
ouse, it failed to be considered; and I ought to say that in the 
ouse of Representatives, in the same Congress, there was a 
easure of like character, though of considerable less power, which 
as reported from the Senate Committee on Education, but which 
t no further. Strong influences were against the bill, and it 
iled. On the assembling of the Forty-ninth Congress (1885- 
7), just expired, the bill was reintroduced in the Senate in pre- 
isely the same form that it had passed before, and after a three 
eeks’ discussion it again passed the Senate by a vote of 36 to 
, gaining three votes. It went to the House last March a year 
o, and there it met a bad fate. The Committee on Education, 
o should have considered such a measure favorably, were found 
be opposed to it. Its friends then introduced the bill under 
other head as a House bill, and it was referred to the Committee 
Labor after a somewhat heated contest, which resulted, I 
lieve, in a vote of some fifty majority. 
There were some objections to the reference, which seemed to 
a slight to the other Committee, who had failed to act upon it. 
r a long time the Labor Committee, who were expected to report 
once, kept the bill in their possession, and at last, after very 
at pressure, reported adversely on the Senate bill, and presented i“

a substitute, which was really — I do not risk anything by sayin 
this when I say that the majority report was made for the purpos 
of killing the bill — reported a substitute which was too ridiculou 
for consideration. The minority reported in favor of the measur 
of the Senate, but failed to get consideration through the lon 
session, and so the matter came over to the short session. 
Never was greater effort made. Memorials came from all ove 
the country. Over 100,000 signatures were placed to a petitio 
for the passage of the bill, many of them representing large bodie 
societies, and organizations of men and women, so that the entir 
representation — as I am assured by those who have examine 
into the matter — the entire representation in favor of the bi 
was not less than 2,000,000 people. The friends of the measur 
made a strenuous effort to secure its consideration under the dire 
tion of the committee who had charge of the bill, and on a tes 
vote, as to the consideration of the bill, had a majority of 160 i 
its favor to 76 against it, more than a two-thirds vote. By 
process of filibustering its consideration was defeated, and so i 
passed beyond the control of any committee. Then nothing re 
mained but an appeal to the Committee on Rules, who are a com 
mittee of the House with power to report at any time. Tha 
committee, in connection with the management of the appropria 
tion bills, and the Speaker’s power of recognizing whomsoever h 
pleases, are the elements which really control the course of busine: 
in the House. A minority of the committee were in favor of r 
porting the bill for consideration, but the majority steadfast] 
refused not only to report that bill, but to report for the consider: 
tion of the House of any of the great measures that had been r 
ferred to it in the same way, fearing, as they expressed it, that 
a report were made some of the friends of the school bill wou 
move to amend that report by proposing the school bill for co 
sideration, and, if it once got out of the committee, it would 
through the House, so that there was no other way but to preve 
its report, and soit failed. But although the bill failed, its streng 
before the country was developed, and also that it had more th: 
a two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Anyone w 
has observed the discussion on this bill must have seen its streng 
The matter now stands in this way : The public necessity alm: 
universally demands it, the Senate in two Congresses has develop 
more than a three-fourths majority for the bill, the House m 
than a two-thirds majority, which would ensure its passage, e 
if it had to incur the opposition of a veto, which I do not beli 
it will, if it reaches the Executive of the country, and we h: 
every reason to hope that in the Fiftieth Congress we shall achi

success. We will know the nature of the opposition we must 
meet, and the friends of the bill will see that it is considered during 
the Fiftieth Congress, and being introduced early, and supported 
by the same influences which have hitherto carried it along, until 
it has grown stronger and stronger, I believe we shall be certain 
of success in the Fiftieth Congress. 
* * * * * * * 
The Senate of the Fiftieth Congress again passed the Blair 
bill, but it was again found impossible to pass it through the 
House, and the attempt to secure such legislation was then 
abandoned. 
In 1894-1895 another effort to secure some form of aid, 
though on different lines, was made in a bill introduced into the 
House by Representative Beckner of Kentucky, which proposed 
to equalize all land grants previously made for common schools 
to two sections to each state, by then making grants to the 
states to supply any deficiency. The bill was referred to the 
Committee on Public Lands, but was never reported out. It 
would have required approximately 28,000,000 acres of public 
lands to have made such grants. 
The following table shows the amount and location of the 
ublic lands still on hand :

_ FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR EDUCATION

Federal Participation in Education.— A traditional and 
firmly established practice, aided by the hitherto accepted 
nterpretations of the rights and powers of the Federal govern- 
ment under the constitution, have caused education, as rep- 
‘esented by the organized public school system, to remain 
inder the practically exclusive jurisdiction of the several states. 
t is clear, nevertheless, that through land grants and money 
subsidies the national contribution towards the upbringing of 
he American educational ideal, embodied in the state public 
chool systems, has been of the greatest moment. The educa- 
‘ional influence of the central government has not, however, 
een exerted entirely through indirect channels. In addition 
o numerous teaching institutions of special character under 
‘ederal control, many departments and divisions of the govern- 
ent carry on work directly and intentionally educational. 
hese teaching institutions and departmental activities should 
e included in any accounting of the nation’s educational 
sources and influences. 
Some measure of the extent and varied character of Federal 
larticipation in educational enterprises is sought through the 
ta, and documents here assembled.

By the terms of the bequest of an Englishman, James Smith; 
son (1765-1829), the United States, in 1846, received in trus 
property amounting to nearly three quarters of a million dollar 
for the founding of “an Establishment for the increase an 
diffusion of knowledge among men.” Under this trust Congres 
established the Smithsonian Institution, which was placed it 
charge of a board of regents composed of the Vice Preside 
and Chief Justice of the United States, three members of t

Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, to- 
gether with six persons other than members of Congress. As 
the pioneer American institution for the encouragement of 
scientific research and publication, the Smithsonian Institution 
is to be ranked among the potent educational influences under 
the oversight of the Federal Government. Connected with 
the Institution are the National Museum (1846), the Bureau 
of American Ethnology (1879), the National Zodlogical Park 
(1890), and the Astrophysical Observatory (1891).

ivisions of the central government likewise contribute to the 
roadening of national ideals and the quickening of national 
rogress. Withal the direct and tangible results of its work, 
nd the country-wide scope of its influence have given to the

IV. Tse Curnpren’s Bureau 
The manifold benefits accruing to the people of the country 
‘om the undertakings of the numerous bureaus and divisions 
{ the United States Department of Agriculture, even during its 
latively brief existence, always afforded a forceful argument 
or those who foresaw the possibilities of the proper utilization 
i Federal influence for the conservation and betterment of 
hild life. The arguments advanced by social service workers 
nd others of altruistic motives for the constitution of a Federal 
gency, the chief attention of which would be directed toward 
hild welfare, had added force through the failure of Congress 
) provide sufficient funds to enable the Bureau of Education 
roperly to carry on its legitimate work.

  The proposals for the establishment of a national Burea 
of Education date from about 1864 and 1865. In 1866 
memorial form was presented to Congress on the subject 
the National Association of State and City School Superinter 
dents. In 1867 an act was passed establishing a Nation: 
Department of Education. The Memorial and this act 
Congress are eliminated from this collection but are given 
the Source Book in the History of Education in the Unit 
States.

  CHAPTER IV 
CONTEMPORARY MOVEMENTS FOR NATIONALIZING 
AMERICAN EDUCATION 
Up to the present time the American Federal policy wit 
regard to questions of direct, or even indirect, education: 
consequence has been of a distinctly fortuitous characte 
While the trend is continually toward a more constructive an 
systematic national attitude, the existing situation point 
conclusively to the tasks yet undone. We reproduce in th 
chapter two selections which serve to indicate both the tenc 
encies and the difficulties. The first selection states we 
the larger aspects of our national educational problem. 
I. Epucation AND THE NATION 
[Pritcuert, Henry S., in the 6th An. Rept. of the Carneg 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 1911, pp. 45-49.] 
The United States has grown, in the course of a century and| 
quarter, from a group of associated states into a nation. T 
difficulties in the way of this result were enormous. ‘The origi 
thirteen colonies were jealous of one another. They were afr: 
to intrust power to a central governmental agency. The weldi 
of these jealous and suspicious states into a nation could be acco! 
plished only by time and the experience that time brings with it. 
It was natural that at the inauguration of the confederation t| 
framers of the constitution should have been careful to create 
few central agencies with strong powers as possible. Even wh 
powers were given to the general government, checks and limi 
tions were imposed upon them at every step. 
Education as a national unifying agency did not lie within 
field of view of the framers of the American constitution. Neit' 
national supervision of education nor a national system of scho| 
was considered. 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-149

NATIONALIZING AMERICAN EDUCATION 127 
The idea of a university at the seat of government was indeed 
1 the minds of several of the earlier leaders of the nation. Wash- 
gton in particular was attracted by the idea of a university at 
Vashington which might bring together the youth of the various 
‘ates. He was led to entertain this idea by his keen realization 
f the intense rivalries generated by the jealousies and suspicions 
f the various states. He feared that these sectional forces would 
isrupt the newly formed confederation, and he hoped that a uni- 
ersity in which the youth of the country might come together in 
‘udent relations would help the people of the different states to 
1e realization of nationalism rather than sectionalism. 
Since the field of education was not touched by the constitution, 
remained with each state to deal with its educational system as 
might choose, with no guidance from the central government 
oking toward unifying and coérdinating the separate state systems. | 
Vhen, therefore, one undertakes to study education and the prog- 
23s of education in the United States from a national standpoint, 
ne must take up such a study with the state systems as units. 
Jot only has each state its own system of public schools, but nearly 
ll of the states have tax-supported institutions of higher learning 
s well. Other agencies which have entered the field of education, 
otably the religious denominations, have also grouped their sys- 
ms of higher institutions in accordance with state lines. Many 
the larger religious bodies have in most states one or more col- 
ges or universities. In some states a single denomination has 
half-dozen or more institutions bearing the name of college or 
iversity. 
Furthermore, in the development of our educational system, 
‘ivate initiative in the field of education has been both unguided 
d unrestrained by supervision on the part of the state govern- 
ents. In all but a few states of the Union any association of 
len who, for educational or business reasons or as a matter “| 
      
      
      
   
    
        
   
      ical pride, desire to start a school or a college, may incorporate 
der the state law and obtain the right to grant all the degrees 
at higher institutions may confer. 
This lack of supervision both on the part of the general govern- 
nt and, to a large extent, on the part of the state governments, 
s resulted not only in an extraordinarily large number of insti- 
tions bearing the name college or university, but it has resulted 
o in the fact that these institutions have become involved in 
al rivalries, so that they represent in very small measure national 
als or national purposes. One of the most difficult things for 
European student of education visiting the United States to 
derstand is the absence of any national feeling with regard to 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  128 AMERICAN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY 
education, and the absence as well of loyalty on the part of thos 
in the colleges and the universities to higher education in itsel 
Instead of this relationship toward national ideals in education 
one finds loyalty toward a particular institution. Higher educe 
tion in America is intensely local and personal in its sympathie: 
College loyalty takes the place of devotion to educational ideals 
the former is local, the latter national. 
The general government, while exercising no control over th 
state systems of education, has by legislation and the appropriatio 
of money carried out two measures that concern the education: 
policy of the several states. Through the Morrill Bill and th 
measures that followed it, Congress has made large appropriatior 
for the support of agricultural and mechanical colleges in all state: 
The federal government, however, has left the administration « 
these appropriations to the states themselves, and has preserve 
over the expenditure of this money a scrutiny so vague as to affec 
in but small measure the direction that the institutions thus iz 
augurated have taken. 
A second act on the part of the central government lookin 
toward the preservation of some form of educational efficienc 
and unity was the creation of a bureau of education under a com 
missioner of education. This office was established in 1867, an 
while the powers of the commissioner have been somewhat increase 
in recent years by appropriations for specific purposes, the duti« 
of the bureau are still practically limited to the work of a statistic: 
agency dealing with existing educational institutions to the exter 
to which the latter are willing to coéperate, and to the publicati 
of reports showing the progress of education in this country a 
in others. 
Both of these measures, while tending in some degree to initia‘ 
action over broader areas, have nevertheless been inaugurated wit 
out any well thought out policy regarding education. In fa 
the government of the United States, like most federal govel 
ments, has had no policy with regard to education. The Morr 
Bill was largely an accidental measure, due to personal initiati 
and enacted without any thinking of a careful sort as to the effe 
that the educational agency thus created would have. 
The contrast between the crude methods with which our sta} 
governments deal with education and the careful and well-consi 
ered methods under which the Prussian government, for examp! 
proceeds in such matters is strikingly brought out in the ste 
recently taken looking toward the inauguration of an endow 
university at the city of Frankfurt. For a long time Frankf 
has been ambitious to possess a university, and has been qu
-P-A-G-E-151
NATIONALIZING AMERICAN EDUCATION 129 
  eady to establish and support such an institution, even without 
overnmental aid. The matter has been under consideration 
or years. Those who represented the interests of education in 
he Prussian government have conducted the discussion with an 
ye not only to the local interests of the city of Frankfurt, but 
vith a regard for the nearby universities already in existence and 
or the independent scientific and literary institutes already es- 
ablished. As a result, the university, if it be established, will 
odrdinate and render more effective all existing agencies. It 
vill not add a new competing institution. The whole proceeding 
s full of suggestion to Americans interested in education and in 
he function of educational institutions in human progress. In 
e process of founding the new university all interests have had 
mm opportunity to be heard. The whole question as to what func- 
ion the university is to serve, how it should be established and 
onducted, what relations it should have to other schools and in- 
itutions, is being worked out under the eyes of the entire city, 
gion, and kingdom in a manner and with a care and foresight 
nknown to us. In our cities a new university is founded by a 
ngle man or a group of men, and the idea of calling the community 
the state into council over the matter has rarely occurred to 
y one. The spectacle is most suggestive to us as citizens of a 
lemocracy, not merely because it is an example of educational 
uilding carried on in a thoughtful instead of a haphazard way, 
t for the stronger reason that it is an example of the working 
a modern government in the effort to conserve both the interest 
the individual and the interest of the organized community. 
ll modern government, practically all modern legislation, is an 
fort to deal with these sometimes divergent interests. How to 
eserve the freedom of the individual and at the same time to 
‘omote the efficiency of the organizations which do the work of 
odern civilized states is the essential problem which every gov- 
nment, whatever its form, faces. This is the question to-day 
America at the heart of all legislation by Congress, whether it 
sals with trusts, or labor organizations, or railroads, or customs 
ties, or any other similar problem. The real problem before 
e legislature and the people is not how to destroy corporations, 
labor organizations, or railroads, or other agencies, but how to 
velop them and still preserve the interest and the freedom of 
e individual. And the significant thing to us as a nation in the 
‘ocess of founding the proposed Frankfurt university is the fact 
at here an effort is being made to deal thoughtfully and seriously 
th a problem that in our American democracy we leave to be 
tled absolutely at haphazard, without supervision on the part

of those who are capable of judging, and without real participation 
on the part of the great body of people whose interests are affected 
The United States has not yet learned to use the expert intelli 
gently, or to distinguish between the expert and the pretende: 
expert. Compare with this method of founding a new universit. 
the action of our Congress, which pours annually into the treasurie| 
of the various states a total of $2,400,000 for educational purposes 
without knowing what is really done with the money. 
The result of this lack of foresight on the part of the federa 
government and of the extremely limited scrutiny exercised b 
the states themselves over the institutions of higher learning hai 
been the establishment in the United States of an enormous num 
ber of institutions calling themselves colleges and universities, + 
a number far in excess of those existing in any other country, an 
undoubtedly greater than the country needs er can support. 
The number of these institutions is not so remarkable, however 
as the great variety of the work that they undertake, the varie 
standards that they set up, and their lack of relationship to th 
general system of schools of their respective states. The college 
and universities of the country are yet often indifferent and some 
times even hostile to the systems of public schools upon which th 
college and the university ought to rest. Too few of those wh 
start a new college and those who conduct colleges that are alread} 
established admit that they owe any duty to the general scho 
system. This is, on the whole, the most astounding fact in o 
higher education. The spectacle of colleges and universiti 
founded and conducted without reference to the general schoi 
system is truly unique. It goes without saying that under su 
circumstances the colleges and the universities contribute far le: 
than they should to a unifying national force in education. 
Notwithstanding this lack of educational unity among t 
institutions of higher learning, the separate state systems ha 
been kept in practical touch by their public schools. The comm 
schools of the separate states, while showing great variations 
their equipment, in the training of their teachers, and in the exte 
to which their studies are carried, are nevertheless founded up 
practically the same plan. They begin with the child at about t 
same age, and either lead him or seek to lead him to about t 
same intellectual development. As a result, the common scho 
have been the great unifying force in citizenship in this countr} 
They have made the English language the sole medium of commu 
cation. In the public schools the enormous armies of immigrai 
have received their induction into citizenship, and through t 
unifying force of the public school system the educational uni       
    
    
        
         
     
   
-P-A-G-E-153

of the country has been preserved. This has been rendered easier 
oy the interchange of teachers and students that has gone on be- 
‘ween the separate states. As we look over the educational his- 
cory of the last half century, it seems clear that the educational and 
political solidarity of the country and the possession of common 
national ideals has been due in very large measure to the fact that 
4 common system of elementary and secondary schools has spread 
throughout all the states. 
The last ten years have been remarkable not only in the material 
zains ‘of the institutions of higher learning and the increase in the 
number of their students, but also in the progress that has been 
made, particularly in the last half of that decade, in relating the 
stitutions of higher learning to the general system of schools. 
This movement going on to-day with increased energy will in the 
long run transform our detached schools and colleges into a true 
educational system, in which the institutions of higher learning 
shall have fruitful relations not only with one another, but with 
the elementary and secondary schools as well. In attempting to 
review briefly what has been accomplished during the last decade, 
f one is to regard it from a national standpoint at all, it is necessary, 
therefore, to consider the steps taken in the direction of relating 
igher education to the public system of schools. The day has 
zone by when isolated educational institutions can serve either 
locality or the state efficiently. Whether one considers the 
local community, the state, or the nation, all educational progress 
lor the future lies in such coérdination of the higher institutions 
f learning with the common school system as will conduce to the 
est education of the individual. Out of this coédrdination will 
lome not only increased efficiency, but also greater freedom, alike 
r the secondary school, the college, and the university.

In Chapter II were presented some of the more important 
rtions of the record of the part played by the Federal govern- 
ent, through grants of both land and money, for the upbuilding 
the public school systems of the several states; and also 
the various efforts made from time to time, to secure further 
tional aid for these school systems. The Hoar Bill and the 
air Bill are representative of the earlier efforts, during the 
riod, immediately following the Civil War. The so-called 
vis Bill of 1907, and the Page Bill of 1912 illustrate the con-

temporaneous efforts to tap the springs of national resource: 
for the betterment of educational opportunity for the Americar 
people. The Agricultural-Extension measure passed in 191¢ 
(Smith-Lever Bill!) was a logical application of the principl 
incorporated in the several Morrill Acts. 
As a culmination of a decade of efforts toward national aid 
Congress in 1913 created a commission to consider the need anc 
to report a plan for national aid to vocational education. 
Upon the recommendation of the commission a comprehensiv 
scheme for such aid was proposed in the following bill 8 
To provide for the promotion of vocational education; to providi 
for codperation with the States in ‘the promotion of such education 
in agriculture and the trades and industries ; to provide for coéperation 
with the States in the preparation of teachers of vocational subjects 
and to appropriate money and regulate its expenditure. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of th 
United States of America in Congress assembled, That there is hereb) 
annually appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not other 
wise appropriated, the sums provided in sections two, three, anc 
four of this Act, to be paid to the-respective States for the purpos 
of codperating with the States in paying the salaries of teachers 
supervisors, and directors of agricultural subjects, and of teacher 
of trade and industrial subjects, and in the preparation of teache

and the sum provided for in section seven to the Federal Board fi

CHAPTER V 
THE STATE THE UNIT IN EDUCATION 
As was indicated in Chapter I, education in America was left 
o the states, and the state has become the unit of administra- 
ion. The development of state oversight and control has come 
radually, and may be traced in the state constitutions, the laws, 
nd. the decisions of the courts.

The development of state oversight and control could be

tes.2 The following description for New York State is illus- 
tive of the development.

he early history of education in New York gives little promise 
the high degree of central control which has come to be estab- 
Extracts taken from Poors, B. F., Federal and State Constitutions, and 
'r official documents issued by the states. 
In the historical portion of the different articles on the state school systems 
onroe’s Cyclopedia of Education the development of centralized control has

  144 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
lished during the present eet Throughout the colonial perio: 
the only action by the Province legislature concerned the estab 
lishment of academies, and whatever was done in the way of com 
mon school education was through private or local action! Th 
relations of the State government to this latter problem begin wit! 
the law of 1795,? appropriating £20,000 annually for the encourage’ 
ment of schools. This amount the legislature apportioned amon; 
the different counties ; the apportionment to the various towns wa 
entrusted to the supervisors in each county, and the local manage 
ment was entirely in the hands of elected town commissioners an 
school district trustees. The trustees were required to mak 
reports to the town commissioners as the basis for the distric) 
apportionment of the State appropriation ; and reports of the num; 
ber of schools, scholars and days of instruction were to be for 
warded through the town commissioners and county treasurer: 
to the Secretary’s office at Albany. There is, however, no pro 
vision for either State or county control or supervision in the systen! 
of school administration thus set up; and although the Stat 
appropriation was continued annually for ten years, there was n 
action taken towards inspection or control of the schools aided fro: 
the State funds. 
In 1805 the school appropriation was allowed to lapse, and al 
though the accumulation of a Common School Fund was at th 
same time provided for, there was to be no distribution until t 
annual interest of this fund amounted to $50,000. It was ni 
until 1814 that this situation was reached, and during this interv. 
common school education became again entirely a subject for loc: 
action or inaction as the case might be. With the renewal of Sta 
aid for schools from the interest of the Common School Fun 
Acts were passed for the organization of the school system throug 
out the State.? The Massachusetts “district system” was ma 
the basis, probably because existing local schools were establish 
on that plan. Each district meeting of freeholders and taxpaye 
was authorized to locate its school, levy local taxes, and elect 
board of trustees, who employed the teachers and directed t! 
management of the schools. There were also to be school co: 
missioners in each town, to whom the trustees were to make repor 
and town inspectors to examine candidates for positions as teache       
     
    
   
         
         
     
    1 As early as 1691 a bill was proposed in the New York Assembly “to appoi 
a school-master for the educating and instructing of children and youth, to r 
and write English in every Town in the Province.’ No action was taken 
this bill. — Journal of New York Assembly, 1691-1743, p. 7.

THE STATE THE UNIT IN EDUCATION 145 
The grants from the State were made conditional on the raising 
of an equal amount by local taxation, and the first step was taken 
n the direction of central supervision by providing for a Superin- 
endent of Common Schools, selected by the Council of Appoint- 
nent, at an annual salary of $400. The chief duties of this officer 
were in the management of the Common School Fund, his powers 
yf control over the schools and local officers being but slight. He 
was, however, to prepare plans for the better organization of the 
schools, to apportion the State appropriation among the counties 
wccording to their population, and the reports of the school trustees 
0 the town commissioners were to be forwarded to him. 
In the introduction and organization of the new school system, 
the first Superintendent, Gideon Hawley, did not limit himself 
0 the duties specified in the statute. By his activity he demon- 
strated the possibilities of his position, and the successful establish- 
nent within eight years of 5,500 schools with an enrollment of over 
300,000 pupils has been ascribed in very large degree to his work. 
‘he uncalled for removal of Superintendent Hawley, in 1821, 
aused the legislature, as a means of censuring this action of the 
Souncil of Appointment, to transfer the duties of Superintendent 
f Schools to the Secretary of State. This change was in effect 
reduction of the central control over the educational system, 
r although that officer could perform the specific duties laid down 
the law, his other functions made impossible the same active 
ork outside the letter of the statute as could be done by a separate 
ficial. 
The first step in the direction of an increase in the central control 
as in 1822,! when the acting Superintendent of Schools was given 
appellate and final jurisdiction over all acts and decisions of 
cal school officials. The power thus conferred on the State 
perintendent has been of the greatest importance ; it in effect con- 
ituted him an administrative court, and his decisions on the 
ousands of cases that have been presented form a body of ad- 
inistrative law controlling the powers and duties of all local 
lhool officials. The scope and significance of this authority will 
considered in detail later; it is only necessary here to note its 
neral character and its place in the historical development of 
intral control. 
'The need for a more effective supervision of the schools and local 
ool authorities soon began to be felt. Governor De Witt Clinton, 
his message to the Legislature in 1826, pointed out that the Super- 
endent of Schools was prevented by his other official duties 
Secretary of State from visiting the schools in person, while in 
1 Laws of 1822, c. 245.

fact he had no legal authority to make such visits. The Governc 
held that “a visitorial authority for the purpose of detecting abuse 
in the application of the funds, of examining into the modes an 
plans of instruction, and of suggesting improvements would ur 
questionably be attended with the most propitious effects.” 
These opinions were endorsed by the Literature Committee of th 
State Senate, whose chairman urged that “the State, which con 
tributes so large a proportion of the compensation of the teacher: 
has a right to direct its application in such a way as to effect th 
object of procuring useful instruction.” ? Similar recommendation 
were made in the following year by the Secretary of State in hi 
capacity as Superintendent of Schools. But no action was take 
by the legislature; and the local authorities continued for fiftee 
years more to direct the management of the schools free from an 
effective inspection and supervision. 
In 1839, John C. Spencer, Chairman of the carat Literatur 
Committee of 1826, became Secretary of State, and ez-offici 
Superintendent of Common Schools. With the earlier proposal 
still in mind, he secured from the legislature the authority t 
appoint unsalaried county boards of visitors to visit the schoo 
and report with suggestions for improvement.’ The reports 
these boards of visitors recommended the establishment of al 
efficient and systematic county supervision under the gener: 
direction of the State bureau, as a substitute for the existing i 
efficient method of town inspection. These reports and the great 
official influence now held by Mr. Spencer secured the enactmen| 
in 1841, of the scheme proposed by him fifteen years before. 
The Act of 18414 provided for the appointment by the Secreta: 
of State of a Deputy Superintendent of Schools, thus maki 
possible a greater central activity in carrying out the powe| 
conferred by previous statutes. For the visitation and inspection 
the schools, there was to be a Superintendent in each county, w! 
should recommend to school trustees and teachers the pro 
studies, books, discipline and conduct of the schools ; examine a 
grant certificates of qualification to teachers; and also decide 
the first instance on appeals subject to the jurisdiction of t 
State Superintendent. These county superintendents, althou! 
appointed by the supervisors in each county, were to act subj 
to the rules and,regulations of the Superintendent of Schools, a 
half of their salaries was paid by the State. With the Dep 
Superintendent at Albany and this corps of county officials, a mi

ore thorough system of school supervision and a much more 
fective central control was made possible. 
The new system of inspection brought about great improvements 
1 school administration, and its benefits were so clear that Super- 
1tendent of Schools Young, who when he succeeded Mr. Spencer 
s Secretary of State was a violent opponent of the change, soon 
ecame its enthusjastic supporter.’ Legislative committees and 
rominent educators also strongly approved of the plan and methods 
dopted. Nevertheless, there arose a strong demand for the 
bolition of this system of supervision.* Local trustees and town 
ommissioners were not pleased to find their former independence 
1terfered with, while injudicious political selections by super- 
isors in some counties resulted in the appointment of some in- 
apable and oppressive officials. For these and other reasons 
ne clamor against the Act continued, the pressure on the legis- 
‘ture finally became too strong, and in 1847 the county superin- 
ndent system was abolished.t On the face of it, the result was 
» place the town and district officers in direct connection with 
ne State Department; but in fact, as the State Superintendents 
scognized, any effective. supervision of the local officers without 
corps of officers acting under the direction of the State bureau 
as impossible, and the result was plainly a long step in the direction 
decentralization. 
The reaction was only temporary. Other forces were at work, 
d soon new measures were taken which so increased the amount 
State aid to the common schools that a return to the policy of 
ther State intervention in the management of the schools 
s inevitable. Already in 1838 the interest of the United States 
posit Fund had been appropriated to the schools,> increasing 
annual State appropriation from $110,000 to $275,000. Just 
the time the office of county superintendent was abolished the 
tation for free schools was beginning; in 1849 the Free School 
it was adopted by a referendum vote;* and, although the 
ctical realization of free schools did not come until much later, 
important step in that direction was taken in 1851, when a 
te tax of $800,000 was imposed by the legislature for the sup- 
of the common schools, in addition to the income of the Com- 
School and United States Deposit Funds. 
‘he increase of State aid was not for the purpese of increasing 
e control, for the new appropriation was turned over to the 
commissioners and district trustees, to be expended at their

discretion in the same way as the earlier grants. Neverthele: 
the increased State appropriation paved the way for a larger d 
gree of inspection and supervision of the schools, and in fact ma 
a more thorough control almost essential. 
An important step in this direction was the organization, 
1854, of a separate Department of Public Instruction. The ge 
eral oversight of the schools had hitherto been entrusted to | 
official burdened with many other duties, and although since 18 
there had been a special Deputy Superintendent of Public Instru 
tion, his duties were those of a subordinate, and the Secretary 
State remained as the head of the school system. An independe 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, freed from all other functior 
could necessarily exercise a greater activity beyond the sphere 
statutory duties. In addition to the former powers of the Secr 
tary of State, the Superintendent of Public Instruction was giv 
authority to visit the schools and make inquiries into the cout 
of instruction, management and discipline. Even although 
could not personally visit any large number of schools, the gra 
of this power is significant of the tendency towards a larger contt 
over the local school officers. 
In 1856 the State school tax was changed from a tax for a fix 
sum to a $ mill tax,’ which at the existing valuation gave an imme 
ate increase of $300,000 in the State grants for schools. At t 
same time came the re-establishment of an effective system 
supervision, which had been urged constantly by the State Sup: 
intendents since the repeal of the county superintendent syst 
in 1847. The new system differed in some respects from t 
established in 1841. There was to be a school commissioner 
each Assembly District, instead of a Superintendent for e 
county, and the commissioners were to be elected instead of 
pointed by the board of supervisors. Although chosen by | 
election, the district commissioners being subject to the rm 
and regulations of the State Superintendent, and receiving tl 
salary from State funds on his order, were under the directio’ 
that officer, and the introduction of the system marks an im 
tant step in the extension of state control. The powers and du 
of the district commissioners included the examination of the 
agement, instruction and discipline of the schools, and the co 
tion of school buildings and grounds; the recommendatio: 
improvements in all these lines; the examination, licensing 
annulling licenses of teachers, and the organization of teac! 
institutes. The authority of the district commissioners did 
however, include the city schools.

  THE STATE THE UNIT IN EDUCATION 149 
The re-introduction of the system of supervision evoked at 
st considerable complaint,! but the State Superintendents were 
tisfied that it produced good results, and it has continued as a 
rmanent part of the New York school system. Acting State 
iperintendent Keyes, in his report for 1862, summarizes the 
nefits derived from the system in these words: “An officer of 
tended jurisdiction has a higher and wider range of influence, 
more generally consulted upon questions of school policy and 
matters of school controversy, and his opinions and advice have 
consequence and weight that cannot attach to a local officer of 
nited jurisdiction.” ? 
After the establishment of the commissioner system of super- 
sion, the next few years showed no new developments in the 
ew York school system. But in the middle of the decade, 1860-— 
70, came a new period of activity, in which the scope of both 
cal and central governmental action along educational lines was 
uch increased. The general revision of the School Law in 1864 % 
ntains some additions to the powers of the State Superintendent 
er the schools, authorizing him to appoint unsalaried school 
sitors in the counties, and to remove school commissioners or 
her school officers for wilful violation or neglect of duty. The 
wers of the district commissioners were also increased by giv- 
them authority to condemn unfit school buildings, and to direct 
stees to make necessary repairs, in addition to their former 
wers of recommendation. The most important advance at this 
was in the introduction of central control in the management 
teachers’ institutes. The Act of 1856 had authorized the dis- 
ict commissioners to organize such institutes in the various 
mties ; and in 1861 they were held in 47 counties, with an atten- 
ce of 7,488 teachers. Under the law of 1864, the organization 
such an institute in every county was required, a State appro- 
lation was set aside for their support, and they were placed more 
lectly under the jurisdiction of the State Superintendent by 
uiring the district commissioners to act in arranging these 
tings under his advice and direction, and further by authorizing 
to employ persons to conduct and teach at the institutes. 
se gatherings of the teachers for even a single week in each 
r gave opportunity for helpful comparisons of methods, and 
eased the interest and enthusiasm of those attending for their 
k. The extension of the State Superintendent’s authority 
r this field was, therefore, an important advance in his control 
he educational system, and enabled him to influence more di- 
ly than before the instruction given in the district schools.

  150 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
  /* In addition to the institutes intended for those actually engag 
in teaching, a system of normal schools for training a body 
teachers was also developed. The State Normal School at Albar 
was established in 1844;! in 1866 the more important State office 
were constituted a Commission to determine the location of oth 
schools,” and within four years eight additional normal schoc 
had been established in different parts of the State. The admini 
tration of this normal school system was entirely centralized und 
the control of the State Superintendent. For each school the 
was provided a local board to direct and supervise the instructio 
but these boards were appointed by the State Superintendent, ar 
all their more important acts were subject to his approval. 
y Along with these developments of central control over scho 
administration there went a rapid increase in the amount of Sta 
aid. In 1863, the State School Tax amounted to a little ov 
$1,000,000; in 1868, it was $2,400,000. At the $ame time can 
the final step in the complete realization of the Free School A 
of 1849; in 1867 an Act was passed by the Legislature abolishit 
all rate bills in the public schools, making them free to evel 
scholar. The increased State activity in educational affairs was a 
companied by a no less increase in local educational activity 
the same period. This is shown clearly by the enormous increa 
of yearly local taxation for school purposes from $2,500,000 
1863 to $7,000,000 in 1869; and it is worthy of note that t 
development is equally striking in both city and rural taxation. 
The unusual progress shown during these few years both 
administrative centralization and in the extension of school faci 
ties and equipment was followed by a long period in which lit 
further advance was made. For nearly twenty years there 
no extension of the powers of the State authorities, and duri 
these years the increase in both State and local expenditure 
schools wasat a rate which barely kept pace with the growth of po 
lation. In the last twelve years, however, there have been furt 
rapid advances along both lines. From 1885 to 1896 the ann’ 
State school tax increased from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000; the t 
annual expenditure for school purposes rose from less than $12, 
000 to $25,000,000; and at the same time there has been a con: 
erable development of central control over the school system. 
Thus, in 1887, a uniform system of teachers’ examinations un} 
the direction of the State Department was substituted for 
former method of independent commissioner examinations. 
1889, the supervision of teachers’ training classes in high sch 
and academies was transferred from the Regents of the S 
1 Laws of 1844, c. 311. + Tbid., 1866, c. 466.

niversity to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The 
ompulsory Education Law of 1894 provided for a small force of 
spectors attached to the State department to investigate the 
forcement of the Law. These and other minor additions to 
1e authority of the State Superintendent in the aggregate materi- 
ly strengthen the central control over the school system. 
To review this brief sketch: — we note that the development 
ward central control in the first half of the century was not 
ithout reactionary steps. The office of State Superintendent 
‘Schools, created in 1812, was abolished in 1821, and the powers 
that officer conferred on another official busied with other and 
arelated duties. The county superintendent system of super- 
sion, established in 1841, was abandoned after six years’ experi- 
ice. Nevertheless, even in this period, there were permanent 
easures in the direction of increasing the central authority, promi- 
nt among these being the appellate jurisdiction of the State 
iperintendent, conferred in 1822, and the provision for a Deputy 
iperintendent in 1841. Since the creation of a separate Depart- 
ent of Public Instruction in 1854, the movement has been uni- 
rmly but not always steadily in the direction of strengthening 
je authority of that department. The system of district com- 
sioners, established in 1856, made possible a closer supervision 
the local schools; in the legislation of 1864-1867 the State 
perintendent’s control was increased through the supervision 
training teachers, and in other details; during the last ten years 
entire system of examining teachers has been placed under 
immediate direction, and the supervision of school attendance 
other details of school management have come to a greater 
less degree under his general oversight. The present stage of 
tral control has been reached not by any sudden change of 
icy, but through a series of measures extending over a period of 
undred years. 
‘his development of central control has moreover been closely 
nected with the increase of State grants. For although State 
does not seem to have been given for the purpose of establish- 
control, the State appropriations have rendered necessary 
e supervision, and, as these State grants have increased, the 
rol over the local authorities has been made more complete 
more effective.

152 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
In 1894 a new state constitution was adopted. This made t 
first definite constitutional provision for a state school systen 
made the Regents a constitutional body ; safeguarded the differe 
funds; and prohibited aid to denominational schools. In tl 
same year the “ Consolidated School Act,” the first consolidation ar 
revision of the school laws since 1864, became a law. A new rex 
sion of the compulsory education act, which changed this into < 
effective law, and the creation of a Board of Examiners and tl 
placing of full control of all teachers’ examinations in the han 
of the State Superintendent, were also enacted in 1894. In 18% 
alaw was passed requiring that all teachers employed in elementa: 
schools, after 1897, must have taught three years, or be graduat 
of a three years’ course in a high school or academy and have hz 
a course of thirty-eight weeks in a teachers’ training class. Teac 
ers in city schools must have had a two years’ training cours 
The Biennial School Census Act and the Horton Act were al 
passed in 1895. Under the Horton Act, the Regents were giv 
an automatically increasing appropriation to enable them to a 
properly the academies and high schools of the state. The resu 
of this law was a marked increase in both the number of such schoo 
and in the annual appropriations for them. In 1896 school distric 
were permitted to contract with other districts for the educatic 
of their children; city institutes and state summer institutes we 
established.

   The year 1904 saw the final unification of the two educatio 
departments of the state school system, and the ending of more th; 
a quarter century of friction. . . . The Unification Act of 19 
providing for a reduced Board of Regents, for membership 
limited terms instead of for life, and for essentially the present fo: 
of state educational organization, took effect April 1, 1904, 
since then the Regents and Commissioner have construed 
law liberally, and in the interests of the schools of the state. 
state educational building, to house the departments, the st 
library, and the state museum, was provided for in 1906; tr. 
schools were authorized, and the new school census law was pas 
in 1908; and the compulsory education law, as it related to ci 
and school systems having a superintendent, was further revi 
and strengthened in 1909. In 1909 the consolidated school ] 
as codified and consolidated by the State Board of Statutory 
solidation, was passed, and the further revision, recodificat 
and elimination of this, as made by the Education Departm 
was accepted by the legislature in 1910, In this the workin;

igements of the Regents and Commissioner, as practiced since

ce was the substitution in 1910 of appointed district superinten- 
ats of schools (beginning January 1, 1912) for the old popularly- 
ected school commissioners, in existence since 1856. About twice 
many district superintendents as school commissioners were pro- 
led for, so as to reduce the size of the supervisory unit one half. 
[. Tae JURISDICTION oF THE Stare: JupictaL INTER- 
PRETATIONS 
The theory upon which the public school system of the 
nerican states has been built up contains two constituent 
ments; that of preserving an approximate equality of chance 
ong individuals to secure the advantages and _ benefits 
ated through the institutions comprising the school system ; 
d that of distributing the burden of support of public edu- 
tion on the foundation of property rather than upon persons. 
e trend in the evolution of our state educational systems 
ords abundant evidence of the firm establishment of this social 
ory of education, a theory which in operation has resulted not 
ly in a continual enlargement of the sphere of the state in edu- 
ion, but also in the development of a positive policy of state 
fication and authority. While the states have developed 
jant attitudes, the typical American policy is exhibited 
ough the judicial interpretations brought together in this 
ion.

his case involved the constitutionality of the act of March 2, 
, constituting the State Board of Education commissioners 
elect textbooks equal to a given standard, and requiring 
to advertise for bids for furnishing the same, and to award 
contract to the lowest bidder, the books to be sold to the 
s by the contractor, through the county superintendents 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  154 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
and township trustees. The act made it the duty of scho 
trustees to notify the county superintendents of the number 
textbooks required for the pupils in their corporations; wher 
upon the superintendents were to make requisitions for tl 
books upon the contractor, and on their receipt were to tal 
charge of and furnish them to the pupils at the price fixed in tl 
contract. In holding that the trustees would be compelled | 
mandamus to obtain and distribute the books in the mann 
provided — it being the intent of the legislature to make tl 
books and the prices therefor uniform — the Court said: 
Essentially and intrinsically, the schools in which are educat 
and trained the children who are to become the rulers of the cor 
monwealth are matters of state, and not of local, jurisdiction. 
such matters the state is a unit, and the legislature the source 
power. The authority over schools and school affairs is not nece 
sarily a distributive one, to be exercised by local instrumentalitie 
but, on the contrary, it is a central power, residing in the legisl 
ture of the state. It is for the law-making power to determi 
whether the authority shall be exercised by a state board of ed 
cation, or distributed to county, township, or city organizatio 
throughout the state. With that determination the judicia 
can no more rightfully interfere than can the legislature with 
decree or judgment pronounced by a judicial tribunal. The de 
sion is as conclusive and inviolable in the one case as in the oth 
and an interference with the legislative judgment would be a bre 
of the constitution which no principle would justify, nor any p 
cedent excuse. 
But we need not rest our conclusion that the control of sch 
and school affairs is vested in the law-making power of the st 
upon the proposition that schools are intrinsically matters of s 
concern, and not of a local nature, — although it may there 
securely rested; for our constitution, in language that can 
be mistaken, declares that it is a matter of the state, and no 
the locality. The language of the constitution is this: “Kn 
edge and learning, generally diffused throughout a commu 
being essential to the preservation of a free government, it s 
be the duty of the general assembly to encourage, by all suit: 
means, moral, intellectual, scientific, and agricultural impr 
ment, and to provide by law for a general and uniform syste 
common schools, wherein tuition shall be without charge, 
equally open to all.” Article 8, Sec. 1. The constitution

ins a duty, and confers a power. The duty and the power are 
-extensive, but the effect they are designed to accomplish is 
ified, because the duty is to “provide a uniform system of com- 
on schools ;” and the power is granted to enable the general 
sembly to effectively perform the duty. Both by the consti- 
tion, and by the intrinsic nature of the duty and the power, the 
thority is exclusively legislative, and the matter over which it 
to be exercised solely of state concern. That this conclusion 
sound, is so clear that authorities are not required to fortify or 
pport it; but authorities are not wanting, for the current of 
dicial decision is unbroken. 
* * * * * * * 
As the power over schools is a legislative one, it is not exhausted 
, exercise. The legislature, having tried one plan, is not pre- 
ided from trying another. It has a choice of methods, and 
ay change its plans as often as it deems necessary or expedient ; 
id for mistakes or abuses it is answerable to the people, but 
t to the courts. It is clear, therefore, that, even if it were true 
t the legislature had uniformly intrusted the management of 
ool affairs to local organization, it would not authorize the con- 
sion that it might not change the system. To deny the power 
change, is to affirm that progress is impossible, and that we must 
ve forever “in the dim footsteps of antiquity.” But the legis- 
ive power moves in a constant stream, and is not exhausted by 
exercise in any number of instances, however great. It is not 
le, however, that the authority over schools was originally 
larded as a local one. On the contrary, the earlier cases asserted 
tt the legislature could not delegate the power to levy taxes for 
ol purposes to local organizations, but must itself directly exer- 
the power; thus denying, in the strongest possible form, the 
ry of local control. This ruling was for many years regarded 
he law of the state; but in the case of Robinson v. Schenck, 
Ind. 307, 1 N. E. Rep. 698, it was held that the legislature 
t either exercise the power itself, or delegate it to local govern- 
tal instrumentalities. It has, indeed, been the uniform course, 
the organization of the state, to regulate and control school 
irs by legislation. All the public schools have been established 
r legislative enactments, and all rules and regulations have 
made pursuant to statutory authority. Every school that 
been established owes its existence to legislation, and every 
1 officer owes his authority to the statute. 
is impossible to conceive of the existence of a uniform system 
mmon schools without power lodged somewhere to make it

uniform; and, even in the absence of express constitutional pr 
visions, that power must necessarily reside in the legislature. 
it does reside there, then that body must have, as an incident | 
the principal power, the authority to prescribe the course of stud 
and the system of instruction, that shall be pursued and adopte 
as well as the books which shall be used. This general doctrit 
is well entrenched by authority. ... Having this authorit 
the legislature may not only prescribe regulations for using su 
books, but it may also declare how the books shall be obtain: 
and distributed. If it may do this, then it may provide that th 
shall be obtained through the medium of a contract awarded © 
the best or lowest bidder, since, if it be true, as it unquestionab 
is, that the power is legislative, it must also be true that the legi 
lature has an unrestricted discretion, and an unfettered choi 
of methods. It cannot be possible that the courts can interfe 
with this legislative power, and adjudge that the legislature shé 
not adopt this method or that method; for, if the question is | 
all legislative, it is so in its whole length and breadth. Under o1 
form of government, there is no such thing as a power partly jud 
cial and partly legislative. The one power excludes the othe 
for each is distinct and independent.... If the legislatu 
exercises its right to make a choice of methods by enacting th! 
the books for the schools shall be furnished by the person maki 
the most acceptable bid, the courts cannot interfere, because t! 
power exercised is a purely legislative one, and within the leg} 
lative domain courts are forbidden to enter. There is no ese: 
from this conclusion save by a denial of legislative independenj 
and an assertion of the rights of judicial surveillance and control 
If the power over the school system is legislative and exclusi 
then the legislature has authority to impose upon all officers wh 
tenure is legislative such duties respecting school affairs as it de 
proper.

Cuester, J. The plaintiffs move for an injunction pendente

ublic instruction, and the board of education of the city of Water- 
liet, from enforcing or executing an order made by such superin- 
ndent directing the opening of the public schools in the city of 
Jatervliet, and appointing a superintendent, and the necessary 
ree of teachers, janitors, and other employees, and from paying 
.eir salaries, and also enjoining the persons so appointed from 
ssuming such positions, and from discharging the duties thereof. 
he board of education of Watervliet is, under the law, a bi-par- 
san board. It is composed of four persons, each of the two 
rincipal political parties having two members. The mayor is 
< officio presiding officer, but is not a member of the board and has 
> vote. Laws 1896, ec. 905, tit. 5, secs. 1-6. The teachers and 
ther employees of the board for the last year were engaged only 
r that school year. The new school year commenced in Septem- 
er last. The members of the board have been unable to agree 
pon the officers and teachers to be employed in the schools for the 
asuing school year. Repeated meetings of the board were held 
ring the months of August and September, and no agreement was 
ached. Every resolution offered in the board by either side nam- 
teachers and other employees was defeated by a tie vote. The 
ard, during all that time, and down to the making of this motion, 
s been in a “deadlock” on this question. The 7th of September 
d been fixed upon by the board as the date when the schools 
uld open. It passed without the employment of a superinten- 
t, a teacher, or a janitor. The 13th of September was then 
lected. That date also passed without any appointments being 
de, or the schools being opened. In this emergency the two 
mbers of the board who had voted one way upon the matters 
difference made an appeal or presented a petition under oath 
he state superintendent, charging the board with disregard and 
tempt of various prior orders made by him; reciting the facts, 
their standpoint, concerning the failure of the board to appoint 
hers and open the schools; claiming that the two members 
had voted the other way were the cause of the trouble, and 
ying for their removal from office, and for a direction that the 
ols be opened at once. The two members whose removal was 
‘ht, filed their answer under oath with the state superintendent, 
ing the facts from their point of view, and charging the

responsibility for the situation upon the other two. The superi 
tendent thereupon, and on September 27, 1897, made a decision « 
order in which he refused to remove the two members proceede 
against, and by which he directed “the board of education of tl 
city of Watervliet to provide the necessary equipment of qualifie 
teachers, janitors, and necessary employees, and to open the schoo 
of that city to the public residing therein on or before the 4th da 
of October, 1897.” The board took no action under this orde 
and did not comply with it in any respect. The state superi1 
tendent then made another order, reciting that the board had wi 
fully refused to comply with the order of September 27th, and th: 
the schools in said city yet remained closed, and no teachers, jan 
tors or other necessary employees had been appointed by said boar 
and in which last order he directed Mr. A. M. Wright, an employ 
of the state department of public instruction, to proceed to the cit 
of Watervliet and organize the school system of said city as ten 
porary superintendent of schools, with a corps of qualified teacher 
consisting of five principals, six assistant principals, and seventec 
other teachers, including one drawing teacher, besides one librariai 
two truant officers, and eight janitors, who were respective 
named in said order, and therein stated to be temporarily appointe 
to the several positions named, with an annual compensation + 
each, fixed in order. The order recited that “said appointmen 
are to continue until the local school authorities of said city she 
designate qualified teachers as their successors.” The order furth 
directed the board of education of said city to immediately open tl 
school buildings to the teachers named, and place at their dispos 
the usual and proper furniture and supplies, including fuel a 
school apparatus, and as often as at the end of each calendar mon| 
during the continuation of the services of each teacher, janitor, ai 
the librarian, to audit and pay to each an equal one-eighth part 
the annual compensation therein designated to be paid to ea 
This last order was made on October 4, 1897. Mr. Wright for’ 
with went to Watervliet, and the schools were at once opened 
him, pursuant to the order, with the aid of the teachers and ot! 
employees named therein. It is claimed by the plaintiffs that 
order of the state superintendent is without authority of law, 
the injunction asked for here is to restrain the further carrying i 
effect and enforcement of the order. 
It is urged by the plaintiffs that under the charter of the cit; 
Watervliet the management and control of the public schools the! 
is vested in the board of education, which is authorized, under 
law to appoint a superintendent of schools and a librarian, conti 
and employ all teachers and pay their wages (Laws 1896, ch.

-. 5, secs. 9, 12); and that the compulsory education law author- 
2s the school authorities of each city to appoint truant officers, 
d fix their compensation (Id. ¢. 606, sec. 3). There can be no 
ubt of the correctness of the claim that it was the duty of the 
ard of education, under the law, to make these appointments, 
it this duty has not been discharged by reason of the “deadlock” 
isting in the board. As a result of this failure of the board, the 
ople of an entire city were deprived of the benefits of free common 
hools; and, if the board alone were to be looked to for relief, the 
ople were likely to continue to be so deprived for an indefinite 
ne. It may be conceded that there was no duty resting upon the 
ard to appoint any particular individual a teacher, or upon the 
embers of the board to vote for any specified person for any posi- 
m within the gift of the board. These were matters of discre- 
m. But there was a duty resting upon the board, under the law, 
open the schools, and provide the necessary force of teachers 
d other employees for that purpose. The board failed to perform 
is duty.. Whether this failure is the result of the zeal of the 
dividual members of the board to promote the interest of personal 
political friends, is of but little consequence. But it is a ques- 
m. of great moment whether or not the people of an entire city 
e to be deprived of free common schools wherein all their children 
ny be educated, simply because the board fails to discharge the 
ities imposed upon it by law. ‘The situation presented by this 
ndition was one in which the people of the entire state have an 
terest, and not the inhabitants of Watervliet alone, for the com- 
on-school system is an institution of the state, and not of any 
rticular locality therein. It is founded upon the idea that a 
eral dissemination of education is essential to the welfare of the 
te. If this were not so, there would be no justification in sup- 
ting common schools by general taxation. The constitution 
uires that “the legislature shall provide for the maintenance and 
port of a system of free common schools wherein all the children 
is state may be educated.”’ Article 9,Section 1. The legislature 
complied with this mandate of the constitution, and has pro- 
ed “that there shall be raised by tax in each year upon the real 
personal estate of each county within the state, such sum as 
legislature shall annually determine necessary for the support 
common schools in the state.’”’ Consolidated School Law, tit. 2, 
1, sec. 1. It has also created the office of state superintendent 
ublic instruction, and by the act last referred to has clothed 
with large general powers with reference to the state school 
em, and has given him authority to apportion the state school 
eys among the cities, districts, and institutions entitled thereto.

The aggregate amount of the state tax for schools the past year w 
upwards of $4,000,000, and under the apportionment thereof ma 
by the state superintendent the city of Watervliet is entitled to t 
sum of $6,000, unless he withholds the same pursuant to the pr 
visions of the law authorizing him so to do in certain cases. TI 
seems to demonstrate clearly that the people of the entire sta 
have an interest in the application of these school funds in the ci 
of Watervliet, to the purpose for which they were raised a1 
apportioned to said city, namely, the maintenance of free comm 
schools therein. 
The charter of Watervliet distinctly recognizes the authority 
the state superintendent with reference to the schools of the cit 
for it provides that the board of education shall have, “to the excl 
sion of all boards and officers, except the superintendent of pub! 
instruction of this state, the entire supervision and manageme 
of the schools of said city.”” Laws 1896, c. 905, tit. 5, sec. 1 
subd. 10. With the people of every county in the state bei 
compelled to contribute by general taxation to the state scho 
funds, and thus being directly interested in having free comm 
schools maintained in every part of the state; with the city 
Watervliet having apportioned to it $6,000 of these funds, and wi 
its board of education refusing to open its schools to the pub! 
as provided and required by law, —the question is present 
whether there is any authority under the law in the state superi 
tendent, on proper appeal to him, to open the schools. T 
consolidated school law provides that any person conceiving hit 
self aggrieved in consequence of any decision made by certain scho 
authorities named in the act, or “by any official act or decisi 
concerning any other matter under this act, or any other act pe 
taining to common schools, may appeal to the superintendent 
public instruction, who is hereby authorized and required to exami 
and decide the same; and his decision shall be final and conclusi 
and not subject to question or review in any place or court wh 
ever.” Laws 1894, c. 556, tit. 14, sec. 1, subd. 7. And the 
further provides that the superintendent “in reference to si 
appeals, shall have power to regulate the practice therein, . 
and to make all orders, by directing the levying of taxes, or oth 
wise, which may, in his judgement, be proper or necessary to g 
effect to his decision.”’ Consolidated School Law, tit. 14, s 
1, 2. It is urged that the authority above referred to in relat: 
to appeals is expressly limited to the “official act or decision” 
the board of education, and that this case presents no official 
or decision which can be brought before the superintendent 
appeal, but simply a case of neglect or refusal or inability to
-P-A-G-E-183

r decide, and for that reason that the superintendent had no 
irisdiction or authority to entertain the appeal, or to make the 
rders which he did. It is true that there has been an inability 
n the part of the board to take any affirmative action. The papers 
10w, however, that there have been repeated resolutions offered 
t different meetings of the board to appoint teachers and other 
mployees; that repeated amendments to such resolutions have 
een proposed in the board; that each resolution and each amend- 
.ent for these purposes has received two votes in the affirmative 
nd two votes in the negative. When two members of the board 
oted in favor of a resolution, and the only two other members 
oted against it, it was, under the rules governing parliamentary 
ractice, lost for want of a majority vote, and amounts, in effect, 
» a decision of the board not to take the action sought to be 
uthorized by the resolution. This principle has been recognized 
1 the case of People v. Bennett, 54 Barb. 480. There it appeared 
1at the board of trustees of the village of Saratoga Springs con- 
sted of six members, three of whom voted to raise the sum re- 
uired by the board of education for school purposes, and three 
f whom voted against it, and the court held that “such act of that 
oard was, in legal effect, a refusal to raise the said sum, for the 
sason that a majority did not vote in favor of the requisition.” 
the case of People v. Eckler, 19 Hun, 609, it was held that the 
fusal of a school-district trustee to pay a teacher’s wages was a 
cision within the meaning of that term as used in the school law, 
d that the relator was entitled to appeal therefrom to the super- 
tendent of public instruction. I think, therefore, that every 
usal of this board to pass any of the numerous resolutions offered 
the board to appoint teachers or other employees was a decision, 
an official act, under which an appeal could properly be taken, 
rsuant to the school law, to the state superintendent, and that 
on such appeal he had the jurisdiction and power under the law 
examine and decide the same. He exercised that power, and 
de the decision of September 27, 1897, above referred to, in 
ich he ordered and directed the board of education to provide 
necessary equipment of qualified teachers and other employees, 
to open the schools, before the 4th day of October following. 
e order contained in this decision not being complied with, he 
the further power, under the law, to make all orders proper or 
essary in his judgment to give effect to his decision. The 
amount object of the decision was to procure the opening of the 
fools. The schools could not be opened without teachers and 
ler employees. The appointment of the persons named in the 
sequent order of the superintendent as teachers, janitors, and

truant officers, was but the incident of the main object to | 
accomplished. The superintendent undoubtedly had power 
withhold the public funds, instead of making the order he di 
but that would not have caused the schools to be opened. 
might have removed the members of the board from office, but th 
would not have accomplished the desired result. He had the rig] 
to make the order which, in his judgment, was necessary to mal 
his former order effective; and, if he had jurisdiction to make t+] 
order he did, as I think he had, the propriety of the exercise | 
him of his discretion is not subject to question by the court. 
think, therefore, that he was justified, under the law, when #1 
board refused to open the schools in compliance with his order, ' 
make the subsequent order which he did, even though that involve 
the temporary appointment by him of a force of teachers and othe 
sufficient to open and conduct the schools. 
The granting or refusing of equitable relief by way of injunctic 
depends to a great extent upon the particular facts in each case, ar 
is largely discretionary with the court. Wormser v. Brown, 1¢ 
N. Y. at page 172, 43 N. E. 576. If I am wrong in my conclusic 
that the superintendent had jurisdiction to make the order | 
question, yet I do not think, under the facts of this case, that 
temporary injunction should issue, the result of which would be | 
close all the public schools in the city at a season of the year whe 
they should be open. Notwithstanding the difficult and embarras 
ing situation presented by reason of the unfortunate organizatic 
of the board of education, the schools are now in full operatio 
pursuant to the orders and directions of the chief officer of t! 
state charged with the administration of the state school syste’ 
Great public injury would result from granting the relief here ask 
for, and, unless the plaintiffs expect to escape all local taxation ff 
school purposes for the ensuing year, they will not be injured 
denying it, for the reason that the papers show that the cost to t 
city of carrying the superintendent’s order into effect is much | 
than the cost of the schools during the last year, and also than 
amount inserted in the budget for that purpose for the current ye 
largely owing to the fact that the compensation of Mr. Wrig! 
the temporary superintendent of schools designated in the order}

There are also other matters standing in the way of granting t 
motion. The plaintiffs sue as taxpayers. The authority for 
action is chapter 301, Laws 1892, and section 1925, Code Civ. Pr 
which are known as the “'Taxpayers’ Acts.” These statutes o 
authorize actions against officers who have acted for or on be 
of any county, town, village, city, or municipal corporation in

‘he superintendent of public instruction is not a municipal officer, 
ut is a state officer. Public Officers Law (Laws 1892, c. 681, 
rt. 1, sec. 2). What he has done has been done in his official

The plaintiffs have also failed to make and file the bond required

ducation was continued under an act directing them to investi-

  164 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
gate the public school system of the State of Connecticut and 
make a report to the General Assembly of 1909, accompanied | 
such recommendations as should seem proper. Immediately aft 
this action the Joint Committee met and appointed five of the 
number, whose names are appended to this report, and cor 
missioned them to carry out the directions of the continuing ac 
and to make the report and recommendations called for. It is 
fulfilment of this assigned duty that this paper is respectful 
submitted to your honorable body. 
Your Commissioners have held public meetings in different pat 
of the state. They have studied with care the school laws of th 
state and of other states. They have carefully considered t 
reports submitted to the State Board of Education by their agen’ 
superintendents, and others during the past two years. They ha 
visited schools, have consulted with many persons interested 
educational matters, and have endeavored in various other ways 
discharge the duty to which they were appointed. 
We are impressed with the fact that the State of Connectict 
by establishing laws for the compulsory education of its childre 
has assumed a very grave responsibility. It is true that t 
school laws prescribed first of all and most properly that “ 
parents and those who have care of children shall bring them up 
some lawful and honest employment.” It is to be regretted th 
the existence of this law is probably unknown to the majority 
parents, and it is further to be regretted that the significance 
such a law is but faintly appreciated. Aside from this the S 
has assumed control of the education of its children. Neit! 
the parent nor the community in which the parent resides 
determine whether or not the children shall go to school, 
determine exclusively the studies which the child shall underta| 
can determine the minimum period of the child’s school life. 
State, and not the town, and not the parent, is the authorit; 
these matters. 
Furthermore, the State contributes every year an enorm 
fund for the carrying out of the obligations entered into thro’ 
the establishment of the laws above alluded to. It seems 
follow as a logical and moral necessity that the state should 
to it that as a state it discharges its own reciprocal duty by 
assertion of its authority in this very grave matter, the obliga 
tacitly undertaken when large sums of money are devoted to 
purpose. When a state requires the children to go to scho 
becomes obliged to provide a suitable school for the childre’ 
attend. 
In recognition of these obligations, the state has establi

THE STATE THE UNIT 'IN EDUCATION 165 
commission known as the state board of education, whose funda- 
ental purpose is, as stated in section 2 of the School Laws, to 
have general supervision and control of the educational interests 
the state.” This board has and exercises a general advisory 
ipervision over the schools of the state, but the specific statutes 
our school laws are of such a nature that the control of the 
lucational interests of the state is by no means in the hands of this 
ate board. Except in a few instances, and with reference to 
wticular questions, the control of the schools is in the hands of 
wn. or district authorities. This is a condition which has been 
herited from an earlier time when the towns were isolated and 
hen the conception of public education was a thing quite different 
om that which prevails in enlightened commonwealths to-day. 
Very grave injustice is being done to-day to a large proportion of 
e children of the state through the inequalities of school oppor- 
nity resulting from this system of local management. Partly 
is injustice is due to the different ability of different communities 
maintain suitable schools; partly it is due to indifference and 
competence on the part of local authorities; partly it is due to 
ty and unworthy jealousies liable to exist between communities 
in communities. As a result of these and other causes we 
eat that a large proportion of the children of the state are not 
eiving proper instruction. A large proportion of the fund 
oted every year by the state to the support of schools fails to 
hieve the purpose for which it is appropriated. A considerable 
t of this money is without doubt rather worse than wasted ; 
there are schools in this state of which it may fairly be said that 
ould be better for the children to work or play rather than to 
compelled to attend them. 
our commission have been painfully impressed by the con- 
on of many of the school buildings in the smaller towns of the 
e. They are old, unclean, offering no proper shelter, poorly 
ted, unventilated, associated with out-buildings offensive to the 
es and sensibilities of child and adult alike; buildings of a sort 
ch would not be tolerated for an instant in the case of a state 
on or a county jail. Yet in these hovels are gathered together 
or six hours a day the helpless little children for whose education 
state has assumed to care. Your commissioners are anxious 
to exaggerate. Yet no one, we believe, could with compre- 
ing eyes look upon these places inside and out without a 
e of state shame and humiliation, without a hope, silent or 
essed, that no visitor from another commonwealth should see 
le things. 
e find further that, aside from the buildings themselves, very

  166 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
many of these schools are equipped but poorly or not at all wit 
the things necessary for the administration of a school in thes 
days. They are without reference books, without maps, and i 
many cases the children are without text books. Indeed most « 
the tools for the maintenance of a school are lacking. 
We find that a considerable proportion of the teachers in th 
Connecticut schools are thoroughly unfit for their positions, tha 
these teachers to whom we take exception are uneducated, withou 
experience or knowledge of the teaching profession, without amb 
tion or ability to improve. We find that, through imprope 
methods of appointment, and through the lack of any state cor 
trol, appointments to teaching positions are made carelessl 
and sometimes in a way suggesting motives which ought to b 
deprecated. For example taking the teachers in something ove 
fifty towns for which appropriate statistics are available, we fin 
that fifteen per cent of them are related by consanguinity or affini 
to the person responsible for their appointment, and that of t! 
teachers comprising this fifteen per cent only two or three can 
ranked as in any way efficient. 
We find that the wages paid to a large proportion of our teache| 
are distressingly small, so ridiculous when thought of in connecti 
with the tremendous responsibilities devolving upon the teacher 
a school as to be a separate and distinct occasion for shame. 
Naturally we find also that in'very many schools the children a| 
learning very little. And all this unfortunate situation exists 
a time, when, because of the influx, specially into our rural distric 
of immigrant children hardly able to speak our language, born 
parents entirely unacquainted with our national character a 
uninfluenced by national tradition, the need for careful traini 
is most pressing. (In 1900 the percentage of illiterates among 
foreign white population of Connecticut from 15 to 19 years of 
was 13.3.) 
The criticisms which have thus far been indicated are applica) 
to many of the smaller schools in some of the rural districts of 
state. The difficulties of the situation in such localities are gr 
Through the prevalence of the district system or through 
willingness of town authorities to maintain more schools than 
really necessary or desirable, there are altogether too many sch 
in the country towns. Your commission believe that a schoo 
four or five or even of eight or ten pupils cannot in any case do g 
work. It is run at an extraordinary pecuniary loss. The lac! 
anything like school spirit reacts disastrously upon the children 
upon the teacher. There is no more depressing sight than that 
half dozen children gathered in a disreputable schoolhouse, 0}

lly meant for thirty or forty pupils, in charge of a teacher who is 
lly in the position of a private tutor without the helps and 
vantages and opportunities that would attach to a real tutor- 
p. 
[t is not too much to say that from three hundred to four hundred 
ools now maintained in the state could be closed, the children 
ng sent to central schools, to the very great advantage of the 
erests of education. In a town in Windham County, for 
umple, the aggregate attendance in four of the schools taken 
ether is less than seventeen. In 108 towns there are 343 schools 
which the average attendance for the year 1907-08 was less than 
elve pupils each. Very often a hardship results, even from the 
vn system of schools, when, for example, children are obliged 
travel or to be carried a long distance in order to attend a school 
their own town, whereas by simply stepping over an imaginary 
e they could attend a school close at hand. There are several 
tances of this sort to which specific reference may be made if 
sired. 
[t is not pleasant to be obliged to call attention to a situation 
sh as that indicated above. Your commission might easily go 
particulars, might name town after town and district after 
rict in which the schools are almost or quite useless, and in which 
money devoted to their support produces no reasonable return. 
might present photographs of exteriors and interiors of school 
dings which it would be humiliating for a citizen of Connecticut 
ook upon. We have in our possession a photograph of a school 
ding so defaced that the photograph could not lawfully be sent 
ugh the post-office and the exhibition of it would violate 
ion 1325 of the General Statutes. But is it not sufficient for us 
ay that in our opinion a large number of our schools call for 
ediate and drastic action looking to their reform and improve- 
t? We feel sure that there are many towns and districts that 
be thankful not to be particularly designated in this report, 
that there are many teachers to whom we do a kindness in 
holding from public knowledge their names and specific lack 
ualification for the position which they hold. We are saying 
it we say unwillingly but because we are profoundly moved by 
se of the wrong that is being done daily to the children over 
e education the state has affected to assume control. And if 
general assembly desires names of persons and places, and 
er evidence of the conditions which we describe, such partic- 
and evidence will be furnished. 
is pleasant to be able to add that there is another side to the 
e. In our cities, in most of our boroughs, and in the more

populous towns, in those small towns also in which still pers 
effectively something of the New England spirit of earlier days, ’ 
schools, while doubtless susceptible of improvement like all ot 
human enterprises, are good. The children in such places | 
being educated. The teachers are alive to their responsibilit 
and opportunities. 
But alas for the little ones whose lot is cast elsewhere in « 
commonwealth; and to whom, notwithstanding their presun 
ability and intellect, notwithstanding their possible genius, th 
comes no chance whatever of developing the best or even a consid 
able part of that which is good within them. 
‘Your commission gladly report that in their opinion the st 
board has done and is doing everything that is possible under - 
laws which govern their action for the proper administration 
the schools. The state has established a state board of edu 
tion, but it has not armed it with authority to carry out the leg 
mate purposes of such a board. The board is faithful, industrio 
careful, skillful. Its secretary is one of the hardest worked a 
most efficient servants of the state. The board often finds it: 
confronted by unwillingness to accept advice, resentment of coun: 
determined opposition to anything like control. The statu 
whose operation would tend and do tend to an amelioration of « 
are mostly permissive. These statutes in our opinion should 
changed so that they should compel rather than permit. In sh« 
the commission is distinctly of the opinion that the state bo 
should be armed with lawful authority to supervise and con 
the educational interests of the state. To this end, the commiss 
has submitted a considerable number of recommendations, w 
will be found below. Some of these recommendations are fun 
mental and if carried into effect by appropriate legislation will 
ify profoundly the educational system of the state. Others r 
to matters of detail and are submitted as recommendations of 
we think would be advisable in matters not of the first importa: 
First of all, as will be seen, we earnestly recommend the e 
abolition of school districts and of the whole district syste 
management within the borders of our state. We recognize 
in some large towns the question of town control is rather econ 
than educational. We believe that in the city of Hartford, 
example, it is doubtful whether the schools as schools woul 
improved by consolidation, yet we cannot imagine that the se 
would be injured through such a process. If in the opinion of 
legislature it should seem wise to exempt incorporated cities 
enforced consolidation, probably no harm would be don 
educational interests, though we should think it a pity if,such

THE STATE THE UNIT IN EDUCATION 169 
unities would not in the interests of the whole state consent to a 
ange in their own methods. But in the rural districts we believe 
at the district system is responsible for a very considerable part 
the evils which we find to exist. 
It is further recommended that the state be divided into terri- 
ries of convenient size, taking into account population as well 
, area, for adequate supervision, these territories to be called 
pervisory districts or by such other title as seems appropriate ; 
id that a supervisor, who should devote practically his whole 
me to the work of supervision, should be appointed, by local 
ithority, in accordance with the conditions now prescribed in sec- 
mn. 132 of the school laws, for each such territory. These super- 
sors should be responsible to the state board, which board should 
escribe their duties, receive their reports, and have the power of 
moval for cause. Such a step as this will make it possible to 
velop teachers and promptly to sift out the good from the bad. 
is obviously impossible for the secretary of the state board to 
ercise personally the minute supervision over all the schools in 
e state which is distinctly required, ad it is in our opinion highly 
sirable that a corps of competent supervisors should be imme- 
tely put in charge of the schools. 
It will be seen that we recommend also the substantial abolition 
n of town lines in the matter of attendance. There is no 
quate reason for compelling children to travel an unreasonable 
tance in order to attend school when another school is almost 
their door, the other school being established and largely main- 
ed by the authority and resources of the state in which these 
dren are resident. 
e recommend further and most earnestly that after a brief 
fiod no person be allowed to teach in any school in this state of 
se qualifications for the work the state board is not well assured. 
system of local examinations is in our opinion essentially bad 
s results, though we cheerfully admit that persons so appointed 
not invariably poor teachers. But in so many cases they are 
ir teachers that the demand for a different and more centralized 
em seems to us irresistible. 
is a simple matter of fact that the salaries paid to teachers, 
cially in the smaller schools in this state, are much less than 
alaries paid for similar work in other and neighboring common- 
ths. The result of this is that it is difficult to retain our 
r teachers. The obvious way to remedy this difficulty is 
crease the salaries of our teachers so that they will be com- 
ble with those paid in other states, and it is believed that the 
sion of the operation of the average attendance law will con-

tribute to this end. Meantime, however, it may fairly be co 
sidered that the graduates of our normal schools, where tuition 
absolutely free, may quite properly be required to teach within tl 
state for a definite period. The men and women who receive th 
preparation at the expense of the state do now when entering upc 
their normal course file a declaration of their intention to teach 
the state of Connecticut. This declaration, however, carries wit 
it but little sense of obligation. It would seem desirable that suc 
normal pupils should sign a definite contract to teach in the sta 
for a specific period of, say, not less than three years. Probab 
such a contract would be difficult of enforcement if a teacher wish: 
to violate it. Yet it would carry with it an emphatic suggestic 
of duty, and furthermore it is possible that the school authoriti 
of other states would hesitate to employ a teacher who had, 
order to accept their proposition, violated a written contrac 
In this connection the commission suggest, but without positi' 
recommendation, that it might be desirable to establish a certa 
number of limited cash scholarships in our normal schools for pup 
of special promise and who as a return for the pecuniary aid th’ 
afforded would contract to teach for a definite number of years 
any school in the state to which they should be assigned by t 
state board of education. It seems to us that in time this proce 
might result in securing better qualified teachers in the small 
schools. The cash value of a scholarship need not exceed $150 
ear. 
y We recommend that the operation of the so-called aver: 
attendance act be extended so as to include technically every to 
in the state. Such an enlargement of its scope will not, of cour 
include all or nearly all of the towns in the state. It will sim 
ensure this, that in no town in the state shall there be less th 
twenty-five dollars expended annually per pupil in average atte 
ance ih providing for his education. It will tend to even up 
educational opportunities of the children of the state and it will 
this at an expense which in view of the saving possible to be attaii 
in other directions is entirely reasonable. 
We recommend that whereas the school laws now provide (See 
169) “that the schoolhouse and out-buildings must be satisfac 
to the board of school visitors,” the law should provide that s 
buildings must be satisfactory to the supervisor appointe 
accordance with the recommendation above submitted. 
It is the opinion of your commission that no school in which, 
average attendance is less than twelve should be continued, 
that in every case in which a school is closed for lack of reason, 
attendance, the pupils should be carried when necessary to

m some larger school in their neighborhood. And in this con- 
ction we feel it important that in those cases and in the cases 
eady provided for the means employed for transportation should 
subject to the approval and under the control of the supervisor. 
We are also of-the opinion that either the state or the supervision 
trict or the town should provide free text books for all the 
ildren. Under present regulations there is grave difficulty in 
2 towns in which free text books are not yet provided. Some 
the children have books, for some of the children whose parents 
» apparently unable to purchase books they are provided as an 
t of charity by the town, but there are many children whose 
rents though well able to provide text books do not as a matter of 
‘t provide them. And the operation of the school is hindered 
even made impossible by this condition of affairs. 
‘he time is at hand when, in our opinion, the state must take 
and consider seriously the problem of establishing state high 
ools in localities remote from the larger communities in which 
h schools now exist. It is certainly desirable that every boy 
girl in Connecticut should have the opportunity to attend a 
th school, and it is probable that in state high schools carefully 
ted so as to be accessible and convenient for relatively large 
1 areas will be found the only solution of the question. 
our commission are of the opinion that it is the duty of the state 
rovide to a considerable extent industrial education, including 
ming in at least the elements of agriculture. Certain of our 
mmendations bear directly upon this problem. It is for 
interest of the state that the successive generations of young 
and women, as they take up their work in life, should be able 
o something of more importance than the unskilled labor or the 
ed labor unskillfully performed which now seems to occupy 
as a matter of necessity. The reason for any public training 
e desire of the state that its citizens should be competent ; 
no man or woman is competent to discharge the duties of citi- 
hip or to contribute proportionately to the prosperity of the 
onwealth who has not been taught how to do something which 
ommonwealth desires to be done, which indeed must be done 
are to maintain our civilization and improve upon it.

Yet as the children now in attendance at such schools must 
most cases be transported at some expense to the larger scho 
the saving in teachers’ wages, while more, probably, than 
cost of transportation, will ameliorate the financial situation | 
little. It seems to us that the state must face the necessity 
spending more money on its schools, the necessity of provid 
the education which it compels its children to accept, the necess 
of controlling those enlarged expenditures in such a way as 1 
secure the highest advantages to the coming citizens of the cc

MMONWEALTH versus THE INHABITANTS OF DEDHAM, 16 Mass. 141. 
(Supreme Court of Massachusetts, 1819) 
At the Circuit Court of Common Pleas, April term 1817, the 
owing indictment was returned by the Grand Jury, viz. 
“The Jurors, ete., on their oath present, that the town of 
edham in said county of Norfolk, at said Dedham, on the 26th 
ay of April, 1816, and from that time to the 26th day of April, 
817, did contain, and still doth contain two hundred families 
nd upwards; and that said town of Dedham at said Dedham, 
id, during all the time from said 26th of April 1816, to said 
6th of April, 1817, neglect, and still does neglect the procuring 
nd supporting of a grammar schoolmaster, of good morals, well 
structed in the Latin, Greek and English languages, to instruct 
ildren and youth in said languages; which is in subversion of 
173 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  174 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
that diffusion of knowledge, and in hindrance of that promoti 
of education, which the principles of a free government requi 
and which the constitution of the Commonwealth enjoi1 
against the peace and dignity of said Commonwealth, and 1 
form of the statute in such case made and provided.” + 
The said indictment was tried upon the general issue of 1 
guilty in the court below, and being brought into this court 
appeal, was again tried before Wilde J., February term 18! 
when the defendants offered to prove that they employed c 
person two months during the said year to instruct the children 
one of the town or district schools, which was similar in its re; 
lations to all the other schools in the town, of which there w: 
eleven. The selectmen had never interfered, in any manner, 
regulate the admission of children into said schools. The pers 
so employed was a graduate of Harvard College, and a stud 
in divinity : and the defendants contended that he was a Gramn 
schoolmaster of good morals, well instructed in the Latin, Gr 
and English languages; and that his being employed as afores: 
was, in part, a compliance with that part of the statute, on whi 
they were indicted. 
But the judge instructed the jury, that it was not an observa 
of the statute. 
The defendants also offered to prove, that two other persons, ¢ 
a Senior Sophister in the college at Providence, and the othet 
Freshman in Harvard College, were employed during the said ye 
four months and an half each, to instruct the children of two ot] 
schools, having the same regulations as that before mention 
There were no regular certificates of the qualifications of the s: 
two schoolmasters last mentioned, obtained before their empl 
ment; but the defendants offered to prove, by certificates obtair 
after their keeping said schools, and by the parole testimony of 
ministers of Dedham, that both of them were, at the time of. t! 
instructing said schools, of good moral characters, and well 
structed in the Latin, Greek and English languages. 
The judge ruled that such evidence was incompetent, and t| 
the defendants could not prove those facts by any other evidei 
than those certificates required by the fifth section of the statu} 
The schools, which were kept during the said year in the to 
were district schools: and there was no separate school for teac! 
the languages aforesaid. 
The defendants were able to prove that, during the said y, 
other schoolmasters were employed to keep other public sch 
1 Stat. 1789, c. 19.

ind were paid with the money of the town; but the masters thereof 
vere qualified only to instruct Hnglish schools: that the time of 
mployment, during said year, of all the schoolmasters being added, 
vas equal or equivalent to three years for one school: and that the 
own raised by tax, and appropriated to the use of public schools, 
luring the year, the sum of 2000 dollars. But believing the said 
vidence alike rejected by the above decision of the judge, the 
lefendants did not offer it: and filed their exceptions to the said 
lecision. 
A verdict being returned against them, the defendants also 
oved in arrest of judgment ; — because the said inhabitants are 
ot sufficiently described by their proper name in the indictment ; 
ecause it is not therein alleged, that the inhabitants of Dedham 
eglected the procuring and supporting grammar schoolmasters 
c. — and because said indictment does not aver that the town 
Dedham contained two hundred families or householders. 
At the last October term, Worthington for the defendants argued, 
at all that was required by the statute, of towns comprising two 
ndred householders, was that they should be provided with 
mpetent Grammar schoolmasters for.so long a time as that all 
eir services should make an aggregate of twelve months in each 
ar. These may be employed contemporaneously in different 
stricts, and indeed would thus diffuse their instructions through 
e town more equally than if employed wholly in one district. 
e word equivalent in the statute has the same meaning in its 
plication to grammar schools as to others; and must intend that 
h schools may be kept at the same time in several districts. 
he defendants complied with the requisitions of the statute for 
‘ven months in the year: but they are charged with neglecting 
ir duty during the whole year. Had they been indicted for their 
ual fault only, they would not have resisted the government. 
ey cannot be convicted of twelve months’ neglect, when the 
idence shows them guilty of one twelfth part only of the time. 
t is the duty of the masters to produce the certificates of their 
lifications. The town is not liable for a deficiency in these, 
more than for the want of fidelity in the exercise of their 
loyment. It may be added that there is nothing in the statute, 
ativing other evidence of the qualifications.* 
n arrest of judgment it was urged that the indictment should 
e charged the inhabitants of the town of Dedham, which is their 
orate name; and not the town. — The word householders was 
ssary, since many families might occupy one house.

  176 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
The cause was continued for advisement, and at the last Febru 
ary term in this county, the opinion of the court was delivered by 
Wilde J. We have taken time for the cohsideration of this case 
not because we thought it entangled with much difficulty; bu 
because we felt unwilling to give a hasty construction to a statute 
which has relation to a subject of general interest and importance 
and which, although it has been in operation many years, has no 
been much discussed in our courts of law. On this statute, there 
fore, we have bestowed considerable attention, and we have n 
remaining doubts as to its construction. 
The first section requires, among other things, that every tow 
or district, containing two hundred families or householders, sha 
be provided with a grammar schoolmaster, of good morals, we 
instructed in the Latin, Greek and English languages; and shall, i 
addition thereto, be provided with a schoolmaster or schoolmaster: 
to instruct children in the English language, for such term of ti 
as shall be equivalent to twelve months for each of said schools j 
each year. 
The fifth section provides that no person shall be employed as 
grammar schoolmaster, unless he shall have received an educati 
at some college, and before entering on the business of said scho 
shall produce satisfactory evidence thereof; or shall produce 
certificate of a learned minister or ministers, that he is of compete 
skill in the Greek and Latin languages for the said purpose. 
And the second section empowers towns to determine and defi 
the limits of school districts, for the accommodation of those i 
habitants, whose dispersed situation might render such a, divisi 
expedient. 
These are all the provisions, which are applicable to the pres 
case ; and they seem to describe, with sufficient clearness, the dut 
of towns, in relation both to the regulation of their schools, and 
qualifications of the schoolmasters they are permitted to empl 
The question then is, whether the defendants have complied w 
the requisitions of the statute. To determine which, we must fi 
decide what is necessary to constitute a grammar schoolmas 
within the act. 
It has been argued, that the character or denomination o 
school must be determined by the qualifications of the master, 
not by the nature of his contract with his employers; and that 
production of evidence, to the selectmen, of his learning and mor: 
is not indispensable. 
This argument, however, cannot be supported against the exp 
words of the statute. Doubtless the qualifications of the ma: 
are of the first importance to the school; and if these are unex

ionable, it seems hard to say that the school would be illegally 
nstituted, unless the certificates of such qualifications were 
xhibited to the selectmen, in compliance with the law. But the 
vords of the statute are express, and the meaning is too obvious 
o admit of a doubt. No person can be lawfully employed as a 
own schoolmaster, unless he first produce the certificates or evi- 
lence required by the statute. Such evidence is decisive as to the 
gality of the school, and can never afterwards be questioned. 
or can the want of it be supplied aliunde. It may be regarded 
ls equivalent to the license of the ordinary, required by the law 
if England; without which no person can there lawfully be em- 
loyed to teach a grammar school; whatever may be his learning 
d other qualifications for such a trust. 
Again, to constitute a grammar school within the meaning of the 
atute, it must be duly regulated as to the admission of scholars ; 
id the master must be engaged to teach a school of that descrip- 
ion. Now none of the schools in Dedham were under the regula- 
ions prescribed for grammar schools ; nor is it pretended that the 
asters were engaged to teach any such schools. In most of the 
istricts they were in no respect qualified as grammar school- 
asters: and it is expressly admitted that all the schools in the 
wn were under similar regulations. They must therefore be 
warded in the same light, and as forming but one description of 
thools. 
But there is another objection to the defence set up in this case. 
e schools required by the statute are to be maintained for the 
nefit of the whole town; as it is the wise policy of the law to give 
the inhabitants equal privileges, for the education of their 
ildren in the public schools. Nor is it in the power of the ma- 
ity to deprive the minority of this privilege. If then the schools 
three of the districts are to be considered as grammar schools, 
id those in the other districts as of another description, the whole 
ceedings of the town have been irregular; and it may well be 
ubted whether the money of the town can be lawfully appro- 
ated to the support of schools thus instituted. Every inhabit- 
of the town has a right to participate in the benefits of both 
criptions of schools: and it is not competent for a town to estab- 
a grammar school for the benefit of one part of the town, to the 
Jusion of the other; although the money raised for the support 
schools may be, in other respects, fairly apportioned. If the 
lole of the money so raised by the defendants had been expended 
hree districts, no one would contend for the legality of such an 
ropriation. Yet the principle of the present case is the same. 
the two descriptions of schools are to be considered as distinct

and independent of each other. Both must be.town schools, ar 
not schools for the benefit of a part of the town only. 
For these reasons, the Court are all of opinion that the motic 
for a new trial must be overruled. 
As to the motion in arrest of judgment, there seems to be r 
ground for it. Misnomer is only matter of abatement, and is n 
a good cause for arrest, even in criminal prosecutions. But if 
were, we are of opinion that the defendants are rightly namec 
and that the deliquency of the town is described with sufficier 
certainty. 
III. Tue SrrvuaG.e To ESTABLISH THE TowNsHIP SysTE 
IN InpIANA 
[From Rawles, W. A., Centralizing Tendencies in the Administr 
tion of Indiana, pp. 28-39. Columbia Studies in Hist., Ec 
and Publ. Law, XVU, 1.] 
The tendency towards State centralization in the administrati 
of schools has been attended by a similar movement in the directi 
of local centralization. A review of the struggle to supplant tl 
“district system” with the “township system” will, in part, expl: 
the conditions which determined the educational life of the Sta: 
and will thus contribute to a better understanding of the difficult 
which impeded progress for half a century. 
The division of the land into townships by the congressio’ 
survey and the reservation of the sixteenth section of each to 
ship for the use of the inhabitants thereof, for school purpos 
betokened, before any statute to that effect, that the towns! 
would be the natural unit of the school system. The earliest St: 
laws in respect to schools and school lands recognized this nat: 
division. An act of 1816 authorized the election, upon the petit: 
of twenty house-holders, of three trustees in each congressio; 
township who were declared to be a “body corporate in deed 
fact”’ with full power to make by-laws or regulations for the enc 
agement and support of the schools in the township. 
The law of 1824 — the first serious attempt to establish a pul 
school system — provided for the incorporation of congressi 
townships, and vested in the corporations the reserved school la 
with certain limitations as to their lease and sale. It then 
ceeded to give the trustees authority to divide the township 
school districts, and to appoint three sub-trustees in each dist: 
These officials were accountable to the township trustees for 
malconduct in the discharge of their duties; they were subjec}

smissal from office after a hearing, and were also liable to prose- 
ition. 
Here was the inauguration of the “district system,” an arrange- 
ent which left to small territorial areas, thinly inhabited, the 
mtrol and management of their school affairs. The inhabitants 
the district determined whether or not they should have any 
ool at all, the site of the school house, the length of the term 
case it exceeded three months) and the method of payment of 
le tax. No county, township or district officer had any authority 
regulate the use of text-books, the course of study, or the methods 
discipline and instruction. The districts depended upon the 
nship trustees for three things only: the appointment of the 
-trustees, the levy of the local tuition revenue, in case such a 
y was necessary, and the examination of the teachers. These 
wers might have been used by the trustees to secure a small 
ree of local centralization, which would have preserved the 
nship unit; but they were not so utilized. 
t that time the educational outlook was not bright. There 
re only 52 counties organized in the State. “Few townships 
ire officered, and fewer yet maintained schools;” and in these 
tion was not always free. The terms seldom exceeded the 
imum of three months. The school revenues were totally 
dequate “both from the neglect of the lands and mismanage- 
mt of the funds.” “With the exception of county seminaries! 
‘iving some aid from the penal code and the township rents 
ruing to the State University, there exists no active fund for 
cation to which resort could be had; and the pittance of rent 
some sixteenth sections is entirely inadequate to effect the 
lect at this time.” ? 
‘he explanation of the substitution of the district for the town- 
as the unit of the school system must be sought in the physical 
ironment of the people, and in their preconceived ideas of local 
-government. It is probable that the location of the “six- 
th section” had almost no influence in- determining the place of 
lement of families or colonies immigrating to the State. At 
t a careful examination of a map of the State does not show that 
villages, towns or cities are located more frequently in the 
ity of the school section than in any other section. Other 
iderations more potent, if not more worthy, guided the settlers 
e choice of lands and in the location of villages. Chief of these

ls were intended to furnish secondary instruction; but in fact, generally 
ided in their course of study the elementary branches as well.

were nearness to water-courses and water-sources, productivene 
of the land (considering their means of cultivation), protectic 
against the attacks of the Indians, and the relationships or frien 
ships with earlier pioneers. Communities were often far apai 
and this isolation was still further aggravated by the insufficie 
means of communication and transportation. In 1820 the tot 
population was less than 150,000; and in three-fourths of tl 
State it averaged less than two to the square mile. The area of 
congressional township was thirty-six square miles. In order 
have had a meeting of the inhabitants for school purposes, perha; 
one-half of them would have found it necessary to travel ov 
almost impassable roads a distance of four or five miles. A sin,

Neighborhoods were often jealous and even bitter in their feelin| 
towards one another. With these obstacles to township unity 
seemed but natural to provide schools for the separate neighb 
hoods as the people of those districts wished. 
In addition to these local considerations there was a deep-seat} 
conviction of the sacredness of local self-government. During t| 
Colonial and Revolutionary periods there had developed in Ame! 
an extreme type of particularism. When the pioneers crossed 
Alleghenies and settled in the Mississippi Valley, they carried w 
them their particularistic ideas. In this sparsely settled regi 
in self-reliant communities, their individualism had an opportun 
for almost unchecked growth. The isolated condition, the deper 
ence upon self-help in a multitude of activities, the self-sufficie 
of the separate localities, all stimulated in the individual the id 
of equality and self-assurance; and in the community an unshal 
confidence in a localized administration of all civil affairs. In 
matters of education, each citizen claimed the right to give 
children the kind and the degree of education which he dee 
sufficient, and the district insisted upon the same right, irrespect| 
of the larger interests and welfare of the township, county or st: 
During the next decade the idea of local self-government was car 
still further. 
In 1833 the slight connection existing between the dist 
and township was severed. The office of sub-trustee was abolis 
Three trustees for each school district were to be elected annui 
thereafter by the qualified voters of the district. They were 
longer removable from office by the township trustees, but by 
vote of a majority of the patrons in the district. The inhabit 
of any district decided whether or not to maintain a school, 
determined the amount and character of the tax for building 
poses and the proportion each should pay, taking into “ consid

n the number of each person’s children to be educated, and 
er equitable circumstances.” After the school house was 
‘e erected and paid for, no person was liable for school taxes 
nless he intends to or does participate in the benefit of the school 
d.” Any one was allowed to send children to such a school 
> from any other tax than his just proportion of the labor and 
ney necessary to repair or rebuild the school house, “he fulfilling 
own contract with the teacher for tuition, fuel and contingencies 
in other cases.” The district treasurer was required to credit 
h inhabitant of the district his due proportion of school moneys, 
ed upon the number of days of attendance of his children, and 
yay over the said funds “to the teacher to be applied in due pro- 
tion to the discharge of the debt due for tuition from each person 
itled to the benefit of such funds, if a contract to that effect 
uld have been made by such teacher with the inhabitants or 
h the district trustees.”! A show of financial supervision 
; made in the requirement that the books, papers and accounts 
she school commissioner, or of the trustees or treasurer of any 
rict or township, should be subject to the inspection of the 
rd of county commissioners. This local control was neutralized 
the ludicrous proviso that three days’ notice should be given, 
process issued by the clerk of the board on the petition of five 
holders or householders of the district, township or county. 
s deprived the county commissioners of all power to initiate 
estigations and gave opportunity to conceal frauds. 
‘he extent to which the theory of decentralization was carried 
be inferred from the fact that schools established by religious 
ominations and by private associations were considered dis- 
t schools, and were entitled by law to a share of the school rev- 
es and to all other privileges of public schools. 
n 1836 and 1837 it was made lawful for any householder to em- 
a “qualified and certificated” teacher to instruct his children 
the children of others of the district who might wish to join 
him, upon such contract as he could make; provided the in- 
itants should fail to elect district trustees, or the trustees

to the aggregate tuition of all the pupils sent to the school.

It would seem possible to go no further in the matter of dec 
tralization unless the requirement of a teacher’s certificate sho 
be abolished. Indeed, we find that in 1841 this was left to 
option of the district trustees. But the same year showed a sli 
reaction from this extreme individualism. All the property wit 
the district was made subject to any tax imposed for build 
school houses. A closer supervision of school funds was provi 
and the township treasurer was required to distribute the reve 
of his township among the districts in proportion to the num 
of children between the ages of five and twenty-one years. 
The legitimate fruits of this ill-conceived system of dist 
schools were shown to be: (1) inequality in the length of 
school terms, in the efficiency ‘of schools, and in the cost of the m: 
tenance of schools within the same township; (2) a greater 
pensiveness, because of the multiplicity of officers and the ¢ 
tinuance of small schools; (3) incompetency of teachers, beca 
of frequent changes and partiality and favoritism in their selecti 
(4) inefficiency in instruction, because of diversity of text-bo 
and difficulty in grading and classifying pupils; (5) laxity in 
enforcement of school laws, because of the absence of supervis 
and the ignorance and indifference of the petty school offic 
(6) wasteful administration of public school funds and revent 
(7) neighborhood quarrels over the sites of buildings and bou 
aries of districts; (8) narrow and selfish views as to the end: 
public instruction.t All this was the outgrowth of an exaggere 
idea of the virtues of local self-government. 
During the seven years prior to 1843, the unfavorable condi 
of school affairs received most serious consideration by the leac 
educators and statesmen. It is evident from the speeches and 
dresses of prominent men and from the reports of officers | 
legislative committees that the most intelligent opinion was 
favor of some attempt at a centralized system. The revelati 
made by these utterances finally moved the legislators to act 
We find in the revised school law of 1843 an important step tow:

subject of schools, declared that the existing plan “‘ scarce deserves the nai 
system.” ‘‘Itis a multitude of systems, having no accountability to each o 
or to any higher powers.” ‘‘We present almost the only example of a

the State was declared by law to be the Superintendent of 
nmon Schools. His duties were chiefly financial and statistical. 
authority to direct the educational policy was given him. How- 
r, the first thing necessary to develop a satisfactory school sys- 
. was to secure full, reliable and accurate information as to 
ds, revenues, schools and children of school age. A beginning 
his direction was made by this act. 
‘his material advance towards centralization was attended 
a considerable degree of local centralization. In the absence 
instructions by the district meeting, the district trustee was 
owered to contract with a teacher. He also was given author- 
to determine what branches should bé taught. Taxes levied 
the district meeting were thereafter to be assessed and collected 
county officers and not by district officers. Much more impor- 
was the requirement that any such tax should be assessed upon 
he taxable property of the district, except that of negroes and 
attoes who were not entitled to the privileges of the schools. 
lursuant to the recommendation of the General Assembly 
its thirty-first session a “Convention of the Friends of the 
mon Schools” met at Indianapolis May 26, 1847. Its com- 
ees drafted a bill to provide for the improvement of common 
ols and an address to the people. The report accompanying 
bill was very exhaustive in its review of the situation of the 
ols and school funds. In the address to the people it was stated 
in 1847 one-seventh of the people over twenty years of age 
neither read nor write; that 30,000 voters in Indiana were 
rate; and that the annual expenditure for education was only 
t $125,000. The only important act of the General Assembly 
is time was a law submitting to a popular vote the question 
support of the common schools by general taxation. The 
t of the vote was in favor of State-established, State-supported 
State-controlled schools. 
e Legislature soon afterwards proceeded to enact a law which 
greater security to school funds and greater accuracy to re-

The number of trustees in each district was reduced from 
to one. Besides attending to the business of the district, 
rustee was made “the organ of communication between the

sts of his district.” In addition, he was required to make

THE DISTRICT UNIT AND THE DISTRICT SYSTEM 
Tue nature and essential features of the district system of 
thool administration can be seen from the following citations 
and illustrative extracts from the school laws, and quotations 
m those who may be regarded as authorities. 
        
    
     
   
    
   I. Formation oF Districts, AND ALTERATION OF 
BounpDARIES 
The school laws in all district-system states provide means 
creating new school districts and altering district boundaries. 
e proceedings are often quite detailed, and must almost of 
cessity be so when the district unit of taxation is involved. 
pical and illustrative methods can be found by looking up 
d comparing the legal procedure in the following states: 
Missouri. A slow and an unnecessarily cumbersone method. 
(See Missouri School Laws (1913 Ed.), Sec. 10,837, and 
the Supreme Court decisions following the sections.) 
CauirorniA. A better method, but with the initiative resting 
wholly with the districts. (See California School Laws, 
Art. V., Secs. 1577-1579, and 1543.) 
(Texas. A much better method, with the initiative resting 
with either side. (See School Laws of Texas (1913), Secs. 
103-105.) EW YorK. The initiative resting with the county educa- 
tional authorities. (See New York Education Law, Art. 5.) 
EorGIA. A simple and effective method. (See School Laws 
of Georgia, Part III.) 
10. An almost equally simple and effective method. (See 
Ohio School Laws, Secs. 3921 and 3923, and Forms and In- 
structions, VIII and XVIII.)

This institution once played a very important part in distri 
school organization, and still remains strong in a few stat 
New York is agood example. This state is one in which Ne 
England traditions still remain strong, and where the tow 
meeting idea still prevails. The powers still retained by t 
annual school meeting are large, while many of the matte 
which the people are called upon to vote are of such a natu 
that they could be settled more easily if left to the distri 
trustees for determination, or settled once for all by unifo1 
state law. Progress must necessarily be slow under such 
system. (See New York Education Law, 1914, Art. 7.) 
Other illustrations of the Annual Meeting, arranged in a sc 
of decreasing importance, may be found, as follows:    
     
    
        
    
   
   1. Arkansas. Annual meeting required; large powers; and 
the matter of maintaining a school extraordinary. ( 
Arkansas School Laws, Secs. 7588-7592.) 
2. Inprana. Subdistrict meetings only; limited powers. 
School Law of Indiana (1911 Ed.), Chap. VII, 
125-127.) 
8. CatirorniA. Meeting only occasional, on call; powers v 
limited; meeting approaching extinction. (See Se 
Law of California, Art. VII, Sec. 1617, subdiv. 20.) 
4. Inunors. Meeting for election of trustees, and receiving 
annual report only. (See School Law of Illinois (1909 Re}

school meeting has disappeared, other methods must be 
ployed, of which election and appointment are the common oJ 
California is a good illustration of the former, and Georgi 
the latter.

Vhile the powers and duties of boards of school trustees, or 
»0l directors, vary much in the different states employing 
district system, the different states may nevertheless be 
sified roughly as (1) States in which the district trustees 
sess large powers, and (2) States in which the district 
tees possess rather limited powers. Colorado, Kansas, 
ois, and Washington are examples of the first type, and 
bama, Georgia, Maryland, and West Virginia of the second 
e. As illustrative of these two types the laws for Illinois 
Alabama are reproduced.

CoMMENTS ON THE District SysteM BY SCHOOL OFFICERS 
robably no feature of the American public school system 
been so condemned by school officers and for so long as 
the district system, yet so great is the conservatism of the 
1 population that progress in substituting a larger unit of 
ol administration has been very slow. The literature of 
ation contains many excellent articles, comments, and 
esses which forcefully reveal the wastefulness and inade- 
y of the district unit; we reproduce here only a few of 
ost pertinent of these. Additional comments and opinions

1. Some Needed Legislation in Kentucky 
[By Supt. M. A. Cassidy, of Lexington.] 
[A paper which did much to secure the abolition of the distri 
system in Kentucky. Though written with only a local proble 
in mind, much that it contains is general in its application. R 
printed from the Bien. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr. Ky., 1903-19( 
pp. 25-32.] 
The most important reform needed in our school system is t 
abolition of the district as the unit of school government, and t 
substitution therefore of the county. There are many other refort 
that could be urged, but the county as the unit is the educatio: 
kingdom of heaven most to be desired at this time. When thi 
obtained, all the other good things will be added unto it. Ot 
reforms, without this, would be like putting new cloth into 
garments, or new wine into old bottles. 
The school district is an artificial unit, measured by the len; 
of a child’s legs, and established for a single and special purp 
Consequently the schools of Kentucky are governmental oute 
bearing no relation to the county government, which, for ev 
other function is the only recognized unit. Therefore, instead 
the uniform system enjoined by the Constitution, Kentucky 
8,330. independent schools, controlled by 24,990 trustees, with 
unity of purpose and with no proper conception of the aim 
scope of popular education. * * * 
I have no words of abuse for school trustees. Many 
them are honest and honorable men. But, in selecting 25, 
officers for any administrative function, it is folly to expect t! 
many of them should have an intelligent conception of the du 
to be performed. The duties of school officials are peculiar, 
require men of culture, business acumen, high aims for hu 
progress, and capacity for intelligent leadership. But the 
vailing sentiment in a majority of districts is that anybody 
do for school trustee. * * * 
Only a small number of the nearly 25,000 school officials w! 
our present system demands, desire to hold the positions. Sc’ 
trustee is one office in Kentucky that goes a-begging. Not 
third of the 8,330 districts ever hold an election. The best 
will not offer for the positions, and the best men will not go to

ls, unless there is a row in the district over a teacher or a 
ool tax. Nor are good men to be censured for refusing to hold 
office of this character. It is a disagreeable and pestiferous 
sition, which brings the holder neither thanks nor emoluments. 
e school district is so small that few men care to incur the dis- 
asure of their friends and neighbors in trying to perform the 
ties required of school trustees. The most necessary tax imposed 
trustees upon the district is nearly always regarded as an impo- 
on, and those who attempt to collect it as impostors. If a 
ghbor has a kinswoman who desires to keep school long enough 
purchase a bridal outfit, and the trustees, out of regard for the 
t interests of the children, see fit to ignore her claims and 
ploy a real teacher, there immediately spring up the two warring 
tions, and every educational interest in the district suffers. 
u would as well attempt to push a mule over a cliff as to try to 
- these men, who wished to do their duty, to serve a second term. 
is an office that good men do not desire, and, when no elections 
held, the county superintendent is almost subjected to the 
essity of getting a search warrant to find men who will serve. 
peak from an experience of twenty years. 
There are some who cling to the district system because, they 
ert, it is the most democratic form of school government. On 
contrary, it is the most autocratic. Because of an almost 
eral failure to elect school trustees, the Superintendent must 
joint a majority of them. When an election is held, the vote is, 
no means, an indication of the popular will. I have known 
es of elections where five votes were recorded, and many where 
two officers and the candidate were the only voters. The school 
rict is democracy gone to seed, a worthless inheritance from 
ssachusetts, from whose system our own was copied nearly 
nty-five years ago. But Massachusetts, after a disastrous 
rience similar to our own, discarded their system many years 
and one of her distinguished sons, Horace Mann, has declared 
the school district is the “greatest blunder in the whole his- 
of educational legislation.” There is neither wisdom nor 
ocracy in it. * * * 
s a taxing unit the school district is an egregious failure. 
about $30,000 are annually collected in 8,330 districts to 
y the incidental expenses of the schools. This is an average 
nly $3.60 to the school. * * * Only about $75,000 are 
ally collected in Kentucky to extend the school term beyond 
onths. Nearly the whole of this sum is collected in small 
s, such as Versailles, Lawrenceburg, Williamstown, and many 
‘3 like them that comprise one district of the county. Very

i i   198 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
little of it is expended on rural schools. In the entire Comm 
wealth, counting all of the unclassified towns and villages, there. 
only 675 schools whose terms extend over six months. Sixty-th 
of these are in Mason County, where, by a special Act of the Le; 
lature, under the old Constitution, this county was made the tax 
unit for school purposes. This leaves 7,667 schools in the st 
with only six months or less. Six months of learning, and six 
forgetting! What a commentary on education in Kentucky un 
the district system! This is not because Kentuckians are p 
urious or that they are opposed to common schools; but becau 
under the district system, they behold such poor returns from - 
more than two millions that are annually expended on their sche 
by the Commonwealth that they do not care to waste more 
local taxation. * * * 
Now the question naturally arises in every inquiring mir 
what is better for Kentucky than the district system? 
The answer may be briefly given: Let the district as the u 
of school government be abolished, and, instead, make the cou 
the unit. And why would this be a better system for Kentuck 
* * * For the same reason that the town is best for Mas 
chusetts, and the township for Indiana. The county is Kentuck 
governmental unit. Since she became a state she has known 
other, and by making the county the unit for popular educat 
the rural schools will be elevated to the dignity and importa 
of other governmental functions. Then the rural schools, wh 
two-thirds of Kentucky’s children must be educated, will be cl 
to and more in harmony with the government from which t 
draw their sustenance, and by such a unification of educati 
interests in each county their affairs would be more intellige: 
and economically administered. * * * 
By making the county the unit of school government, it is obvi 
that its citizens would manifest the same interest in the admi 
tration of its schools that is nowhad in other governmental functi 
County pride and a natural desire to get the best for their m 
expended would insure this. For proof look at the cities of 
Commonwealth. Here the city is the unit of school govern: 
Jefferson County, with a school population of about 8,000, is 
ministered by about 300 trustees, while Louisville, with a sel 
population of nearly 60,000, has a school board composed o; 
representative citizens. There is, of course, no comparison 
tween the schools of Louisville and Jefferson County. The 
thing is true of Lexington, Newport, Covington, Owensboro 
other cities. In the cities the best citizens are selected by 
entire municipality to control the schools, and the whole city

butes to their support. All the children have equal advantages, 
d the success and prosperity of the urban-schools are the pride 
its citizenship. The wealthiest wards are made to help bear 
e educational burdens of the poorest, and so all have equal school 
vantages. 
But under the district system the rural schools are, in a large 
sasure, dependent upon the support and guidance of small com- 
nities that have little conception of the methods by which 
od schools are made. Petty jealousies and neighborhood dissen- 
ms are reflected in their management. Untoward influences 
at would be unimportant in wider areas, distract their councils 
d destroy their usefulness. Because of the absence of a central 
trolling body, such as a county board of education, and the 
ponsibility consequent to such a body, the schoolhouses are the 
rest sheds; equipments are makeshifts or are wholly lacking; 
re are, perhaps, six months of learning and certainly six of 
getting; the selection of teachers is in the hands of men who 
e little or no conception of what a teacher should be; com- 
ency and teaching ability do not assure stability of position; 
plementary aid is regarded as extortion; and, indeed, in name 
have we a rural system of schools in Kentucky. 
id why would the schools of Kentucky be better adminis- 
d by making the county the unit instead of the district? 
ply because there would be a concentration of authority and 
onsibility in their management. There are, under our present 
em, an average of 210 school officials to the county. Under 
county system there would be an average of five or six. Even 
dullest can see that, in this wider area, it would be easier to 
ict a school board of this limited number who would have and 
Id manifest an interest in popular education, than it would 
lo secure 210 men of the same character. And, too, it is equally 
ious that, since this board would be elected by the whole mu- 
ality, the electors would hold them to a strict accountability 
he successful administration of the schools, as other officials 
held in the administration of other county affairs. * * * 
something is not done to give the country people better 
ols, the time will come when the best of our rural population 
crowd into our cities. This would be disastrous to the agri- 
ral interests of our Commonwealth. The liberal education 
e farmer’s child in the country is the probable salvation of 
arming interests. We cannot get away from the fact that the 
er’s child must be made an intelligent citizen, not only content 
ay on the farm if that is best, but fitted to fill honorably and 
igently any station in life. To do this he must have every 
   
-P-A-G-E-222
  200 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
possible opportunity of education and culture that is accorded 
the city child. We must rid ourselves of the idea that the count 
school is a literary poorhouse. There is nothing too good for t 
country child. Nearly every man who has made illustrious ¢ 
nation’s history was born and reared on the farm. The cradles 
most of our Presidents were rocked by country mothers. 
~ I am convinced that, if the county be made the unit of sch 
government, it will be the greatest blessing that could be bestow 
on the people of rural Kentucky. It will give them 119 sche 
districts instead of 8,330. It will reduce the great army of neai 
25,000 inefficient school officials to about 500, who can be ma 
as efficient as are the boards of education that manage the schor 
of the cities. 
2. Auditing District Accounts 
By the Superintendent of Public Instruction of Michigan. 
(71st An. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr. Mich., 1907, pp. 58-57.) 
The law authorizing the Superintendent of Public Instructi 
to audit accounts of school districts is of recent date. It has, h 
ever, already justified itself. Before it had become operative th 
were requests for an auditor from several districts, and as it 
become more generally known that such a law exists, the calls h: 
increased far beyond our ability to respond, there being no on 
this department who can give the matter his whole attenti 
The many requests show however that there is much dissatisfac' 
with the present method of accounting for public funds. 
The carelessness and negligence, disregard and ignorance 
the plain letter of the law with reference to accounting for pul 
moneys is surprising and altogether too common. Someti 
officers do not so much as read the laws under which they 
supposed to be operating, to say nothing of following such | 
nor is this condition confined to the school districts. In m 
cases it has been necessary to consult the books of the town: 
before the district accounts could be audited. Oftentimes 
data needed could not be found in the township officer’s bi 
until these books had been audited and proper corrections 
additions made. Sometimes it has been necessary even to go t 
books of the county treasurer for data that should be found i 
township treasurer’s books. This would not be the conditi 
the township books were kept in accordance with the forms 
contain, 2.e., if each account were kept under its proper fun| 
head. In some cases the various columns for the proper dat 
ignored and the whole of the moneys ‘bunched’ and paid o 
      
           
    
      
       
      
-P-A-G-E-223
HE DISTRICT UNIT AND THE DISTRICT SYSTEM 201 
haphazard manner, some funds thus becoming over paid, while 
hers are made to suffer a shortage of money in some special 
e for which it was voted. * * * 
This neglect is generally because of ignorance of the law, but 
some cases it is to cover up the illegal use of the funds that 
ie been diverted to some purpose not voted by the people, or 
a few cases used in the private business of the officer, or stolen. 
‘tentimes the “statements” made cover a misuse of funds in 
ain violation of the expressed prohibitions of the statutes. The 
dinary tax-payer, unless he is willing to stand as a “knocker,” 
id besides being somewhat ignorant of his rights in the case, sits 
ent and goes away from the annual meeting, dissatisfied with 
tters. 
In some cases the district board takes it upon themselves to 
ke the repairs voted by the district, and allow themselves such 
ges as they choose, and in some cases they have gone so far as 
build a schoolhouse, because ‘the district had voted that the 
trict build a schoolhouse,’ all in direct violation of the direct 
visions of the law. And sometimes the term ‘incidentals’ 
ers an actual embezzlement of district funds. * * * 
Frequently all warrants, orders and receipts are destroyed 
ler a settlement is made with the proper officers, leaving the 
asurer and the clerk without any original documents of defense 
case of an investigation into the financial affairs of the town- 
or district; the books may be produced, but they are not 
clusive. It is the indorsed warrants and orders, and the 
ipts that really show how money has been expended. Treas- 
s of both townships and school districts should forbid the de- 
ction of any of the original documents of their administrations. 
‘rom the above facts and the experience gained in auditing dis- 
it accounts, it is my opinion that each county should have an aud- 
whose duty it should be to audit the books of townships and 
ol districts annually ; also that the laws should be so amended 
one of the qualifications for holding the office of treasurer 
Id be the ability to read the English language, and write it 
ly. 
e violations of the laws in handling school funds and account- 
or the same are usually along some of the following lines : 
rst. School moneys are not kept separate from other moneys. 
is in violation of section 1198 of the general school laws. 
cond. The school moneys are often used by the treasurer and 
times by other members of the board for their own purposes. 
e officers have no thought of defrauding the district, but it is 
convenient when some ready money is needed to use some of       
   
    
     
     
   
     
   
    
      
    
    
 
-P-A-G-E-224
       202 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION ft 
the school money which will not be needed for school purposes. 
many districts have a large amount of money on hand which cant 
be used for school purposes, the money is not returned to the tre 
ury; instead more is used. Again and again this happens until 1 
officer finds it quite impossible to reimburse the district when he 
called upon to do so. The result in several districts has be 
criminal proceedings against the officers. * * * 
Third. The money is sometimes loaned to some friend or ¢ 
poration; sometimes the district votes to loan its surplus funds 
a real estate mortgage. In both of the above cases the law is v 
lated. The district cannot go into the loaning business, even 
it has a large surplus of cash on hand. 
Fourth. The money is sometimes used for other purposes th 
those prescribed by law; the primary school interest fund, whi 
can legally be used for teachers’ wages only, has in many distri 
been used for all purposes; the one-mill tax money has also be 
used contrary to the express provisions of the law. In no case ¢ 
the primary money be diverted legally from the teachers’-wa; 
fund; the one-mill tax can, however, by a vote of the district, 
used for other purposes, after a district has had in any school yj 
eight months of school. In no other way can any of this fund 
used for other purposes than teachers’ wages. Occasionally mo: 
voted for a certain purpose has been diverted to some other 
pose and so covered in the accounting that the ordinary per| 
cannot discover the discrepancy ; again, interest that has been 
by banks has been kept by the officers, contrary to law, such 
terest being the property of the district; and again, money 
been voted by the district board for purposes not authorize 
law, and the district kept in ignorance of the fact. 
Fifth. In a few cases officers have deliberately defrauded 
district, using the money of the district for private busi 
making no attempt to replace the same, and deliberately falsif 
the district accounts and the annual report to this depart: 
A common method of defrauding the district is for two perso 
the same family or the same ilk to secure the offices of trea: 
and director of the district board. Then these officers pre 
bills for real or fancied services. Two of the officers bei 
the same family they pass upon the bills favorably and have 
allowed, an order is drawn for the payment of the same and 
presented to the moderator for his signature is signed by him r: 
than have any trouble about the matter; quite likely he is bi 
by being allowed to do some work about the school grounds 
furnishing some wood or ‘supplies,’ real or fancied, at an ext 
gant price, another illegal act.     
      
    
        
   
    
   
        
    
-P-A-G-E-225

Sixth. Often the cause for errors is the failure to understand the 
irious funds as designated by law. To make this matter clear a 
ulletin has been prepared by this department and distributed 
nong school officers. This classifies the funds and gives their 
urces and the purpose for which each fund may be used. 
Seventh. Another cause for errors in accounting for school 
nds is a misunderstanding of the powers and duties of the school 
ficers and taxpayers. Certain taxes are voted by the district, 
id certain others by the school board. Officers have sometimes 
ken advantage of their right to vote taxes by voting a much 
rger amount than will be needed, and then diverting the surplus 
some other use than that for which the money was assessed. .* * * 
The financial reports of district officers have been corrected so 
r in 1,342 districts, seattered through over 70 counties of the State. 
ese corrections were as follows :    
    
    
    
           
       
    
   . For incorrect report of primary money received. . 653

incorrect report of wages paid, amounts due the district, 
failure to account for all the funds in the treasurer’s hands —_ 337 
Total corrections in the above 1,342 districts . . . 1530 
n addition to the above there have been many cases in which 
ary interest money and one-mill tax money have been illegally 
id, also many cases of officers being paid for services which they 
Id not legally perform for pay, such as labor on the buildings 
grounds, furnishing fuel, ete. 
here have been a few cases of defalcation which are at present 
g prosecuted by the Attorney General. 
nearly every case in which money has been illegally used we 
le succeeded in having it replaced in the district treasury. 
se amounts vary from a few dollars in some districts to over 
in others. 
(Later comment, by the same official) 
3rd An. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr. Mich., 1909-1910, pp. 7-8) 
luring the past year the records and accounts of nearly 100 
icts in the state have been audited and the books corrected. 
lvery case examined irregularities were found to exist, but in 
cases they were unintentional, as was shown by the fact that 
 
-P-A-G-E-226

they had ceased after the School of Instruction for school offic 
in that particular county. In these cases the officers were high 
pleased with the results achieved in these meetings, and we 
anxious that others should be held in the near future. 
The violations of the law most frequently found and whi 
appear to have been almost universal in the districts examined we 
the purchasing of school, building, and other supplies from t! 
officers of the districts by the board and the hiring of school office 
for miscellaneous work connected with the school, for which th 
were paid by the day. 
Shortages were discovered in 18 districts ranging from a fe 
dollars to over $5000, but in each case these amounts were replace! 
by either the treasurer or his bondsman without the loss of a ce 
to the district concerned. On the other hand district treasure 
who have been charged with'the unlawful use of school funds ha’ 
asked to have their books audited, and a thorough examination 
their books and records has resulted in clearing them of the charg 
In several cases interest received on school funds and misapp1 
priated by the treasurer has been recovered, and the benefice 
effect of this fact upon the treasurers of one county was sho’ 
by the fact that other treasurers of the same county afterw: 
went to the county commissioner and voluntarily acknowled, 
that they had misappropriated interest on school funds, sta 
the amount, and immediately deposited the same to the credit 
the district. 
Another violation of the law which was found in several distrij 
was the loaning of school funds to private individuals-on notes 
mortgages. This was done in some instances by the district 
annual meetings, in others by the district board, and in still ot! 
by the treasurer himself. All such loans with accrued inte! 
were immediately recalled and the funds replaced. 
Numerous disputes between districts have been settled and 
tricts which have through improper use of the funds on hand bJ 
deprived of their apportionment of the primary school fund h 
had their books audited, their balance on hand properly divi 
into the several funds, and the reports corrected so that in 
future they will receive their share of the primary apportionm| 
Investigation has shown that in too many cases the dis 
treasurer depends upon the district director to keep the acco 
of the district, and that he does not properly protect himsel: 
keeping a correct and complete account of all moneys received 
paid out by himself. The records of the treasurer should be 
cea with those of the director, so that they may be easily 
pared.

3. Waste in Education 
upt. Francis G.* Blair, in 28th Bien. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr., 
Illinois, 1908-1910, pp. 503-505.] 
Another source of waste in the educational system is in the 
anner of its administration. The school system of Illinois 
msists of the taxable property of the tax payers, of the 45,000 
hool officers elected or appointed by the people to represent 
em, of the 28,000 teachers who stand in the school rooms day 
er day and administer to the wants of the children, of the 
lousands of principals and superintendents in the cities and high 
ools, of 102 county superintendents, and of a State Superin- 
dent of Public Instruction. This in a rough, general way is 
administrative side of the public school system. It is easy to 
that in such a vast system, expending $32,000,000 annually 
its maintenance, and administered by such a great army of 
cers there are endless opportunities for leakage and waste. 
e duplication of officers, the overlapping of authority, the con- 
of duties and functions, the opportunities for neglect of duty 
of responsibility, all these show us readily that here is a phase 
the management of the common schools which needs the careful 
ention of every believer in the system and of those who make 
laws which govern it. 
‘he Educational Commission is recommending several measures 
ich have to do with the administrative side of the public school 
tem. One of these is a State Board of Education, which, in 
nection with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
ll in a certain sense have a large supervisory function over the 
ire system of the State. It is difficult to enter into such detail 
ould be necessary to set forth the need of such a board. It 
laimed, however, for it, that such a board made up of dis- 
uished citizens of the State, interested in the economic admin- 
lation of this great school force, interested in providing for the 
dren of the State the largest school opportunity at the least cost 
he State, would be a movement in the direction of preventing 
te in the common school system. The commission is con- 
ed that one of the best means of preventing waste is to 
mgthen the office of city superintendent and county super- 
mdent. In every great business enterprise it has been dis- 
red that a superintendent who directs the activities of the 
men, who, through advice and counsel, helps them to work 
armony rather than antagonistic to each other, is one of the 
it valuable officials in the entire system. So in the public school 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
       206 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
° 
system, it is believed that the city and county superintendents a 
officers who should serve the large purposes of avoiding ove 
lapping and duplication in school work and school facilities, w 
can prevent conflict and waste in the instruction and who can 
organize and direct the activities of the school under their char 
as to bring forth the maximum of efficiency with a minimum 
cost to the community. The commission is recommending a bh 
providing that after a year or two of trial the city superintende 
shall be elected for a term of four years. This will give him : 
opportunity to mature his policies and to effect the desirable en 
which we have suggested briefly. Perhaps the most import: 
officer in the public school system is the county superintende 
The 10,613 single-room schools and the small village and to 
schools of the State are dependent upon the county superintend 
for their success. It is he who, through his counsel, through 
plans, through his course of study, through his work with 
teachers, secures efficiency, avoids waste, and insures a reasonal 
degree of success in these schools. The commission is recomme! 
ing a reclassification of the counties of the State, a new scale 
salaries, with a provision for the employment of assistants where 
needed to strengthen the influence of the county superintende 
Another administrative reform which is offered respects th 
single-room schools. The Educational Commission is thoroug! 
convinced that in a great agricultural State like Illinois the sin, 
room school was a necessity from the beginning and will conti 
to be a necessity so long as such a large part of the State is gi 
over to agricultural pursuits. But it cannot close its eyes to 
fact that many of these little schools were established without 
most careful consideration and that many of them which 
largely attended when they were first established have reac! 
such a low attendance as to make their continuance a financial 
educational waste. From 1901-1907 the enrollment in the 
graded schools of Illinois decreased to the extent of 47,000. 
easy to understand the meaning of this. The movement from 
agricultural regions to the towns and the cities is continuing 
many of these little schools which, in the past, had a suffic 
attendance to warrant their continuance can no longer be just 
on the grounds of economy or of educational need. Up to my o| 
within the last year came a letter containing this sort of a ques 
It was written by a director in whose home the teacher was bo 
ing. He said we have just two pupils enrolled in our school. 
of them has been sick for a month and the other does not at; 
regularly. The teacher wants to know whether, in order to 
her daily wage, she must go to the school each morning at

clock, even though she knows that neither one will be present, 
id if she goes at nine in the morning, must she go back at one in 
1e afternoon to see whether either one has come, in order to draw 
sr wages. Of course this is an unusual and extreme case, the only 
1e I know of, but it suggests one of the large leaks in the common 
hool system of Illinois, an expenditure of money that cannot be 
stified upon any ground of educational need or expediency. 
Je have over a hundred schools in Hlinois with a smaller enroll- 
ent than five. I do not believe that the continuance of these 
hools can be justified upon any grounds. In order to avoid the 
aste that comes from the constant depletion of attendance upon 
lese single-room schools the Educational Commission is recom- 
ending a bill which is called the township enabling act, providing 
means whereby the rural schools of a township may unite the 
mtrol and management of these schools under one board of 
rectors. There are over 500 townships in Illinois composed 
olly of rural schools. It is believed that a great financial saving 
uld be effected and that a great increase in the efficiency of the 
struction brought about by an arrangement which would place 
lese several schools under the control of one board which should 
elected by the people of these several districts. The financial 
le of it appeals to me strongly. It is possible in a township to 
lve a great deal of the property in the form of railroads or other 
ge corporations centered in one or two of the districts, where they 
taxed to support the schools of those districts, while the remain- 
portions of the township receive no benefit whatever from the 
sence of these corporations. I am informed by the county 
erintendent of Lawrence county that in one township there is a 
rict in which the oil companies have erected all their oil tanks, 
s accumulating a great amount of taxable property within one 
rict. There are five other school districts within the township. 
one in which these oil tanks have been placed levied last year 
x of one-fifteenth of one per cent and raised $2,500, more than 
as much as was needed to run the schools of that district, 
not another one of the districts in the township got any benefit 
ttever from the presence of these oil tanks in the township. 
lieve that there is a good argument in favor of this equalization 
axes, but I know that Superintendent Conn, of McHenry 
ty, has presented this argument to you as he has prepared the 
argument on that side of the question which has been offered 
e State of Illinois. In the purchasing of the supplies for the 
ral schools, employing the teachers, keeping the buildings in 
ir, supplying them with proper books and apparatus, I believe 
this central board would administer the several schools of the

township with greater economy and with greater efficiency tha 
when they are managed by these separate boards of directors. If 
board of directors were placed in charge of several rural schools « 
the township and it was discovered that one of these schools ha 
fallen below five in attendance, this central board could do as boar 
in the cities do, say to the parents of these children: “This scho 
has ceased to be profitable and we cannot afford to employ a sey 
arate teacher for this school. We shall have to ask your childre 
to go to a certain other school within the township. We shall n 
discontinue the school, but we shall close it up until we are assure 
that there are enough children to attend it to make it worth whi 
from the standpoint of economy and education to open up tl 
school again.” It seems to me that this township enabling a 
can be made a large influence in stopping the waste in our rur: 
schools. 
4. A Larger Unit of School Organization 
[Supt. Fairchild, in 18th Bien. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr., Kas., 191 
1912, pp. 19-21]      
     
    
    
      
     The present unit of school administration is the district, 
which in this state there are 8718. This means that, with t! 
14,000 teachers, we have an army of between 25,000 and 30,0 
school officers to administer the public-school affairs. The c 
of the maintenance of our schools amounts annually to more th 
eleven million dollars. 
Viewed as a business proposition, the financial management 
our schools ranks with the big enterprises of the day in importan 
In no other big business do we find such lack of organization prev: 
ing with respect to the collection and disbursement of funds. 
is evident that the district system is out of touch with mod 
business methods. Not only does the present system insure 
necessary extravagance and actual waste of funds, but it is ine’ 
tive in a still more important detail. Because of this vast am 
of school officials, selected often at random and without regar 
special fitness for the administration of school affairs, there ij 
complete lack of codrdination and unity of effort. There can b 
solidarity of purpose nor unity of action under such a system. 
Many weaknesses that inhere in our rural schools of to-day 
due to the district system. The consensus of opinion, as expre: 
by students of this important subject, is that the ideal school 
of organization is the county, that the next best is that of 
township; while the poorest, the least effective, is the district. 
In the county system, which prevails in several states of
-P-A-G-E-231
  HE DISTRICT UNIT AND THE DISTRICT SYSTEM 209 
nion, a single board administers the affairs of the schools. Cities 
Wing a certain specified population are generally exempt from the 
thority of the county board. These are classed as independent 
stricts. The affairs of the rural schools are administered by a 
angle board consisting of five or seven members, elected at large. 
ich a board is able to reduce materially the cost of the upkeep of 
ese schools, since they are able to buy the needed equipment and 
pplies, such as coal, maps, globes, charts, etc., at wholesale. In 
e matter of coal alone it is apparent that a great saving could be 
fected to the districts if the purchase were made in the manner 
dicated. The county board selects the teachers, and by and 
ith the advice of the county superintendent puts into operation 
uniform system of administration, secures uniform courses of 
udy and that unity of aim and action on the part of all the 
hools that is so necessary to the highest success. 
A most serious evil in our present district system is the great 
wiation in the valuation of taxable property among the various 
stricts. At present one district rich in valuation maintains an 
cellent school for seven or more months each year upon a very 
w tax levy. The adjoining district, because of a low valuation, 
forced to make an extremely high levy to maintain school even 
r the minimum term. Under the county system the budget is 
ade up by the county board and the taxes are levied upon the 
tire county and distributed in an equitable manner. 
The proposed system is sometimes objected to on the score that it 
undemocratic; that it removes from the people the last vestige 
popular government. This reasoning does not appear to be 
md. For in the district system it is to be noted that the number 
patrons that attend the annual meeting is very small; that 
‘ough them a body of directors is chosen, and to this body is 
egated the powers belonging to the people of the district. The 
n for a larger unit does exactly the same thing, with this dif- 
lence: that a board chosen for the purposes mentioned, and hay- 
the responsibility of the administration of the educational 
irs of the entire county, is certain to be selected with more care. 
le county unit does not contemplate the destruction of the present 
‘icts, but allows them to remain as they are. A local repre- 
tative is chosen for each district to look after the buildings and 
otify the board of needed supplies. 
t is not my purpose to discuss at length this important subject. 
gislative committee of ten is considering and studying carefully 
problem of the larger unit of school organization, and will 
ent to the legislature their recommendations based upon the 
lence secured. I have discussed this problem with many

V. Rurat ScHoou' Conprtions; Disrricr System 
Rural School Conditions. —Our present district system and 1 
ease with which boundary lines may be changed are responsi! 
for a multitude of ills. Districts are irregular in shape, and uneq 
in size, population and wealth. Anxiety to be near the sch 
house has caused the formation of numerous new districts, ur 
many are too small and too weak to support good schools. 
district financially weak means high taxes, short term, low wag 
poor school. There are districts in the same county — sometin 
they are adjoining — the valuations varying from a maximum 
$50,000 to $150,000 ; to a minimum of $6,000 to $10,000. The « 
on a ten-cent levy is able to employ a good teacher for a term 
eight or nine months; the other with a sixty-five cent levy is unc 
the necessity of letting a four-months’ term to the lowest bidd 
‘These conditions seriously impede progress. 
Inequalities in school population are in keeping with other 
equalities, but the larger number of pupils does not always belo 
to the wealthier district. In fact, many districts of less th 
average valuation are under the necessity of maintaining two scho 
—one for negro children. There are many districts, some of th 
financially weak, in which the enumeration is 70 to 100 child: 
and the attendance 50 to 75. Others, some of them wealt 
enumerate 15 to 25 children, and 10 to 15 go to school. The sch 
unit as now constituted is responsible for these conditions. 
fear that very little change for the better can ever be made unt 
different organization is effected. — Supt. L. J. Hall, in 51st 
State School Rept., 1900, p. 91. 
Types of School Boards.—Members of school boards should h 
a two-fold qualification: business training, and a knowledg 
educational work. This naturally presupposes at least ordi 
intelligence. The school directors supervise all of the work of 
teachers, select ext-books, and, to a certain extent, dictate 
course of study. In addition to this they make all contr 
build and equip schoolhouses, and have sole charge of valu 
property. Yet there are a few Secretaries in the State who cai 
write their names, there are a number of Treasurers who cai

id a column of figures, and there are Presidents unacquainted 
th the English language. It is not surprising that county super- 
tendents find it impossible to secure records, and that county 
2asurers are puzzled in their efforts to balance accounts. 
They have more authority than the county superintendent or the 
ate superintendent, and, under present laws, the taxpayers have 
. redress in most cases of flagrant mismanagement. A director 
y be removed for malfeasance in office, but relief through the 
rts is slow. A school board may disregard the law and enjoy 
rious illegal perquisites without the least fear of any serious con- 
uences. — Biennial Report Supt. Publ. Instr. Colo., 1897-1898,

    The District Treasurer. — In many districts the election of school 
asurer arouses more interest than the election of director, yet 
s a useless office as far as administration of the schools is con- 
med. A very great deal depends upon the man elected director. 
not infrequently occurs that the election of director hinges 
nm whom he will support for treasurer, or what bank he favors, 
rder that some one or some bank may have the use of the school 
ds on deposit without interest. No such business methods are 
itted concerning other public funds. 
Vhy should $5,000,000 of school funds be handled to the advan- 
of private interests ? 
‘he funds would be safer in the hands of the county treasurers on 
unt of the better methods of bookkeeping and the methods of 
ing semi-annual settlements with those officers. Most of the 
ties in the state could handle the payment of school warrants 
ctly through the county treasurers without any additional 
nse to the county. — State Supt. Deyoe, in Bien. Rept. Dept. 
J. Instr. Iowa, 1911-1912, p. 29-30. 
lwmber of School Officers. — Under our laws nearly 25,000 men 
lected as school officers, and to them is committed directly 
are of the public schools. I do not care at this time to discuss 
ropriety or the necessity of such a large number of men to 
after the welfare of about 7000 school districts, but it is clear 
observer that each school district is practically a law unto 
, and that school affairs are managed in one district without any 
nce whatever to the welfare or the desires of an adjoining 
unity. This may be perfectly proper under ideas of local 
overnment, but in my judgment it is to the detriment of 
hildren who attend the public schools and for whose benefit 
ic schools exist. Too many school boards in their management
-P-A-G-E-234
  212 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
of affairs seem to think that the public school exists solely that th 
may hold an office, or for their especial benefit. This is a mistal 
and the disastrous results which we sometimes see, when sch¢ 
boards maintain this attitude, warrant the people in quickly « 
stroying the power not only of the board but of the individual me 
bers, so far as they may come in contact with the schools. — Su

   Small and Unnecessary Schools. — In Illinois there are 32 
tricts which have no schools at all. There are 106 schools w: 
fewer than 5 pupils, 589 with fewer than 10, and 1,460 with fe 
than 15.... In Missouri in 1907 there were 555 distri 
enumerating less than 20 pupils. In Arkansas in 1906 as mi 
as 462 schools enrolled less than 11 pupils, and in Wisconsin 2| 
In Kansas 87 schools have an enrollment of 5 or less, 474 an enr 
ment of from 5 to 10, and 1,049 between 10 and 15. In Michi; 
in 1902 there were 51 schools with:2 or fewer pupils, or which ha 
schools at all. — Final Rept. Ill. Educ. Com., 1909, p. 122. 
High Schools. — As fast as our towns have abolished the dist 
system by their own vote, they at once began to consider the ma 
of a high school. So long as the districts exist, we shall not h| 
high schools; but if we can get rid of the districts, we shall 
mately be able to provide high school facilities for the greater p 
if not for all, of the children of the state. — Supt. Stockwell

1. The Township Unit System 
[Bulletin No. 8, 1909-1910, Dept. Public Instr., Michigan.] 
Michigan with its 7310 school districts is confronted with 
great problem, that of improving the conditions found in many « 
those districts. This is by far the most important school proble: 
in the state to-day. 
All movements which tend to create a more useful country scho 
should receive emphasis. The work is not confined to any one lin 
but in the establishment of the township as the unit of school a 
ministration is to be found one of the most efficient means. T 
bill passed by the legislature of 1909,' made the establishment 
the township unit system optional with the people of the townshi 
There are 747,307 children of school age in Michigan; nea: 
one-half of that number live in rural communities, and if th 
attend school, all but few are to be found in district schools. | 
changes that have come about in the number of children in the d| 
tricts since the organization of such districts, have given rise 
some peculiar conditions. There are several districts in the stq 
with only one child of school age on the census list, many distri 
with only three, four, or five each.?- More than 1500 districts 
of the total of 7310 have fifteen or fewer children of school a; 
and less than ten in actual attendance. 
The great majority of the rural schools of Michigan are at pres 
under the district system, the township being divided into sch 
districts varying in number from five to twelve; in other wo! 
there are from five to twelve single-room schools in each towns 
the taxing area being divided accordingly. The number of pu 
in these districts varies from one to forty, with a few school: 
greater enrollment. Each district board consists of three memb 
The course of study covers the first eight grades; in a few sch 
some advanced work is given. The daily program of the ave! 
school consists of from twenty to thirty classes. One grade ot 
consists of but one pupil. The conditions are such as to admi 
almost no work in drawing, music, nature study, manual train 
and agriculture, and even the drill in reading, arithmetic, pen: 
ship, and spelling is necessarily limited. High school departm 
are very rare.

nts cannot afford this expense, while perhaps just as bright as 
more fortunate children, must suffer from their poverty and do 
out advantages which could just as well be given them in their 
district, with little, if any, additional expense. 
he interest and efficiency that characterized the large schools 
ormer days in many localities is today wanting in the present 
ler schools. 
he district system, which served quite satisfactorily a half- 
ury ago, has to a great extent outgrown its usefulness. It has 
ined in efficiency and will continue to decline. The district 
ol is very much as it was fifty years ago. This condition exists 
because the rural population of Michigan is not progressive. 
rovement has been made in all other lines. Where the farmer 
1 in his log cabin and harvested his wheat with a sickle, today 
average farm home is one of comfort; the farmer gathers his 
t with a binder; everything connected with the average rural 
unity has advanced. 
o essential features, in educational work as well as in business, 
be kept in view, — efficiency and economy. ‘To secure these 
must be comfortable, convenient schools, necessary appli- 
, intelligent teaching, and no more schoolhouses than are 
d for the number of pupils. The problem is, how can the 
um amount of efficiency be secured at practically a minimum 
se, or, in other words, how can the greatest good to the great- 
mber be provided at a reasonable expenditure. 
de from the fact that the average cost per capita in a one-room 
'y school is, in many cases, from three to ten times as much as 
neighboring city and village schools, the results under this 
are not only not commensurate with the cost of maintaining, 
e advantages offered are far below those of other schools.

It is manifestly unjust that one school district is forced to   tain a school at a high rate of tax while neighboring districts i 
same township maintain in many cases a better school at a fa 
expense. * * * 
Tt is clear to one who gives the matter any thought that no 
can be done to improve rural school conditions under the antiq 
primary system. The schools are small and lack the inspi 
and enthusiasm given by numbers, and the cost of maintaining 
is excessive, nor is there any possible way by which the pupils 
given the advantages which are found in city schools. 
way in which conditions can be bettered is to do away with the 
districts and unite the schools under the charge of one boar

ris can be done under the township unit system. This system is 
ot an experiment. Aside from like organizations in other states, 
early the whole of the upper peninsula of Michigan is organized 
ith each township as a school unit, and by special acts certain 
istricts in the lower peninsula are organized as such. 
From an economical standpoint, the township unit system 
ould be adopted. With more than 20% of our district schools 
ving an average of less than ten pupils, and a correspondingly 
igh rate per capita for maintenance, the district system is extrava- 
nt without giving value received. 
The township system would mean an economy in buildings, 
luding heating and repairs, and at the same time better buildings 
ith better equipment at no increase of cost. The same fuel would 
m forty children as would warm five. Five maps and globes 
yuld supply the schools where twice that number are now needed. 
It should be remembered, however, that the chief purpose of the 
nship unit system is to better the condition of education for the 
munity. Under this system when carried to its conclusion the 
nship will constitute one district with one board of education, 
entral high school and as many primary or ward schools as are 
ded,. at properly located points in the township, all under an 
ert supervisor, thus giving closer and superior supervision, both 
agogically and from a business standpoint. A single board of 
could undoubtedly administer the affairs of the township better 
n they are administered by the five to twelve three-member 
rds today. 
[he single room school does not afford proper advantages. The 
nship system permits organizing into departments. The school 
eight or nearly eight grades, and with an average of four 
ses to a grade, will have a daily program of at least twenty 
ses, oftener nearly thirty, admitting of very short class periods ; 
e teachers, or even two, in a school will divide the number 
rades, thereby dividing the number of classes, and thus give 
for those subjects that are as truly necessary to the educa- 
of the boys and girls as spelling and arithmetic. A class 
lod of 20 or 25 minutes with ten pupils in the class will do more 
he individual than a period of ten or fifteen minutes with a 
lle pupil. One pupil in a grade results in lack of enthusiasm 
the inspiration from numbers.

  2. Some Objections to the Township System 
[From the Final Report of the Illinois Educational Commissio| 
1909, pp. 125-129] 
The objections most frequently urged against township orga) 
ization are the following: The township system would tal 
the control of the school out of the hands of the people, a towns 
board would not manifest the same interest in the district school 
a board elected by the voters of the district only; the towns 
unit means higher taxes; the township system means the closi| 
of schools, the transportation of pupils and consequently hard roa 
Let us consider these objections, taking them up in the inverse or 
of that in which they have just been presented. 
The objection that the township system of school organizat: 
involves the question of taxation for hard roads is based on a 
conception of what the township system really is. The miscone 
tion arises from the supposition that the township system of sch| 
organization necessarily involves the consolidation of schools 
the transportation of pupils. This is a mistake, the towns 
system does not mean the consolidation of schools, but the uni 
tion of school management. We could have township organiza’ 
without closing a single school. It is probable, however, that w 
the township system the people of some townships would vote 
and then to close a school which had become inefficient. Certai 
they ought to do so in the interest of the children of such sch 
But if so, it would be of their own action and entirely incident: 
township organization. The commission has expressed the o 
ion that schools containing an enrollment of less than ten p 
should be closed and this opinion is supported by the experi
-P-A-G-E-243
THE TOWN AND TOWNSHIP SYSTEMS 221 
  1d practice of other states. But, as has been seen, the form of 
ganization proposed by the commission does not include even that 
‘ovision. The objection, though invalid, is one which naturally 
ises, and which has been met with in every attempt to introduce 
ie township system. The present superintendent of schools of 
ermont, in speaking on this same point says “the present law was 
yn amid much apprehension and misapprehension. The fear 
as that a reckless consolidation of schools would ensue. This is 
:tagonistic to its-spirit. It means consolidation of management ; 
yt schools, except in cases where the larger profit to pupils unques- 
onably justifies the action.” 1 
“Another misapprehension,” said he, “was largely increased 
‘pense. 
This brings us to the objection that the township system involves 
creased taxation. The answer which comes from all the states 
hich have adopted it is that it doesnot. In Vermont, for instance, 
the year following the adoption of the town system the children 
the state received 6411.2 additional weeks of schooling, and the 
rerage cost per week was reduced from $11.69 to $10.90. 
It is easy to show that if the school facilities remain the same the 
st of operating the schools under the township system could not 
: greater than under the district system. If, for instance, a town- 
ip has ten schools, employs ten teachers, and has ten boards of 
hool directors, necessitating ten elections annually, and purchases 
3 supplies through ten different channels, it is contrary to reason 
suppose that its expenses would not be diminished by uniting the 
magement of its schools under one board of directors requiring 
t one annual election and by purchasing its supplies in large 
antities through one channel. But it is not supposed that the 
ool facilities would long remain the same. One of the chief 
rits of the township system is that under it they increase. Now, 
is possible, even probable, that in time this increase would raise 
expenditure of the township to the amount required under the 
trict system, or beyond it. Such increase, however, would 
end chiefly upon the growth of interest and pride which the 
ple of the township would manifest in their schools, and the 
ent of these, of course, cannot be accurately predicted. It is, 
refore, absolutely impossible for anyone to say whether in a year, 
years, or at any given time in the future the tax rate under the 
ship system would be above or below the level of taxation 
er the district system. All that can be positively asserted is 
at the same rates of taxation the township system will provide 
er school facilities than the district system. This may be

   222 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
shown both by calculation and by the evidence from other stat 
which have adopted the township system, and this alone is sufficie 
to justify the commission’s recommendation. 
Not only does the township system secure better schools than t! 
district system, but it makes possible a development of schoc 
which could never take place under the district system. T 
prime object of a system of school organization with respect 
taxes is not the reduction of taxation, but the more economic 
use of the taxes raised for school purposes, and this is attained | 
the township system. It means an equal distribution of the burd 
of taxation throughout the territory adopting the system, and co 
sequently the taxes of some persons would be increased under 
and those of others diminished. It means also an equal distributi: 
of taxes levied and consequently an equal distribution of schc 
privileges. It should, therefore, appeal particularly to the rur 
population of the State, for it is obvious on the most casual co 
sideration that the children in towns and cities enjoy superi 
educational opportunities to the children of those who live in t! 
country. The country people of the state have more to gain fro 
the township system than any other class of citizens. 
In regard to the third objection, namely, that a township boa 
of school directors would be less interested in the district school thi 
a local board of directors, it seems plausible enough, and yet a caref 
consideration will show that it is almost wholly without foundatio 
It assumes what is not true, and that is that interest in the wo 
of a district school depends upon one’s geographical relation to | 
It is not even true that a man who sends children to school h

Interest in a particular school depends upon an interest in schoi 
generally, and such interest is due to one’s natural bent or is call 
forth by one’s professional duties. It is often times a pecul: 
attribute, and is found highly developed now and then in men a 
women who are childless. It is an interest, too, which is develo, 
by responsibility. The objection assumes that a school directo 
more deeply interested in his school and will look more caref 
after its welfare than, for instance, the county superintendent 
schools. Everybody knows that this is not the case. The cow 
superintendent, because of his professional relationship to the sch 
work in general, is, as a rule, more deeply interested in all questi 
affecting the progress of the district schools of his county tl 
the directors themselves. Everybody knows that this is the c 
So it is to be expected that a township board of directors, bee: 
of their increased responsibility and wider professional duties, w 
manifest greater interest in individual schools than is found am|    
    
      
    
       
   
   
      
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE TOWN AND TOWNSHIP SYSTEMS 223 
boards of school directors as they are now constituted. This has 
been proven in those states which have adopted the township 
system. On the other hand, the increased responsibility of the 
school directors under the township plan would lead the people 
themselves to be more particular with respect to the professional 
interest and intelligence of the men selected for that position. 
Thus there would be a double tendency under the township system 
towards increasing the interest and efficiency of school directors. 
It should be remembered, too, that interest in a school is not suffi- 
ient. It must be intelligent interest. Interest in a school some- 
imes amounts to nothing more than interference with the school. 
he experience of other states has shown that under the township 
ystem more efficient school officers are secured. People who are 
ost deeply and intelligently interested in an institution do not 
Insist on managing it themselves, but are anxious to entrust its 
anagement to the most efficient officers that can be selected. 
‘hus this objection, which is one of the first to occur to those who 
egin to think about the two systems of school organization, com- 
letely breaks down. 
Finally, we have the objection that the township system takes 
e control of the schools out of the hands of the people. 
This objection betrays an entire misconception of the nature of 
lopular government and also of what the township system really is. 
‘he township system merely proposes to reduce the number of repre- 
ntatives elected to carry out the popular will. It would increase 
e territorial area from which these representatives are chosen. 
lut since such representatives would still be elected by the people 
e control of the schools would be left in the hands of the people. 
.is surely a fact that local government does not depend upon the 
ea of the territorial unit from which representatives are chosen. 
under our present system two districts are consolidated, would 
at affect the participation of the people in the school affairs of 
lose districts? Obviously not. If it did, it might be shown by the 
e reasoning that to divide a district would make the government 
ll more democratic, which is absurd. School government, like 
er forms of government, must necessarily be representative, 
id its democratic nature is not affected in the least by making the 
mship the unit instead of the district. Does the fact that the 
n is the unit in the making of roads, the building of bridges, the 
e of the poor, the levying and collecting of taxes, for town pur- 
es, etc., indicate that in these matters the people have surrendered 
of their authority? Certainly not, and so if the people should 
ide to make the township instead of the district the unit of 
ool organization and administration and elect fewer representa-

tives to look after their interests, they would merely adopt a mor 
efficient system for the exercise of a particular governmental func 
tion and would surrender not one iota of the power now lodged i 
them. * * * 
Each of our cities is managed by a single board of education 
Now if the district system alone is democratic the people of thes 
cities of our state have been deprived of the rights which naturall, 
belong to them as members of a democratic community. Eac' 
ward should be a separate district with its own board of directors. 
They should, therefore, divide these cities into as many district: 
as there are schools, and the people in the small divisions con: 
taining a school should elect their own directors. Why don’t the: 
do it? Because they know that in making the entire city a singl 
district they have adopted a system of organization far mor 
efficient than a small district system could possibly be. 
  3. Opinions of State School Officers 
[Quoted in Final Report of Illinois Educational Commission, p 
129-131. Names and titles those of 1907.] 
Kansas has 13,000 public school teachers and an army of 28,00} 
officers to direct and manage these teachers — an anomalous condi 
tion, and one that means a great waste of energy and a decided lac 
of unification and coordination in educational matters. A lar, 
unit means a more economical and business-like administratio’ 
It is the small district and the varying conception of school wo 
that are responsible for most of the weakness of our syste 
The district plan is apparently the last remnant of the old-ti 
conception of the widest distribution of business, and is at war wi 
every modern thought of classification and organization. — L. 
Fairchild, Supt. Publ. Instr., Kansas. 
In my opinion, and I find it to be the opinion of the leadi 
educators of this state, the small unit, such as we have in the di 
trict, is not producing the results that could be obtained by mea: 
of a larger unit. Personally I am strongly in favor of the coun 
unit. My next choice would be the township unit. I am fir 
of the opinion that with a township or county unit the net result 
our educational effort would be increased fifty per cent. It is 
what we put into a system, but what comes out of it, that sho 
count, and hence, as I have before indicated, the greatest questi 
1 Many cities once had just this condition, but abandoned it in the inter 
of better education. One of the main reasons why the cities have develo, 
such strong school systems is that the school system has been treated as a w

  before the American people is that of a changed unit of administra- 
tion. We are using a method that is more than one hundred years 
old, without any change, and for that reason the country schools 
have not kept pace with the city schools. The city schools have 
forged ahead because they have used a larger unit for educational 
purposes. — J. H. Ackerman, Supt. Publ. Instr., Oregon. 
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    
      
   
     
    
     
   
    I am most emphatically in favor of the township system. It 
akes for efficiency in education which assists materially in con- 
olidation. It brings upon the district school board men of better 
ualifications ; it makes a more satisfactory school, and in this state 
aterially reduces the cost of school management. I think that 
he objection that it would mean increased taxation is not sound, 
nless indirectly better schools mean increased taxation. We have 
5 counties in our state, 40 of which have the township system and 
ive of which have the district system, and I am sure that it would 
e greatly to the advantage of these five, educationally, if they 
ould make the change.—W. L. Stockwell, Supt. Publ. Instr., North 
akota. 
In this state we have both the township organization and the 
ingle district organization. The township organization lends aid 
centralization of schools, and there is a likelihood of having 
etter school officers in the township system than in the single 
istrict system. Local disturbances in the district seem to be more 
tisfactorily handled by a township school board who are unlikely 
be parties to other factional affairs so frequent in the single 
hool district. — H. A. Ustrud, Supt. Publ. Instr., South Dakota. 
I am very certain your educational commission has acted wisely 
d in the interests of efficient and progressive school administra- 
mn, in recommending a change from the district to the township 
it of organization. One of the things which most hampers the 
ral schools of Minnesota is the small school district. —C. G. 
hultz, Supt. Publ. Instr., Minnesota. 
The change proposed from your district system to the township 
tem is unquestionably a step in the direction of the permanent 
provement in the organization of your schools. Any territorial 
it that is smaller than the township is in almost every interest 
weak to provide adequate school facilities for the children. 
rger units are, as a rule, stronger units, because of the increased 
ount of taxable property upon which they rest and the greater 
ree of intelligence possible in the management of the schools. —

Pennsylvania has always had the township system of managin; 
schools. From the start the schools have been in charge of si: 
directors. In our opinion this results in economy. My notion i 
that a county system is more economical even than a townshiy 
system. The superintendent of one county claims that if he coul

     By an Act passed at the biennial session of the General Asse 
bly of Vermont in 1892, the educational system of the state w 
changed from the district system to the town system. Prior 
that Act, the towns in their annual town meetings, voted on t! 
adoption of the town system. Each year about 80 % of the vote 
voted against the system, and at the time the law was made co: 
pulsory by statutory enactment there were only 12 towns in the sta 
which had voluntarily adopted the town system. At the bienni 
term of 1894, an attempt was made in the General Assembly 
revert to the district system, but the attempt failed. Since th 
no attempt has been made to revert to the previous system, a 
for the past ten years I have known of no attempt to return to t 
previous condition of administration. The principle involved 
that education is a common good; therefore equal advanta: 
should be furnished all, and the expense of maintenance should al 
be equal. As a result of the town system, there is much bet 
administration of schools, better teachers are employed, and bet 
results are obtained. — Mason S. Stone, Supt. of Educ., Vermo

The district school system was abolished in this state only after 
onged agitation and discussion. At the time of the abolition of 
district system there was strong opposition to the measure. 
3; opposition continued for a number of years to disturb the 
ols. However, it is now the very general verdict of our people, 
the nearly unanimous opinion of our educators, that the step 
one of the most important that has been taken in the direc- 
of progress. Under our former district system the average 
en had little interest in the schools of his town, except in the 
located in his own district. This interest of the local school 
rtunately often took the form of interference with the details 
hool management, even to the extent of interference with the 
s and privileges of the teacher. Under that system also the 
ibution of school funds was most unfair, and there could be 
ling resembling equality of opportunity so long as it prevailed. 
urse, it would be too much to say that the difficulties I have 
ioned disappeared entirely with the abolition of the districts, 
believe I speak conservatively when I say that at the present 
la much better educational policy prevails throughout the state 
esult of the township system. I may add that recently there 
een a growing tendency to enlarge the school unit in the 
ion of making it that of the state rather than the township.

han the district system. Indeed, it is my opinion that there

district system seems archaic and absolutely inadequate to 1 
the requirements of the times for publie schooling, in distinc 
from private education. The district system is only one step | 
home or private schooling. You can educate efficiently all 
children of a town only by having uniformly good schools thro 
out the town. Under the district system I never knew a t 
of good schools anywhere, or a town maintaining a reason

[ucn of what has been reproduced in Chapters VII and VIII, 
ting to the substitution of some larger unit of administra- 
_ for the district system, has indicated the need of making 
county the unit for school work, as it is for most other forms 
overnmental activity. In this chapter some further com- 
its are added, relating more to the office of county superin- 
lent of schools, and a description of the Maryland form of 
nty unit is given. 
he first article shows the position and the small powers of 
county superintendent of schools in a strong district-system 
e; the second section presents extracts from official reports, 
ing to the need for a change in the methods of selecting 
official; the third section relates to the advantages of 
county-unit and a county board of education; and the 
ter closes with characterizations of the county-unit plan, as 
rce in Maryland and in Georgia. Chapter X contains 
ore material bearing on county educational organization.

California is a district-system state, and the districts, ra 
than the counties, control educational affairs throughout 
state. San Mateo County is divided into thirty-six school 
tricts, twenty-three of which are rural one-teacher schools. E 
district by law has a Board of Trustees of three members, ele 
by the people of the district. Each such Board of Trusteé

These duties, as will be seen, are, with the exception of number 
argely clerical in nature, and could be equally well performed 
an office clerk of reasonable intelligence. No unusual amount 
reparation or intelligence is required. 
n duty number 1, although authorized to “superintend the 
yols of the county,” there are absolutely no powers granted 
im consistent with the carrying out of that duty. The County 
erintendent, under the present system, cannot determine the 
of a school building; rearrange desks or seats; condemn a 
ding on account of the inadequacy of the heating, lighting or 
ilation; he cannot select teachers, specify their salaries, direct 
method of teaching, or dismiss a teacher for any cause what- 
He cannot require janitor work to be more efficiently carried 
mploy additional janitors, or require any school building to

Supervision of the schools” generally consists in visiting each 
lol once each year, as required by law, and for a period of from 
n minutes to one hour; in asking several questions of the

two occasions.

Il. Nesp or a CHANGE IN THE MerHop or ELEcTIN 
County SUPERINTENDENTS 
1. Fundamental Weakness of our Present System 
[State Supt. C. P. Cary, in Bien. Rept. State Supt., Wisconsi: 
1906-1908, pp. 17-18.] 
One of the most important problems connected with the 
provement of the country schools is the problem of the supervi 
of these schools. During the past two years this question has 
discussed at the meetings of the Wisconsin State Teachers’ 
ciation and at the County Superintendents’ Convention. 
consensus of opinion seems to be that our present system of s: 
ing county superintendents is radically wrong and shoul 
changed. From 12,000 to 14,000 educational positions are 
in the state each year by boards of education elected by the pe 
that is, by applying the principle of representative govern 
However, when it comes to the selection of the seventy-three e: 
and district superintendents the method of electing by direct 
is still used. 
For more than forty years the present system has been i 
in the state and it has failed to give us a profession of county s| 
intendents, and never until such a profession exists will the e 
superintendency be what it should be. If a person secures a 
tion in one of the high schools of the state, he knows that i 
he is successful in that school, the reputation gained thereb, 
enable him to secure a better position, and the same is tru 
respect to city superintendents. Such conditions are an inc 
to our high school principals and city superintendents to d 
best. Such conditions also warrant one in looking forwar 
successful career in these lines of educational work during 
working years of life, but with respect to the county si 
tendency these conditions do not exist. Anyone consideri 
advisability of going into the county superintendency work m 
assured of meeting defeat at the polls in the course of a few 
and when defeat comes his career as a county superintenden

.e is not even eligible as a candidate in any other county or 
rintendent district. As long as this lack of permanency and 
of opportunity for promotion exists in the county super- 
idency it will never become a profession, and therefore will 
uppeal to anyone as a life work. 
gain, when a vacancy occurs in a city superintendency or a 
school principalship, the board of education in filling it is 
confined to candidates who are residents of that particular 
ity. The board has the right to go even beyond the limits 
e state in its efforts to secure the best person that it is possible 
cure with the money at its command. Not so, however, in 
election of county and district superintendents, for under the 
nt system the people are compelled in their selection to con- 
themselves to local candidates, no matter how poorly fitted 
he position they may know every one of them to be. 
hese conditions constitute a fundamental weakness in our 
nt system. This weakness has retarded the country schools 
e past, and will continue to retard their progress as long as it 
s; therefore, it is to be hoped that the next legislature will 
ide for the election of county boards of education, such boards 
e elected by the people. Such boards of education should 
t the county superintendents, fix their salaries, provide neces- 
clerk hire, audit the expense accounts of the superintendents, 
do such other work as the legislature, after careful considera- 
may deem proper to place in their hands. 
2. The Work of a County Superintendent

1899-1900, pp. 81-82.] 
must be borne in mind that the office of superintendent of 
s is different from any other county office. The duties of 
other county officer are definitely and fully set forth in the 
es. Certain duties of the county superintendent are also 
rated in the statutes. He must examine teachers, visit 
s, make certain reports, and must conduct an institute in 
mty each year. Beyond this the statutes do not and cannot 
ly go. Yet the chief value of the superintendent’s services 
ork entirely outside of the performance of these duties. His 
f supervision cannot be formulated by statute. His work

ing and organizing the educational forces of the county, 
; the product of statutory enactments; but these are the 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  234 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
most important functions of that office. They are functions w 
are strictly professional in character, requiring either sp 
training, or long experience, and, in any case, a high degre 
skill. [Everyone must admit that special skill or professional 
ity in “educational work is not best obtained through a por 
election. If.it could be so obtained, why should not the teac 
in each district be elected by popular vote at the district mee 
instead of being appointed by the district board? If it coul 
so obtained, why is it that in those cities where the best scl 
are always to be found the city superintendents are appointed 
stead of being elected by popular vote? That it cannot b 
obtained is no reflection upon the intelligence of the people. 
arises from the fact that the great mass of people are fully occu 
with the daily business concerns of their own vocations, and dc 
give the special attention and study to the needs of their ed 
tional system that must be given in order to secure its best deve 
ment. That this last statement is correct is shown by the 
that not one parent in twenty ever visits the school in whicl 
children are enrolled once during the school year? 
3. The County School Superintendent 
(Supt. J. H. Ackerman, in Bien. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr., Ore 
1911, p. xxi] 
It cannot be said too often that the county school superint 
ent is at the strategic center of all school operations; and 
as he is so will be his schools. If this be true, and there ca 
but little doubt of it, the office ought to receive more recogn 
than it has ever had. In a political way it has amounted to ] 
and ought to amount to less, — for it ought to be an office 
the schemes of cliques and beyond the strife of partisans, 
in a sociological way no official position in any county is 
powerful either for good or for evil. It reaches with its 
but pervasive influence, whether consciously or not, every 
and hearthstone all over the land, and determines, to a grea 
a less degree, not merely the moral tone of the home but the 
tical efficiency as well. It is but a trite statement, then, that 
men ought to be the best procurable. By “best” is not 
merely the morally best. Their morals, of course, should be 
reproach and unimpeachable. But many may have this 
fication and still be utterly incompetent. These men should 
in addition to their perfect moral fitness, professional fitne: 
competency. ‘They ought to be trained men, not only me

y but men who know how to do, to lead, to bring things to 
; and in each county there ought to be such a man giving his 
e time and thought to the work of organizing schools, direct- 
he course of study, conducting institutes, holding conferences, 
developing in the system its tens of thousands of latent pos- 
ities for good, which only a competent man can find. 
uch men can be found and kept in the work only by holding 
s an attraction for them positions big with promise and bulging 
opportunities. Too many superintendents in Oregon have 
such positions. There are scarcely half a dozen in the thirty- 
counties that a man may hold and live by. This being true, 
y are held by men who rely in part upon other work or enter- 
s for a living, giving the affairs of this office but a portion of 
- time and thought. To spend money for irregular, perfunc- 
and desultory supervision is grossest extravagance. It must 
ctive, thorough, and skilled if it amounts to anything worth 
e. 
4. The County Superintendent's Powers 
t. E. B. Denison, in 51st Mo. State School Rept., 1900, p. 104.] 
1e legislature has not failed to provide duties for the superin- 
ent, every one of which duties I most earnestly endorse; but 
is surely neglected to provide the proper power or authority 
varrying some of them into effect. The legislation needed is 
so much concerning the duties of the superintendent as it is his 
rs. The fact is that the superintendent has little or no 
lority so far as the actual work with the schools is concerned. 
as absolutely no authority over the teachers, and nothing 
ymmon with the district boards of directors. Whether or not 
cooperate with him in the management of the schools depends 
ther on their pleasure in the matter. The superintendent 
through his personal influence with some of the teachers and 
s of directors, succeed this year in organizing the work in 
of the districts, but by the shifting of teachers and the 
ing of directors, next year will find much of the work undone 
atly retard Our city schools are well organized and have 
ite course of study, and the work moves forward in proper 
year after year. Why this condition in the city schools and 
the rural schools? It is due to the close cooperation between 
y superintendent and his board of directors; he meets and 
ts with them often regarding the management of the schools, 
oice in the selection of teachers, and is vested with the proper 
ity for conducting the schools. The city teachers, recogniz-

his plans. These relations do not exist between the county st

do exist the rural schools will not reach the proper stan

5. County and City Superintendents Compared 
[W. K. Tate, State Supervisor of Rural Schools, in 42d An. 
State Supt. Educ., S. Carolina, 1911, pp. 105, 113.] 
I wish once more to emphasize the value of proper superv 
in the training of teachers. The city superintendent usually 
a new recruit in his school awkward and inefficient. He 
continually assist her in the management of her class and i1 
improvement of her methods. She progresses rapidly unde 
right kind of supervision.. The country teacher has almost 
of this assistance. The sole supervising officer is the co 
superintendent, employed at a salary which assumes that | 
to devote only a portion of his time to this work and respon 
for a territory which makes it impossible for him to visit 
schools more than once a year. There are counties in § 
Carolina in which the salary of the county superintendent 
300 teachers in his charge is less than one-half the salary o! 
city superintendent in the county seat with one-tenth the nu 
of teachers. This is not giving the country children a square. 
and no one who would continue the condition is a true frier 
the country school. In my opinion no county can afford a c 
superintendent who can be secured for less than $1,200 a year| 
the county should demand all his time for the schools. * * 
[ie county superintendent of education is the most impo} 
offi@ér in the county. He should be able to plan wisely the e 
tional program of the county, and with some assurance of o 
tunity to execute his plans*? Should we not hedge this offic 
some qualifications? Is fhe direct primary every two or 
years the best way to select an expert? Should we not ha’ 
privilege of hunting our man occasionally, instead of limitin 
selves in our choice to those who seek the position? Shou! 
the county superintendent be the executive officer of the 
board, just as the city superintendent is the executive offi 
the city board? Can we afford, too, to have the county s 
tendent the poorest paid officer in the county?

6. The County Superintendency and Politics 
From Editorial in New England Journal of Education, 1910.] 
[he county superintendency must be taken out of polities] 
aid this in an Indiana county the past summer, and an exceed- 
ly bright young man said to me: “ Wait till I get in, and then 
ach that gospel to the limit.” 
This records the real trouble. It would be a simple matter 
eliminate politics if we could eliminate the aspiration of bright 
ing men who have been laying their plans for some time. 
Wherever one party is continuously in power the politicalization 
the county superintendency is not noticed. (Jn Pennsylvania 
nan often stays in office from ten to twenty-five years, despite 
fact that the office is political.] But when there is a political 
srturn in the county the viciousness of the situation becomes as 
yarent, as at present in Indiana. There the county superintend- 
_is elected by the township trustees, one from each township ; 
ially fewer than ten compose the county board. 
[hese trustees are elected on a purely partisan ticket. There 
no thought of the professional educational aspect of the 
ation. A man gets on his party ticket, and if the ticket is 
eted he goes along with it. 
Here is a sample county: From time immemorial the county 
; been going Republican. There are nine townships, which 
ans nine voters for the superintendent. The present superin- 
dent is universally appreciated and admired by the teachers 
by all educational interests in the county. Every principal 
township superintendent would sign a petition for his reten- 
in office. It is the universal judgment that he is the best 
lerintendent the county has ever had, but, at the election in 
, the state went Democratic. The governor, the congressmen, 
legislature went Democratic, and that carried this county in 
mon with others, and five of the nine directors are Democrats, 
the chance of his re-election is a negative quantity. The five 
ocrats say emphatically that he is the best man for the place, 
they would like to vote for him, but they were elected on a 
ly ticket, and the party expects them to do their political duty. 
long will this thing be allowed to continue?

  238 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
III. Neep or a Larger ApMInistraTive UNIT 
1. A Larger Administrative Unit Needed 
[State Supt. J. H. Ackerman, in Bien. Rept. Supt. of Publ. In 
Oregon, 1911, p. xxii.] 
From the beginning of the organization of the public scl 
system the school district has been the smallest administra 
unit. It met the needs of a people who were working under c 
paratively primitive conditions and probably accomplished 
purpose as effectively as could be reasonably expected. 
question is now being seriously considered as to the advisabi 
of enlarging the present administrative unit to meet the need: 
our present civilization. It is a matter of common knowledge t 
in other lines of human effort the tendency is strongly tow 
combination and centralization, to the end that more effective w 
may be more adequately dealt with and the details may be m 
definitely planned and executed. 
The question of supervision is a vital one. In the cou 
superintendency we have the beginnings of a complete and effec! 
system of supervision. We must perforce use the county uni 
secure the desired results. We must adopt the system now 
vogue in our cities to all parts of the county, excluding only 
cities of the first class. The problem can best be solved by mal 
the county the major unit in so far as there shall be one head, 
then have a sufficient number of subdivisions of this major u 
with an assistant superintendent in charge of each subdivi 
working under the advice and direction of the county sw 
intendents. There should be a sufficient number of such 
divisions, so as to secure as efficient supervision as is secure| 
city systems. The county superintendent should have a 
in the selection of all teachers, to the extent of having a vote i 
selection or dismissal of a teacher. He should also have a 
in the making and executing of all rules and regulations fo: 
government of the school. This would make the county sup} 
sion effective. To the extent of the selection of teachers an 
supervision of instruction we are introducing the principle o' 
county unit without running the risk of introducing partisan po} 
into the schools, — the gravest objection that can be urged ag} 
the plan of placing the full control of all the schools of a ¢ 
under one board. 
The smaller unit, the district, can safely be entrusted 
a i iN i i a lk
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE COUNTY UNIT — 239 ner administrative powers, such as building and repairing. . Thus 
ain we are employing the combination unit — county and 
trict. This does not preclude the idea of consolidation of dis- 
cts when at all practicable, and which should be encouraged 
all legitimate means. 
2. The County as a School Unit 
ate Supt. W. T. Carrington, in 55th Mo. State School Rept., 
1904, p. 9.] 
In civil and local government, township organization is not 
pular. It is considered expensive; good service is not secured. 
.e thousand clerks, assessors, collectors, and trustees are too 
ny for a state. Township officers are less competent than 
unty officers. There is not enough to do, and not enough 
ponsibility to develop efficiency. So it is in school matters. 
e little sub-district does not command sufficient attention to 
ure competent management. ‘The consolidated district or 
vnship organization is good, but county organization would be 
tter. Were it possible to have all taxes levied by counties, all 
100ls of the county supported out of a common fund apportioned 
a county board and a certain part of it devoted to high schools 
atrolled entirely by this county board, we would approach that 
ch-desired end, — equal taxation for school purposes and equal 
ool opportunities for all children. This county board could be 
rusted to employ a county superintendent, and to exercise a gen- 
il supervisory power over all the schools of the county. The 
sent State Superintendent will, perhaps, not see such an or- 
ization effected; but it will come sometime. 
3. Recommended Legislation 
te Supt. W. T. Carrington, in 57th Mo. State School Rept., 
1906, p. 5.] 
‘rovide for efficient supervision of rural schools. Give every 
ty a school supervisor. For large and populous counties 
ide at least one assistant. Fix the qualifications high and 
uard the selection so as to put only trained and experienced 
ers in the position. Better not have it than to fill it with 
ervers and persons lacking in scholarship, leadership, and 
ogical training. Fix the salary high enough to command the

best talent, and demand results. Make the duties of the off 
more administrative and pedagogical than clerical. Give t 
county supervisor authority to nominate teachers and trans 
them, such as is given to city superintendents. Constitute 
special county board, composed of business men, to employ a sup 
visor on merit, as one who would build a good house would emp 
an architect to make plans and superintend its construction. 
not shift the responsibility to the people to determine whet! 
they want such a position. It should not be treated as an offi 
It should be filled by the employment of an expert to perform te: 
nical duties. 
4. The Advantages of a County Board of Education 
[From the Final Rept. of the Illinois Educ. Com., 1909, pp. 95-4 
v The general purpose to be served by a county board of edu 
tion is to assist the county superintendent in carrying out 
educational policies and in the performance of the work necess 
to operate the general educational system of the state. (The cow 
board bears about the same relation to the county superintend 
as does the state board to the state superintendent.) Cow 
boards, it would seem, are needed to complete the educatio 
administrative system of the state. They would extend t! 
system from the general supervising agencies at the capitol of 
state and at the county seat to the remotest rural districts. TI] 
would serve as an avenue of communication between the vari 
educational authorities of the state and the people of each tor 
ship. 
But it is not for the sake of systematic state organization al 
that county boards of education should be constituted. T| 
may be made the direct means of increasing the general efficie 
of the schools and the school system of the county. The co 
superintendent has general supervision of the schools of the co 
as the superintendent of public instruction has general supervij 
of the schools of the state. For practically the same reasons w! 
make it advisable to have a state board of education to assist 
state officer in the performance of his duties it is also advis| 
to have a similar body to assist the county superintende: 
directing and improving the work of the county schools. 
county superintendent is required “to labor in every practi 
way to elevate the standard of teaching and improve the cond 
of the common schools of his county.” Now, it would be o 
greatest assistance to him when he has devised plans lookii

is end to be able to call together the county board, explain to 
members his ideas and policies and secure their codperation 
carrying his plans into effect. It would be necessary, of course, 
‘him to convince the members of the board that his plans are 
se and expedient, but if he is unable to persuade them that what 
proposes to do is calculated to promote the welfare of the schools, 
will be evidence that his plans are untimely or at least that they 
ed modification. If on the other hand, he is able to develop in 
> county board an active interest in school administration and 
1001 teaching he will have at his command a strong force to bring 
© operation in the development of public sentiment favorable 
advanced ideas in regard to the conduct of schools. It will 
well for him and for them to meet at intervals to discuss edu- 
tional needs, problems and expedients, and the benefits derived 
them from exchange of ideas and opinions would be reflected 
the welfare of the schools. 
[t is not alone, then, as an avenue of communication and a 
ans of developing public sentiment in favor of wise educational 
licies that county boards are desirable. Their members would

wers and duties which are usually assigned to them by law. 
nong these are the power to adopt and enforce rules and regu- 
ions for the management of schools not inconsistent with the 
ulations prescribed by the state board of education; to direct 
at branches of study shall be taught and what text books and 
aratus shall be used in the several schools; to prescribe a 
form series of text books and to enforce their use in the schools 
rr which they exercise control; to select the books for district

One of the Maryland county systems has recently done rat 
remarkable work, and the following article, dealing with 1 
possibilities of the Maryland county-unit form of organizati 
was written as a comment on the published statement that ' 
county superintendent of this county had been offered the c 
superintendency of one of our large city school systems. 
Possibilities of Maryland’ s School Organization 
[By J. Montgomery Gambrill, in the Baltimore Sun of January 
1914.] 
The thoroughgoing county organization of the school syst 
of Maryland is all but unique, and offers splendid possibilities t 
only a very few of the counties of the State show any signs 
recognizing. It is common in all sections of this country for 
urban communities, even in many cases those of 3,000 or 4, 
inhabitants, to have separate school systems, each with its own 
ministrative and supervisory officials. Village and semi-rural ec 
munities too poor for even a part-time superintendent frequer 
elect a school board and manage after some fashion their own affa 
As a result the county superintendent is usually little more t 
an executive clerk with merely nominal supervision over a 
small districts, or he is, perhaps, in charge of a purely rural ¢| 
munity which is unable to do much for itself even if it were 
vised free of charge by a more competent superintendent thai 
can employ. It is easy to see, then, why relative feebleness 
inefficiency should exist in a large proportion of school sys 
outside cities of at least moderate size, and why ordinarily the 
of the more efficient professional people is toward the cities. 
the education of these village and rural communities is a m 
of vital importance from every point of view, a prime fact 
the much-discussed problems of rural life. 
The Maryland plan, however, provides the strength of u 
By uniting in one system all the rural and urban commu 
of a large county like Baltimore, Allegany, Washington or

‘ick, ranging from rural districts and small villages to cities of 
),000 to 40,000 inhabitants, public education rests upon a vastly 
ronger basis, financial and social. It becomes possible to pro- 
ide for each of these communities an expert professional service 
uch beyond what it could pay for alone (except in the case of a 
w of the larger cities, perhaps). Imagine any one of these 
yunties split up into three to five or six school systems and all 
xcept the urban subdivided again, each looking out for itself, 
nd you have a picture of the other state of affairs. 
Fortunately a few of the counties of Maryland in recent years 
ave shown a dawning consciousness of what might be done under 
is excellent plan of county units of administration and control. 
r various reasons Baltimore county has gone much beyond any 
er, and since it is the superintendent of that county who has 
me to be professionally known beyond the bounds of the State 
d the loss of whose services is threatened, the results there 
appropriately be summarized. The school authorities have 
dually built up a very interesting and efficient organization 
id have brought together a supervisory body much above the 
lerage in competence. There is the usual supervision of grade 
rk and special subjects common in city schools; there is a 
cially trained supervisor of rural schools; 15 or 16 persons 
devoting their time as supervisors or special teachers to home 
momics and manual and industrial work. The spirit animating 
supervision is one of constructive helpfulness. It is loyally 
ported by the teaching body, which seems to be quite free 
ugly spirit or warring factions. Such professional duties 
the selection of textbooks and the preparation of courses 
methods of study are left wholly in professional hands. 
codperation of the people, essential to the financial and 
al support of such a system, has been secured and main- 
ed. 
ow, the point to be strongly emphasized is that there is no 
ine promotion in going from such a system of county edu- 
m to a city system. The ordinary standards of comparison 
tween cities and counties evidently do not fit. Indeed, the 
imore county problem is the more complex and difficult and 
wider scope for personal and professional ability. That 
the case, why should the superintendent of such a county 
led upon to consider a change of the kind now under dis- 
on? Should not the county position be given suitable recog- 
and dignity by providing an at least equal salary? Should 
ther Maryland counties spend a great deal more than they 
ow spending on supervision ?

  244 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
Can Baltimore county afford to pay $5,000 to $6,000 to a supe 
intendent of schools? There is no doubt that it can. A con 
parison of school salaries will show this clearly enough. Inc 
dentally it is said that the county recently offered a salary | 
$5,000 to try to retain the services of a road supervisor. 1] 
giving population figures I shall use the census of 1910, givir 
round numbers that are close to exact. For reasons already i 
dicated, it would be absurd to use county salaries as a measur 
the Maryland county is virtually a municipality for school pu 
poses, and we must make our comparisons with cities of somewh: 
corresponding population. Our point of departure is a populatic 
for Baltimore county of 125,000 and a salary for the superintende: 
of schools of $3,500. 
If we pick out the three or four cities nearest in population 
this county we shall find: Birmingham, Ala., $5,000; New Hav 
Conn., $4,500; Omaha, Neb., $5,400; Dayton, Ohio, $5,0 
Scranton, Pa., $5,000. These run, it will be noticed, from $1,0 
to $1,900 higher than the Baltimore county salary. Only o| 
city of such a group — Paterson, N. J. — has a salary no hig! 
than that of the county. Turning now to salaries that do cor 
spond and excluding the exceptionally high and low, one finds 
following examples :

Oklahoma, Okla. ete eds 68,000. 3,600

Dubuque, Iowa . . . . . 39,000 3,600 
These cities average less than half the population of Balti 
county and present problems much less difficult. Nor are t 
extreme examples. As many cases could be quoted of hi 
salaries for work of the same magnitude. For example: 
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. . . . . 67,000 $4,500

Furthermore, there are many small cities, much smaller 
those mentioned above, and only a mere fraction of the si: 
Baltimore county, that pay as large or larger salaries.

Observe that the total population of these six towns is sub- 
ntially less than that of Baltimore county and that they pay 
all $26,200 to their school superintendents. The distinctly 
an population alone of Baltimore county far exceeds the com- 
ed population of Montclair and Miles City, which together pay 
200. 
uch comparisons could readily be extended, but the facts 
leady given certainly show that Baltimore county can afford 
pay a superintendent of schools at least $5,000 and that some 
er Maryland counties are far from using their resources liber- 
for the support of education. The point might be made that 
bility as well as necessity be considered the taxable basis as 
ll as the population must be taken into account. This is true, 
if the most liberal allowances are made the proposition will 
ain no less clearly established. At the same time it must 
remembered that the county problem —the kind that we are 
talking about —really demands a better equipment than 
s the ordinary urban problem. 
this article I have done little more than point out the special 
racter of the Maryland county organization, with the splendid 
ortunities it gives, and the readiness with which the counties 
ht spend a great deal more money for the employment of pro- 
ional skill adequate to the development of those possibilities. 
re are many other important factors in the problem if time 
space permitted their treatment here. Suitable academic 
professional qualifications for the office of county superin- 
lent should be established by law. A minimum salary might 
stablished by statute; a New Jersey act of 1912 establishes 
lary of $3,000, notwithstanding the fact that all important 
and towns have superintendents of their own. The power 
strict school trustees to appoint principal teachers is a relic of 
ecentralized plan that has no place under the county organ- 
n and is only a hindrance and nuisance to an efficient super- 
dent. There is the question whether some of the smaller 
weaker and more purely rural counties of the State might 
ined in larger administrative units in order to obtain the 
ntages that are open to the larger counties like those referred 
the foregoing paragraphs. The law which now explicitly

  246 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
requires the Governor of the State to recognize party politi 
in making appointments to school boards should be changed, ar 
the appointing power charged with the responsibility of ignorir 
partisan and political affiliations. The present miserably inad 
quate provisions for the professional education of teachers shou 
be increased and vastly improved. And inseparably connecté 
with all this is the problem of stronger State organization. Mar 
land may well study the strong centralized organization, with

    V. Tue County Unir in EpucatTionaL ORGANIZATION 
GEORGIA 
[Evans, L. B., Supt. of Richmond County, Georgia, in an ad 
before the Dept. of Superintendence of the N. E. A., 1896.] 
This address, made nearly twenty years ago, describe 
system of county educational organization greatly superior 
that to which our Northern states have as yet attained. If 
succeed in developing as efficient an educational organizat} 
within the next decade or decade and a half we shall 
indeed fortunate. 
The educational thought of our time has been chiefly dire 
toward the improvement of city school systems. So we hea 
the great schools of Boston, Chicago, New York, Cincinnati 
Philadelphia, and a score of other places. The emphasis of 
thought has been placed long and devotedly on city schools 
the expense of the rural schools. * * * 
It is quite time that we change the emphasis of our sti 
turn aside from the contemplation of the excellences of the 
schools, and consider the necessities of the rural schools. 
wisest policy is to frame some educational scheme that will 
people in the country, that will stop the exodus from the f: 
that will make the rural people content, and that will make 
enlightened and prosperous. 
I believe very firmly that the county, or township, is the p 
unit of educational organization. If one system of schools 
be made to extend over a whole county, including city and vill 
the organization will be upon the basis of territory. B 
means the entire country can after a while be brought 
uniform organization. So long as the organization is by

merely organize by locality, which can never be uniform or 
re. It will always remain a one-sided development. A proper 
cy is to induce the people hereafter to organize by area, rather 
1 by spots. The effect of this will be to give to the rural child 
same school advantages as to the city child, and there is every 
on in equity and good sense why these advantages should be 
same. 
come from an illustration of this kind of organization, and it 
‘not be amiss to tell something of the schools of Richmond 
nty, Georgia, in which county is situated the thriving city of 
usta. Here, for the past twenty-five years, has been in 
ration what is known as the county system. 
ne board of education, composed of representatives elected 
che people for a term of three years, one-third of the member- 
| expiring every year, has charge of the entire school interests 
he City of Augusta and of the County of Richmond. This 
rd of education has the unique power of levying a school tax 
ctly upon the people of the county, without revision by any 
r authority, and without any limit as to rate or amount. 
school tax is levied and collected as a uniform rate upon all 
yerty of the county, whether it is in the city or out of it. This 
is the general school fund of the county, supplemented by the 
e appropriation. 
‘hen it comes to the distribution of the fund no regard is paid 
e amount raised by any ward of the city or any district of 
ounty, but the fund is distributed according to the necessities 
ch ward and district, determined by the number of children 
le educated. The School fund of the whole county is raised 
tax on all property of the county, and is distributed upon the 
of the school population of each community. Thus it hap- 
that a community rich in naught else but children will get a 
shing school paid for by their wealthy but less fortunate 
bors. 
a matter of fact, a large part of the money paid by the city is 
ly spent in the rural districts, for the city has nine-tenths 
taxable property, but only three-fourths of the school popu- 
So it happens that the rural schools may pay one-tenth of 
hool tax and receive the benefit of one-fourth of it. Augusta 
ent in the past twenty years the sum of two hundred thousand 
s, in building schoolhouses and paying teachers for the 
en who live in the country districts around her. Augusta 
own her faith in the proposition that every city needs to be 
ned by an intelligent, industrious, and contented population. 
n it comes to teachers, the same qualifications are demanded

for rural schools as for the city schools,/ Upon the regular 
amination terms, and upon the issuing of licenses to teach, 
applicant does not know whether he will teach in the city or 
of it, and to many it is a matter of indifference. And I ki 
whereof I speak when I say that there are young women gradu: 
of normal colleges doing high-grade work in country schools 
miles beyond the limits of the city, and doing it happily and ch 
fully. We firmly believe in the further proposition that a cour 
school is entitled to as good a teacher as a city school, and t 
those who live in the fields are as deserving of education as tl 
who dwell beside the asphalt. Carlyle must have had a cour 
child in his mind when he said, “this I consider a great trage 
that one soul should remain in ignorance that had capacity 
higher things.” / 
The teachers are treated as nearly alike as can be. (City. 
country teachers are paid about the same salaries.) They ge 
at the end of every month, and on the same day. The certai 
and the regularity of a fixed compensation create a sens¢ 
security, safety, and comfort in a teacher, and accordingly 
creases his efficiency. No teacher can do his best work wher 
works at starvation rates, is paid once in three months, and o! 
in scrip that he must discount. There is much _ philoso 
also economy in the maxim that advises us to pay a public serv 
well and watch him closely. So we draw no distinction of local 
First-class work is worth as much twenty miles from town a

The schools of the county are run nine calendar months.) T 
all begin at the same time and close at the same time.” Dw 
the last year every child of the county, regardless of wher 
lived, was offered nine months of actual tuition. 
So far as schoolhouses are concerned, these are located in 
districts, so as to be on an average of four miles apart. No ch 
out of walking distance of a school, open nine months in the

county board of education, and cost from three hundred to tw 
five hundred dollars each, according to size and equipment.

nce a month, and in addition have a one week’s institute, in 
he summer months. 
This, in brief, is the outline of the plan of organization of the 
chools of which I assumed charge thirteen years ago. That it 
as its defects of management and its grave faults I am prepared 
o admit. These I need not enumerate at this time. Suffice it to 
ay that no one knows what they are, and that they are, more 
urely than do I. What institution devised and controlled by an 
mperfect humanity is without the faults that are incident to us 
s men? That our system is projected upon the proper theory, 
or all our population, and for all the boys and girls under our 
ition, I firmly believe. 
There are two other systems in Georgia organized upon a similar 
an, one for Savannah and the County of Chatham, and the other 
x Macon and the County of Bibb.

  CHAPTER X 
THE RURAL SCHOOL PROBLEM 
Tuis is only another phase of the problem of county educ 
tional reorganization. In attempting to solve the difficulti 
which present themselves to those interested in improving ru 
education, a number of devices and plans have been trie 
some of which will be illustrated here. 
One which has been tried, with some good results, has b 
that of the approval and standardization of rural school buii 
ings. Illinois and Missouri have tried this device, with so 
success. The nature of the device is well shown by the foll 
ing statement and score card, taken from the Missouri St 
School Report.    
    
       
    
      
     
   
   I. Tse Approvat or Rurat ScHooLs 
[From the 63d An. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr., Mo., 1912, pp. 35: 
The first plan for the approval of rural schools was promulg 
in 1909. It led at once to increased interest, on the part of 
communities, in the grading of the school, in attendance, an 
better buildings and grounds. Nearly three hundred schools 
been placed on the approved list, and many others are taking 
steps as will lead to their approval in the near future. 
Before a school will be approved it must comply with the 
lowing requirements : 
(1) The term must be at least eight months in length. 
(2) The teacher must holda certificate higher than a third 
county. 
(8) The salary paid the teacher must be at least forty d 
per month. 
(4) The board must have complied with the library la

(5) The State Course of Study must be followed. 
(6) The organization and classification of the school must be

(8) The school buildings, grounds, and outbuildings must be 
quate, cleanly, and sanitary. 
(9) The room must be heated by other means than radiation.

11) A satisfactory program of recitation and study periods 
st be posted conspicuously. 
12) A total credit of 80 points out of a possible 100 must be 
ied. 
it is, therefore, suggested in order that rural-school approval

ear to each district that maintains an approved rural school.

When new schoolhouses are built, separate cloak rooms should

  THE RURAL SCHOOL PROBLEM 253 
A school is held on the approved list but one year at a time, and 
ist be reinspected to see that all the requirements are fully met each 
ar: So long as these requirements are met, the school continues 
the list, but when it fails in any one requirement it must be omitted. 
is to be regretted that several schools have been dropped from 
> list this year, owing to a failure to comply with the standard. 
II. Some Ruray Scuoou Dirricutties 
The difficulties which the one-teacher rural school has to 
ntend with are too numerous to be more than slightly helped 
such approval, useful as it is in itself. The following state- 
nt of “ The Situation in Texas,” taken from a bulletin issued 
the University of Texas, illustrates well some of the 
ficulties with which the one-teacher school has to contend. 
The Situation in Texas 
om Bedichek and Baskett, The Consolidation of Rural Schools, 
Bul. 48, Univ. Texas, 1904.] 
With over 6000 one-teacher white schools, with more than 600 
.ools enrolling less than twenty pupils, and over 100 enrolling 
s than ten, Texas would seem to offer a large field for Consolida- 
of Schools. If, in connection with this fact, one but considers 
utter absence of equipment and the interminable list of lessons 
ich must be heard each day by the teacher in each of the one- 
ther schools, the need for consolidation becomes too obvious 
discussion. For the enlightenment of those not familiar with 
hopeless task now set many of our rural teachers, we give here 
samples of the daily programs in actual operation.

III. Tar Consonmation or Rurat ScHoois 
ne movement for the consolidation of rural schools has been 
uch more fundamental importance as a means of solving 
rural-school problem, and rather remarkable results have 
achieved in a few states within the past twenty-five years. 
le more or less attempted in almost all of our American 
s, it is only in the township-unit or the county-unit states 
the plan has met with any marked success. The move- 
, west of the Alleghanies, began in Ohio in 1892, and the 
ing report of an investigating committee, sent out by 
ichigan State Grange in 1900 to visit and report on the 
schools, describes the usual conditions and results. The 
of the committee is quite long, and is given in full in the 
rt of the State Superintendent of Michigan for 1901, pp. 
, but the following extracts from the report illustrate 
the methods of work and the findings of the committee.    
   
   
Report of the Michigan State Grange 
1. Madison Township, Ohio 
superintendent of the schools of Madison township assured 
t “the experiment of centralization was no longer an experi- 
but had come to stay, and that as soon as suitable buildings 
be secured large enough to accommodate the pupils, all of 
tricts would be brought into central schools.” The people 
       
-P-A-G-E-278
      
256 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
of the individual districts are demanding to be centralized, 
opposition to the plan has long since died out; yet in the be 
ning the people were quite evenly divided, and a bitter controv 
ensued. This fact your committee found to be the general | 
dition, that wherever the plan was proposed it met at first 7 
determined opposition but, once started, the objection me 
away, and the population affected were equally averse to g 
back to the original districts. This was the testimony at e 
place visited by your committee. 
In this township we visited each school, and met and ta 
with the drivers of the wagons. We took pains to meet at 1 
homes a large number of the farmers, and from that source gath 
a mass of information, which can best be compiled in a few 
statements. 
No one was found who for any reason desired to go back to 
subdistricts. There were many who acknowledged having o 
nally opposed centralization, but were now among its stron 
advocates. The enrollment of pupils is increased upwards o 
per cent, while the average enrollment for last year was 96 per 
of enrollment; this is a result of transportation. The pe 
usually are agreed that especially with younger children the 
less sickness because of less exposure. No accidents have 
occurred with their wagons. Very much depends upon the dr 
As much care should be exercised in the selection of drivers : 
teachers. 
The wagons were usually covered and made comfortable 
robes, soap-stones, and in some instances, oil stoves. In 
township not a single instance of complaint against the pla 
conveyance could be found. The distances ranged from tw 
four miles, and at an average cost per wagon of $1.30 per 
with an average load of fifteen pupils. The drivers say tha 
children seem to enjoy the ride, very seldom give any tro 
are never tardy, have no wet feet or clothing, and are very re; 
in attendance. 
Mr. Corlett, a member of the board of education, who at 
was a very strong opponent of centralization and transport: 
but who is now equally as enthusiastic, says that the tow 
shows a lessened cost as compared with the old system. 
Mr. DeForest, one of the heaviest tax-payers of the tow! 
says he does not notice any particular difference in his s| 
taxes, but thinks that much of the success of the plan is d 
the good management of the township board of education 
to the energy, ability, and enthusiasm of the township 
superintendent.

one of the centralized districts, originally three districts, the 
s are very bad — heavy hills and sticky clay: still the driver 
rts but one day missed during the year, and that because of 
y snow drifts. The teacher reports the average attendance 
good; quite a number of the pupils have been neither absent 
rardy during the year. The three sub-districts had previous 
onsolidation an enrollment of 21 pupils, or an average of 7 
school, and a per-capita cost of $45; there is now in the one 
ol an enrollment of 35 pupils, and a per-capita cost of $15.50. 
2. District Jealousies 
1e next place visited, Kingsville, is a small village two miles 
_ the railroad, has a township high school, and to this school 
sonveyed all of the children of the township, except those of a 
ial district at North Kingsville. The school has about 200 
Is, with six teachers and six wagons for the conveyance of 
it 100 pupils. There were originally nine district schools 
twelve teachers, now the one school with six teachers, besides 
special district at North Kingsville. Careful inquiry elicited 
fact that were it not for the jealousy between the two small 
ges there would have been but one school, and it was generally 
eded that the work done at the central school was very much 
best. The school year is nine months. From the township 
- we learned that there was a saving to the township during 
rst four years of nearly $1000, but since 1896 there has been 
crease in the taxation of about 20 per cent over that of the 
r period. The salaries of teachers are higher, the teamsters 
e from $1.00 to $1.50 per day, according to the length of 
s. Talking with the drivers we ascertained that they also 
daily mail-carriers. Here, too, we failed to find any people 
desired to return to the old conditions. Quite a number 
ed that, were they obliged to return to the district plan, 
ould move elsewhere. 
ile in Ohio we learned that there was some difficulty with 
hools of Starke county, and on returning home letters were 
o New Baltimore inquiring the facts. ‘The replies received 
ll of the same tenor. Mr. J. B. Bryan writes: “We had for 
years a centralized school under control of township board, 
subdistricts being abandoned and conveyed .to the village 
Baltimore. This was just half of the township. The cost 
ling conveyance was less than under the district system. We 
van for each district abandoned. Drivers were paid from 
o $1.50 per day. Our roads were very bad a portion of the

spring, otherwise quite good during the season. No days 
missed, not were the wagons ever late. Generally speaking 
patrons of the school were well satisfied. The attendance aver 
120, with no truancy and no tardiness. But the other four dist: 
seeing that we had some advantages that they were not partic 
ing in, were jealous and voted us out. The principal objec 
were that the children had to leave home a little earlier anc 
home a little later.” 
IV. ConsoLmpATION IN DISTRICT-SYSTEM STATES 
The usual method followed in attempting to form consolid 
districts, in district-system states, is to look over the ma 
the county and find a group of districts, properly located 
with sufficient taxable property, and probably favorably 
clined, and then to try to induce such to vote to abolish 1 
district schools, and to create instead a central consolid 
school. The following studies are illustrative of this plan |

This means that under the law this district may organiz 
a town school district, having as it does over 200 childre 
school age (R. S. Mo. 1911, see 10864), and will thereby bi 
titled to certain privileges, as for instance the privilege of inc} 
ing the maximum levy to 100 cents for school purposes (R. S. 
1911, sec. 10825). 
II. Transportation. — Five routes will take care of al 
children living more than one-half mile from the school 
(children living less than one-half mile distant are not en 
to transportation under the law). The roads are in the 
good clay roads. 
The distances in every route are very reasonable and no 
need be on the road more than one hour. The average 
twenty minutes. The wagons will usually carry less thai 
totals given because of absences from school.

This means practically, however, that three of the distri 
B, C, and D, levying 40 cents, would have to raise their as: 
ment while the other two would lower to strike an average. 
The best proposition to be made and fought out in these 
tricts is this: Are you willing to raise your levy to 65 cents 
have a graded school with three years’ work in the high sc 
and six teachers employed? 
This can be easily done for 65 cents on $383,835 assessed v: 
tion of the whole district. The whole district would giv 
increase of $490, which would more than enable the distri 
hire an additional high school teacher and give three yea 
high school work. 
Natural growth of sentiment with the success of the s 
would undoubtedly increase the levy because that always ha: 
in towns, and farmers are just as friendly to education as ar 
patrons if they can see that they are getting the worth of 
money in better schools. 
Initial Cost of Consolidation. — This is difficult to stal 
terms that would hold for every locality. It so happens 
there are three buildings in these districts, none more th: 
miles from the village, in good condition, that could be mo 
and used. This with the two-roomed village school woul: 
care of all the pupils and the initial cost would be largel 
cost of moving them in and repairing them. This cost 
be largely defrayed by the sale of the sites and the rem 
school building. Later the district could build a good 
building, and the sooner the better.

proposition to build a new building would depend upon 
| the sentiment of the district is. The village would very 
ably be willing as individuals to pay a good part of the initial 
of putting up such a building on ample school grounds. 
ve covered wagons to be owned by the district would cost 
idition about $150 each.

toom. Also by raising the levy to 60 cents they could pi 
another teacher, do two years of high school work, and have p 
of money left. Fifty-five cents, the levy now made in one o 
districts, would probably do the work. 
That is, by all the districts paying what one does and 
solidating, they could have a graded school and two years 
school. At present individual patrons in these districts p 
total of over $2500 a year, sending their children away to 
school. Two years of this could be had at home by consolide 
There is only one principle upon which to work for consc 
tion — the principle of improved service. Cheapness is no | 
ment. The school which gives the best service for the m 
spent is the best school. Country schools are maintaine 
notoriously low taxes. Yet country children should have an 
cation as good as that of city children. 
The best education in consolidated schools will cost more 
poor education in one-room schools — if people will pay the m 
for the best. 
If consolidated schools are conducted as poorly as in the 
room schools, they will cost less; but nobody wants them - 
tun so poorly. They ought to be immeasurably better, 
patrons should see to it that they have the best. 
It is a characteristic of Missouri patrons that, when they u 
stand a school proposition, they will vote the necessary m« 
and this holds for rural as well as for city patrons. 
The friends of consolidation should spare no pains to make 
their plans. They should be made as simple as a primer, an 
the fight should be madefor good schools, not for cheap sch:

      THE RURAL SCHOOL PROBLEM 
Consolidation of Schools in Randolph County, Indiana 
Co. Supt. L. I. Driver, in Bien. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr., Indi- 
ana, 1911-1912, pp. 124-146.] 
is not the intention in this article to discuss the question of 
superiority of consolidated schools over the district school, 
nat question has been settled by comparison in scores of con- 
lated schools all over the State. We wish to show, especially, 
influence of these schools in the enrollment and attendance 
ne eighth year graduates. Randolph County, like all others 
he State, for years depended solely upon its district schools, 
we should not in any degree minimize the work of these schools, 
hrough them alone is the present high efficiency made possible. 
onsolidation first began in this county by the school building 
osantville, in Nettle Creek Township, having been condemned 
he State Board of Health. The school authorities thought it 
to transport two small district schools to this place. Although 
brought about a storm of opposition, the experiment was tried 
proved a great success. The building was built in 1905 and 
concrete, costing $14,000 and has since been equipped at a 
of about $300, not including desks, globes, maps, and library. 
the first time in the history of the county the flush system of 
ts was installed in a township building. A high school was 
blished with a three years’ course of six months each. This 
been increased to a four years’ course of seven months and is 
a certified school. From the very first this school has been a 
8, which is shown by the fact that 94 per cent of the eighth 
graduates have entered high schools. 
e school corporation of Lynn was laid down and the township 
charge of its school and built a six-room building at a cost of 
$24,000. At the dedication of this building Doctor Hurty, 
king an address, spoke of the “large and commodious build- 
lanitary in every part, large enough to meet the needs of the 
unity for years.” The people of the community, realizing 
idvantages of such a school, abandoned two of the district 
s and it became the duty of the same Doctor Hurty to con- 
the building because of its lack of room in 1909. A four-room 
lon was built to meet the growing needs of this school, but 
we find an insufficiency of room, as the building is now 
d in every part. Laboratories for physics, botany, agri- 
, manual training, sewing, and cooking are installed and 
t work is being done in all of them. From a school requiring 
chers and having a high school course of three years it has

The enrollment of eighth year graduates has increased fro 
per cent to 97 per cent. 
In 1912, five districts in the north part of this same tow1 
petitioned the trustees to abandon the district schools and 
solidate them. To this end a $15,000 five-room building 
erected in 1912. 
In 1908, a four-room, dilapidated, unsanitary fire-trap 
school house in Greenfork Township gave way to a modern e 
room building. This building is not only sanitary and me 
in every particular, but is an architectural beauty. It is situ 
in a maple grove near the center of the township and accommo« 
the pupils from six districts. 
The high school maintained here has grown from a three y 
course of six months to a four years’ course of eight months 
was commissioned in 1911. The per cent of attendance of 
eighth year graduates has increased from 80 per cent to 97 per 
since the erection of this building. 
In 1908, the trustee of White River Township found hit 
facing the problem of several small schools and poor buildin 
the western part of his township. It was deemed advisab! 
build a consolidated school. To this end a four-room buil 
was erected at a cost of $14,000. Many people looked up 
as a foolish undertaking, as it was situated entirely remote 
any town or village. In fact, at the dedication of this buil 
known as the “Lincoln,” prophets were heard to say that 
time would never come when the building would be half f 
This school began with an enrollment of forty-three. Its

As some of the high school children were transported from t

1909, Parker abandoned its school corporation and its manage- 
t was assumed by Monroe Township. A new building was 
ssary. Four acres of ground near town were purchased by 
trustee and a building costing $24,500 was erected. This. is 
equipped and maintains a commissioned school having twelve 
ners. The children in the western half of the township are 
sported by wagons and interurban trolley to this school. This 
ling is equipped for manual training, sewing, cooking, botany, 
ulture, and physics. There yet remain four district schools. 
per cent of attendance of eighth year graduates has increased 
67 per cent to 90. 
e banner year for school house construction was 1910, as 
townships erected buildings that year. 
leen Township erected a six-room $19,000 building upon a 
-acre school lot in the center of the township. This is the 
township in the county to have complete consolidation, as 
the eight schools are now abandoned and transported to the 
1 school. For five years previous to the establishment of 
chool but 21 per cent of its eighth year graduates enrolled 
h school. This low per cent is perhaps due to the fact that 
igh schools were near this township. The growth of this 
has been remarkable, and a four years’ certified high school 
intained. The per cent of attendance of the eighth year 
tes has increased from 21 to 92 per cent; every member 
class of 1911 enrolled. This school is certified. 
son Township is another that built in the year 1910. Its

the lack of room. Every indication points to the building « 
addition in the very near future. Five schools are centralize 
this place, and the enrollment of eighth year graduates ha 
creased from 31 to 95 per cent. 
Ward Township had a high school at Saratoga previous t¢ 
year 1910, but Saratoga is in an extreme corner of the town 
which made the high school inaccessible to most of the childr 
the township. Two schools abandoned for lack of attend: 
together with three abandoned by petition were centralized it

graduates in the territory covered by this school has increased 
31 per cent to 92 per cent. It is only a question of a short 
until this building must be increased, as it is now too sme 
permit of manual training or. domestic science. 
In the spring of 1911 the Board of Health condemned the 
school building between Nettle Creek and West River Town 
at Modoe, and the trustees of these townships built a five- 
building at a cost of $18,000. During the summer three dis 
schools petitioned to be abandoned and consolidated with 
school at Modoc. The high school, which had been a two y 
course of seven months, was put upon a commissioned basis 
mediately, and has grown from an attendance of 15 to 40.

because of lack of room. 
At the same time in which the Modoc school building wa: 
demned another building in West River Township at Hun 
was also condemned, but the Board of Health realizing t 
township would be burdened by building two buildings duri 
same year extended the time of condemnation to 1912. I 
summer of 1912 a four-room building was erected at Hun 
at a cost of $15,000. This school, like the one at Modoc, ha: 
increased from a two years’ course of seven months and 
upon a commissioned basis. Three abandoned schools are 
ported to this school, leaving only two district schools in the 
ship. The eighth year enrollment has increased from 68 p

n the spring of 1912 four districts in the central part of Wayne 
vnship petitioned to be abandoned and consolidated in a central 
vol. To this end five acres of ground were purchased and a 
tract let for a seven-room building at a cost of $23,000. At 
time of writing this article the building is not finished. The 
les are being taught in the various abandoned districts, and 
two years’ high school is being conducted in a one-room build- 
These schools will occupy the new building upon its com- 
ion. The high school is put upon a commissioned basis and 
s every evidence of being as successful as the others of the county. 
44 per cent of the eighth year graduates for the past five years 
e entered high school.

ied above we have made no attempt to enumerate such rooms

n. Each building has from two to six of such rooms which 
as valuable in their place as the rooms mentioned in the 
ription. 
hese buildings have been built according to the rules and regu- 
ons of the State Board of Health, as to lighting, heating, and 
tilating. The heating is by furnace and steam, the ventilation 
ig by fans. Automatic regulation is installed in most of these 
dings, thus insuring a constant temperature. The flush system 
oilets is made possible by cess-pools, which are easily drained 
which have proved very satisfactory. 
e cost given is in most cases the contract price and does not 
de any improvements or equipment. 
some cases the old school buildings are used for barns and in 
irs new barns are built. These are used for the horses of the 
drivers and of children who furnish their own transportation. 
ese barns are constructed so that by removing a temporary 
the school hacks may be stored during the summer. 
ese buildings are constructed for a broader purpose than 
iy school buildings. Many of them have become the centers 
immunity interests because of their facilities for the accommo- 
in of public gatherings. Many of the townships have no 
public buildings of sufficient size to accommodate general 
ngs of the community. Without exception these buildings 
auditoriums which are made by combining two to four rooms, 
lometimes the corridor. Folding doors of unusual height are 
or this purpose. These auditoriums vary in size, depending 
le size of the building, but in most instances will seat from 
400 people. These facilities have brought about many 
ainments such as are given in lecture courses of high quality.

Commencements, township institutes, both teachers’ and farm 
political meetings, Sunday School conventions, farmers’ orgar 
tions, parents’ and teachers’ meetings — in fact all meetings fo 
in any high grade community are being held in these buildi 
This has brought about a closer relation between patrons, child 
and the schools, and this alone is well worth the extra cost of 
auditorium. 
These schools have brought about a higher appreciation of sc 
work in advance of the eighth grade. Families are now represe1 
in the high schools of the township which were never represe! 
before. Children no longer are discussing the question of stop 
at the eighth grade, because they have in their own midst an 
stitution of higher learning. We know of no more convin 
proof of the above influences than a reference to the statist 
report of the county. In 1908-09, the year before these sch 
were started outside the towns, this county had 371 eighth gi 
pupils enrolled, 191 high school pupils. In 1911-12, by a stre 
coincidence, the report shows the same number of eighth gi 
pupils, but the enrollment in the high school has increased f 
191 to 417. Seventy-one per cent of the pupils of the towns 
of the county are in consolidated schools. 
This influence not only reaches to those of the eighth year 
extends entirely throughout the grades, and the general attit 
of these lower grades toward the schools and school problem 
perceptibly better. As one reflects upon the schools of the ] 
and compares them with those of the present with all their | 
vantages the question arises, “What great things are in stor 
the children of the next generation?” 
The greatest problem in consolidated schools is the transport 
of the children. This can be best done only by the best m 
drivers with the best teams to be had, and these attached t 
best hacks possible. Too great care cannot be taken to insur 
best service in this line. The hack routes must be as sho: 
possible so that children may be in the wagons for a mini: 
period only. The hacks should be commodious, warm, and 
ventilated. To this end the trustees of this county are purch 
only hacks that have glass sides and ventilators. They s 
be heated by coal stoves and thus eliminate any fumes. 
The glass sides give good opportunity for ventilators and i 
plenty of light, both of which are not only essential to good 
but are conducive of good deportment. Hack drivers whi 
merly drove the hacks with curtained sides report that th 
cipline in the modern hacks is much better. This is due | 
to the fact that the hacks have plenty of light and that the c

‘ance against accidents while crossing railroads. 
The hacks used here have double floors, which also adds much 
the comfort of the children. 
Good roads are also a necessity to successful transportation.

mail routes, bring about good roads, as the best service is only 
sible under the most favorable conditions. 
nly men of the highest moral worth should be employed as 
ers. As much care should be exercised in the selection of a 
ik driver who has charge of the children to and from school as 
lhe teacher who has charge of them while in school. The best 
en can only be secured when the position pays the price de- 
ded by a first-class man. Bids for driving a hack should never 
aken by a trustee as this brings about unsatisfactory com- 
tions. 
e rules and regulations of the hack service should be a part

The following extracts from Kansas and Missouri §$ 
School Reports point out the desirability of general cot 
educational reorganization. The Missouri extract uses B 
County as an illustration of what could be accomplished u 
such a plan for educational administration. This is only 1

ing under the county-unit plan. What both propose is 1 
is provided for in the required county educational reorgat

1. Fundamental Rural Needs in Missouri 
[From 46th An. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr. Missouri, 1905, pp. 27- 
At a recent conference of nearly a hundred leading teache 
the State, the sentiment in favor of a revision of the educati 
provisions of the State Constitution was nearly unanimous. F 
the school standpoint, the purposes would be to adjust the fina 
support of the different parts of our articulated system of ed 
tion. The ends to be accomplished are: (1) Fixing a permai 
support for all State institutions by a definite State levy, pla 
the burden on all property in the State equally, offering to e 
section of the State and to every young man and woman e 
opportunity for technical and higher training; (2) making 
county a taxable and school administrative unit, to provide s 
dary schools and to exercise supervisory control over eleme 
schools; (3) providing for larger school districts, popularly d| 
nated as “consolidated districts,” with larger liberty in le 
school taxes than is now given to school districts. 
The state needs to have its assessed valuation increased 
per cent at once. This can be done under laws now on the sta’ 
by county assessors and county and state boards of equaliz: 
if they will but do their full duties. There is neither justic 
law in the present custom of assessing property at from 25 
per cent of its actual value. .. . 
The apportionment of this money should encourage the form]

consolidated school districts, or township districts — about 
}0 in all, instead of 10,000 as at present. The manner of ap- 
tionment should induce every community to do all it is able 
lo for itself... . 
et us see what would be the results of such a reorganization, 
pplied to Bates county. This county has, in round numbers, 
0 children of school age; enrolled last year 7800 children; and 
an average attendance, for 156 days, of about 4800 children. 
re were 220 teachers in 140 districts, receiving an average 
ual salary of less than $300. The present assessed valuation 
roperty is $12,000,000, including railroad, telegraph and tele- 
ne lines; perhaps 300 boys and girls, nine-tenths of whom live 
owns, are in high schools. The rate of tax-levy is 51 cents, 
ch produces about $60,000 from local taxes. The total ex- 
diture for school purposes is $80,000. 
he State contributes about $12,000 of this, about $9,000 of 
ch the county pays into the state treasury as taxes. This is a 
showing for one of the best counties of the state. 
That should it be? The average attendance should be 6000 
the average length of term should be 160 days — no district 
ing less than eight months. The number of districts should 
educed to about 20, through consolidation. The total number 
sachers should be reduced to 200, giving four or more teachers 
2ach township school district. The average annual salary 
iid be $400 with no salary in the county less than $40 per 
th. The assessed valuation of property should be increased 
118,000,000. There should be 20 good two-year high schools, 
in each district, enrolling 400 pupils. There should be one or 
central high schools, for more advanced and special work, 
ling at least 400 more. There should be a state school-tax 
of 10 cents, a county school-tax levy of 10 cents, and a district 
l-tax levy of not less than 40 cents, — averaging 50 cents 
lent average about 65 cents). This would give, counting 
e from permanent funds, about $80,000 to pay 200 elemen- 
teachers and $20,000 for incidentals, supplies, and repairs 
e 20 district schools. The county board would thus have 
0 with which to maintain 20 small high schools and one or 
rst-class central high schools, and to employ efficient super- 
for all of the schools. Under such an organization, $100,000 
$130,000 spent on elementary and secondary schools in 
county would be raised by direct tax on county property. 
other $30,000, would be apportioned from the state 
‘y, a larger part of which would be raised from corpo- 
taxes and from permanent investments. In addition to

the above, Bates county should spend annually $30,000 for 
buildings. 
If we multiply expenditures, number of teachers, and numb: 
pupils by one hundred, we will get about what the result woul 
for the entire state. 
2. A Larger Unit of School Organization 
[From the Report of the Educl. Com. of Kansas, 1910, in the 
Bien. Rept. Supt. Publ. Instr. Kas., 1909-1910, pp. 34-36.] 
The Educational Commission, appointed by the State Teacl 
Association in October, 1901, begs leave to submit the folloy 
report: 
* * * * * * * 
4. A larger unit of school organization. 
This committee has given careful consideration to the ques 
of a larger unit of organization for the schools of Kansas ar 
fully convinced that the enactment of a law making the cor 
the basis of organization would be highly beneficial to the ¢ 
of general education. 
Three units of organization are in use in the various state 
the Union; the district, the township, and the county. 1] 
than half of the states are organized on the district basis. 
New England states, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and a 
other states have adopted the township system. The Sout’ 
states use the county plan. Iowa and South Dakota have rec 
undertaken the adoption of the county unit. Committee: 
the codification of the school laws in several other states 
recommended it for adoption. Many schoolmen and o 
who are giving their attention to the practical working of s 
affairs and to the consideration of plans for the improveme 
schools to meet the needs of the times are urging the adopti 
the county as the unit of organization. Wherever the plai 
been given a trial the results are highly satisfactory. 
The following are a few reasons for the superiority of the e 
unit over the district system: 
1. It is less expensive. This has been true in most places 
it has been tried. In the comparatively few instances in 
the cost of schools has been increased, the superior faciliti 
forded have more than counterbalanced the additional outl 
2. It equalizes taxes levied for school purposes. In one 
in Kansas the valuation of a certain school district is only $6

    THE RURAL SCHOOL PROBLEM 277 
nother district $3,521,000. The tax levied in the first district 
sven mills; in the second no tax was required this year. In 
other wealthy districts the levy was only four-tenths of a mill. 
er counties in the state now show similar conditions. Certainly 
valid reason can be given why one man should pay fifteen or 
nty times as much for the education of his children as another, 
ully wealthy, should pay for the same privilege. Under the 
ity system railroad and other corporation taxes would be more 
sly distributed and present conditions greatly improved. 
It insures equality of school provisions as to schoolhouses, 
aratus, and other school equipment, thus making greater uni- 
1ity of attainment possible. 
It secures for teachers greater permanency of position. 
ler the district system, the teacher often loses her position on 
unt of petty neighborhood quarrels. Such conditions would 
ess likely to affect the school under county organization and 
ter efficiency would be a natural result of the longer tenure of 
e of teachers. 
The county system reduces the number of schools and in- 
ses the number of pupils in attendance at each, thus making 
ible better grading and classification and adding the inspira- 
of numbers. 
It is a means, possibly the only one, of obtaining that closer 
rvision necessary to bring the common schools to the highest 
ee of efficiency. The single visit paid by the county superin- 
lent to the district school annually can accomplish but little 
e way of efficient supervision. The county system renders 
ible the appointment of assistant superintendents or super- 
's who can visit schools often enough to be of some real service 
em. 
It eliminates all district boundary disputes, having a decided 
ntage in this respect over both district and township systems. 
It makes consolidation of schools easy and practicable. The 
er efficiency of consolidated schools, because of their better 
ings, better equipment, more competent teachers, more 
ugh supervision, more careful grading and classification, 
itted by all educators and by all patrons familiar with them. 
efully worked out plan of consolidation for the country 
ls of our state would be of inestimable value to the cause 
cation. 
is committee is in favor of immediate steps being taken to 
ish the county system in the state of Kansas. Many reasons 
added to the above for its adoption. We believe that this 
be a great forward movement for the common schools and

The Vermont Educational Commission (1913) recommer 
that a comprehensive state scheme for educational reorga: 
tion be effected, with the end in view of creating a seri 
consolidated schools in the towns, each in turn connected 
a complete high school, and each such group of schools 
towns to be under the supervision of a full-time superinten 
of schools. This is not essentially different in principle 
the county-unit idea, as found in Maryland or Georgia. 
It is only in such consolidated schools, however organ 
that a curriculum suited to rural-life needs of the present 
future can be provided, and it is only in such places that | 
munity-center schools capable of real rural service can b¢ 
veloped. The following extract, dealing with the school sy 
of an essentially rural state, points out clearly the need o 
directing the curriculum of the rural schools if they are t 
made to meet rural needs. 
3. Rural School Needs in Vermont    
  [From Study of Education in Vermont, Carnegie Foundation f 
Advancement of Teaching, Bul. No. 7, 1914, pp. 8-13.]      
        One conclusion stands out as the fundamental and imp 
outcome of this study. It is that the chief problem with 
the state is concerned is the care and development of its eleme} 
and secondary schools. No one whose vision is true woul 
to belittle the problem of higher education, but in rural com: 
ties, such as prevail in Vermont, the problem of the common 
overshadows all others. So overwhelming is its importan 
it is not too much to say that if the state develops an efficie 
fruitful system of elementary and secondary schools, and 
sure of an effective source from which teachers for the elem: 
and secondary schools may be drawn, the essential probl 
education for Vermont is solved.

  THE RURAL SCHOOL PROBLEM 279 
he detailed studies that follow show that of the nearly 1700 
oolhouses in the state, nearly 1400 are one-room school build- 
‘s — nearly all of these rural schools. Of the 83,000 children 
-ween the ages of five and seventeen, 57,000 are attending the 
mentary schools. Few of these children enter the school before 
years of age, and practically none remain after sixteen. For 
se elementary schools there are required about 2400 teachers, 
se pay is between $8 and $9 weekly. The future of Vermont 
her citizens is to be wrought out in these schools and by these 
hers. 
a similar way the detailed study elsewhere presented shows 
the problem of secondary education in Vermont has the rural 
ation as its essential factor. To make these two agencies, the 
entary school and the secondary school, effective in forming 
lives of the children is the fundamental problem which con- 
ts the state. 
study of the detailed reports will make it clear that, notwith- 
ding the great amount of devotion put into the separate schools, 
notwithstanding also the intelligence applied by this or that 
visor, the elementary and secondary schools of Vermont 
for years been conducted upon a curriculum whose tendency 
draw children away from the homes in which they were born. 
ithstanding certain improvements, the school still fails to 
lest them directly and efficiently in the life about them. This 
ition is dealt with in the two sections relating to the elemen- 
and secondary schools. These sections carefully discuss the 
mental questions, What is the elementary school for? What 
f school can serve fruitfully and efficiently the aspirations, 
eeds, and the vocational wants of a rural population? 
er the answers to these questions have been completely 
d out or not, it seems clear that at least four things must be 
n order to bring the elementary and secondary school system 
mont to the point where, as an agency of civilization, it will 
he requirements of its people. 
it, there must be adopted in the elementary school, and later 
high school, a course of study related to the life of the child. 
loes not mean that the strong intellectual motive of the ele- 
‘y school must be abandoned. The value of studies like 
ther tongue and elementary mathematics can never be ques- 
but it is clear that the domination of the college and of 
tion for college has had an undue effect upon the courses of 
nd the methods of instruction even in the elementary 
ninety-five per cent of whose children are never to enter

ception of: eaucation and partly out of a failure to accomp! 
practically-the res lt aimed at. That human being is educa 
who has been so trained as to make the best out of the place 
life in which he finds himself, taking into account his full capac 
— spiritual, intellectual, economic. Education is therefore a. | 
ative, not an absolute term. The school as the agency of educat 
is founded upon this conception, but tradicional school meth 
tend constantly to obscure it and to harden into specifics unrela 
to the life experience of the children. As a minimum the sch 
should do at least three things for the child — teach him s 
discipline, teach him to think, and strengthen his relations to 
social and industrial interests of his community. It is not too m 
to say that not alone in Vermont, but throughout our states, in 
country-side schools the children are put through the grades w 
a régime which gives them little self-discipline, dulls their mij 
with artificial repetitions and routine tasks, and, so far as it 
cates them at all, educates them away from the life in which 
have grown up. Any form of school that weakens the ch 
interest in the life of his community is deficient in the elem 
requisite of the school as an agency of civilization. Somethi 
radically wrong with a school in an agricultural community 
develops motormen, stenographers, and typewriters, and 
to develop farmers, dairymen, and gardeners. A course of s 
prepared with the view of correcting this condition is the first 
in reform. 
As a part of elementary and secondary instruction there s 
be included the gradual development of vocational facilities. 
chief industry in Vermont to-day is agriculture, and while 
facturing is also making strides, it may fairly be assumed th: 
many years to come agriculture will remain the chief vocati 
its citizens, and the development gradually of a sufficient m 
of trade schools or courses in agriculture should be a part 
school program. Such schools will naturally form a part 
regular system of schools, and their development will be a 
the work of the board of education and its experts, work 
unison with the towns. 
Secondly, there should be provided for the school syst 
Vermont an educational administration that shall supervij 
schools as a whole, and that shall bring to every high sch 
to every elementary school genuine, sympathetic educ 
advice. It has been pathetic to see the eagerness with wh 
tural school teacher reaches out for educational help.

ol deepen when one sees the devotion, the ener, ~, and cften- 
s the great natural teaching ability that are disr'ayed by a 
| elementary school teacher. Any system‘of educational ad- 
istration that is to be successful must provide the means by

pathetically, intel#gently, and skilfully help them to correct 
akes and to strengthen their own-good qualities. This means

nally, agencies must be provided by which the requisite number 
‘ained teachers can be obtained for the elementary schools — 
hers who shall have had some training not only in arithmetic 
in geography and in English, but shall have had a training 
in the social point of view from which they must approach 
- work. The future of Vermont lies in the hands of these 
hers, and no single act that the state government can perform 
ore important than that which seeks to provide the means for 
ing in the right way an adequate supply of teachers for the 
entary rural schools. As a practical matter this means that a 
ty-two-year-old young woman, paid at present at the low 
of about eight and a half dollars a week, must be fitted for 
task, and that her education for the teacher’s calling must be 
within easy reach of her home. 
* * * * * * * 
far, therefore, as the results of this study concern the general 
c school system of Vermont, they are contained in the recom- 
ation: Establish a competent educational administration ; 
it from political interference ; give it a free hand to work out a 
e of study that shall meet the people’s needs, to train teachers

   CHAPTER XI 
STATE EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION 
Tue material of this chapter will relate to the State St 
intendency, State Boards of Education, and state educat 
organization. : 
I. Evo.ution oF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENCY 
The first chief state school officer provided for was in 
York, in 1812. Since then every state in the Union has 
vided for such an officer. The title of the chief school o 
is usually State Superintendent of Public Instruction, or ‘ 
missioner of Education, the latter term having been adc 
in all recent reorganizations. The evolution of the office 
be seen from the table on pp. 283-287. 
Il. 
The enumerated powers and duties of the State Superinte 
of Public Instruction of Oregon are typical for those 
in which the office is filled by popular election, and relate 
to the common school system. Duties oF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT

anuary, 1913, pp. 19-21.] 
he first great point of weakness in our system of educational 
inistration is the method of selecting a State Superintendent 
ublic Instruction by popular vote. Such a man rarely employs 
obvious influence of the place to do more than strengthen his 
hold upon it. Popular election stands as an insuperable 
to the extension of the powers of the superintendent. The 
otion of the efficiency of our rural schools absolutely demands 
the superintendent possess regulatory instead of simply rec- 
endatory powers over the work of such schools. Such a 
requires genuine administrative ability and technical training, — 
ities which are not often found in company with the arts by 
th an educator commends himself to the managers of a great 
ical party, or with the larger talent for self exploitation which 
e only substitute for such managerial support. The superin- 
ency in a great state requires years of experience, and ought 
the culmination of a successful career. The choice of super- 
dents should not be limited to the narrow field of California, 
should be made from the country at large. All this is im- 
ble if the place is filled by election. Real experts in good 
ions will not risk the chances of the wheel of politics. A 
nm of New York, for example, cannot stand for election in 
fornia. It is a general principle of political science that experts 
t be chosen by election. 
would seem, therefore, that the Superintendent of Public 
luction should be appointed by some authority. This result 
e reached in the course of the movement for a “ short ballot” 
is not anticipated by educational reform. It is not unreason- 
o urge that the superintendent should be appointed by the 
mor and that education should be made simply one of the 
tments of state government. There are, however, certain 
erations which weigh very heavily against such a plan. 
tion is by very many times the most important branch of 
istration in the state, both as to the magnitude and multi-
-P-A-G-E-314
  292 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
tude of its activities. It is easily first in the amount of mor 
expended, the number of persons employed and the proportion 
the population directly affected. Over this vastest of pul 
enterprises the superintendent of public instruction should exerc 
a great and positive control. From these facts flow two importi 
conclusions. The first is that, under present political conditio 
in a state where traditions of expert administration are by no me: 
firmly established, it is unsafe to give the governor the appoi 
ment of an officer who is, or should be, so powerful. The tem: 
tion of such an easy opportunity to put the educational syste: 
the state into “ politics ” might well prove too much for a weak 
ambitious governor. The only protection, beyond this dubi 
one of the gubernatorial conscience, would be an enlighte’ 
public sentiment for expert service which is only just begin 
to make itself felt in California. The mere fact that the pre 
governor is honest and capable should not blind us to the poss 
action of his successors. The second conclusion is that the 
of educational administration is so broad and involves so m 
that is technical and professional that the governor has not 
time nor the training necessary for its successful supervision. 
is by no means always capable of intelligently criticising the su 
intendent, and never could find the time for exercising this 
pability if he had it. Several months’ service in the office of 
most vigorous and active governor in the history of California| 
given the writer an intimate knowledge of the crowded life o: 
state executive. There is no time in his office for checking] 
conduct of a superintendent of public instruction. 
The only alternatives would be election by the legislatu: 
appointment by a state board of education. The first of 
alternatives has against it every argument which might be 
ployed against appointment by the governor, and many 
The comparative irresponsibility of the individual legislator 
it possible in that body to undertake political thuggery, whic! 
worst governor would never even contemplate. We are 
therefore, only the last alternative, appointment by the 
board of education. This body, if properly constituted, 
select a superintendent on a rational basis, and effectively cri 
and control him after selection.

V. Srate EpucaTIoNaL ORGANIZATION 
The following comments and extracts from important r 
documents lay down fundamental principles relating to 
educational organization. 
1. The State Board of Education 
[Extract from an article on “A Constitutional State Boa 
Education,” by Reed, Thomas H., in Sierra Educational ; 
January, 1913, pp. 21-24.] 
(A continuation of the article on pp. 291-292) 
This naturally leads us to a consideration of the State Bo: 
Education. We are at present treated to the unusual spe 
in absolute defiance of the normal arrangement of such institi 
of an elected, political superintendent and an ex-officio, 
board. They have no necessary relation to one another 
that the superintendent is a member of the board. As to the 
itself there is nothing to be said against the honesty or comp 
of its individual members. They hold positions which gual 
their qualifications. It has done some things well, notab 
raising of the standard for admission to the teaching prof 
It has done some things not so well, especially its principal 
selecting textbooks. As compared with the ex-officio bo 
education in other states, it is, of course, composed too excli 
of persons engaged in normal school work to the neglect 
mary and secondary education. The chief difficulty wi

      ard, however, is that it'is made up of very busy persons whose 
lll time is taken up with the important duties of the responsible 
ecutive positions which they fill and who, in consequence, can 
e but meagre attention to the business of the board. The 
sent board is tolerable but not over satisfactory in its organ- 
tion, while its relation to the Superintendent of Public instruc- 
m and the administration of education is wholly erroneous. 
‘rom the point of view of the student of administration in gen- 
] it appears almost self-evident that the functions of adminis- 
tive boards are properly selective and supervisory. Actual 
inistration, however, should belong to the officials selected by 
board for this purpose. Such boards choose their expert ser- 
ts, watch over them, mitigate the rigors of their professionalism, 
stand between them and political pressure. Just as it is 
essary to have on a modern automobile a “ shock absorber ” 
inimize the jars of its operation, so it is necessary to have

le for a combination of lay and professional service. In Ger- 
y laymen and experts serve side by side on the various boards 
committees which administer the several units of local govern- 
t. The lay members are always in a majority numerically, 
giving them potential control. President Lowell in his “ Goy- 
ent of England ” ascribes the merit of English administration 
ly to the characteristic union of lay, political, and responsible 
rs with professional, non-political officers responsible only

administration of education. Where it has gone wrong it 
een because one party or other to the combination did not

lachusetts and New York.

board would pass to the superintendent and the other experts 
his office. The members of the board should receive no p 
except the necessary expenses incident to attendance on meetin; 
They should, of course, be men and women of superior educati 
and capacity. It is impossible, however, to frame an educatio 
qualification on any rational basis, and the character of the bo

means a satisfactory method, and this is especially true where 
traditions as to the character of the persons to be chosen are 
established. The governor’s responsibility for a bad appointm| 
would be clearer, and his motive to make good appointments ¢| 
sequently more effective. The term should be a long one and 
members of the board should retire in rotation, so that no 
governor could obtain political control of it. The term shoul

during his term a majority of the board. Since he could not 
himself politically by controlling its power and patronage, he w’ 
naturally, aim to secure such credit as he might by good app:

Such are the main outlines of a suitable organization of our 
administration of education. The next step is the consider 
of the practical measures to be taken to secure it. [The a

‘he educational systems of the various states, like the bodies of 
under which they are operated, have grown up in a more or less 
hazard manner to meet the most imperative needs of rapidly 
easing populations and rapidly changing conditions. At the 
inning the schooling of children was left wholly to the initiative 
he local communities, and rightly so for the reason that differ- 
s in social and industrial conditions, the customs, predilections 
ideals of the people made the educational needs of a state 
mtially diverse. Moreover, a central body of any kind was 
remote to act effectively as a stimulating and regulating 
cy. Not only were the support and management of schools 
latter of merely local concern, but it was often left to each 
munity to say whether it should have any school at all. All 
was justifiable under the conditions then existing. But con- 
ms have changed. Close interrelations of the various com- 
ities in all the states of the Union have been developed with 
rapidity. The development of system in the educational 
of the states, however, did not always keep pace with them. 
strial and social conditions, customs and ideals, the popula- 
itself, have become practically homogeneous. A central 
to exercise supervision over the schools of a state is not now 
te either in time or in space. Education has become distinctly a 
function. The doctrine that the taxable property of the 
state should educate the children of the state has been 
ally accepted. Complete state educational systems are, 
‘ore, needed, and a state board of education with liberal powers, 
pportunity for discretion in matters of detail, is an indispen- 
part of such system. 
of the greatest advantages to be derived from a state board 
cation is systematic organization of the educational forces

the educational work of a state is, in one of its aspects, a 
s proposition. In Illinois, for instance, there are a million 
to be instructed, 13,000 buildings erected for that purpose,

  28,000 teachers employed, all involving an expenditure 
$32,000,000. If this vast business were put in the hands 
business men they would instinctively begin immediately to 
troduce system in order to eliminate the present waste of educati 
and thus increase the ratio of educational results to educati 
expenditure. They would probably create not only an execu’ 
head of the business to insure swift action, but also a boar 
directors to give counsel, and to lay down rules within which 
activity should be exercised. 
A state board of education for the state corresponds in a wa;

This need will be the more conspicuous if we consider the

upon the superintendent and confers upon him nine dit 
powers. Some of these duties and powers are of the most g 
nature... . It is clear that a board of education might r 
him of some of these duties, as well as assist him by counsel. 
a board would be of invaluable assistance to him in impr 
upon the people of the State the ideas which he wishes to b

county under the supervision of a county superintendent of

It was said that such efforts were a reflection on the exist- 
chool authorities, that they contemplated a dangerous central-

main objection to the creation of a State Board of Educa- 
that it involves an undesirable, if not dangerous, central- 
of power. To this it may be said that, in this case, the fear 
partly from a failure to distinguish between a true central- 
of power and an organization of functions or duties. When 
rintendent of public instruction is provided for, he is usually

clothed with great power. But the special activities necessai 
connected with the full exercise of this power are distributed am 
various agencies. To gather them up, organize and unify th 
under a central board should not be regarded as a centralizat 
of power as usually implied by that expression. 
The second objection is that a board of education may be so ¢ 
stituted as to be or to become a political body with selfish or pa 
san ends and with no deep and abiding interest in educati 
problems or the welfare of the schools. This is a real danger, 
it may be avoided by the adoption of a wise method of constitu 
a board. The experience of the various states seems to poin’ 
the selection of the members of the State Board of Educatio 
appointment as the least objectionable. ... Only one s 
board of education in the country is elected by popular vote, 
this is a board whose powers and duties are relatively few 
simple. Constitution by appointment is, therefore, in har 
with the practice of other states as well as in accordance with] 
conclusions reached from a purely rational consideration of 
subject. 
We may say, then, in concluding the discussion of the 
Board of Education, that such a body should increase the effici 
of a school system by introducing greater economy, and by ine 
ing its responsiveness to newly arising conditions and n 
that it involves no dangerous centralization of power, th

ing the chief school officer of the State to perform more effici 
the duties imposed upon him by law, but which under pr 
circumstances are too often such as no single officer can adeqi 
perform. The indications afforded by the development of 
cational administration are that state boards of education 
occupy an increasingly important relation to the educa 
activities of the various states.

A study of the chief historical stages in the educational evolu- 
n of the state for the past one hundred years furnishes justifi- 
ion for the statement that Vermont has never completely as- 
ed a definite constructive responsibility for the progressive 
elopment of the public school system; has never clearly re- 
ded this system as an institution and instrumentality of the 
monwealth. This may be accounted as a natural result of a 
bination of influences. Among these are the sturdiness and 
ependence of local communities under the characteristic New 
land scheme of government, the comparative isolation of the 
eral principal geographic sections of the state from one another, 
the absence of any dominating city centres of population. 
his absence of a positive state policy explains in large measure 
lack of a proper state machinery for the administration, super- 
ion, and inspection of the common schools and other public 
cational institutions. ‘ 
he establishment of the first State Board of Commissioners 
Yommon Schools in 1827 and its abolition in 1833; the creation 
he office of State Superintendent of Common Schools in 1845; 
refusal of the General Assembly to appoint a State Superin- 
ent in 1851 and the resulting absence of any state supervision 
he following five years; the creation of a State Board of Edu- 
nm in 1856, which continued until 1874, when the office of the 
e Superintendent was reéstablished; the creation of another 
le Board of Education in 1908 as the successor of a Board of 
al School Commissioners created in 1898; and the passage 
lhe legislature of 1912-13 of the act creating the present State 
d of Education with its partial and ambiguous authority over 
several parts of the educational system, — make clear the 
of a well-planned, continuous educational policy. 
casual examination of the general scheme of the state’s gov- 
ent of the system of education, and of the constitution and 
rs and duties of the several boards and officers composing 
educational government, reveals immediately a situation 
able to discontinuity of organization and to waste in operation. 
arked general tendency of the past two decades has been the 
opment throughout our American states of the type of school 
nment whereby an increasing authority and responsibility 
lentred in state boards and officers. This tendency is un- 
edly a consequence of the wider recognition of the funda- 
1 social policy that public education, in order to provide an 
x   
  
-P-A-G-E-328
306 STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
equitable distribution of educational opportunities, must 
assumed by the state rather than by local governmental uni 
— district, town, county, and city. The recognition of this lar; 
state responsibility results in the exercise of a large amount 
control directly by the state. This trend whereby the influe 
of the state in education is enlarged and vitalized is customar; 
expressed by the phrase, “ centralization of state control.” 
first and most evident result of this centralizing movement 
been the erection of a new form of state machinery for the oversi: 
of public educational activities, especially as regards elementa: 
secondary, special, and supplementary schools. This organizati 
is not intended to take away the rights of local communi 
to govern their own schools, nor to weaken their responsibil 
for school support. It aims simply to provide, along 
moderate financial aid, a system of scrutiny and supervision t! 
shall make for a wider school opportunity, more uniform co 
tions, and freedom from some of the more objectionable | 
limitations. The state is the only agency that can undertake 
function. a 
The former widely adopted plan of placing the common scl 
system of the state under the general direction of a Superinten 
of Public Instruction, elected by popular vote or chosen by 
legislature, is being replaced by a plan that assigns the pul 
school organization of the state to the general control of as: 
board or commission appointed by the governor, with or wit! 
legislative confirmation. Such a board or commission is usu 
designated as “‘ The State Board of Education.” Recent exa: 
of such boards, newly constituted or reorganized, are to be f 
in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Idaho, New Je 
and elsewhere. The modern state board of education emb 
the fundamental governmental principle of the immediate s 
ainty of the state over the public school. As to the essential 
stitution and internal organization of the centralized state b|

It is a representative board of laymen, few in number, rece’ 
no compensation, appointed and constituted in a manner pr 
ing for responsibility of performance and securing continui

The State Board of Education is the active deputy of the pi 
of the whole state. It is therefore composed of laymen ri 
than of those professionally engaged in the educational se 
or of those officially connected with other branches of state go

tives of particular educational institutions or other speci 
terests. Neither will it have any ex-officio members.

The Board of Education should not itself, individually or ec 
lectively through committees of its members, attempt to perfor 
executive functions. Within the defined statutory limits 
should aim to provide ways and means to carry out the pub 
educational policy determined by the legislature. The act 
execution of these policies belongs to the expert trained officers 
the board, in particular the commissioner of education, the ¢ 
of these officers, with whom first responsibility rests. In ad 
tion to this chief executive officer there ought to be a suffici 
number of assistant commissioners, supervisors, and inspect 
properly to care for the state’s share of responsibility for the e 
duct and development of the schools. The selection of th 
executive officers represents the most important function of 
board. 
The commissioner should be a man of such breadth of ed 
tion, of such special training, of such varied educational experie 
and with such a record of successful performance, as will en

He should be selected without reference to his residence within 
state, should be given an indefinite term of office, and shoul 
subject to dismissal only upon a two-thirds vote of the en| 
membership of the board. There should be attached to 
office a salary to be determined by the board, of sufficient siz 
attract and retain a skilful and successful man. The new stat 
Idaho, with a population smaller than that of Vermont scatt 
over an area nine times as large, pays its commissioner of ed 
tion $6000. 
The success of the educational administration will depend no| 
on the personnel of the board than on the abilities of the chief 
utive officer. Hitherto American governmental boards have 
reached a high order of efficiency. We are now developing in I 
numbers the type of man adapted for the duties of trustee

    ss of such a board is to govern, not to administer. To fill such 
place on a board of education is to render to the state service of 
e highest order. 
Acting through its officers, the Board of Education ought to 
ve general control of the entire educational system of the state. 
is will include not alone the elementary and secondary schools, 
cational schools, and any school established for the training of 
chers, but also schools for the training of special classes, the 
cational departments of charitable and penal institutions, 
all supplementary educational activities, including those 
ting to libraries, which are properly a part of the state educa- 
inal system. 
uch oversight will involve the estimation and preparation of a 
get for educational expenses, the enforcement of laws relating 
chools and other institutions of learning, the classification and 
fication of the public schools, the establishment of uniform 
rds and reports, the determination of the qualifications of 
hers and their certification for the elementary, secondary, and 
ial schools, and the recognition of certificates and diplomas 
other states. The board should, as the supervisor of the 
nditure of all state money for educational purposes, inspect 
stitutions and report upon their use of such funds. 
lhe board in coéperation with the state board of health should 
blish standards for the construction, arrangement, and sanitary 
pment of school buildings and school sites; and should direct 
medical inspection and study of public health as far as the 
lols are concerned. Such a program ought to include also a 
matic effort to inform the people of the whole state as to the 
rtunities of their own schools. A serious defect of the present 
tion lies in the fact that it is not easy for the average parent 
tain disinterested educational advice concerning his children, 
prejudiced information concerning the nearby agencies of 
tion. 
e necessity for such a board has already been fully realized 
ose who have given serious thought to the educational prob- 
lof the state. The creation of the existing board of education 
as a result of this conviction, and its creation was a long step 
direction of better organization and a clearer differentiation 
ities. The existing board is defective, however, particularly 
b restricted authority that is given to it and in its ambiguous 
mn to the superintendent of education. Its reorganization 
ordance with the following recommendatior~ would be the 
ary initial step for the establishment c” ite system of

rightly constituted board with competent experts will step by st 
revise the curriculum of the elementary and secondary school 
provide facilities for the training of teachers, and meet the oth 
problems of state education as they arise. 
It is recommended, therefore, that the existing state board 
education be reorganized so as to provide for a board of five me 
bers to be appointed by the governor, one member to be appoint 
each year for a term of five years; that this board have gene 
control of the entire educational system of the state; that

in the direction of economy and efficiency, if in addition to the 
set aside for the salaries of the commissioner and his deputi 
lump sum were for the first two years placed at the disposal o! 
board, to be accounted for subsequently in the form of an ite 
budget.

Jensive statement of the position of the modern state in 
education of citizens, and the responsibilities of the state

cchett, Henry S., in the 6th An. Rept. Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching, 1911, pp. 119-122.] 
he various states of the American Union have with prac- 
unanimity accepted the position that,the obligation for gen- 
education rests upon the state. This conclusion has been 
hed in the course of a hundred years of history, during which 
t of these states have grown from pioneer communities to 
monwealths of considerable population and wealth. 
he beginnings of the educational systems in all of the states 
» practically the same. Private initiative led the way. In 
r earlier history the state governments were only too glad 
ncourage any effort that looked toward education. Private 
viduals, denominations, and associations of citizens were 
uraged to start educational enterprises, whether they aimed 
e elementary schools or institutions of higher learning. 
t first in New England and the middle west, and much later 
he southern states, with increased population and increased 
rentiation in employment and increased wealth, the state 
rmments one by one undertook the creation of a general sys- 
of public schools, first of elementary and secondary schools, 
finally of institutions of higher learning as well, so that in 
of the states of the Union one finds to-day a system of 
al education reaching from elementary school to university, 
the control of the state. Alongside of these state tax-sup- 
d institutions are a number of institutions under private 
‘ol whose relation with the state system of education is ill 
d and rests in the main upon the ideal of education held by 
who conduct the separate institutions. It is only within the 
ecade that the question of relating these independent insti- 
s to the state-developed system of education has become a 
ng one. Until that time education of any sort was held 
so desirable that any kind of school was welcome. Further- 
the state systems were so incomplete that the privately 
ed school could find a place in either secondary or higher 
tion. With the gradual rounding out of the elementary and 
ary school systems of the various states this situation has

changed, and to-day the state begins to concern itself with 
relations of these institutions which exist under its laws, 
practically outside of its educational jurisdiction. Only wi 
afew years have the states growninto an educational self-consci 
ness and have begun to ask themselves how they ought to 
with these detached and unrelated schools. How, in fact, o1 
they to deal with their own institutions, which in many cases | 
had as little consideration for the general system of educa’ 
and have been as truly competing institutions, as have those 
were in the hands of private individuals? 
The development of the organized school system resemble: 
riously in its history the development of the system of railrc 
In the pioneer days any railroad built under any circumsta 
was welcome. It was only as the country grew up, as popula 
became more dense, and as industrial and political problems 
came more pressing, that the various states turned about to e: 
ine what kind of railroad system had grown up under this | 
régime, and to seek to bring into the hands of the state once 1 
some sort of authority over systems of railroads that had 
allowed to develop in such independence. 
The beginnings of this change of attitude on the part of 
various states toward educational systems are shown in the app 
ment in the last three years of commissions in one state or ano 
to deal with the question of education. In Iowa a single b 
has been appointed to take charge of the three state institut 
of higher learning. The state of Oklahoma, with character 
fearlessness, has appointed a single board to govern eighteen s 
institutions, of which eleven are educational. The state of 
ginia has appointed a commission to examine and to report 
the tight relations of all of its institutions of higher learning 
similar commission has been created in Kansas. 
In nearly all cases these commissions were originated fo: 
purpose of examining existing state institutions whose la 
codperation had become evident to the state authorities, b 
sooner do such commissions begin their work than they find t 
selves face to face with a much larger question, namely, 
sort of system of schools ought an American commonweal 
foster ? 
This is a very different question from that which was br 
to the attention of these commonwealths in their earlier e 
tional history, — as different as the problem of railroad regu 
in the central west to-day is from the problem of railroad) 
struction fifty years ago. It is a question that touches 
interest in the state, if it is answered fully and wisely, and t     
          
        
      
     
    
-P-A-G-E-335

er this question fully and wisely required the very best thinking 
which civilized and educated men are capable. 
t is generally admitted to-day in all countries that the state 
st furnish to all its citizens the opportunity for a general elemen- 
ty education. In the more advanced countries it is further 
ognized that the state must deal also with vocational training, 
ainly with industrial vocations and perhaps with professions. 
a word, a state that to-day addresses itself to the problem of 
cation must consider a system of schools which shall train the 
le population in those fundamentals that make for good citi- 
hip, and it must establish as well at the right points of articu- 
m with this system, industrial training schools appropriate to 
wants of the various communities, and it may foster in addi- 
a fair number of professional schools for those seeking to enter 
professions. It does not follow that because industrial educa- 
, for example, is a necessary part of modern educational train- 
that the state itself must establish the local schools which 
le particular communities, any more than it would be called 
to establish local schools to train doctors and lawyers and 
eers, but it does mean that the state, in considering its prob- 
of education and the system of schools that it will conduct, 
so plan that the system of schools established by it shall 
ter to the training of the individual in his vocation, whether 
vocation be an industry or a profession. 
needs only a statement of this problem to make clear the fact 
the question that these state commissions and that the states 
selves face to-day is a very much larger problem and a very 
more difficult one than the problem that the states have 
pted hitherto. For example, the matter of agricultural 
tion is one with which the state has dealt by the establish- 
of an agricultural and mechanical college, but the experi- 
f forty years has shown that such schools train men for pro- 
al life, not for industrial life, and that if men are to be 
ld effectively for the work of the farmer, local industrial 
g for agriculture must be established by the separate com- 
ies, either with state aid or without. But in any case such 
will not be established successfully unless the state in its 
ional supervision and in its educational policy provides a 
of schools that shall minister to agricultural training. 
e are to-day two notable examples of the attempt to deal 
is question, the one in Germany, the other in Japan. In 
rman Empire, as in the United States, the question of 
on is for the federated states, the local schools being con- 
and managed by local agencies, but under the supervision

of the state bureau of education, which is notably efficient and fe 
sighted. One finds here a combination of state and communi 
effort producing a truly national effect, due in large measure to t 
unifying supervision that comes from the state. 
Japan, on the other hand, has undertaken to create a new syst 
of schools fitted to the needs of its population, the experime’ 
being conducted entirely through the agency of the impe 
government. 
It is a hopeful sign that our American states have begun to dj 
with this question from the general, not from the local standpoi 
and although little progress has yet been made in determining 
to organize, how to supervise, and how to conduct a state sys 
of schools which shall minister at once to the general educatio 
the whole people and to the training of communities and of i 
viduals for particular vocations, the very fact that the s 
authorities have begun to think of the question is itself a ma 
of encouragement. One may well hope that the next ten y 
will see real progress toward carefully thought out and 
conducted state systems of education. The first steps w 
seem to be an educational study of the particular state, o: 
schools, of the industries of its inhabitants, and of the app: 
mate needs that the state is likely to feel in the various voca’ 
and professions. Following such a study, the state might 
lend itself to the gradual development of a system of schools 
shall undertake to minister to the whole population of the s 
both in the larger educational sense and in the vocational s 
It is out of some such experience and out of some such study 
our American states will develop, if they develop at all, syste 
education which shall answer the needs of the whole popul: 
The question at the moment for any one of these commonw 
is to find a body of experts competent to study the educa’ 
situation and to give governors and legislators wise and pra 
advice.

ur educational system — the colleges, the schools, and the 
emies — have had scarcely time to adjust themselves to one 
ge before they were called upon to make another. The col- 
, for example, have to a large extent discarded the old com- 
ory classical training, which at least had the merit of discipline 
thoroughness. In adopting a much broader and in many 
3 a more sensible curriculum they have not yet had time to 
1 any such stage of thoroughness as was attained under the 
orm. 
eanwhile, in the states of the American Union two movements 
- gone on which have tended to throw increased responsibility 
1 the school system. 
1e first has been the enormous progress in the industries and 
1e differentiation of vocation which has come with modern 
. Workmen no longer ply their callings in their own homes. 
7 are grouped in large factories, where each man becomes a 
alist. Under this régime the apprentice system has disap- 
ed, and the school to-day is called upon to do for the boy some- 
s like what his apprenticeship did for him a generation ago. 
very industrial community there must be provided a school 
h shall give the theoretical and some of the practical founda- 
; of vocational training, if the boy is to get this training in 
systematic or satisfactory way. 
second movement which has to do directly with educational 
ency is found in the recent tendency to place in the hands of 
hole people direct political power. During the past ten 
much of the political power that has been intrusted to repre- 
tives has been taken over in various states by the people 
selves. The direct primary, the initiative, the referendum, 
call, are all devices that grow out of the movement, whether 
r unwise, to place political power directly in the hands of the 
people. It needs only the smallest consideration to show 
if this movement is to continue, the general education of all 
s becomes an even more vital thing for a democracy than it 
een hitherto. 
la word, the question of education, the determination of the 
system of schools and of their effective codrdination and 
ct, is the most important question before each nation, but 
country does this question assume such importance as in a 
racy in which every citizen assumes full political respon-

VI. REORGANIZATION oF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION

ciation on Economy of Time in Education. Bulletin No. 
1918, United States Bureau of Education, pp. 23-25.] 
(b) Exementary Epucation SHoutp END wITH THE TWE: 
YEAR 
When we pass to a consideration of that social class w 
stands at the opposite extreme of those who go to college, we 
many grounds that suggest the wisdom of completing the ele 
tary school at the close of six years of instruction. 
In the first place, such expert testimony as we have indi 
the presence of considerable waste of time and energy in th 
mentary school. There is a very widespread belief among s 
men that the fundamental facts, habits, attitudes, and i 
demanded by the general needs of our civilization can be fix 
the nervous system of the child in six school years, particula: 
the less useful parts of the course of study are eliminated and 
efficient methods are introduced. 
In the second place, the compulsory-education law unde 
present organization gives society control of the child only 
enough to guarantee the ablest child eight years of general 
ing. It cannot guarantee him the additional years of voca 
education required to make him an efficient, self-supportin; 
self-reliant citizen. To shorten the elementary school 
years without impairing its efficiency is to guarantee every] 
who does not go to the high school some vocational educ} 
The need to guarantee some vocational education to the re 
pupils is so important that many careful students of social 
tions are ready to say that the compulsory school age mi 
extended to 16 years, so as to carry the least able elementary 
children, who now get no further than the fourth, fifth, o: 
school year, through one, two, or three years of vocational 
cation. 
In the third place, the six-year articulation is regarded n 
as a better ending point for the general elementary studies, 
a better beginning point for the secondary studies. Th 
certain inner physiological changes that usher in adolescen 
now occur at about the time when the average child mal 
transition from elementary to secondary school. The st 
outer and inner conditions are more or less coincident. Th 
 
-P-A-G-E-357

esulting school mortality is likely to be larger than it ought 
»; or school life is continued at a larger physical and nervous 
than ought to be the case. It would be a distinct gain for a 
to get fairly well started and adjusted to his new school life, 
tional or secondary, before the full weight of physiological 
nervous changes are thrust upon him.. The two adjustments 
be better cared for in series than together. 
rain, it is the opinion of schoolmasters in general that, for 
> who have the peculiar mentality to go on to the ordinary 
emic high school, it is decidedly more profitable to begin the 
gn languages at 12 than at 14 years of age. The same ad- 
age may be had in other subjects where a large acquisition of 
/is necessary to successful work. 
the case of those children who are more given to action than 
bstraction, it is equally profitable to begin to center their 
lectual work about an active vocation early. To begin 
tional education, with its practical life-career appeal, at 12 
ar than at 14 is to save many children from truancy and 
terest. It will extend their school life so that they will not 
90 early driven into unprofitable and futureless employment. 
y will still take up much general training parallel with and 
vated by their broad study of vocational work. 
sre again the practicality of a reorganized elementary school 
d finds adequate sanction in experience. We have only to 
to the concrete efforts in this direction that have already been 
by American schoolmen. Suchexperiments as have been tried 
erican school systems under practical operating conditions, 
with certainty that the elementary school may be reduced to 
years; and that there is an almost equally strong probability 
lan elementary school of six years would be fully as efficient. 
e the seven-year school has been tried, the school officials 
generally anticipate a six-year plan. The organization of 
high schools out of the two upper grammar-grades and the 
ear high-school class is a distinctly successful move in the 
direction. Here the high school begins to reach down into 
ammar school. The establishment of separate departmental 
s in the elementary system, consisting of the two upper ele- 
ry years and given over to manual activities, is the voca- 
movement beginning to claim its own from the elementary 
system. All sorts of successful experimentation tending 
rict the general elementary curriculum to six years give at 
entative, fragmentary approval to the practicality of the

SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The Focus of Educational Control. — The most salient fea 
of American social-educational development of the two dec 
connecting the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is to be fc 
in the public secondary school. From causes that lie dee 
the nature of our political and economic institutions the 
school, besides being widely established, is undergoing a 1 
rapid evolution. This evolution is producing differenti 
types of schools, the survival of which will determine som 
the dominant characteristics of the educational system. 
arguments and data relating to secondary education bro 
together in this chapter contain some evidence of the prob 
that must yet be met before the public high school is orie 
in the educational organization.

      mality of that part of section 1, chapter 224, page 326, of the 
ws of 1899 (section 6305, General Statutes, 1901), authorizing 
jes of the second class to maintain high schools in whole or in 
rt by collecting a tuition fee from each pupil. 
he judgment for the plaintiffs rendered in the district court of 
glass County was affirmed. The decision of Justice Green is 
ught to deserve careful reading by all those interested in the 
elopment and the protection of the American free public school 
tem, including all grades of instruction from the lowest to the 
hest. 
he plaintiffs, for themselves and 400 others similarly situated, 
ught this action to restrain the board of education of the city of 
rence, a city of the second class, from enforcing one of its reso- 
ions previously adopted, authorizing the superintendent of its 
schools to expel from the high school all resident pupils who 
sed to pay a tuition fee of $2.50 per term. The petition alleges 
it the plaintiffs are residents and taxpayers of the city of Law- 
e, and the parents of the children between the ages of 6 and 20 
3; that the board of education had previously passed a resolu- 
to the effect that all pupils attending such school should be 
ired to pay a tuition fee of $2.50 per term, and had authorized 
superintendent of schools of the city to expel from such: school 
hildren then attending who refused to pay such tuition fee on 
fore a certain day therein named. Upon the application of the 
tiffs a temporary restraining order prohibiting said board 
enforcing the conditions of the resolution was allowed, and 
ily made permanent. It was held generally that the board 
lucation had no power to impose a tuition fee upon the resi- 
pupils as a condition precedent to attending such school. 
e question involved is, has the Legislature of the state of 
as power to authorize the board of education of cities of the 
d class to impose a tuition fee upon resident pupils attending 
igh school? If this question is answered in the affirmative, 
st be held that the board acted with authority. The Legis- 
attempts to confer such authority upon the board of educa- 
f the cities of the second class within the state by the enact- 
of section 6305, Gen. St., 1901. This section reads: 
‘he board of education shall have power to elect their own 
‘s, except the treasurer; to make their own rules and regula- 
subject to the provisions of this article; to organize and 
ain a system of graded schools; to establish a high school 
ver in their opinion the educational interests of the city 
id; and to exercise the sole control over the schools and school 
ty of the city; and maintain such high school, in whole or x ,

in part, by demanding, collecting, and receiving a tuition fee f| 
and from each and every scholar or pupil attending such hi 
school.” Plaintiffs contend that the common schools of Kan: 
are free schools, and that this section, in so far as it attempts 
confer power upon the board of education of cities of the seco 
class to impose a tuition fee upon pupils attending such scho 
contravenes section 2, art. 6, of the Constitution of Kansas, an 
void. The constitutional provision invoked reads: “ The Le; 
lature shall encourage the promotion of intellectual, moral, sci 
tific, and agricultural improvement by establishing a uniform s| 
tem of common schools, and schools of a higher grade, embrac 
normal, preparatory, collegiate, and university departments.” 
The one great hope of the republic lies in the intelligence 
morality of the individual citizen. To encourage, promote, 
inculcate intelligence and morality large bodies of land 
reserved by the government from the public domain to man; 
the states upon their admission into the Union, to be used f 
permanent school fund. Section 34 of our organic act prov: 
“that when the lands in the said territory shall be surveyed w 
the direction of the government of the United States, prepara 
to bringing the same into market, sections numbered sixteen 
thirty-six in each township in said territory shall be, and the s| 
are hereby, reserved for the purpose of being applied to schoo! 
said territory and in the states and territories hereafter t 
erected out of the same.” 
Recognizing the great need of popular education, the frame: 
our Constitution, in addition to the provisions hereinbefore qu 
making it compulsory upon the Legislature to establish a uni 
system of common schools, inserted section 3, art. 6, which r 
“The proceeds of all lands that have been or may be grante 
the United States, for the support of schools, and the five hw 
thousand acres of land granted to the new states, under an 
Congress distributing the proceeds of public lands amon

which, together with all the rents of the lands, and such other 
as the Legislature may provide, by tax or otherwise, shi 
inviolably appropriate to the support of the common schj 
Ample provisions are found elsewhere for the annual distri! 
of this fund to the several county treasurers of the state, to b 
in the support of the common schools. In addition to th 
 
-P-A-G-E-361

us provided, the Legislature has made provisions for the sup- 
rt of the common schools, and enacted rules for the general 
nagement by officers to be elected by the voters of the locality 
ere the schools are to be maintained. 
n view of the numerous provisions made by the general govern- 
nt and the Constitution of this state as well as the history of 
legislative enactment, for the establishment and maintenance 
la common school system under which the children have been 
cated for the past 40 years, the suggestion that such schools 
not free comes as a surprise at least. This, however, cannot 
nge the provisions of our Constitution, and it is to such provi- 
s we must look to determine whether the system of common 
ols it commands the Legislature to encourage was to be a 
em of free common schools or pay common schools. We can 
determine this by ascertaining what was meant by the words 
mmon schools,” as therein used. If we find that they have 
ired a technical meaning, we must assume that they were 
in the Constitution in their technical sense. The high school 
ties of the second class is a department of the common school 
m. of such a city, in which the higher grades of the common 
lol are taught. Board of Education v. Welch, 51 Kan., 792, 
ac., 654; Whitlock v. State ex rel. School District, 30 Neb., 
47 N. W., 284. The phrase “ common schools ” is synony- 
with “ public schools.” Jenkins v. Andover, 103 Mass., 94. 
have been defined by lexicographers and by judicial inter- 
tion to mean “ free schools.” Merrick and others v. Inhabit- 
of Amherst: and others, 12 Allen, 509; Roach v. The Board 
sident and Directors of the St. Louis Public Schools, 77 Mo., 
Collins v. Henderson, ete., 74 Ky., 74; Irvin Gregory (Ga.), 
E., 120 Roach v. Board of President and Directors of the 
uis Public Schools, 7 Mo., App., 567; People v. Board of

le, schools supported by general taxation, open to all of suit- 
ge and attainments, free of expense, and under the control 
ts appointed by voters.”” Mr. Black, in his Law Dictionary, 
common schools to be “ schools maintained at the public 
e and administered by a bureau of the state, district, or 
pal government, for the gratuitous education of the children 
citizens without distinction.” Mr. Anderson, in his Law 
ary, says: “Common or public schools are schools sup- 
by general taxation, open to all free of expense, and under

tained at public expense, for the elementary education of child: 
of all classes.” Mr. Bouvier, in his Law Dictionary, says t 
common schools are “schools for general elementary instructi 
free to all the public.” Chancellor Kent, in his Commentar! 
vol. 2, p. 195, in discussing free common schools in the sev 
states of the Union, on the continent, and in many European co 
tries, uses the phrase “ common schools” exclusively. It 
be assumed that the men who wrote our Constitution used 
phrase “common schools” in its technical sense, as we fin 
defined. We think it follows, therefore, both from authority 
reason, that the phrase “ common schools ” was used in the 
stitution in its technical sense, which means free schools, and 
the common schools of Kansas are free schools. The act of 
Legislature attempting to authorize boards of education of ¢ 
of the second class to collect tuition fees for the admission of 
dent pupils into such schools violates this provision of the Co’ 
tution of this State, and is therefore void. 
A contention is made that the word “ otherwise,” found i 
latter part of section 3, art. 6, of the Constitution by whic! 
legislature is directed to add to the permanent school fund by 
or otherwise, is an express authority to add to it by charging 
tion fee. The word “ otherwise,” as there used, simply means 
the Legislature may set apart for public school purposes 
moneys as may come into the public treasury incidentally, su 
fines imposed for violation of laws of the State, and items of aj 
ilar character. To charge and collect a tuition fee would n 
adding to the permanent school fund. 
The objection that the plaintiffs cannot maintain this a 
on the ground that an individual cannot maintain an acti 
restrain public officers from performing a public duty, 
such party can show some personal, pecuniary, or special in 
or some injury which he may sustain other than the publi 
erally, cannot be sustained. The exclusion of the plaintiff’ 
dren from the public schools is a question in which they 
special and peculiar interest, not held in common by the 
of the state. While the people of the state and county 
general interest in the education of its children, the exclusion 
particular child directly affects the parents of that child in 
greater degree than it does the public. In Craft v. Jackso| 
5 Kan., 518, 521, it is said: “ If the injury is one that parti 
affects a person, he has his right of action.” 
The judgment of the court below is affirmed. All the J|

     tracts from address by Frank A. Hill, secretary of the Massa- 
husetts State Board of Education, before the New England 
ssociation of Colleges and Preparatory Schools at Springfield, 
t. 15, 1898.] 
have been asked to answer the question, “ How far is the public 
school a just charge upon the public treasury?” I shall 
e to limit my answer to Massachusetts, although, in the nature 
he case, whatever answer may satisfy Massachusetts is likely 
erve, in some measure, other States as well. . . . 
will not discuss the justice of making education in general 
arge upon the public treasury. For two centuries and a 
Massachusetts has clung most tenaciously to two fundamental 
ghts about this matter. One is that evéry child — the 
blest as well as the proudest — is entitled to a fair education. 
, he is not simply entitled to it, but the State must see that he 
it. And the other is that the cost of this education is a legiti- 
public charge. Under stress of poverty or war Massachu- 
has wavered at times in application of these principles, but 
r in loyalty to their essence. They are deeply intrenched 
e universal conviction; they have found splendid expres- 
in the supreme law; they are woven as unbroken strands 
the substance of her history. Indeed, it is idle to make 
w of defending a citadel that is a Gibraltar in itself and 
no enemy of consequence now attacks. 
en we leave education in general and think of secondary 
tion in particular, we shall have to say that, so far as legal 
hnical justice is concerned, the high school tax as well as the 
lal school tax is a just charge upon the public treasury. That 
ay, there has never been a time since 1647 when the laws of 
chusetts did not require certain towns to maintain at public 
se grammar schools, %.¢., college preparatory schools, or 
modern equivalents or successors popularly known as high 
s. It has not been simply the legal right of these towns 
themselves for the support of secondary schools, but it has 
heir legal duty to do so; and towns were not rarely “ pre- 
” as the old records run, and fined for failure to discharge 
ity. 
when Massachusetts became a State the people took pains 
ch this policy of colonial and provincial times by putting

     into the Constitution these words: “It shall be the duty 
legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Comm 
wealth, to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, a 
all seminaries of them; especially the university at Cambrid, 
public schools and grammar schools in the towns.” In ot 
words, the ancient and historic grammar schools that tau; 
Latin, Greek and mathematics, with such minor variations in 
curriculum as the people saw fit to make, and that were s 
ported at public expense, were specifically mentioned by the pei 
in that “solemn and mutual agreement.” as schools which le; 
latures are constitutionally bound to cherish. In response to 
duty, imposed upon them by the supreme law, our Legislat 
have again and again made requirements relating to gramma: 
high schools, while the towns, within the realm of local con 
have, in numerous instances, gone far beyond the letter of 
State requirements. 
And when now and then conservative, skeptical or intr] 
able persons have questioned the liberal action of the t 
toward high schools, and have applied to the courts to res 
them in such action, the highest judicial authority has invari 
stood for the larger, the more generous interpretation of the 
school policy of the State. So that the justice of the high s 
tax, if we consider simply such questions of legality as are se 
by the Constitution, the laws and the decisions of the courts, 
on the solidest of rock. 
* * * * * * * 
The relation of any tax to the people’s ability to pay it, 
our form of government, is dependent on the people’s willin 
to pay it; and this willingness, in its turn, is dependent o 
people’s intelligent appreciation of the benefits the tax is sup 
to bring. The tax should not be so heavy as to check produ 
to devour income, to extinguish ambition, in short, to ki 
goose that lays the golden egg; but what its basis shall b 
what percentage of this basis shall constitute the tax, ho 
tax shall be distributed among the various purposes it 
serve, how each portion of it shall be expended, — these 
scores of allied matters, are always likely to be open que 
In their nature they do not admit of exact, complete an 
answers. It is not what people casually say that must be ta 
their true answers to these questions but what they dire 
through their representatives actually vote for. When th 
islature in 1824 voted to exempt nearly every town in the 
from maintaining a high school, this meant that, in the

    dgment of that time, the high school was an institution of so 
leat expense and so limited service that only the largest and 
althiest towns ought to be required to maintain it. When the 
gislature in 1891 ordered that every town should be required 
provide its properly qualified children with free high school 
ition, this meant that, in the popular judgment of that time, high 
ool education was of so great and general value that, notwith- 
nding its expense, no child ought to be denied free access to it. 
n short, our people are doing far more for education to-day 
n in 1824, and yet they are doing it more easily. The voice 
he grumbler, I suppose, will never cease, but it is less often 
rd to-day than then. Here and there, indeed, we see a town 
it is pitifully burdened, paying double or quadruple the school 
of-its wealthier neighbors and yet powerless to command the 
oling it ought to have. Such unevenness, whether of bur- 
is or of results, is regrettable; the State does something to re- 
it and should do more. Still the inequalities are not what 
once were under the vicious district school system. It may 
afely said that, whatever defects of taxation need to be rem- 
, the people as a whole are not excessively taxed.

lot only are there ample reasons, in theory, why the public 
Id value and support the high school, but there are ample 
nees in fact that these reasons are mighty with the public. 
ider for a moment the rise of the high school and its present 
rkable hold on the loyalty of the people. Our educational 
ry shows in the spirit of the people the golden era, the dark 
and the renaissance, — the golden age in the beginning, the 
sance in our own time and the dark ages between. ‘There 
he action of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay in 1647, order- 
at towns of 100 families should each maintain a grammar 
ll, that is, a college fitting school. It was Latin grammar and 
, not English, that it taught. English grammar, as we 
stand it, was hardly known. It is a significant fact that the 
age of English literature was a grammarless age; the art 
hed, the science slept. In 1677, Plymouth Colony said 
owns of 50 families may, and towns of 70 families must, 
la grammar school. The next important legislation was 
9. People had been living through a hard century. It 
coming more and more trying for the towns to comply with 
Many of them had ceased to do so. Accordingly the 
1 Court relaxed the grammar school law of 1674. It ordered 
ereafter towns not of 100 families but of 200 should main- 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  344 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
tain a grammar school. Under the old law 230 towns were requir 
to maintain such a school; under the new more than 100 to 
were released from this requirement. 
But the General Court of 1789 unwittingly gave another dama| 
ing blow to the grammar schools. It unfortunately establish 
the school district system. Under this system the school distri 
not the town, became the educational unit. Not unfrequentl. 
town was broken up into twenty or thirty such districts. A: 
result district spirit rose; town spirit, already feeble, fell to grea’ 
depths, and with this fall went a further decline in the gram 
school, which was a town and not a district institution. In ot! 
words, the several districts absorbed the educational energy 
the people, what there was of it, and the town, as a town, was 
educationally dry and barren. In such a desert no grammar sc 
could thrive. It was this decline in town spirit, this dying ow 
the grammar school, that led to the springing up of academies 
private schools on every hand. Towns might grow cold ab 
high grade schooling, but there were spirited families enoug' 
insist, whatever the sacrifice, on such schooling for their child: 
The year 1824 saw low water mark in our educational hist 
There were 172 towns that should have been supporting gram) 
schools under the law of 1789. Very few of them, however, 
doing so. Accordingly, the Legislature exempted all towns w 
5,000 inhabitants from maintaining them. That is to sa; 
exempted 165 of those 172 towns, — all of them but 7. It w: 
longer only 100 families in the town, as in 1647, no longer 
families, as in 1789, but practically 1,000 families, that create 
obligation to maintain a grammar school. Thus the gra 
school was nearly extinguished and its very name began to 
in oblivion. The altar fires of high ideals, however, were 
alive in the academies. It was the very success of these acad 
that, in a way, checked their growth and led, with some n 
exceptions, to their reduced importance or their demise. I 
largely because of them that the demand for free secondary in: 
tion revived. It became a burning question everywhere, “ 
should not the children of all the people enjoy advantages 
to those of the favored few?” 
The reaction from the legislation of 1824 came quick and 
In 1826 the Legislature ordered that towns of 4,000 people 
maintain a high school of the first grade; towns of 500 fam 
high school of the second grade. Here was a partial return 
policy of the fathers, the beginning of educational repe:

     connected with the colleges in the traditional way, the second 
red the colleges and was ignored by them. And now for 
e years the policy of the State was singularly vacillating. 
re was a locking of horns between the progressive party and the 
ervative. The law of 1826 had been in force but a short 
when the requirement of a second grade high school in the case 
wns with 500 families was repealed; in 1836 it was restored; 
40 it was practically repealed again; and in 1848 it was re- 
d again, this time to stay until another advance became pos- 
. So we see that it took just twenty-two years to clinch the 
lation of 1826. 
r many years after 1826 the high school outlook was far from 
raging. The law was explicit enough, but towns consulted 
pleasure about obeying it. In 1838, for instance, out of 43 
s required to maintain high schools only 14 were doing so. 
he upward movement, long delayed, began at last. The mis- 
ries of the movement were Horace Mann and his fellow- 
ts. In 1852 there were 64 high schools; in 1866, 156; in 
216; in 1886, 229; to-day there are 261. 
1891 the State took a step which placed it, for the first time, 
vance of the policy of the founders. It ordered that free high 
1 tuition thereafter should be the legal right of every properly 
ied child in the Commonwealth. Every town, without 
ion, must furnish it either in its own high school or in that 
meighbor. Other States have gone beyond Massachusetts 
king the college or university a part of the public school 
, but Massachusetts was the first State in the Union, if 
le first in the world, to make it compulsory on all its towns to 
e free high school instruction. Such compulsion bore with 
ip, of course, on many small and feeble towns. Hence the 
in such cases of State reimbursement of high school tuition

The purpose of this paper is to present certain reecommendatij 
in an effort to be helpful toward the solution of some of tl 
problems. With this end in view, we desire to state, first, as| 
see them, a few of the fundamental and essential qualificat! 
which stand out in a right system of schools. 
1. The schools of Iowa, from the elementary grades to 
University, should each be a part of a consistent system, cod 
ating in a general plan. 
2. The elementary schools are to-day the universal agen 
the state to give to every boy and girl the elements of a simple| 
thorough training. We must look to these schools to con 
in this function and to pledge themselves to greater simpli 
sincerity and thoroughness. 
3. As life in Iowa becomes more diverse, we must provid 
only for the general elementary education of the great maj 
youth, but we must provide also the means by which each 
vidual may become an effective economic unit. In other 
the vocational school must become almost as universal 
elementary school. 
4. The three institutions of higher learning in Iowa must

professional men and women at this high line; and society, j 
judgment, will continue to hold high the conditions for ad

he American high school is seeking to fulfil two distinct 
ctions: (1) the preparation of the great mass of students for 
enship in a democracy; (2) the preparation of a minority 
erhaps 5 per cent—for college. The evidence which has 
referred to would go far to show that this last object is but 
ly attained. The easiest way out of the difficulty would be 
onclude that this outcome condemns the double effort. This 
been repeatedly urged. The high school, it has been said, 
ing essayed two tasks, falls between them: it may, by concen- 
on on one group of studies, prepare a boy for a practical career; 
may, by concentration on a limited range of academic tasks, 
are a boy for college; but, it is urged, experience proves that 
not do both, so long, of course, as the two do not more nearly

ish, in contradistinction to this view, to express my firm 
iction that both these objects can be compassed consistently 
e same secondary school, and that, furthermore, the same 
lods which make for efficiency in the preparation of boys and

irls for their vocations. If, indeed, both high school and

ring no deep or organic purpose, can the program which it

dly this is not the case. Both high school and college sub- 
a single purpose: the preparation of the American boy for 
portunities and responsibilities of the type of civilization 
as a nation we are endeavoring to establish. Not all can

The difficulty into which we have fallen seems to me in lar} 
measure to have arisen in the course of the effort to enlarge t 
curriculum of the old time classica] high school for the purpose 
fulfilling the réle just mentioned. The movement was a th 
oughly sound one. It is inevitable that into the secondary sch 
those studies should be admitted which touch the lives and the 
cations of future citizens. The difficulty has been that in 
haste to enrich and to diversify the curriculum we have to so 
extent lost our ideal of what education means. To learn a li 
about many subjects, to dip superficially into the study of Eng! 
and Latin and chemistry and psychology and home economics, 
a dozen other things, is not education. Only that human b 
has gained the fundamentals of an education who has acqui 
soundly a few elementary branches of human knowledge, and 
in acquiring these, has so disciplined his mind that it is an effic 
instrument ready to be turned to whatsoever task is set befor 
The high school student is led to believe that education is attail 
by learning a little of each of many things; he gains, therefo:

Such a youth has not been educated. That only is education w] 
sets a boy on the way to use his own mind for his pleasure an 
profit; which enables him to attack a problem, whether it

tion, rightly understood, is a power-producing process; an 
serious indictment against the secondary school system to-d 
that its graduates do not acquire either discipline or power. 
real struggle in the American high school is between that j 
ence which makes toward thoroughness and that which 
toward superficiality; and if the high school is to become th 
training-place of the people, the ideal of thoroughness must 
plant the ideal of superficiality. 
But it must be remembered that thorough teaching can b

mber of subjects. A small high school which attempts to give 
any courses is sure to be weak in most of them. 
In visiting a college recently in one of the older and richer 
lates — a state very backward in the development of its secondary 
thool system — I was struck by a remark of the officer in charge 
admission which bore upon this matter. After looking over 
th him the admissions to his own college, I inquired the name of 
le high school from which he obtained the best prepared students. 
answered that the best prepared students came from a high 
ool in a small village, conducted by two teachers, a man and his 
e. This result arose out of the fact that here were two com- 
ent teachers attempting to instruct pupils in only such subjects 
they could teach effectively. 
‘his is no argument against the enriched curriculum of the 
mdary school, provided the enriched curriculum does not 
to dispersion and so defeat the end of all education. But let 
boy understand that if he desires to study agriculture, for ex- 
le, he cannot study all the other subjects in the curriculum; 
him take with agriculture one or two things which will form 
trunk of his educational structure and learn them well and 
dly. For only in this way can he gain the intellectual disci- 
le and the intellectual strength to make his way either in college 
a vocation. 
llustrations of divergent tendencies may be taken from curric- 
or high schools set forth by state boards of education. Thus 
regon one of the state regulations governing the high school 
e is that “ no pupil shall carry more than four subjects at any 
time.” In Kansas the college preparatory course for high 
Is having three or more teachers contains no more than four 
cts each term, with certain variations and elections. On the 
hand, in North Carolina the Latin-Scientific course is made 
ch year of six distinct studies, aggregating twenty-five hours 
k in the first two years, and twenty-six hours in the latter 
; and in Maryland a similar requirement of six studies is 
, whose recitation hours equal twenty-seven each week. In 
oston Latin School the student carries six studies, except in

masters. Each generation finds new studies which it believ 
to be specifics for the training of the youth of its own time and i 
own country. There are, however, no educational specifics whi 
fit the varying temperaments, tastes, weaknesses, and ambitio: 
of the youth of a nation. Perhaps the matter has never been mi 
clearly stated than in the saying recorded by Thucydides, “ 
should remember that man differs little from man, except that 
turns out best who is trained in the sharpest school.” To av 
large degree the disciplinary side of education in both high sch 
and college has been forgot in the past twenty years. During 
same period the family discipline has also been softened. 
total effect is seen in the unreadiness of the great mass of yor 
to face a hard, steady pull, whether in college or in business. 
Our educational curricula to-day, both in the high school 
in the college, resembles closely the bills of fare which one fi 
in the hotels, on which are set down dozens of dishes under hi 
sounding names; and yet one looks in vain through all this me

somewhat as one would treat his stomach if he ate faithf 
something of every article on the bill of fare. There is not 
in the conduct either of the high school or of the college admi: 
requirements which points toward a simple and thorough ide 
study. 
To such an argument as this the high school teacher an 
high school superintendent are much inclined to reply tha 
high schools must include all the things which the American p 
are ambitious to know; that they must teach their pupils some 
of a great many things in order to satisfy popular demand. E 
where in the high school, as in the college, the cry is, ‘‘ We 
keep up with the competition of our rivals.” This compe

It is true, as it seems to me, that the high school breaks 
in both its functions and for the same reasons. It appears 
however, that the educational ideal which makes for a simp] 
thorough curriculum for the individual serves equally well t 
who looks toward college and the boy who goes directly fro 
high school into a vocation. These two functions are ni 
compatible under a right educational conception.

V. Tuer REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 
‘om the Third Annual Report of the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching, 1908, pp. 152-153.] 
t seems clear that the work of the next two decades in American 
cation is to be a work of educational reorganization, and this 
rganization must include elementary and secondary education 
well as higher education, for the problem of national education 
really one problem, not a series of isolated and unrelated 
blems. ‘To-day our schools, from the elementary school to 
university, are inefficient, superficial, lacking expert super- 
ion. They are disjointed members of what ought to be a con- 
lent system. The work of reorganization is so enormous that 
is almost at a loss to answer the practical question: Where 
Id such organization begin? The answer to this question 
t come in the end from the intelligent leadership of teachers 
selves, and from the codperation of teachers in all parts of 
system of national education. I venture to point out certain 
iderations which seem to me to be essential as forming the 
ndwork from which improvement and progress must proceed. 
is, I believe, admitted by those who are most familiar with 
conditions of schools throughout the United States that the 
ness and inefficiency of the elementary and secondary schools, 
mg in the first place from a lack of clear conceptions of what 
schools should actually seek to do, are apparent, first, in the 
t to teach too many things and, second, in the lack of compe- 
teachers. In other words, the elementary and secondary 
Is, like the institutions of higher learning, have attempted 
any subjects to the neglect of the fundamental intellectual 
ing common to all education. The remedy is to be found in 
r definitions of purpose, variation of school types, and more 
le and thorough curricula. We cannot teach all subjects in 
chool, but we can provide a wide variety of schools, each of 
may do its own work thoroughly.

sive national weaknesses, and that the inefficiency of our

xample, mathematics is a subject which has been a standard 
in our schools from the beginning. Students who pass 
igh our high schools and enter college spend in the nine years 
ponding to the period covered by the German gymnasium, 
cent more of the time of instruction on mathematics and 
ceive a training vastly inferior to that of the gymnasium. ERR RDM IRR ee a ant eae Ty a ey Teen en ee

later, so as to include the freshman and sophomore years of

e the problem of articulating our three types of schools for 
eral education with each other and with schools for vocational

tions which can separate a continuous system for cultural 
cation into three distinct institutional units. 
he secondary school has tended to extend its limits upward 
nclude the first two years of college, as well as downward to 
ude the last two years of the elementary school. But the 
ner tendency is comparatively slight. The mass of experience 
ns to favor the latter, as has already been suggested; and the 
retic considerations corroborate actual practice in this direc- 
. The inclusion of the two collegiate years in the high-school 
; is opposed by arguments of a sort difficult to overcome. The 
est gap in our school system exists between high school and 
sge.. The most advanced teaching of a cultural type is very 
ely dependent upon the research of the university in replen- 
ng its stock from advancing knowledge. The equipments 
lired by college and university are more nearly coincident 
1 those of college and high school. Endowed institutions 
titute a larger proportion of the schools for higher education 
they do for secondary education. An upward extension of 
igh school is so difficult as to seem inexpedient, while a down- 
extension seems logically to be a line of least resistance. 
hese grounds it is probable that, in the generality of cases, 
school education will plan to include the period from the 
th to the eighteenth year. 
objections which have been urged against the inclusion of 
collegiate years by the high school hold largely against any 
sal that the college should attach to itself the upper two 
of high school. Such a proposal is not seriously made. If 
re, all our current tendency would be against it. Even the 
er colleges are tending to drop the preparatory academies or 
schools which have so frequently been associated with them. 
arger institutions did so long ago. The discussion of any

entirely with the training for those commercial, agricultural. 
industrial occupations which may be entered soon after the

has been under supervision, the high school board, taking i 
consideration the report of the inspector, the report of the exami 
and such other information as may be at hand, shall grant s 
aid to schools whose work and organization are satisfactory 
give promise of permanency. By provision of the law, no sc 
receives aid in excess of the amount expended in carrying out 
purposes of the act, exclusive of the cost of buildings and re} 
thereon. 
6. The high school inspector shall report on the yearly expe} 
ture of each high school. The special report shall include: 
(1) The part of the superintendent’s annual salary in exce: 
$600. 
(2) The salaries of high school instructors. In case of ins 
tors giving part time to high school work, proportionate c 
shall be given, but in case the eighth grade is combined wit! 
high school for purposes of instruction, the entire salary of at 
one instructor shall be charged to grade work. No part of 
salary shall be counted in reckoning high school expenditure, 
(8) The cost of library fixtures and library books. No 
shall be given for expenditure already balanced by gift or by 
aid to school libraries. School boards are at liberty, of cour: 
make any purchase they may desire, but no credit shall be 
for the purchase of subscription books or expensive sets unle: 
inspector’s approval shall have been secured prior to such| 
chase. Free texts for ordinary class use shall not receive 
(4) The cost of laboratory fixtures and apparatus. No 
shall be given for charts, for unusual or expensive apparat 
sets of apparatus, or for any devices sold by traveling aj 
unless the approval of the inspector shall have been secure 
to such purchase. 
3- Removal from the List. 
Schools failing to comply with these regulations, or not 
taining the required standard of efficiency may be droppe 
the list. The inspector shall advise the local superintende’ 
the clerk of such possible action.

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
   
‘he Economic Trend of Education. — As the political ideal- 
of the nineteenth century produced the free, tax sup- 
ed and state controlled school system, the economic neces- 
s of the first decades of this century produced a series of 
ifying forces that are certain to alter both the form and 
function of the different grades of institutions belonging 
the public educational scheme. A number of the im- 
ant features of the vocationalizing process, resulting in the 
ed variation of educational procedure and organization 
in the likely public preference for new types of educational 
tutions, are emphasized in these five selections that deal 
the general subject of industrial education.

question at present under discussion in education is so fraught 
consequences for the future of democracy as the question of 
rial education. Its right development will do more to make 
education truly democratic than any other one agency now 
consideration. Its wrong treatment will as surely accentuate 
lemocratic tendencies in our present situation, by fostering 
rengthening class divisions in school and out. It is better 
ler a while longer from the ills of our present lack of system 
truly democratic lines of advance become apparent, rather

     and thereby use it to mark off to the interests of employers a si 
arate class of laborers. 
These general considerations have a particular application to 
scheme of industrial education which has been proposed for ad 
tion by the next legislature of the state of Illinois — one of 
leading industrial states of the Union, and containing its sec 
largest city. This scheme proposes a separate State Commis: 
of Vocational Education and a separate Board wherever the 
munity may wish to develop any form of industrial education. 
other words, the entire school system of the state as a whole an| 
such communities of the states as may desire to do sometl 
definite in the direction of industrial education, is split into tw 
the education of all above fourteen years of age. Since what 
a state like Illinois may do in such a matter is sure to have ii 
ence in other states in this formative period, educators all 
the country should be aroused to help ward off what, wit 
exaggeration, may be termed the greatest evil now threatenin 
interests of democracy in education. 
The statement of the scheme ought to be enough to conde 
The least reflection shows fundamentally bad features assoc 
with it. First, it divides and duplicates the administrative 
cational machinery. How many communities have such an ¢e 
of public interest in education that they can afford to cut i 
two parts? How many have such a surplusage of money and 
resources that they can afford to maintain a double sys: 
schools, with the waste of funds and the friction therein invol 
Second, the scheme tends to paralyze one of the most vital 
ments now operating for the improvement of existing g 
education. The old time general, academic education is 
ning to be vitalized by the introduction of manual, industri 
social activities; it is beginning to recognize its respons 
to train all the youth for useful citizenship, including a call 
which each may render useful service to society and make an 
and decent living. Everywhere the existing school system 
ginning to be alive to the need of supplementary agencies 
it fulfill this purpose, and is taking tentative but positi 
continuous steps toward it. The city of Chicago in this sam| 
of Illinois probably ranks behind no other city of the countr 
extent and wisdom of the steps already taken, steps which 
necessity be followed by others just as fast as those alread 
demonstrate their efficiency.

EVILS OF SEPARATE CONTROL WORK BOTH WAYS 
These two movements within the established American public 
ool system, the proposed scheme, if adopted, will surely arrest. 
neral education will be left with all its academic vices and its 
oteness from the urgent realities of contemporary life un- 
ched, and with the chief forces working for reform removed. 
reasing recognition of its public and social responsibilities will 
blasted. It is inconceivable that those who have loved and 
ed our American common school system will, whatever the 
lects of this system, stand idly by and see such a blow aimed at 
Were anything needed to increase the force of the blow, it is 
fact that the bill provides that all funds for industrial education 
led by the local community be duplicated by the state, although 
funds contributed by the state for general school purposes 
hardly more than 5 per cent of the amount raised by local 
tion. 
hirdly, the segregation will work disastrously for the true in- 
ts of the pupils who attend the so-called vocational schools. 
uperintendent Cooley of Chicago, who is understood to be 
nsible for the proposed bill in its present form, has written a 
lable report on ‘‘ Vocational Education in Europe.” He quite 
ly holds in high esteem the work and opinions of Superin- 
nt Kerschensteiner of Munich. It is noteworthy, that this 
ng European authority insists upon all technical and trade 
being taught in its general scientific and social bearings. 
ugh working in a country definitely based on class distinction 
where naturally the schools are based on class lines), the one 
Superintendent Kerschensteiner has stood for has been that 
trial training shall be primarily not for the sake of industries, 
r the sake of citizenship, and that it be conducted there- 
ma purely educational basis and not in behalf of interested 
acturers. Mr. Cooley’s own report summarizes Mr. Ker- 
teiner’s views as follows: 
the boy is to become an efficient workman he must compre- 
is. work in all of its relation to science, to art, and to society 
eral... . The young workman who understands his trade 
scientific relation, its historical, economic and social bear- 
ill take a higher view of his trade, of his powers and duties 
tizen, and as a member of society.” 
tever may be the views of manufacturers anxious to secure 
of the state in providing them with a somewhat better 
f laborers for them to exploit, the quotation states the point 
which is self-evident to those who approach the matter of 
   
-P-A-G-E-390
    368 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
industrial education from the side of education, and of a progress 
society. It is truly extraordinary that just at a time when e 
partisan politics are taking a definitely progressive turn, suc 
reactionary measure as the institution of trade and commer 
schools under separate auspices should be proposed. It is 
necessary to argue concerning the personal motives of the ban 
and manufacturers who have been drawn into the support of 
measure. Doubtless many of them have the most public spir 
intentions. But no one experienced in education can doubt 
would be the actual effect of a system of schools conducted wh 
separate from the regular public schools, with a totally diffe 
curriculum and with teachers and pupils responsible to a to 
independent and separate school administration. Whatever 
the original motives and intentions, such schools would not 
could not give their pupils a knowledge of industry or any 
ticular occupation in relation to “science, art and societ; 
general.”” To attempt this would involve duplicating exi 
schools, in addition to providing proper industrial training. 
it is self-evident that the economical and effective way to ac 
plish this move is to expand and supplement the present s 
system. Not being able to effect this complete duplication, 
new schools would be confined to aiming at increased efficien 
certain narrow lines. 
UNITY OF PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM ESSENTIAL 
Those who believe in the continued separate existence of 
they are pleased to call the “lower classes”? or the “lal 
classes ” would naturally rejoice to have schools in which 
“classes”? would be segregated. And some employers of 
would doubtless rejoice to have schools supported by 
taxation supply them with additional food for their mills, 
others should be united against every proposition, in wh: 
form advanced, to separate training of employees from tr; 
for citizenship, training of intelligence and character from tr, 
for narrow industrial efficiency. That the evil forces at 
are not local is seen in the attempt to get the recent nation: 
vention on industrial education in Philadelphia to commi 
in favor of the Illinois scheme. 
The only serious danger is that a number of sympathet 
otherwise intelligent persons should be misled, and on th 
of a justified enthusiastic support of the principle of industri: 
cation (with whatever supplementary: agencies may be 
necessary) jump to the support of this scheme, not realizin;

really involved init. Such persons should first inform themselves 
to what is already being done in this direction in the more pro- 
lessive public schools, and should then devote their spare energies 
backing up and furthering these undertakings, and to creating 
ublic opinion that will affect the more backward and conservative 
blic school systems. The problem is a difficult one, but many 
elligent, though unadvertized, attempts are already making for its 
ution; and its difficulty is no reason for permanently handi- 
ping the interests of both common school education and a dem- 
atic society by abruptly going back upon what, with all its 
ects, has been the chief agency in keeping alive a spirit of 
ocracy among us — the American public school system.     
   
    
    
   
    
     
    
    
    
      
   
       
    
   
        
    
      
   
   The Distinction between a System of General Education and a 
System of Industrial and Technical Education 
tchett, Henry S., in 45th An. Rept. Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching, 1910, pp. 77-78.] 
‘here is to-day a widespread movement in the United States 
ing toward the development of industrial and technical edu- 
m. No one who knows the industrial conditions of America 
doubt the need of such schools. The apprentice system, in 
h hitherto our skilled workmen were trained, has passed away. 
ay in all civilized states the workman must learn the funda- 
tals of his trade in some form of school which takes the place 
apprenticeship of former days. With this foundation, he 
then hope to become, with moderate practice, a skilled jour- 
an, and one with a far larger outlook than his father had 
e him. In order that this plan may succeed, it is necessary 
the trade school should be thorough, and that the boy trained 
should have access, as a junior journeyman, to the trade 
he chooses. 
the general movement now going on for the development of 
trial and trade schools, two plans have been advocated. One 
t trade instruction shall be incorporated directly into the 
system of the country; in other words, that the high school 
shall become, for those who desire to make it such, a trade 
The advocates of the other plan urge that trade instruc- 
lhould be given in separate schools, these trade schools being 
lated at the proper place with the general system of schools. 
eems likely that successful trade instruction will in this | 
'y be brought about-in both these ways; but at the same time 
ell to remember that the system of general education of a

country cannct be turned into a system of utilitarian schools wi 
out sacrificing the essential things for which a system of gene! 
education stands. The public school system of the United Sta 
is intended for the general training of children and youth in th 
studies which make for intelligence, for honesty, for industri 
living, for patriotic devotion to their country, and for training 
the social obligations of a democracy. Into such a school 
study of agriculture may, for example, rightly be introduced, 
become a helpful and useful study. But it will not be possibl 
change the school into an agricultural trade school without los 
the essential things for which the public school stands. The s 
is equally true of other trade subjects, as for example shop-w 
For this reason I am inclined to think that many who advocate 
extensive introduction of practical studies into the public 
schools will be disappointed in the results which will come thro 
their introduction. In a country high school the study of agri 
ture will not result in turning out from this high school f 
trained practical farmers. Agriculture, however interesting 
useful it may be made in such a school, must nevertheless s 
the purpose which all other studies serve, — the general trai 
and culture of the pupils. This fact appears to be overlooke: 
those who believe that the mere introduction of agriculture 
study in the rural high schools will at once turn back to the 
great numbers of boys and girls who now earn a livelihood 
where. 
The high school and the elementary school in America b 
to the system of schools intended for the general education 
whole people. They may be enlarged and improved by incl 
in their curricula studies which touch closely the lives of 
pupils. They cannot, however, be turned into trade schools 
out sacrificing the main reason for which they exist.

every child, their aims and purposes are such that a majority of 
children are unable to take advantage of them beyond a certain 
de and hence do not secure at public expense a preparation for 
ir work in life. Although here and there we see the beginnings 
hange, it is still true that the schools are largely planned for 
few who prepare for college rather than for the large number 
go into industry. 
nly half of the children who enter the city elementary schools 
lhe country remain to the final elementary grade, and only 1 in 
eaches the final year of high school. On the average, 10 per 
of the children have left school at 13 years of age; 40 per 
have left by the time they are 14; 70 per cent by the time they 
15; and 85 per cent by the time they are 16 years of age. 
he average the schools carry their pupils as far as the fifth grade, 
jin some cities great numbers leave below that grade.t 
we assume that all children should have a minimum school 
ing equivalent to the eight grades of the elementary school, 
ust acknowledge that the schools now furnish this minimum 
ss than half the children who enter them. The rest leave 
1 with inadequate general education and with no special 
ing to fit them for work. Vocational courses are, therefore, 
d to attract and hold in school pupils who now leave because 
are unable to obtain suitable preparation for useful employ- 
For such pupils the vocational courses also offer the only 
tunity the schools have to give further training in citizenship. 
whole scheme of education presupposes leisure to acquire 
mic culture or to prepare for leadership in the professions. 
ional culture and training for leadership in industry is equally 
tant, and these can come only when education is broadened 
t the needs of all the children; so that each and every one

he is capable.

   Whether from necessity or not, the economic fact is that the m 
of children go to work as soon as the laws of the various sta: 
permit. It is not solely because the children and their parents 
not appreciate the value of an education that more than half 
the entire number who enter the elementary school do not rem 
to complete it. It is, at least to some extent, because neither t! 
nor their parents are able to see in the schools of to-day an opp] 
tunity for education and training to fit for callings which t 
must pursue. It is for the States and the Nation, not only to 
that these children are prepared for life’s battles before they le 
school, but to supplement their work by after training in p 
time and evening schools, so as to insure them the largest possi 
opportunity for development in everything that makes for us 
and happy citizenship. 
The United States is one of the few large nations which 
not provide by legislation for the continued education of chil 
who become wage earners at 14 years of age. The period f| 
14 to 18 years of age is the one in which the youth is finding 
self in society and setting up standards which will largely d 
mine his future conduct and career, and it is therefore impor 
to continue his training both for general civic intelligence an 
vocational preparation. If allowed to drift during this perio 
if placed in an unwholesome or degrading environment, he ma; 
to realize his own possibilities of development and may be 
a dependent or injurious member of society. The adolescent p: 
is, therefore, the critical period during which the individual 
earner needs training for citizenship as well as training for wo

| By introducing into our educational system the aim of utility 
ke its place in dignity by the side of culture, and to connect

on of vocational education is not only to provide definite 
ing in the technique of the various occupations, but to relate 
training closely to the science, mathematics, history, geog- 
y, and literature which are useful to the man and woman as a 
er and a citizen. Under such instruction the student worker 
mes familiar with the laws of health and with his rights and 
ations as a worker and a citizen in relation to his employer, 
sllow employees, his family, the community, the State, and the 
on. By thus relating education closely to the world’s experi- 
it becomes purposeful and useful and enables the worker to

rience, the knowledge and culture which the race has accu- 
ted. Such education is at least entitled to a place in dignity

Industrial and Social Unrest is Due in Large Measure to a 
of Vocational Training.    le absence of opportunity for creative work and, hence, for 
lelf-expression is, without doubt, one of the causes of much 
present unrest. The tendency of large scale production 
divide labor almost indefinitely and to confine a worker to 
onotonous process, requiring little save purely manipulative

Evidence such as that presented by bureaus which are strug;

State aid is necessary to stimulate and encourage commu- 
to carry on work in vocational education. At the same time 
lation should provide that local communities should be per- 
d to initiate and maintain vocational training, if desired, 
ely apart from state support and supervision. 
Vocational education includes all forms of specialized educa-

The fields of vocational education considered here are indus- 
education, agricultural education, commercial education and 
hold arts education. 
Industrial education denotes the field of vocational educa- 
esigned to meet the needs of the manual wage-worker in the 
s and industries and the household. 
Agricultural education is that form of vocational education 
fits for the occupations connected with the tillage of the 
he care of domestic animals, forestry, and other useful work 
farm. 
‘ommercial education denotes the field of vocational educa- 
lesigned to meet the needs of the wage-earner employed in 
usiness and commercial pursuits as bookkeeping, stenography, 
‘iting, clerical work, salesmanship. 
ousehold arts education is that form of vocational education 
fits for non-wage-earning occupations connected with the 
old. 
ocational schools as referred to in this document, include 
cultural, industrial, commercial and household arts schools, 
trolling purpose of which is to fit for useful occupations, 
ich deal with pupils above fourteen years of age and below 
grade, as indicated below.

  persons over fourteen years of age who can give one or more ye 
to such preparation before entering employment. 
10. A part-time vocational school is a school for persons engag' 
in useful employment which affords instruction during a porti 
of the working time of the pupils that is eae to si 
employment. 
11. Evening schools or classes in eassiry or agriculture 
schools or classes attended by persons over sixteen years of aj 
already engaged in useful employment, which provide instructi 
directly related to such employment. 
12. Evening schools or classes in household arts are schools 
classes giving instruction in home-making to pupils over sixt 
years of age, however employed during the day. 
13. The proper expenditure of state moneys for vocational sch 
should be fully safe-guarded, while, at the same time, the initia; 
in adapting measures to local conditions should be left to the 1 
authorities. The relation of the state to the community in 
matter of industrial education should be that of partners, in w! 
the non-resident partner has the right of inspection and appr 
in return for partial support of the educational venture. 
14. State aid should be sufficient to induce localities to tak 
the work and to justify reasonable participation on the part o 
state in control and administration, but on the other hand, 
aid should not be so large as to sacrifice local initiative and 
port. Experience seems to show that the best results are se 
when the local community is required to furnish the plan 
equipment and pay approximately one-half of the operatin 
penses. 
15. Payments to local communities by the state should n

dation of the state board of control for work actually accompl 
In passing upon the school, the state board should have the 
to approve every feature of its work, including all such it

vision, approval, and reimbursement of the work.

school for all persons in the state otherwise eligible, wheth 
are or are not residents of the community in which the s 
maintained. In order to meet the case of pupils non-resi

   sts of such pupils by the joint contribution of the community 
which the child resides and the state. : 
18. Administrative and executive functions. For the purpose 
this statement of principles, it is necessary to distinguish sharply 
tween the functions of the administrative authority and those 
the executive or expert employed by the administrative author- 
es. 
119. Administrative control is that exercised by a board such as 
tate Board of Education or a State Commission on vocational 
cation or a local educational authority, as to rules and 
ulations concerning such matters as expenditure of moneys, 
rses of study, employment of teachers, etc., which in general 
ht be described as legislative as contrasted with executive 
ctions. 
0. Executive functions are those exercised by a superintendent 
chools, commissioner of education, or the director of an indus- 
1 school, in carrying out the decisions of the board of control 
other necessary executive work. 
il. Effective administrative control, on the part of the state, 
oth vocational and general education, requires the existence of 
ate Board possessing sufficient powers effectively to supervise 
rms of education receiving financial aid from the state. Should 
a board not exist, in any state, or should it be found that an 
ing board is unprepared to deal effectively with the estab- 
ent and promotion of vocational education, then it is expe- 
and desirable that a special administrative Board of Control 
ocational Education shall be established until such time as 
te board properly qualified to deal with all forms of state- 
education shall exist. 
Effective administrative control on the part of the local 
unity of both vocational and general education requires the 
nce of a local school board or committee possessed of ample 
to establish and maintain, under proper state supervision, 
1 and vocational schools. When the existing local admin- 
ve authority for general education does not provide for the 
ishment and promotion of adequate vocational education, 
tive provision should exist, enabling industrial and other 
tional interests, under proper restrictions, to procure the 
n of a special Board of Control for Vocational Education. 
To secure effective administrative control of vocational edu- 
wherever practicable representation of employing and 
ed interests should be provided in administrative boards. 
3 where vocational education is carried on by the regular 
chool board or committee, it is strongly urged that the
-P-A-G-E-400
378 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
  local authorities give adequate representation on such boards 
committees to the employing and employed interests. 
24. Effective executive or expert control. The following featu 
should be recognized: (1) The creation by law of a separate depai 
ment for vocational education, whether under the regular st 
board of education or otherwise; (2) The placing at the head 
this department of a competent deputy commissioner, super] 
tendent, director, or supervisor, who shall be an expert in vo 
tional education and shall be familiar with industrial conditio| 
(8) A salary sufficient to attract and hold a competent man, 
such conditions of tenure of office as would remove him from 
ranks of political employees; (4) The delegation to this offi 
of large powers and responsibilities for superintending the wi 
25. These same principles should be recognized and applie 
the local administration of vocational education. 
26. Efficiency in vocational education requires different met! 
of school administration, different courses of study, diffe 
qualifications of teachers, different equipment, different wa: 
meeting the needs of pupils, and a much greater flexibility in a 
ing means to ends than is possible of development under the 
nary routine of the public school system. 
27. Separation of vocational and general education. For 
reasons, whether administered by regular public school autho 
or a separate board of control, and whether conducted in a sep: 
building or under the same roof as the regular school, the wo 
vocational education should be carried on separately and ind 
dently from that of general education, so that it may be lef 
to realize the dominant aim of fitting for useful employ: 
This requires a separate organization, under a separate hea 
distinctive management, and separate equipment, course of 
pupils, and teachers who shall have had extended practical e 
ence in the industries or occupations they are employed to 
28. Separate schools best. Experience seems to prove that 
conditions admit, this work can be best prosecuted in se 
schools, whether under the control of the regular board of 
tion or otherwise. 
29. Cities of more than 25,000 inhabitants should proba 
required to meet the need of vocational education by si 
schools rather than in departments of regular schools. 
30. Separateness and dominance of vocational aim. Sho 
state desire to give aid to vocational departments in the 
schools, such a department should be defined in the law as a 
ment having a separate head or director who should be tr 
an expert in dealing with the problem of vocational educati|

. State and local autonomy. In developing measures for 
strial education for the different states, it is essential in order 
cure the best results that each state shall, subject to the fore- 
ig principles, adopt the plan for the administration of this new 
of education which is best adapted to its own needs and which 
provide the best results under its particular social, economic, 
trial, educational, and administrative conditions.

       The New Public Education.— Time was when educa 
had a meaning practically synonymous with school. This m 
a narrowing of the conception of education, and a restric 
of the activities of the school. As the state school system 
been expanded and has assumed new duties, gradually the 
meaning of public education has become more apparent. P 
education might properly comprehend any socially orga’ 
project which had for its justification the communizing 
telligence, — the essential prerequisite for the attainme 
popular culture; whether that culture be expressed in 
of a bettered physical condition of life, a higher standa) 
social conduct, an enlarged sphere of common appreciatio 
sympathy, or an improved economic productivity. The 
as a social center, the library, the farmers’ institute an 
versity extension are typical representatives of the expa| 
dominion of public education. The modern board of 
as it has gained in efficiency and importance, has beco 
of a police agency and more of an instrument for p 
education.

‘ipal address, because five months ago I did not know anything 
t this movement. I have taken no active part in it, and I 
not going to assume, as those who have preceded me have 
ned, that you know what the movement is. I want, if for no 
r purpose than to clarify my own thinking, to state as briefly 
»ssible, what the movement is. 
1e object of the movement is to make the schoolhouse the 
center of the community, at any rate in such communities as 
upplied with no other place of common resort. 
ADY FOR USE—THE MEANS OF CONCERTING COMMON LIFE 
is obvious that the schoolhouse is in most communities used 
during certain hours of the day, those hours when the rest of 
community is busily engaged in bread-winning work. It 
rred to the gentlemen who started this movement that inas- 
1 as the schoolhouses belonged to the community it was per- 
y legitimate that the community should use them for its own 
‘tainment and schooling when the young people were not 
pying them. And that, therefore, it would be a good idea to 
there all sorts of gatherings, for social purposes, for purposes 
itertainment, for purposes of conference, for any legitimate 
y that might bring neighbors and friends together in the 
Ihouses. That, I understand it, in its simplest terms is the 
center movement — that the schoolhouses might be made 
ce of meeting — in short, where by meeting each other the 
e of a community might know each other, and by knowing 
ther might concert a common life, a common action. 
SPONTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT 
          
    
      
         
     
        study of the civic center is the study of the spontaneous life 
munities. What you do is to open the schoolhouse and light 
e evening and say: “ Here is a place where you are welcome 
e and do anything that it occurs to you to do.” 
the interesting thing about this movement is that a great 
things have occurred to people to do in the schoolhouse, 
social, things educational, things political, —for one of the 
why politics took on a new complexion in the city in which 
vement originated was that the people who could go into 
loolhouses at night knew what was going on in that city and 
upon talking about it, and the minute they began talking 
t, many things became impossible, for there are scores of 
hat must be put a stop to in our politics that will stop the

       388 
  EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
moment they are talked of where men will listen.” The treatr 
for bad politics is exactly the modern treatment for tubercu 
—it is exposure to the open air. 
Now you have to begin at the root of the matter in orde 
understand what it is you intend to serve by this movement. 
intend to serve the life of communities, the life that is there, 
life that you cannot create, the life to which you can only 
release and opportunity; and wherein does that life consist? 
is the question that interests me. There can be no life in a « 
munity so long as its parts are segregated and separated. 
just as if you separated the organs of the human body and 
expected them to produce life. You must open wide the char 
of sympathy and communication between them, you must n 
channels for the tides of life; if you clog them anywhere, if 
stop them anywhere, why then the processes of disease se 
which are the processes of misunderstanding, which are the 
connections between the spiritual impulses of different sectior 
men. 7 
COMMON CENTER ESSENTIAL TO COMMUNITY LIFE 
The very definition of community is a body of men who ] 
things in common, who are conscious that they have thing 
common, who judge those common things from a single poir 
view, namely, the point of view of general interest. Suc 
thing as a community is unthinkable, therefore, unless you 
close communication; there must be a vital inter-relationsh’ 
parts, there must be a fusion, there must be a coérdination, 
must be a free intercourse, there must be such a contact as 
constitute union itself before you will have the true course oj 
wholesome blood throughout the body. 
Therefore, when you analyze some of our communities 
will see just how necessary it is to get their parts together. 
some of our great cities for example. Do you not realize by 
mon gossip even, the absolute disconnection of what we cal 
residential sections from the rest of the city? Isn’t it si 
that while human beings live all over a city, we pick out a 
place where there are luxurious and well-appointed houses ai 
that the residential section? As if nobody else lived anyw! 
that city. That is the place where the most disconnecte 
and in some instances the most useless part of the communit; 
There men do not know their next-door neighbors; there 
not want to know their next-door neighbors; there is no bj 
sympathy; there is no bond of knowledge or common ac 
anceship.    
     
       
       
         
    
      
-P-A-G-E-411
  SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION 389 
I am not speaking of these things to impeach a class, for I know 
no just way in which to impeach a class. 
It is necessary that such portions of the community should 
linked with the other portions; it is necessary that simple 
ans should be found by which by an interchange of points of 
Ww we may get together, for the whole process of modern life, 
whole process of modern politics, is a process by which we must 
lude misunderstandings, exclude hostilities, exclude deadly 
alries, make men understand other men’s interests, bring all 
n into common counsel, and so discover what is the common 
lerest. 
‘hat is the problem of modern life which is so specialized that 
s almost devitalized, so disconnected that the tides of life will 
flow. 
y interest in this movement, as it has been described to me, has 
touched with enthusiasm because I see in it a channel for the 
oration of the unity of communities.

the first place, don’t you see that you produce communities 
eating common feeling? I know that a great emphasis is 
on the mind, in our day, and as a university man I should 
s not challenge the supremacy of the intellect, but I have 
been convinced that mind was really monarch in our day, 
ny day that I have yet read of, or, if it is monarch, it is one 
modern monarchs that rules and reigns but does not govern. 
COMMON FEELING ESSENTIAL TO FREE GOVERNMENT 
t really controls our action is feeling. We are governed 
passions and the most that we can manage by all our social 
litical endeavors is that the handsome passions shall be in 
jority — the passion of sympathy, the passion of justice, the
-P-A-G-E-412
  390 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
passion of fair dealing, the passion of unselfishness, (if it may | 
elevated into a passion). If you can once see that a working 
jority is obtained for the handsome passions, for the feelings t 
draw us together, rather than for the feelings that separate us, tl 
you have laid the foundation of a community and a free govei 
ment and, therefore, if you can do nothing else in the communi 
center than draw men together so that they will have com 
feeling, you will have set forward the cause of civilization and 
cause of human freedom. 
As a basis of the common feeling you must have a mu 
comprehension. The fundamental truth in modern life, a: 
analyze it, is a profound ignorance. I am not one of those 
challenge the promoters of special interests on the ground 
they are malevolent, that they are bad men; I challenge 
leadership on the ground that they are ignorant men, that 
you have absorbed yourself in a particular business through 
your life, you have no other point of view than the point of vie 
that business and that, therefore, you are disqualified by ignor: 
from giving counsel as to the common interests. 
A witty English writer once said: “If you chain a man’s 
to a ledger and knock off something from his wages every ti 
stops adding up, you can’t expect him to have enlightened 
about the antipodes.” Simply, if you immerse a man in a 
undertaking, no matter how big that undertaking is, and kee 
immersed for half a life time, you can’t expect him to see 
horizon, you can’t expect him to see human life steadily or 
whole.      
   
         
           
    
   
       
    
    
     
    
    
    
    MEANS TO LIBERAL EDUCATION 
I once made this statement that a university was intend|

which I do not mean anything disrespectful to their father:

Now a kind of liberal education must underlie every who 
political and social process, the kind of liberal education 
connects a man’s feeling and his comprehension with the 
tun of mankind, which disconnects him from the special i 
and marries his thought to the common interests of gre: 
munities and of great cities and of great states and of great

     d, if possible, with that brotherhood of man that transcends the 
undaries of nations themselves. 
Those are the horizons to my mind of this social center move- 
nt, that they are going to unite the feelings and clarify the 
prehension of communities, of bodies of men who draw together 
conference. 
CONFERENCE ALWAYS MODIFIES AND IMPROVES THOUGHT 
would like to ask if this is not the experience of every person 
le who has ever acted in any conference of any kind. Did you 
ir go out of a conference with exactly the same view with which 
went in? If you did, I am sorry for you, you must be thought- 
t. For my part I can testify that I never carried a scheme 
a conference without having it profoundly modified by the 
icism of the other men in the conference and without recognizing 
m I came out that the product of the common council be- 
ed upon it was very much superior to any private thought 
might have been used for its development. The processes of 
tion, the contributions to consensus of minds, the compromises 
ought create those general movements which are the streams 
ndency and the streams of development. 
WILL MAKE EASIER SOLUTION OF GREAT PROBLEMS 
id so it seems to me that what is going to be produced by 
ovement, — not all at once, by slow and tedious stages, no 
, but nevertheless very certainly in the end, — is in the first 
a release of common forces now undiscovered, now somewhere 
d up, and now somewhere unavailable, the removal of bar- 
o the common understanding, the opening of mind to mind, 
larification of the air and the release in that clarified air of 
that can live in it, and just so certainly as you release those 
you make easier the fundamental problem of modern society, 
is the problem of accommodating the various interests in 
society to one another. 
ADJUSTMENT NECESSARY TO LIBERTY 
d to teach my classes in the university that liberty was a 
of adjustment and I was accustomed to illustrate it in this 
hen you have perfectly assembled the parts of a great steam 
for example, then when it runs, you say that it runs free; 
ans that the adjustment is so perfect that the friction is
-P-A-G-E-414
  392 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
reduced to a minimum, doesn’t it, and the minute you twist ar 
part out of alignment, the minute you lose adjustment, then the 
is a buckling up and the whole thing is rigid and useless. Nc 
to my mind, that is the image of human liberty; the individual 
free in proportion to his perfect accommodation to the whole, 
to put it the other way, in proportion to the perfect adjustment 
the whole to his life and interests. 
Take another illustration; you are sailing a boat, when do 
say that she is running free, when you have thrown her up it 
the wind? No, not at all. Every stick and stitch in her shi 
and you say she is in irons; nature has grasped her and s 
“You cannot go that way; ” but let her fall off, let the sheet 
and see her run like a bird skimming the waters. Why is 
free? Because she has adjusted herself to the great fore 
nature that is brewed with the breath of the wind. She is fr 
proportion as she is adjusted, as she is obedient, and so men 
free in society in proportion as their interests are accommod: 
to one another, and that is the problem of liberty.     
      
     
        
    
     
     
    
     
    
    
   
    
    
    
     ANALYSIS ACCOMPLISHED —NOW ASSEMBLED 
Liberty as now expressed is unsatisfactory in this co 
and in other countries because there has not been a satisfa 
adjustment and you cannot readjust the parts until you an 
them. Very well, we have analyzed them. Now this move} 
is intended to contribute to an effort to assemble them, bring 
together, let them look one another in the face, let them recko: 
one another and then they will codperate and not before. 
You cannot bring adjustment into play until you have g 
consent of the parts to act together, and then when you ha 
the adjustment, when you have discovered and released 
forces and they have accommodated themselves to each 
you have that control which is the sovereignty of the people. 
There is no sovereignty of the people if the several sections 
people be at loggerheads with one another; sovereignty com 
coéperation, sovereignty comes with mutual protection, sove 
comes with the quick pulses of sympathy, sovereignty com 
common impulse. 
You say and all men say that great political changes are i 
ing in this country. Why do you say so? Because ever| 
you go you find men expressing the same judgment, aliv 
same circumstances, determined to solve the problems b: 
together no matter what older bonds they may break, no 
what former prepossessions they may throw off, determine 
together and do the thing.

   ENLIGHTENED CONTROL IN PLACE OF MANAGEMENT 
And so you know that changes are impending because what 
s a body of scattered sentiment is now becoming a concentrated 
ce, and so with sympathy and understanding comes control, 
, in place of this control of enlightened and sovereign opinions, 
have had in the field of politics as elsewhere, the reign of,man- 
ment, and management is compounded of these two things, 
recy plus concentration. 
ou cannot manage a nation, you cannot manage the people 
state, you cannot manage a great population, you can manage 
some central force; what you do, therefore, if you want to 
age in politics or anywhere else is to choose a great single 
e or single group of forces, and then find some man or men 
cious and secretive enough to manage the business without 
g discovered. And that has been done for a generation in 
United States. 
ow, the schoolhouse among other things is going to break 
up. Is it not significant that this thing is being erected upon 
‘oundation originally laid in America, where we saw from the 
that the schoolhouse and the church were to be the pillars of 
epublic? Is it not significant that as if by instinct we return 
ose sources of liberty undefiled which we find in the common 
ing place, in the place owned by everybody, in the place 
nobody can be excluded, in the place to which everybody 
Is as by right? 
so what we are doing is simply to open what was shut, to 
e light come in upon places that were dark, to substitute for 
doors, open doors, for it does not make any difference how 
or how few come in provided anybody who chooses may 
in. So as soon as you have established that principle, you 
penings, and these doors are open as if they were the flood 
f life. 
FAITH IN PEOPLE JUSTIFIED 
not wonder that men are exhibiting an increased confidence 
judgments of the people, because wherever you give the 
a chance such as this movement has given them in the school- 
they avail themselves of it. This is not a false people, this 
people guided by blind impulses, this is a people who want 
, who want to think right, whose feelings are based upon 
whose instincts are for fairness and for the light. 
at I see in this movement is a recovery of the constructive 
tive genius of the American people, because the American

II. Wisconsin Free Liprary Commission 
[From the Ninth Biennial Report of the Wisconsin Free| 
Commission, 1911-1912, pp. 3-6.] 
It is a matter of some interest to the state that the 
Free Library Commission is under the state law engaged in 
number of activities than any commission in the countr
-P-A-G-E-417
    
  SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION 395      
   only commission which is the administrative body in control 
a legislative reference department. It is also the only commis- 
in which conducts a library school. As the commission is now 
anized it is administered through four departments: one de- 
tment engaged in establishing, organizing and maintaining 
lic libraries, one conducting the traveling library work of 
state, one an instructional department including the library 
ol of the university which is still under the control of the com- 
sion, and the legislative reference department. 
         
      
           
       
      
  WHAT THE COMMISSION DOES 
It helps establish, organize, and maintain public libraries. 
town is large enough to support a public library, the com- 
ion begins by furnishing a traveling library which costs the 
ity nothing. Then it sends speakers, puts articles in the 
r, writes letters and does everything in its power to explain 
a library will help the town and to line up the citizens be- 
a movement for a public library. It advises and counsels; 
nishes lists of books to be bought and tells how to buy them; 
ds workers to help catalog the books and organize the library. 
the town is ready for a new building, it makes suggestions 
plans, shows pictures of buildings elsewhere, meets with the 
y board and gives counsel and advice. If an application is 
made for a Carnegie gift, the details are often arranged by the 
ission. No matter how large or how old a library is, the 
ission keeps in touch with it, visits it periodically, sees that 
ept up to date, sends speakers to arouse interest, publishes 
if new books and material on new subjects, and assists in every 
making it an effective, aggressive, moral, social, educational, 
tilitarian force in the community. During the biennial 
the commission workers have made five hundred visits to 
les in the state, each visit extending from a few hours to sev- 
ys. 
‘he library commission makes librarians. Because there 
t enough well trained librarians in the state of Wiscon- 
e library commission six years ago established a library 
to train librarians who might take charge of Wisconsin 
s. This school is now as big and, in its field, as good 
in the country. In its instruction it tends toward the , 
| rather than the theoretical. The instructors first show 
ents how to do things and then take them out to do these 
n Wisconsin libraries, in Wisconsin towns, with Wisconsin

This the university now does, although the school is still under 
control of the library commission. 
The commission also conducts each year a summer session| 
six weeks. This session is primarily to help the librarians fr 
the smaller Wisconsin towns whose salaries are not large eno’ 
to enable them to attend the full professional course. 
This work is done by the instructional department of the libr 
school. 
3. The library commission loans books where there are 
public libraries. During the last two years, the commission 
out 1,949 boxes of books to communities where without them t! 
would be little or nothing to read. These traveling libraries 
small collections of books which are sent in stout, hinged boxe: 
the state from one community to another. They circulate fr 
charge except the cost of transportation. The libraries are 
up of the best popular books for adults and children, in fic 
history, travel, biography, science and literature. They ar 
tended for farming communities and small villages not enj 
public library privileges. The traveling library should be ke 
the most centrally located and most easily accessible place 
can be found. The local postoffice is usually the best place| 
it may be placed in the general store, or a private residence 
should if possible be accessible continuously or at frequent inte! 
The commission sends magazines and papers to lumbering c: 
Wherever there is a group of men or women or boys or girl 
wish to study any subject, the commission supplies not 
box of books upon the subject but a study outline as well. 
commission sends out books printed in German for the go 
German citizen who is too old to learn to read English; it 
Bohemian books for the Bohemian, Norwegian books for th 
wegian, Swedish books for the Swede, Polish books for the 
and Yiddish books for the good citizen who can read no 
language. 
4. The commission helps legislators legislate. The 
lative reference library is administered by the free librar. 
mission. In it you can find all that you can find collect 
where on law making subjects and much that can not b 
elsewhere. This department has helped the lawmakers of 
sin to understand and to frame such measures as the 
commission law, the public utilities act, the workmen

ensation law, the corrupt practice measures, and the indus- 
‘ial education law. The department, of course, puts into form 
lot its own ideas but the ideas of the legislator. Back of each 
ill drafted is the written request of a member of the legisla- 
e, containing definite directions and duly signed. No drafts- 
an is permitted to draw a bill without such a written request. 
5. The library commission prepares and issues publications 
value. 
(1) The Wisconsin library bulletin. A bi-monthly periodical 
issued by the commission as an economical way of communi- 
iting with the libraries and library officials of the state. 
(2) Book lists. To inform librarians as to the material which 
uld be placed in their libraries, the commission issues from time 
time various carefully selected lists. Among those more re- 
tly issued are the following: (a) Suggestive list of children’s 
ks. A carefully compiled annotated list of about 500 titles, 
piled by Helen T. Kennedy of the library school. (b) Soeio- 
ycal material free or easily obtainable. Two hundred and fifty- 
titles of the best material upon sociological subjects constantly

    Ill. Farmers’ Institures 
[From Hamilton, John, in Farmers’ Institute and Agricultu 
Extension Work in the United States. Annual Report, O 
of Experiment Station, U. S. Department of Agriculture, 19 
pp. 333 ff.] 
Reports of the farmers’ institute work for the year ended J 
30, 1912, were received from all the States excepting Virginia 
the island of Porto Rico. Institute meetings were held in all 
_the States and Territories excepting Nevada, Alaska, and P 
Rico. Although no institutes were reported for Louisiana, m| 
ings of institute character were conducted by the agricult 
experiment station as a form of college extension. 
INSTITUTES HELD 
The total number of institutes held during the year was 7, 
These were made up of 5,328 one-day meetings; 2,015 two 
and 247 three or more days, an increase over the previous ye 
1,380 one-day meetings and 288 two-day. There was an ince 
in the three or more day meetings of 33. The whole num 
days of institutes held in 1912 was 10,191, an increase of 2, 14 
the year 1911. 
SESSIONS 
The number of sessions was 19,430, or 2,689 more than 
held in 1911. This large increase is the more significant since 
in connection with the average attendance per session it me 
accurately the progress of the work. It shows an advance o: 
than 16 per cent over the sessions of the previous year. 
ATTENDANCE 
The attendance reported at the regular institutes was 2,5: 
with an average of 131 persons per session. This shows an in

   tendance over the previous year of 257,342. While under the 
stem adopted by the American Association of Farmers’ Institute 
orkers for computing attendance duplications occur, yet the 
tals serve for comparison with those of previous years. When, 
wever, the total number reported in attendance is divided by 
number of half-day and evening sessions held, error is elimi- 
ited and the progress of the work is accurately shown. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
he appropriations from all sources for institute support in 1912 
lounted to $533,972.09, an increase of $101,278.62 over 1911. 
appropriations by the State legislatures were $439,186.54, 
from other sources $94,875.55. The amount expended in 
ying on the work was $487,832.17, or an average of $25.10 per 
ion of institute as against $25 in 1911. The amount appro- 
ted for institute purposes for 1913 by 35 States reporting is 
020. 
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION AID 
irty-eight of the agricultural colleges and experiment stations 
ished from their faculties and staffs 474 lecturers, who con- 
ted 6,018 days of time to institute instructions. This is an 
ase of 129 lecturers and 1,759 days of service over the previous 
The figures show that the colleges and stations are. alive to 
portance of this work, and notwithstanding the large increase 
ident students in their institutions are sending out more men 
the institute field and are giving more time to this form of 
ction each year. The average time given to institute work 
ch college or experiment-station lecturer in 1912 was 12.7 
in 1911 it was 12 days. 
SPECIAL INSTITUTES 
vable schools of agriculture and home economies were held 
tates. The total number of these schools was 164, occupying 
ys of time, with a registered attendance of 137,669, an in- 
in attendance over the previous year of 89,234. 
ly-four educational trains were run in 24 States. Twenty of 
tates reported 310 lecturers accompanying these trains, and 
attendance in 23 States of 1,033,735. Two thousand one 
d and six stops were made at which meetings were held and 
miles of road were covered.

   Independent institutes were held in 17 States to the number 
609. There were 971 sessions, with an attendance of 138,59: 
Seventeen round-up institutes embracing 166 sessions were held i 
17 States, with an attendance of 46,464. 
Four hundred and fifty-nine fairs, picnics, and conventions we’ 
visited, and addressed by institute lecturers, with a total atten 
ance of 123,881. Fifty field demonstrations were given by sev 
expert demonstrators, the attendance not reported. 
The aggregate attendance at all of the special institutes report: 
was 1,480,347, making the entire attendance at institutes of 
kinds for the year 4,029,546. 
FARMERS’ INSTITUTES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
One hundred institutes for young people were held in 5 St: 
extending over 107 days and consisting of 163 sessions. The 
tendance is reported at 14,245. Two States conducted 28 mov: 
schools for young people. The schools covered 121 days, and h 
total attendance of 6,054. 
Many institute directors do not yet seem to appreciate the 
portance of institutes specially adapted to young people of 
ages of 14 to 18. It must be perfectly clear, however, to ever: 
who has observed the interest taken by boys in their corn-club y 
and in the boy scout movement, as well as by girls in their h 
economics and art association work, that young people in 
country are ready now to join the movement for increasing 
knowledge of agriculture and home economics if institutes adaj 
to their ages and attainments were organized and judici 
conducted. 
WOMEN’S INSTITUTES 
Separate institutes for women were held in 8 States to the 
ber of 720. The States were Michigan, North Carolina, Okla 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wise: 
The institutes embraced a period of 916 days, and occupied 
sessions. The total attendance is given at 78,776. This 
advance over the previous year of 418 institutes, 542 day: 
sessions, and 30,814 in attendance. 
The great progress made during the year strikingly app 
the 8 States reporting work of this character for both the 
of 1911 and 1912 are compared. The comparison show: 
there has been an increase of 870 sessions, and of 43,767 in 
ance in 1912 over 1911. If the 40 other States had org 
institutes separately for women there is every reason to

lat equal gains would have occurred in them all, and that many 
lousands of women now deprived of the privilege and advantage 
such meetings would have been greatly aided in their social life 
well as in their home economics work. Here, too, there is need 
general awakening to the opportunity for service that the or- 
izing of institutes for women affords to the directors in the 
eral States. 
MOVABLE AND CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS 
ne hundred and sixty-four movable schools of agriculture were 
in 14 States. The instruction continued through 829 days, 
an attendance of 137,669. Ninety-one of these schools were 
en and continued over 490 days, with an attendance of 68,511. 
y-five were for women, continued over 218 days, with an 
mdance of 11,059. Twenty-eight were schools for young peo- 
continued over 121 days and attended by 6,054. Last year 168 
ols of this character were held, covering 659 days, with an 
dance of 48,465, showing a considerable increase both in days 
ted to this work and also in the number in attendance. 
ese figures do not show the entire amount of movable school 
done during the year. Inanumber of the States this work has 
detached from the farmers’ institute and transferred to the 
sion department of the agricultural colleges, and therefore 
not appear in the institute report. The statements made 
, however, that the work is growing rapidly and is supple- 
ing the old form of institute by devoting longer periods to 
ction in the localities where the meetings are held. It must 
mfessed, however, that in but few instances have they met 
andard for movable school work set by the Office of Experi- 
Stations. Much of the instruction is still fragmentary and 
hat superficial. It would be greatly to the advantage of the 
le school enterprise if demonstrations by experts could be 
show precisely how the system proposed can be most effi- 
operated. 
ilar demonstrations showing the practicability of conveying 
ation by means of the method of correspondence outlined

demonstrations carefully conducted along the lines there 
led showing how agricultural instruction of high grade can

   402 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
ITINERANT WORK IN TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES AND RURAL SCHOO. 
The farmers’ institutes in a number of States have been detaili 
lecturers to address school teachers at their country institutes 
conventions. Also to visit the normal schools, high schools, 
common schools to speak to the students on subjects related) 
agriculture and rural life. 
During the past year 12 State directors reported that 55 of t! 
instructors had given 371 days of time to teachers’ institutes 
that they had met in these institutes a total of 32,642 pers 
Four hundred and five men gave 612 days to high-school inst 
tion, meeting 91,705 persons; 9 men gave 21 days to instruc 
in the normal schools, meeting 2,050 persons; 42 men devote 
aggregate of 2,953 days to lecturing in the rural public sch 
meeting 72,379 children; 74 men gave 3,796 days to itinerant 
among farmers, giving advice and conducting demonstrati 
and 18 men gave 2,350 days to other forms of extension work. 
The effect of efforts in these several directions cannot be 
nitely known, but that they are productive of great good in sti 
lating interest among rural people in advanced agriculture a: 
the betterment of rural conditions is unquestioned.

IV. Unrversity Extension 
[From Van Hise, Charles R.,. President’s Report. Bie 
Report of the Regents of the University of Wisconsin, 1906- 
pp. 18-21.] 
University Extension Reorganized. No step in the pr 
of the university during the biennial period has been more ii 
tant than that of the reorganization of the extension division. 
many years university extension has been announced in the 
logues. However, aside from agricultural extension, the 
consisted mainly in sporadic lectures or groups of lectures in v| 
parts of the state as called for by the citizens. While some 
spondence work was undertaken some years ago, until the re 
ization of the division it had practically ceased to exist as 
activity of the university. This situation was an extremely 
sirable one, and therefore the question arose as to whet! 
extension work, other than agricultural, in the university 
be vivified or killed. Certainly, it could not be allowed to e 
in a moribund condition.

   SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION 403 
The enormous success of the commercial correspondence school 
gested that here was an educational opportunity which had 
n neglected by the universities. At my request, Dr. Charles 
‘Carthy investigated the work of the commercial schools with 
lerence to the people of Wisconsin. He found that these schools, 
ile having certain defects, are undoubtedly performing a great 
cational work, and moreover the astonishing fact was disclosed 
t many thousands of persons in the state of Wisconsin were 
ing correspondence work for which they were paying out 
dreds of thousands of dollars per annum. 
‘he situation was placed before the regents at the meeting in 
e, 1906, and as a result of this a small appropriation was granted 
egin the reorganization of the extension work. The fund was 
sufficient to secure a permanent director of extension. Mr. 
. Legler, of the free library commission, was so deeply inter- 
in the movement that he consented to act temporarily as 
tary without compensation. The response of the state to the 
of the university to do effective extension work was immediate. 
e general interest shown in extension was so great before the 
f the first year that the legislature of 1907 appropriated $20,000 
r to support university extension. With this fund available 
ime had come for the appointment of a director.... Al- 
the university extension division is so strongly organized 
in the university and is held in such esteem among the people 
state that this division is recognized as of great importance 
g the branches of the university. 
report of Director Reber shows that the extension work is 
ized in four departments, (1) correspondence study, (2) in- 
ion by lectures, (3) debating and public discussion, and 
neral information and welfare. In his report he gives fully 
lope of the work of each of these departments, and this report 
not summarize. 
espondence Instruction. It is, however, worthy of note 
it the end of the first year of the appropriation for extension 
han one thousand students are doing regular correspondence 
The weaknesses of correspondence instruction in the past 
een (1) that it does not bring together the student and in- 
r, and (2) that the student works alone. Because of these 
n unnatural amount of stamina is required of the student, 
r that he shall persist in his work. It has been the experi- 
the commercial correspondence schools that only a small 
of the students beginning a course continue to the end. 
tor Reber has devised a plan which removes these defects. 
the institution of the traveling professor, several of whom
-P-A-G-E-426
        404 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
     are now members of our staff. Once fortnightly, and we hope 
the future it may be once a week, the professor meets a group 
students in the same subject and thus gives the lively interest whi 
comes from contact with the instructor. At the same time 
second defect is overcome. The students, while not necessai 
working at the same rate, meet one another in the class room 
have the stimulus which comes from a group working upon 
same subject. 
Cooperation of Manufacturers. To put this plan into op 
tion required the cooperation of the manufacturers. The 
fessor could conveniently meet the students only at the manu 
turing establishments where they are at work. It is 
fortunate that in this state the manufacturers have show 
enlightened spirit in this matter. Already a considerable nu 
of the manufacturers in Milwaukee have furnished class room 
the traveling professors, and have given every encourageme: 
the men who take work in the extension division even to the e 
of paying the men when attending the classes. There can b 
doubt that the action of the manufacturers of Milwaukee is 
tical wisdom; for the men taking extension courses will bi 
proved in their efficiency and earning power both for the 
facturers and for themselves. Of equal, or greater, impor 
will be the increased good will between the employer and emp 
because of the interest of the former in the latter. 
Debating and Public Discussion. There are various 
lines of extension work which have been markedly successf 
first year. One of these is the department of debating and 
discussion. There is a strong desire for active intellectual 
the village and rural communities. Accurate knowledge is d 
upon public questions. There has been in the past no way in 
this desire could be efficiently met. To illustrate, the de 
societies, many of which have existed for a long time, freq 
discussed general questions which really led nowhere. This 
tunity for educational work has been seized by the extensio 
sion. Live political and social questions have been furnis! 
the debating societies, with syllabi of the sound argument: 
each side, and references to the authorities. By coopera 
the extension division with the free library commission, or 
extension division directly, the necessary material has be 
to the communities. Not only have existing debating s 
been thus assisted, but many new literary and debating si 
have been formed.

enough for knowledge to exist in books to be obtained by 
under favored circumstances; the knowledge must be carried 
to the people. This, of course, is done through the regular 
ol channels in a very large way. But because of unfavorable 
mstances there are immense numbers of boys and girls who 
bliged to begin a vocation before their education has even 
d through the elementary school. It is necessary to supple- 
the education of the schools by the further education which 
be availed of by the adult as well as the child. The univer- 
xtension division does not compete with the schools or other 
ng educational institutions. It supplements them all. 
e aggressive business man does not wait for the consumer to 
the wholesale establishment to purchase his articles. He 
is products out to the retail stores by advertisement, by travel- 
ents, and in other ways. Also, more and more, the manu- 
er is beginning to establish retail stores in various parts of 
untry to sell his goods. Are we to be less aggressive in educa- 
han we are in business? It seems to me that the proper 
ris clear. If the nation is to solve the various great ques- 
which are before it, if the people are to succeed in obtaining 
rable material environment, if they are to gain a reasonable 
ctual and spiritual life, it must be by carrying to the masses 
owledge which the scholars and investigators of the world 
btained, and such is the purpose of the extension division of the

made different provisions for higher education, the state 
ersity being the common type in the south and west, and

great variety of ways in which the different states meet 
ucational problems may be indicated briefly : 
w England the state systems of education, except in Maine, 
of well-developed elementary and secondary schools, under 
rol partly of local and partly of state authorities, culminat- 
niversities, colleges, and technical schools independent of 
trol. In each one of these five New England states there 
titution that was founded on the proceeds of the so-called 
rant from the federal government, and that now receives 
ations from the state; but no one of these approximates 
ion of a western state university. In Vermont the insti- 
ceiving this grant is a part of one of the older endowed 
in Massachusetts a part of the annual grant from the 
lovernment is given to the similarly endowed Massachu- 
itute of Technology, which has also been assisted by the 
islature. Maine alone has ceased to conform to the

practice of the other New England states, and, within the 1 
decade, has developed her agricultural and mechanical college i 
a state university at the head of the state system of educati 
after the manner of the western states. 
New York possesses an education system that is unique am 
the states. There is no state university, although Cornell, foun 
by Ezra Cornell with the assistance of the federal grants, app 
to be approaching some such status. All higher education, hj 
ever, is under state supervision to a degree elsewhere unkni 
through a department of the state government entitled the Uni 
sity of the State of New York, the board of regents of whi 
elected by the legislature. This institution is not a teaching b 
but is intrusted with important powers over all institutio 
higher education whose charters do not antedate its crea 
No corporation may call itself a college or university, or ¢ 
degrees in academic or professional subjects, without the pe 
sion of the regents. This permission is given only after an i 
tigation of the curricula of the institution, its financial cond 
and its equipment. While their demands, particularly as re: 
finances and equipment, are not rigorous, the regents have no 
prevented paper colleges and universities from establishing 
home in New York, but have kept the words “ college ” and 
versity ’’ approximately close to their proper meaning. Th 
nition of a college upon which the regents proceed in grantin; 
ters to educational institutions is the definition adopted 
Foundation. 
New Jersey has no state university, and has adopted th 
tice of Vermont in handing over the federal grants to on 
older endowed colleges. The last legislature revised the 
administration extensively, and placed at its head a sup 
dent of education with comprehensive powers, without, h 
any jurisdiction over higher education. 
Pennsylvania, as well as New York, has a unique me 
dealing with higher education. Pennsylvania has created 
institutions, but has assisted institutions under private 
with grants from the public treasury. The University of 
vania has received assistance from the state from time 
but the only administrative connection with the state is 
governor of Pennsylvania is the president of the board of 
of the university. The University of Pittsburgh has of 
ceived large grants by act of the legislature, without ha 
administrative connection with the state. The federa| 
supplemented by large state aid, go to the Pennsylva: 
College, an institution which, although inconveniently |

de provision by which in course of time the thirteen so-called 
te normal schools may be purchased by the public authorities 
become state institutions in reality. Hitherto these normal 
lools have been private corporations enjoying large annual 
ts from the state, the control of the state being limited to a 
t to select a certain proportion of trustees upon the nomination 
he holders of stock. The control of this stock has in general 
me highly centralized, and has often been exercised commer- 
ly rather than educationally.

institution, now known as Delaware College, forms the head 
e state system of education. Delaware has no state normal

chools of Pennsylvania. 
Maryland, also, the federal grants were given to a private 
ration, the Maryland Agricultural College, one of the oldest 
lutions of the kind in the Union, upon the state being given 
privilege of naming one-half of the trustees. The Johns

Isewhere ; one old endowed college, St. John’s at Annapolis,

ustees are merely grouped together under this nominal title. 
District of Columbia has no institution of higher education 
nder any measure of governmental administration or con- 
organically with the high school or public school system of 
ton. Congress, moreover, occupied with its larger duties, 
eglected, as the local legislature for the district, to throw 
rds around the establishment of institutions that, under the 
laws of the district, any three citizens, no matter how meagre 
alifications, may incorporate themselves as a university 
fer any degree, except in medicine. It is not necessary 
to procure any endowment, to own any equipment, or 
have any habitat beyond a post-office address. The

become logically the home of a large number of institutions wh 
dishonest practices are immensely aided by the apparent pres 
of a location at the federal capital, and by the astounding prj 
lege which enables these enterprises to say truly, that they 
“incorporated under the provisions of an Act of Congress.” 
impossible to believe that the many educated men in both ho 
of Congress will not gladly terminate this abuse, whenever 
college authorities that are among their constituents shall gene 
request it. 
The Atlantic states, south of Washington, and the South Ce 
states classify themselves in two groups according to their atti 
toward the public administration of higher education. 
Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, 
Arkansas have concentrated all of the state institutions of hi 
education into a single state university. In all of these gs} 
except Georgia and Tennessee, this state university represe 
development of the state agricultural and mechanical college 
was originally endowed by the federal grants. In Kentuck 
state agricultural college has recently become the state univ: 
In Florida the state university is subject both to a board of tr 
and to the visitorial jurisdiction of the state board of educ 
which consists of the governor and certain elective official 
are popularly styled his cabinet. In West Virginia there is 
board of control in addition to the regents of the state univ, 
Oklahoma has a similar state board, with even more ex 
powers. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Missi 
Alabama, Texas, and Oklahoma have each several, sometim 
peting, state institutions of higher education. In Virginia 
mission has been endeavoring to reduce all such actual and 
conflicts into one comprehensive and harmonious edu 
program. Mississippi has attempted to solve this prob 
constituting a “ Board of Trustees of the Higher Edu 
Institutions of the State of Mississippi.” 
The states of the North Central and Western divisions 
several typical groups. Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
Nebraska, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, and C 
have centered all of the state’s functions with regard t 
education under one administrative control in a single s 
versity. Indiana has two state institutions of higher e 
under separate control, but the work of each so complem 
of the other that together the two form practically o 
university. Indiana University is unique among state un 
in intrusting the election of all of its trustees to the State 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
      HIGHER AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION 411   
   
  ducation and to the alumni of the institution. Montana, South 
akota, and Iowa have not given their state universities the com- 
llete control of the higher education of the state, but in these states 
l state institutions of higher education are under the control of 
single board. 
North Dakota, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wash- 
gton, and Oregon have each two or three separate state insti- 
tions of higher education, each under separate government. 
hile these several institutions in a single state often compete, 
ley do not all pretend to be state universities. A state univer- 
'y is admitted, at least formally, to be the head of the educational 
tem, while the other institutions, chiefly agricultural and me- 
nical colleges and schools of technology, however their work 
y overlap that of the university, merely claim to perform cer- 
of the functions of a state university. Oregon has a “ Board 
Higher Curricula” to prevent such duplication. In Ohio, on 
other hand, there are, at least in theory, three state universi- 
The Ohio State University at the capital, evolved from the

e appropriations: during the last decade, is rapidly attaining 
osition of prominence among state universities. But Ohio

xford, as state universities, and gives them a measure of state 
These universities, to the measure of their financial ability, 
avor to compete with the university at Columbus, and the 
‘usion so produced is perhaps the chief reason that the educa- 
1 system of Ohio is less efficient than that of some of the 
boring commonwealths. 
Michigan, where the idea of a state university first attained 
development and influence, there are, apart from the normal 
Is, three state institutions of higher education with some 
e of competition between them. The powers of the regents 
le University of Michigan exceed those in other states. The 
s originally made to the university by the federal government, 
he incomes from these grants, are under the immediate con- 
f the regents. The legislature has no power over them, 
gh it can give or withhold appropriations from the state 
ry. 
eneral, then, in most of the Atlantic states the state support 
er education is confined to the general support of schools of 
logy and to state grants to privately endowed academic 
chnical institutions. Half of the other states in the Union 
tate universities that include technical education. The

       412 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
The attitude of the several groups of states toward the publ 
support of higher education is indicated by the following fractio 
representing the proportion of students in tax-supported as co: 
pared with privately supported or endowed universities, colleg 
and schools of technology:    
   4 of the North Atlantic states have ? of their students in endow 
institutions 
2 of the South Atlantic States have 2 of their students in endo 
institutions 
2 of the South Central states have 3 of their students in endo 
institutions

     In six of the Western states practically no higher educatio: 
provided except by tax-supported institutions. This is true 
where else except in Delaware, while its neighbor, New Jerse 
the only state that has no primarily tax-supported institutio: 
higher education. 
The attitude of the several groups of states to the public sup 
of education in general may be judged from the following 
centages representing the proportion of students of various gr 
in tax-supported as compared with privately supported or end 
institutions. These proportions of students in tax-supp' 
institutions are:    
   
   
   
North Atlantic states, 15% college, 96% normal school, 
school students 
South Atlantic states, 43% college, 78% normal school, 
school students 
South Central states, 41% college, 63% normal school, 
school students 
North Central states, 56% college, 86% normal school, 
school students 
Western states, 87% college, 92% normal school, 84 
school students    
   The North Central and the Western states thus appear a 
one-third more interested in publicly supported education th 
South Atlantic and the South Central states; the North A 
states occupy a middle position among the five divisions 
same relation is preserved when the percentage of children e1 
in the public schools is also considered. The position of the

tlantic states is especially interesting by reason of the strength

rgely attended in this than in any other section of the country.

owever, grown up in the last ten or fifteen years a movement which 
mtemplates a mingling of these two plans, — an institution draw- 
g large appropriations from the state, but over which the state 
ercises no authority. This movement has obtained headway 
ainly in the New England and Atlantic states, and particularly 
those states where there is no tax-supported university. In- 
ed, one of the arguments which has been most commonly used 
the appeal to legislatures for such appropriations has been the 
a that it was necessary for privately endowed institutions to 
et what is called the “ educational competition ” of the great 
-supported universities, and that the states where no state 
versity had been founded should therefore assist the privately 
owed institutions. In this situation again the question of 
lege competition has been made to play a large réle. 
m the New England states New Hampshire makes a grant to 
tmouth College nearly twice as large as the grant to its state 
lege of agriculture and mechanic arts. Vermont gives subsi- 
to all three of the privately endowed institutions of higher 
ation in the state, the University of Vermont (which is not a 
le university), Middlebury College, and Norwich University. 
Massachusetts the legislature a few years ago made large 
inuing grants to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
a year later similar, but smaller grants to the Worcester Poly- 
ic Institute. In the State of New York public funds are 
ted, under somewhat more carefully framed conditions, to 
ell University, Alfred University, St. Lawrence University, and 
use University. In Pennsylvania state aid to privately 
‘olled educational and philanthropic institutions — universi- 
schools, hospitals, ete. — has been developed to an extent 
aled elsewhere. Among the institutions which now partici- 
extensively in state aid are the University of Pennsylvania

‘hese considerations bring up at once a topic often discussed in 
mt years, namely, the need in each state in the Union of an 
uate system of educational administration and supervision. 
clear from our experience of the last twenty-five years, as well 
rom that of other nations, that somewhere in each common- 
Ith there should be an educational agency dealing with the 
er institutions of learning and with the secondary and elemen- 
institutions as well, for these schools are not unrelated enter- 
s, but are all parts of one thing. Such places should seek out 
lablest men. 
e most serious effort which has been made in this direction 
the State of New York, where the University of the State of 
York has had supervision over elementary, secondary, and 
ical education; and its work has resulted in far greater uni- 
ity and efficiency in the schools of New York than is to be 
in most of the other states. The University of the State 
w York, practically the State Department of Education, has 
however, no authority over higher institutions of learning, 
least, it has never exercised such authority. For this reason, 
ore, it has been able to do only a limited work in the corre- 
of higher and secondary education. Recent efforts to deal 
ithe institutions of education in Iowa and in Massachusetts 
described in my last annual report. The creation of such 
issions undoubtedly marks a step in the direction of an 
supervision of education in the interest of unity, economy, 
ciency, but as tried in both these states the commissions 
ertain weaknesses which make the ultimate outcome more or 
ubtful. In neither Iowa nor Massachusetts has this body 
pervision of the whole educational system. Again, even 
icomposed of able and intelligent men, such commissions

political, and generally have lacked the power, responsibility, a: 
financial reward necessary to attract strong men. Furthermoi 
as a rule, these officers have had no relation to higher educati 
whether in institutions under state control or in those upon priv: 
foundation. Colleges and universities have almost universa| 
resented any inspection or scrutiny on the part of the state. T 
objection has not been without justification in the past on 
ground that the men at the head of state departments of educat; 
have generally been appointed through partisan considerati 
Very rarely have they been men of such high educational qual 
cation as to fit them for a general scrutiny of state instituti

qualifications. They should be places of such dignity and secu; 
as to attract the best men. Until that time comes, it is idl 
hope that the higher institutions of learning can be helped or

placed under the departments of education. Just so long as; 
state superintendent’s office is in politics, its influence will 
thrown toward those educational measures which count for ]j 
numbers rather than toward those which count for efficiency 
therefore for the ultimate interest of the whole people. 
All of this, however, does not detract from the fact that the 
unquestionably should have the power to scrutinize and r 
upon the educational institutions it has chartered, whether 
call themselves state institutions or private institutions.

The practical question is how to secure an agency in the 
stage of educational and political development which s' 
able to bring into helpful codperation the more or less d 
institutions now engaged in the educational work of the 
universities, colleges, technical schools, normal schools, high 
and industrial schools. 
In the present situation a commission seems the most pra 
agency to which one can turn. A small state commission

representatives of the various educational institutions and em- 
ered to scrutinize and report upon institutions of all kinds would 
im likely to bring about a better understanding of common 
blems and a more just view of the whole educational problem. 
fh a commission would naturally have a representative from 
office of the state superintendent, from the state university, 
one of the strong endowed colleges, from the normal schools, 
from the high schools. Such a commission would be a step 
ard in the use of the expert in American education. A body 
hosen, comprised of educational experts who were also high- 
ed men, could at least do two things. It could let the people 
e state know what their institutions were actually doing, and 
uld point the way toward a better understanding, a closer 
eration, and a higher efficiency of the separate parts of the 
educational system. For the state problem of education is 
roblem, and it will never be efficiently solved until the various 
ies for education have abandoned an attitude which is often 
f hostility or of armed neutrality for one of active codperation. 
all such efforts, the first step to be taken is to disarm sus- 
and promote good-will.

At the time the first report of this Board was submitted, 
a few months had elapsed for the board to study its probl 
and organize for its work. It was a reasonable request, there! 
that the Board made, namely that more time than had alr 
elapsed should be allowed for a study of the more important 
lems confronting it, before anything like a definite policy sh 
be announced. 
In making this request for more time, special reference was} 
to the problem of the coordination of the institutions comm 
to the Board’s care. It was recognized from the beginning tha| 
legislature had this problem primarily in mind when this 
was established. The joint legislative committee which m:

creation of this Board, made that document specific on this 
The debate preceding the passage of the bill, and numerous |

of the chief reasons for the creation of a single board was to 
of needless and expensive duplications, and to cause these 
owned and state-supported institutions to cease being rival 
become cooperating units in a comprehensive system of 
education. 
The institutions as they exist to-day are the natural out; 
of the system under which they have grown up. Gover: 
separate boards, each developed without much thought 
other, and the General Assembly had not time during it 
sessions to do more than get a superficial knowledge of th 
situation. It became more and more apparent, however, 
went on, that unjustifiable duplications existed, and t 
‘institutions instead of being cooperating units in a general 
were to all intents and purposes rivals of each other. It wa: 
an end to these rivalries that this Board was created.

  tifiable and what unjustifiable. The subject was discussed 
ally and informally — in board meetings and outside; it was 
ussed with business men, legislators and educators as oppor- 
ity offered. Finally, a majority of the Board came to feel 
tt two existing duplications were without justification and 
itively harmful, not only from the standpoint of the useless 
nditure of money, but because their existence begat weak- 
and hindered progress. ‘These duplications were, first, in 
Meering, as between the University and the State College of 
culture and Mechanic Arts, and, second, in liberal arts, as

   DUPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING 
us consider briefly the reasons which led the Board to con- 
late engineering at Ames and liberal arts at the University. 
as found that the engineering department at the State Col- 
f Agriculture and Mechanic Arts was founded in 1868, that 
alue of the plant and equipment at the present time is ap- 
nately $550,000.00, salary budget $60,000.00, number of pro- 
24, instructors 16, students 589. The University College of 
d Science was founded in 1905. The value of the plant 
uipment is $201,000.00, salary budget $36,000.00, number 
fessors 8, instructors 10, students 168. It should be stated 
connection that engineering was taught after a fashion 
State University for many years, but the College of Ap- 
cience, as now organized was established in 1905. While, 
ically, engineering might more logically have been estab- 
riginally and exclusively at the University, the fact is that 
not so established, and not having been thus established, 
stion the wisdom of attempting to establish it when it was 
established, only seven years ago, especially in view of 
that the State already possessed at Ames a department 
ering which had demonstrated its capacity to accomplish 
rk in this field. 
to 1905, the University budget in engineering had never 
much as $6,000.00 per annum. Immediately upon the 
hment of the College of Applied Science on the present 
her departments sadly in need of development had to 
ide. For example, three years ago the budget of the 
partment of English was only $8,000.00. The neglect of 
ege of Medicine was well-nigh disgraceful. Had the 
voted to the building up of the College of Applied Science 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
  426 EXTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
been spent on departments already established, the Univers| 
would be better off to-day and would have more students. 
The contention that engineering cannot be adequately develo 
at the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, is not tenal 
The work which this institution has done up to the present t 
speaks for itself. It numbers among its alumni men who 
done some of the most notable tasks accomplished in enginee| 
in recent years. Incident to the courses in agriculture an 
veterinary medicine, there are at Ames, and there always mus 
strong courses in the sciences, in English, and in the mo 
languages. The courses at the University and at Ames in the 
eral departments of engineering parallel each other absolutely, 
there be anything in the argument referred to, then the best 
under the conditions that obtain in Iowa, is to do what has 
done in medicine and law, that is to raise the standards of a 
sion to, say, two years of college work, outline it, and let 
spective students in engineering take their preparatory wo! 
the University or wherever they choose. We do not look 
this argument as practical. Some of the best engineering s 
in America are not connected with universities, nor do they 
tain extensive cultural courses. The Massachusetts Instit 
Technology, the Troy Polytechnic Institute, and the institut; 
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, are separate and apart from c 
of liberal arts. 
It is to be stated, moreover, in favor of the engineering 
ment at Ames, that it has touched the commercial and ind 
life of this state as the department at the University hj 
touched it. 
Therefore, because the Board firmly believes that it is abs| 
unjustifiable for the state to maintain within 125 miles 
other two engineering schools covering practically the sa 
and for the further reason that the federal statute make 
ligatory to maintain engineering at Ames, it has been de 
discontinue the College of Applied Science at the Univers 
concentrate the engineering work at Ames. 
Another thing must not be forgotten, namely that wher 
cations such as these are maintained, the result invariabl 
neither college approximates the highest standards. If 
leges of engineering were continued, it would be the dut; 
Board to request of the legislature a large sum for a 
equipment at Iowa City, to be available immediately ; and 
be no less the duty of the legislature to vote the money 
anticipation of the action taken, the appropriations for 
partment have been held down to the lowest point.

DUPLICATIONS AT THE TEACHERS’ COLLEGE 
The Iowa State Normal School was established in the early 70’s 
train teachers for the common schools, and for many years it 
s, strictly speaking, a normal school. Latterly it became am- 
ious to extend its field to the granting of collegiate degrees, 
it has gone even to the extent of offering graduate work. The 
islative committee of which the late Senator Whipple was the

touching the proper place for a school of education of col-

HOME ECONOMICS 
The work in Home Economics now being carried on at the S 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts is to be transferr: 
the University for the following reasons: 
First, to avoid duplications which must otherwise be cre 
There are at the University at the present time approxim: 
eight hundred young women who are clamoring for the estab 
ment of a department of home economics. Moreover, this sul 
should be pursued in connection with a wide range of sub 
in liberal culture which already exist at the University, but 
do not and cannot without further expensive duplication, 
at the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. There i 
at the University a college of fine arts, and this, in conn 
with a strong college of liberal arts, is a most valuable a 
for those interested in household arts. Besides, many of 
studying home economics expect to become teachers, and 
desirable that they should take advantage of the opport 
offered by a college of education. 
It is evidently not understood by the public generally th 
home economics course at the State College of Agricultur] 
purely technical course designed to prepare young women t 
this subject. It is not a home-makers’ course as many s! 
believe, primarily designed to aid young women from th 
toward better housekeeping. It is a teachers’ course. No 
enter it who has not mastered the requirements insisted u 
entrance to the standard colleges. Formerly a home- 
course of two years existed at this institution, but it was al 
years ago by the former board of trustees, and this strictly 
course was established in lieu thereof. 
Second: There is still another reason. It is the aim 
Board to introduce at the State College of Agriculture 
chanic Arts short courses in all of the departments of agr 
and, in connection with the engineering department, wo! 
trade school lines. One of the great defects of our ed 
system is that very little is being done, either in the publi

     the colleges, for that great body of young people who cannot take 
time to master the entrance requirements for admission to 
ndard colleges. They leave the public school before they enter 
high school, which as now constituted is intended to be the 
tibule of the college. Without in any way disturbing the high 
dards of college work now existing at the State College of 
iculture and Mechanic Arts, it is the intention of this Board 
tilize this great plant for the benefit of the young men from 
farms who can spare only a short time for this work, and give 
an opportunity to do work along practical lines, and to do 
same thing for the young men seeking to develop themselves 
g mechanical lines. As it is now, the boys outnumber the 
at this institution four to one. When the plan outlined shall 
been carried out, they will outnumber them ten or more

ion as hitherto. The extension work in home economics and

gress in professional education throughout the United States 
the past decade has been no less significant than the prog-

Such a vocation is rightly considered a profession, and for its pr

sity. On the other hand, pharmacy is a calling which dema 
elementary technical knowledge, with accuracy and faithful 
in following out the instructions of another. It does not call 
the development of the sort of independent thinking that the 
fession of medicine demands. It is certainly a question whe 
or no such a calling is to be ranked among professions, and whe’ 
a university should undertake the supervision of the trainin; 
such students any more than it would undertake the trainin, 
students in any other technical vocation. 
In general, it may be said that a profession not only rests 
higher educational qualities and more extended educational 
ifications, but also that the individual practising a profe: 
assumes also a public or a quasi-public responsibility. The

No consideration more closely touches the progress of edu

States in this matter during the last ten years shows many 
of encouragement along with many reactionary steps. U. 
cently colleges and universities have assumed a very small 
of responsibility for their professional schools, particularly f 
schools of medicine and of law. Most universities have 
the possession of these schools because of the desire for instit 
completeness. In many cases universities have allowed gr 
practitioners of law or of medicine to form professional 
under the university charters, the connection with the uni 
being of the slightest possible sort, and in a very large pr

In this country it is usual to provide in the state constituti

of location of the institution, and that it shall have power to gi

any restrictions, while in a few instances, as in Michigan

There should be established in each state a council of educati

Regents of the University of New York, and it should be compos 
of the most eminent men in the state, without any reference 
political considerations. No degree-conferring institution sho 
be incorporated without the approval of the council of educati 
which should be indorsed upon or filed with the certificate of 
corporation. That council should have the right to fix the mi 
mum standard of requirements for admission and graduati 
and the conditions under which degrees may be conferred, and 
degree-conferring power should be withheld from all instituti 
not complying with the regulations established. Such legislat 
should be made applicable to all institutions thereafter in 
porated, as well as to those already incorporated, when the state 
reserved the power to modify the powers conferred. It could 
be made to apply to institutions already incorporated in ¢ 
where the state has not reserved power to do so. 
There appears to be no good reason for doubting the cons 
tionality of the proposed legislation. No constitutional provi 
is violated by creating a commission or council, and giving it 
power to decide the questions which otherwise would be lef 
each institution to decide for itself. The principle that legisl 
power cannot be delegated is not involved. On determining 
questions submitted to it, the council is no more engaged in 
of legislation than would be the institutions themselves oi

IX. Tue UNIVERSITY AND THE STATE 
rom Van Hise, Charles R., Commencement Address (1910), 
University of Wisconsin.] 
The strength of the state university lies in its close relations to 
state. The state demands of it service; the university feels 
eculiar obligation to the state in which it is situated. It is the 
y of the state university to instruct young men and women; 
is its duty to advance knowledge, and especially those lines of 
wledge which concern the development of the state. It is the 
y of the staff of the state university to be at the service of the 
e along all lines in which their expert knowledge will be helpful ; 
their duty to assist in carrying knowledge to the people. 
‘hese relations between the university and the state bind them 
ely together. The growth of the university is dependent upon 
state. The state owns the university; and every citizen feels 
self to be a stockholder in that ownership. But associated 
these close relations, which are the strength of the state 
versity, are also its most serious dangers. These are that the 
ersity may be politically controlled, and that it may be ham- 
id in its work. 
DANGER IN POLITICAL CONTROL 
the first of these dangers the state university is expecially 
ed in its youth. A number of such universities have suffered 
politics in their early history; and President Pritchett of the 
legie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, in his last 
tt mentions the fact that recently the universities of Okla- 
and Florida have had revolutions due to political changes. 
these disasters it will be many years before they recover. 
aks well for the democracy of this country that as the states 
developed the’ danger of political interference in university 
ment has steadily become less. At the present time there 
serious danger of political control in any of the older and 
er state universities. 
INTERFERENCE WITH ACADEMIC FREEDOM 
other danger of the close association of the university with 
te, — interference with its work — has two aspects; first, 
be demanded that the teaching which looks toward material 
all be strong, while the humanities are allowed to remain

   weak or not properly developed, and second, freedom of teachi 
and investigation may be interfered with. The former is pro 
ably the more imminent danger for the majority of institutions. 
It is natural, indeed inevitable, that the people shall dema: 
that effective teaching, research, and extension of knowledge sh 
be done in agriculture, in engineering, and in other lines from whi 
a financial return may be shown from the investment. Thi 
demands are right and should be fully met by the universi 
but also the people should appreciate that all material gains are 
men and women. Why do we wish to produce more wheat 
cotton? In order that human beings may be fed and cloth 
But, “The life is more than meat and the body is more 
raiment.” Shall the people demand of their university that it 
vide for their material needs and neglect the people themselves, 
their intellectual, artistic, moral, and spiritual developme: 
The capacity of a state university to make the man himself, 
subject of study and advancement, maintain a paramount pj 
tion will be the crucial test of the state university. 
The university authorities must insist that man shall not 
come subordinate to material gain, which is for him. If the pe 
will support a state university in which these ideals obtain, 
can it be truly said that a democracy is a success. ; 
The remaining danger of the close association of the state 
the university is the possibility of interference with the free 
of teaching and investigation. If such interference occurs, 
likely to be indirect rather than direct, and is therefore all the 
insidious. A sentiment may be developed or a situation 
arise in a state such that the professor feels he is not free to 
the truth as he sees it; and to quote a phrase, he may feel th: 
must shade the truth somewhat. 
INVESTIGATION SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED 
For my own part I have no doubt that in all the states in 
the state universities are strongly established the overwhel 
majority of the. people are in favor of absolute freedom of te: 
and investigation. But frequently the deep-seated dominan 
timent does not express itself, and there are always some who 
place limitations upon the field of a university.. But a uni 
must insist that the whole domain of physical and humai 
nomena belong within its scope, —pure science, applied s 
politics, morals, religion, are proper fields of study for a 
sity. No part of the domain of human experience, knowl 
ideas can be set off as forbidden ground.

   HIGHER AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION 437 
In making this statement I do not mean to imply that the 
te university should dogmatize; but this is no more true of 
litics and religion than it is of agriculture. In no field should 
le method of the university be that of dogmatic teaching. The 
ts concerning any subject should be broadly dealt with; none 
uld be hidden; their bearings should be considered with refer- 
e to the principles which flow from them; and always without 
s. The attitude of the professor in reference to every subject 
uld be that of a candid judge, not that of an advocate, but an 
olutely free and fearless judge who feels heavily the responsibil- 
of his position of trust. The professor should consider the 
blem before him in the light of pure reason with no thought but 
find the truth, wholly uninfluenced by popular sentiment or 
sion. Shall the university be free to teach that a certain practice 
griculture is wrong and advocate a new and improved practice, 
the same principle not apply in politics and in morals? Such 
sition would be intolerable. No institution which does not 
le the humanities in all their amplifications under the same 
ciples that it handles the pure and applied sciences is worthy 
e name of a university. 
taking part in the work of advancement of the state, the 
of the university should be free from intellectual arrogance 
devoid of any attempt to force their ideas upon the people. 
e state gives freedom of teaching and investigation to the 
rsity staff, also the people of the state should be free to

   to be as large a part as possible. The university, the culminati 
of the educational system of the state, would be a miserable ins 
tution indeed if it could not justly claim to be a large segment 
the soul of the state. 
A state university should not be a follower, but a leader, and 
all fields. Says President Pritchett in a recent article in t 
Atlantic, speaking of the state university: ‘“‘ Those who dir 
the purpose of these great enterprises of the democracy cannot 
too often reminded that the highest function of a university is 
furnish standards for a democracy.” And again, “ The rise 
these great universities is the most epoch-making feature of 
American civilization, and they are to become more and more 
leaders, and the makers of our civilization. They are of 
people. When a state university has gained solid ground, it me 
that the people of a whole state have turned their faces toward 
light, it means that the whole system of state schools has b 
welded into an effective agent for civilization.”

three relating to the history of permanent school funds are 
trative of types. The history of the Massachusetts fund 
at of a state which received no land grants, but has itself 
t up a fund of moderate size, and which it now uses to assist 
its poorer communities. The history of the Wisconsin 
ol fund is typical of the waste and mismanagement which 
acterized most of the earlier grants for education. The 
ch of the Minnesota fund is typical of the newer attitude 
rd these grants, and of the efforts now being made by a 
ber of the states to preserve what is left of their grants. 
few states will be able to develop so large a fund as will 
esota.

was established three years later. These legislative acts are

urpose of the fund was “the aid and encouragement of

education for two thirds of a century. These acts marked t 
change from an unrelated mass of schools to a superior system 
organization, which was brought about by the persuasive influen 
of the fund and the wise counsels of the Board of Education, rat! 
than by the enforcement of any general mandatory act. The gr 
force which the State exerted beyond certain requirements as 
maintenance, and attendance upon the schools, was mainly in 
form of aid and advice. 
A glance at the history of the fund and the varying methods 
the distribution of its income will show that it was intended 
supplement but in no wise to supplant the efforts of the | 
committees to maintain their schools. 
The fund was to consist of the money in the treasury deri 
from the sale of lands in the State of Maine, and from the cla; 
of the State upon the United States for military services, toge 
with half of all money thereafter to be received from the sal 
Maine lands, and the principal was not to exceed $1,000, 
Subsequent enactments of the Legislature placed in the f 
$75,000 of the money received by the State under the provis 
of the Treaty of Washington, and transferred in 1854 a suffi 
number of shares of the Western Railroad Corporation to iner, 
the principal of the fund to $1,500,000. In 1859 it was prov 
that one half of the proceeds of the sales of the Back Bay lan 
Boston should be added to the principal of the fund; but 
years later, under the stress of the Civil War, this source of in 
was diverted to the bounty loan sinking fund, after the prin 
of the school fund should have reached $2,000,000. Whe 
State in 1882 sold the Boston and Albany stock, which formed 
of the investment, the fund was increased some $700,000 °b 
premiums received; and in 1890 a similar amount was plac 
the fund by the refunding of the United States direct tax. In 
the principal of the fund was fixed at $5,000,000, $100,000 
paid into it annually from the treasury until that sum is re: 
The principal at the present time amounts to $4,370,548.

greater exertion for educational purposes, and that aid ha:

tablished. One half of the income of the fund was distributed 
the several cities, towns and districts, according to the ratio of 
pulation; the other half in proportion to the amount of money 
ised by taxation and expended for the support of schools. Later 
the same year a law was enacted providing that the distribution 
the income should be in the future according to the number of 
rsons between the ages of four and sixteen. Five years later the 
tribution was again made according to the ratio of population; 
t the following year a return was made to the former basis, with 
provision that no apportionment should be made to any town 
t did not raise a sum equal to $1.25 for each person of school 
In 1849 the sum to be raised by taxation was increased to 
50 and the distribution was based upon the number of persons 
ween the ages of five and fifteen. One half of the income from 
period to the present time has been applied to the normal 
lools and other general expenses. This continued to be the basis 
istribution of the half distributed to the towns until 1885, when 
as enacted that no town should receive benefit from the fund 
ss the town had raised by taxation and expended for its schools 
m of not less than $3 for each person between the ages of five 
fifteen. This law still continues in force. 
is it became evident that the smaller agricultural towns were 
ming depleted in population and valuation, the method of 
ibution was from time to time changed in order to aid these 
-burdened communities. The cities and larger towns relin- 
ed their income from the fund for this purpose; and its aid 
withdrawn from all towns of over $10,000,000 valuation in 
and subsequently from towns of over $3,000,000 valuation, 
ie law at the present time. It was found that no general 
of school population or property valuation would afford the 
d aid to small towns with a vanishing population and a fading 
tion. To meet this, certain lump sums were allotted to this 
of towns in inverse proportion to their valuation, the towns 
same time being forbidden to decrease their effort and stim- 
to increase their exertion by a distribution of a portion of 
come as a premium upon their local taxation for the support 
ools.

FINANCING THE SYSTEM 448 
Little has been done in recent years because it has been thoug! 
that the state lands have all been sold. Six hundred thousa: 
acres of land belonging to the various trust funds are still to be so 
and the state may easily save $1,500,000 on their sale by givil

When the state offers lands worth $15 or $25 per acre for $1 
or $3.00 per acre, no citizen can be blamed for purchasing th 
The state has not only lost by selling lands at less than their val 
but it has held at $1.25 per acre, for years, lands only worth 
cents an acre, from lack of information on the part of the offi 
in charge or from their lack of authority to make the necessary 
duction in price. Some lands not now in the market are rept 
to be worth $50 per acre. It is notorious that state lands cov 
with valuable timber have been sold, a fraction of the pure! 
price paid, the timber removed and the lands then allowed to | 
to the state. The present land commissioners are making e 
effort within their power to secure the conviction of a large nw 
of persons who have denuded public lands of timber in violatio} 
the law, and they are finding a tremendous task before thei 
one to which their means are not adequate. 
A study of the state constitution, of the debates and discus: 
which preceded its adoption, and of the first reports of the 
superintendent show that the founders of the commonwealth 
careful plans to secure for the children of the state for centuri 
come the benefits flowing from a princely school fund. 
The earlier state superintendents estimated that over $5, 
would be received from the sale of the school lands. Later 
opments show that double that amount might easily have 
secured. + 
Since those estimates were made the state has received 1, 
acres of selected lands in lieu of lands taken by the general go} 
ment. About four-fifths of these selected lands belong t 
common school fund. Much of this land was valuable, but 
amounts have been sold at from one-fifth to one-half thei 
worth. The school fund last September (1892) with large 
tions from other sources than the sale of school land, only amo} 
to $3,360,000. In this connection, and as a basis of comp: 
the history of the lands owned by Cornell University in thi 
is instructive. The grant of 960,000 acres was located in no: 
Wisconsin. A large share of it was put on the market an 
at sixty cents per acre, before the majority of the Trustees

ne timber was removed. The original grants to our state for 
hool purposes amounted, according to the estimates of the earlier 
orts, to 1,474,720 acres. After the sale of all but 60,000 acres 
le state can show but about $2,000,000 in its school fund credited 
this source. Our magnificent heritage, the sacred birthright of 
pless children, has been squandered and plundered by ruthless 
ds. 
‘he Hon. A. C. Barry, in his report as state superintendent in 
8, deplored the gross negligence in dealing with the school funds. 
said at that time, ‘ Whoever attempts to divert any portion of 
sacred school fund from its consecrated purposes of education 
uld feel that he is treading on holy ground. That noble fund is 
hope of our people, —of 264,000 children now living in our midst, 
of millions yet unborn. They crave the boon of education, 
ch is their chief, as well as their best inheritance, and for that 
cation they must ever rely upon the people’s colleges, the com- 
schools of our state. Those children need a fit preparation, 
hey must soon wield the destinies of Wisconsin. Every dollar 
racted from the school fund, under whatever plea, will yet have 
e replaced with more than compound interest, or ignorance, 
and crime will be the penalty of our children, and our chil- 
’s children will have to suffer as a natural consequence of our 
‘uided folly.” 
recommend that the legislature order the immediate with- 
al from the market of all school lands owned by the state, 
hat no further sales be made until the value of these lands be 
by competent and reliable appraisers. ... I also recom- 
that the legislature give authority to some competent officer, 
is interested in the enlargement of the school fund, to examine 
lockets of justices of the peace and to commence action against 
who do not make complete records of all convictions and 
on their dockets, or who do not report and remit the fines

The state government was made its trustee, and the people of t 
state its beneficiaries. A brief statement of the present conditi 
of the school fund is necessary to make evident the manner in whi 
this sacred trust has been administered. 
The nominal amount of the school funds is $5,652,461. 
The report of the Secretary of State shows that $2,251,900 of 1 
amount is in the form of certificates of indebtedness of the St: 
of Wisconsin, and the remaining portion is invested in bonds, 
accordance with the law. The certificates of indebtedness are e 
dences of the disappearance of nearly half of the school fun| 
The rate of interest on these certificates is 7 per cent. The sti 
is thereby made debtor to the funds to which it bears the relat, 
of trustee. The disadvantage that follows is evident. Instea 
a productive fund whose income diminishes the weight of t 
tion, there is a state debt by reason of which the annual tax ley; 
greatly increased. A debt is not the equivalent of a produc 
fund. Were the entire fund available for loans in accordance 
the requirements of the constitution the income would be a ch 
upon private enterprises, and its use for public purposes wo} 
to that extent, lessen public burdens. 
The common school fund may be taken as an illustration. 
the year ending September 30, 1892, the entire common sc 
fund income was $205,047.85. Of this amount $109,459 
derived from the interest upon the certificates of indebted: 
and was raised by a tax upon the industry of the people of the s 
Only a small part of this would have been necessary had the e| 
fund been invested in the bonds of public corporations, as the 
in such case would have well-nigh earned an equivalent a 
to take the place of the tax as a revenue to be used in the su 
of common schools. No difficulty is experienced by the pr} 
commissioners in making safe investments of all the avai 
school fund. The demand is greatly in excess of the amou 
their disposal. 
The law which directed the investment of the school fund

The certificates are non-negotiable and non-transferable. N. 
vision whatever is made for their payment. The discret 
authority of the commissioners, who are clothed with constit 
powers over its investment, is thereby destroyed by the f 
statutory enactment. The effect is the creation of a perpetu: 
debt, requiring the levy and collection of an annual state

ctive funds to the liquidation of the state debt would prac- 
leave the state as though no provision had ever been made

e to assume that this amount is not over-estimated. In fact 
m the knowledge of the properties already gleaned, we are 
tified in saying that the lands, when mined, will show more

ithout in any way desiring to criticise the administration of 
ler states it may be of interest to note the experience of neigh-

    state had the benefit of the experience of other states. Those 
s received large land grants from Congress containing minerals, 
er and farming lands, approximately as Minnesota. It ap- 
s that they sold the land outright for a small sum per acre, 
ming neither the timber nor the mineral. From the official 
t of Michigan made on June 30, 1908, that state had a perma- 
or primary school fund of a little over four millions of dollars, 
versity and agricultural college fund of a little more than a 
m and a half dollars with substantially all of the land which 
cured from Congress, sold. On June 30, 1906, Wisconsin 
school fund of nearly four million dollars, and only 22,964 
of land remaining unsold. Under the Wisconsin law all 
ted estates and all fines collected under penal laws, and five 
nt of the United States land collections were added to the 
fund. Wisconsin has a permanent agricultural and univer- 
nd of only $535,920.11 and 364 acres unsold. On July 1, 
Iowa had a permanent school fund of $4,778,019.46. In 
he sales of school land were conducted by the county officers 
e funds derived from the sale of the lands in the several

efits of the far-sightedness of Governor Ramsay and his 
f early law-makers in this important respect. First, in 
a time when government lands were on the market at

could be sold at public sale to the highest bidder at a certain si

sota, and not until the timber had been sold could the land

Thus it was that when iron was discovered northwest of Dul 
the state was the owner in fee of large areas of cut-over lands in

1889, a law was passed to lease the lands for iron ore or mi 
purposes at a minimum rate of twenty-five cents per ton. 
little later a general law was passed reserving to the state} 
minerals on state lands. With the extension of the iron area

Herbert Spencer in 1850 announced the doctrine that tl

man’s children is robbery, and that the State has no more 
administer education than it has to administer religion. 
Legislation, both in Europe and in this country, has in

recognized by Spencer. It is in addition a great social and 
nomic effort. 
“The ability of this generation to recognize education as so 
thing larger than mere learning or even discipline, to perceiv 
as a great force moulding national character,” is one of the w 
some signs of the times. 
In the educative process certain well-defined and clearly es 
lished steps are necessary. Formal education begins with the 
mentary school and ends with the graduate school of the uni 
sity. The great instrument for this training we call a syste! 
schools. A school system, therefore, is a great social agent o: 
State, and the parts that compose the whole are simply sub-a; 
in one general educative process. 
By common consent and general practice, Jefferson’s sche: 
a complete educational system for all the people has been ad 
in this country. That plan provides for — 
(a) Public elementary schools. 
(6) Public high schools. 
(c) The university. 
In addition to these our system of schools in Virginia n 
cludes normal schools and the group of technical schools

Later I shall attempt to define the peculiar function of e: 
the several groups above named. For the present phase 
discussion of the subject, that of support, it will be sufficie’ 
to observe that education in a State is really one thing, fr 
elementary grade to the graduate school. Each part, whe 
be under State control or private control must, in the lon| 
relate itself to the system of public instruction. “ Any el 
school system must be an organism, instinct with life, growij 
developing harmoniously in all its parts, each part receivi 
portion of nourishment and life blood, and each perfor 
proper function in relation to every other part, and to th 
body. Any other conception can result only in waste of fu 
disappointment in results. Each part must be a codperati 
and not a competing part.” To organize, maintain and 
such a system should be the chief interest of the State whi 
for large developments, social and industrial.

e State has been steadily pressing for the better schooling of 
hildren. Better buildings, better teaching, longer schooling, 
school instruction for all, — these things are more and more 
uously insisted upon for the good of the children and the

lovide them. The State has taken the ground that the chil- 
must be properly schooled, whether towns have the means 
ool them or not. The interests of the children, and through 
of the State, must be protected at all hazards. As a result, 
legislation has imposed upon some of the towns burdens that, 
er heroically they are borne, are unquestionably excessive. 
If the blessings of good schooling or the evils of bad were 
local, and therefore of less vital interest to the State, it 
well be questioned whether the State has a moral right

the youth of these heavily-loaded towns are forever leaving 
the well-trained and noble-spirited to swell the enter-

     after, as it were, to clinch policies well advanced before it tal 
them up and makes them binding. The minimum length of sch 
ing, for instance, heretofore required of towns under 4,000 inha 
ants, has been six months. The law of 1898 raises it to ei 
months. It did not do so, however, until 202 of 251 towns wi 
a population of 4,000 had voluntarily increased their schoolin, 
eight, nine, and, in many cases, ten months. 
It follows that the State, in making requirements beyond 
ability of the towns to meet without excessive effort, is under s| 
measure of obligation to ease their burdens, at least at the pi 
of greatest pressure. This obligation has already been chee 
recognized in various ways, —in the State reimbursement, in 
tain cases, of high school tuition and of additions to teac 
salaries, in the aid it gives to district superintendence, and jj 
distribution of the income of the school fund. These for 
aid are adapted to old conditions, but not to such new hard| 
as may have been created by new legislation. If such har 
appear, they merit considerate attention from the Legislature, 
The policy of the State so far has been to legislate for such s

t in that poorer Illinois, school rates are two or three times as

ut poorer Illinois is not all in the southern end of the State;

railroad situation as affecting school tax rates deserves a few co 
plementary, or complimentary, remarks. The railroad assessm 
per mile of main track in Illinois averages $8,452. For purpo 
of our calculation this should be reduced somewhat. Suffice 
say, that a stretch of railroad one and one-half miles long, in a sch} 
district where land is assessed at $2.50 an acre may easily do 
and more the total valuation and thus halve the tax rate. W. 
land is $4.00, a similar stretch would reduce the rate fifty per ¢ 
In DeWitt county, where land is $11.00 an acre, the railroad val 
tions in such districts as have railroads average about one-sixt! 
the total valuations. Is it right that a school district should es 
with a fraction of the rate its neighbors have to pay because it 
a railroad and they have none? A strip of land, sixty-six and 
thirds feet wide and one and one-half miles long, or 100 feet 
and one mile long contains twelve acres. At an average Illi 
price its assessed valuation would be $114.00. As railroad rig! 
way it may easily be $10,000.00 to $15,000.00 or even $20, 
There are 2,600 miles of railroad in those thirty-six counti 
poorer Illinois and about 3,000 school districts, of which, per! 
one district in four has any railroad in it. Probably of the 
school districts about 750 are helped by the presence of rai 
property beyond the point of serious need so far as eleme 
schools are concerned. The other 2,250 get no such help. 
Finally, the State’s distribution of $1,056,971.31 annually a: 
districts according to minor population means 50 cents perha) 
child, or possibly $1.00 per child actually enrolled, and may 
some southern Illinois districts $50.00-$60.00 annually. 
benefits accruing from township and county funds and from| 
and forfeitures are of some moment, but are so fortuitously sea: 
that it would be guess work to speculate about them. It 
probable, however, that of the 3,000 districts in poorer Illinoi: 
2,000 in spite of all adventitious aids cannot get even by 
to the limit the $480.00 apiece that the support of a good 
demands. They still need help, from a little up to $280.00 e 
in the aggregate — though it must be a guess — about $300, 
So far we have been talking of the adaptation of the 
district system to the financing of isolated elementary 
alone. Anything like adequate supervision is financially ij 
ticable. It is when we come to the rural high school q 
however, that the district system breaks down completely.

     st in cities and villages the high school has indeed seen a remark- 
le growth. But as to rural communities it is only when the dis- 
ict organization is discarded for what is essentially the township 
stem, that they get high schools at all. Out of the 240 rural dis- 
cts of the greatest and richest farming county of the State, only 
or five could get, even by taxing to the limit, $2,500 for the 
port of a high school. 
uch, then, are the short-comings of our present school revenue 
tem. How far would the proposals of the Educational Com- 
sion remove them? The most pertinent proposals of the com- 
sion are two: To substitute the township for the district 
tem; and to restore the two-mill tax. 
‘o make the township the unit for school purposes would equalize 
rates as well as school opportunities within townships. The 
district and the small district, the poor land and the best land 
id all pay the same rate. That large district in Funk’s Grove, 
example, that paid 17 cents last year, would under the town- 
system with all the other districts have paid 43 cents. It 
ht continue, if desirable, a big district, but it would not for 
reason escape, comparatively, taxation for school purposes. 
ourse no criticism of the farmers of that district is intended. 
are among the most progressive in America and would be the 
persons in the State to wish to escape any proper burden. 
the system that is criticised and that causes the inequality. 
injustice arising now from the unequal distribution of railroad 
erty among districts would entirely pass away, though it 
d still remain as among townships. The larger the school 
however, the smaller the chance of inequality. This inequal- 
ong townships and counties will demand eventually a sweep- 
hange that it is the function of a revenue commission rather 
of an educational commission to suggest —a separation of 
urces of State and local revenues. When that time comes the 
ads will be relieved from all local taxation whatever, and will 
per cent of gross receipts or the average State rate for all 
ses calculated upon their assessed and equalized valuation, 
ly into the State treasury. The latter method would un- 
edly be both fair and constitutional and would net the State 
r six millions annually. The State tax could then be done 
with and realty and some personalty left to be taxed, as in 
ylvania, for local purposes only. Until this is done injustice 
continue. Hardin and Calhoun counties have no railroads 
Madison, because it lies in the direct way of lines making

r. ‘The railroad valuation alone of Madison county is greater

than the total valuation of all property in any one of twenty-sev 
counties in Illinois; and the railroad valuation of Cook county 
nearly twice that of all the thirty-six counties of our poorer Ilin 
combined. 
The adoption of the township as the school unit would open 
way for the culminating expanse of the high school system. Wh 
land is assessed at $10.00 an acre even country townships co 
spare $3,000.00 for high school purposes and still keep within 
present tax limit. In the poorer townships — such say as h 
not a total assessed valuation so great as $300,000.00 — the St: 
should help maintain high schools, the help extended to vary 
versely with the total assessed valuation of the township, 
directly with the tax rate levied by the township itself for 
maintenance of its schools. Possibly 800 of the townships of 
nois might require such aid to the extent of an average of $1,00 
each, or in all $800,000.00. In some cases two townships ¢ 
unite to support a school. In exactly the same way the cos 
adequate supervision of both elementary and high schools shoul 
shared by the State. This might take $500,000.00 annually. 
It is important that everybody understand exactly how 
adoption of the township system and the establishment of 
schools would affect tax rates. Let us take an illustration.

qual distribution of wealth, or the presence of railroads in some

Id not this rate be fairer than nine different rates varying

two assistant teachers, and a superintendent who will super-

reason, excepting one of policy, for the exclusion of places of

to ability to pay than the farmer of the corn belt, I do not kn 
who it is. 
The Educational Commission has voted to recommend the r 
toration of the two-mill tax. Let us see just what this means. 
By the free school law of 1855 it was provided: ‘“ The com: 
school fund of this State shall consist of such sum as will be 
duced by an annual levy and assessment of two mills upon e 
dollar’s valuation of all the taxable property in the State; 
there is hereby levied and assessed annually . . . the said 
mills.” The same statute provides that six per cent interest uy 
funds received from the federal government for the suppor 
common schools and upon the amount of the surplus revenue 
tributed to Illinois in 1837 shall be part also of the said fund. 
said that this provision of the law of 1855 providing for this 
to be raised by an ad valorem tax upon all the wealth of the 
and distributed according to population and area, put the 
through the Legislature and kept it from being repealed. It 
the bill acceptable where it would have been weakest — in| 
poorer sections of the State. By the first distribution every co 
but two in what we have called poorer Illinois got more out o 
fund than it paid into it. And this state of affairs holds true 
out exceptions to-day. The two mill tax brought in $607, 
this first year, averaged $687,000.00 for the next twelve years 
by 1872 was running about $900,000.00. At that time the s 
law was re-written and into the rewriting crept a change th 
proved of serious importance. The section providing for th 
tributable fund was made to read, “ .. . the proceeds of 
mill tax to be levied . . . annually, unless otherwise provid: 
law.” The very next year the Legislature proceeded to le 
lump sum of $1,000,000.00 “ in lieu of the two mill tax,” a p: 
which has been since kept up. At the time when the chan; 
made in the law the tax was bringing in only $900,000.00 an; 
but now it would mean nearly $2,500,000.00 a year, even 
property is actually assessed at seventy per cent of one-fifth 
real value. 
By the terms of a revenue law of 1855 the rate to be lev, 
general revenue purposes annually thereafter was one and o: 
mills. From 1873 to 1888 the average levy for general pi 
was $1,600,000.00. Since 1895 the amount levied for 
purposes has risen rapidly, until it is now $5,000,000.00 
with receipts from fees, insurance and inheritance taxes, a: 
the Illinois Central aggregating $3,000,000.00 more. Th 
levy remains $1,000,000.00, which with $56,937.31 inter 
stitutes the distributable fund. Once, one and two-thi

eral levy, the school levy is now but twenty per cent of it, or 
lelve per cent of all general revenue receipts. Once the State 
id more than the local political units for the support of the com- 
m schools ; now it pays about three per cent of the total amount. 
thin the last thirty-five years population has doubled, our school 
‘ollment increased fifty per cent, the wealth of Illinois has mul- 
ied by four; young men have married and grown old; the sons 
m of their sons are now in the schoolrooms; but the distributable 
remains the same. New stars have been discovered in the 
lvens above, new elements in the earth beneath, but the State 
llinois now, as thirty-five years ago, is still distributing annually, 
er common schools the paltry sum of $1,056,937.31. The 
ge the commission recommends would increase the average 
1 Illinois tax rate hardly more than one-fiftieth. If you pay 
00 now ; then you would pay $51.00. It might cost the people of 
lois 30 cents apiece—less than they pay for soda-water and gum. 
e believe in the restoration of the two mill tax because the 
s right in principle. To some extent surely, all the wealth of 
is is responsible for the education of all her children. The 
josition of the commission is that the State take a one-thir- 
h interest in the enterprise. We believe in this larger fund 
se it is needed to help pay a reasonable minimum wage and 
ther expenses for elementary education in poorer Illinois, to 
eachers’ institutes, to encourage expert supervision in town- 
, to help build township high schools and extend the oppor- 
Fes of secondary education to every boy and girl in the State. 
‘armer’s vocation is necessary to society and he must be per- 
id to engage in it without sacrificing his children. 
already indicated I believe that the plan for distributing our 
fund should be changed. Surely so long as our fund remains 
all not one cent should go anywhere excepting where it will 
at good. What do we need of your distributable fund in 
n county, where our rural school rate is 73 cents, where we 
ild a million dollar court house, or $75,000.00 ward schools? 
ibuted according to abilities, this fund should be distributed 
ing to needs. Townships with a total assessed valuation 
ough so that they can get all necessary school advantages 
school tax rate of $2.00 or less should get none of the fund; 
tribution among the remaining townships should vary in- 
as the total valuation of property and directly as the rate 
for school purposes by the township itself. Even Heaven 
nly those who need help and who help themselves, Massa- 
s likewise. Who will doubt the wisdom of a plan followed 
Heaven and by Massachusetts?

     It may not be out of place to mention here that the great 
burdens of taxation proportionately, are stood by the poorest s 
tion of the State — this notwithstanding that there are more cit] 
and villages farther north. The last report of our auditor sh 
the three highest county aggregate rates to have been: Hamilt 
$9.92; Gallatin, $8.04; Jackson, $7.87. Of the thirty-one cow 
rates above $5.00, sixteen belonged to the one-third of the coun: 
southeast of the Kaskaskia. 
The adoption of the township system, the restoration of the 
mill tax and its proper distribution, if accompanied by a mini 
wage law, will remedy, in the main, every most glaring injus 
in the workings, if not of our revenue system, at least of our sc 
revenue system. We shall have then a logical system — not 
that “ just growed.’ If there has been chaos as to school rev 
matters in the objective world, it has been because of a cha 
the brain of the schoolmaster. Until the labors of this commis: 
the school teacher had not thought the thing out. Hithert 
“have seen as through a glass, darkly; now, face to face.” 
long shall the education of an Illinois boy, his chance in the ra 
life, depend upon the price of land per acre in the county whe 
is born, or upon the track of a glacier made 40,000 years ag, 
In the public schools of Ilinois must be amalgamated the 
dren of a score of nationalities. Not of the same race, they 
be made to be of the same mind. From the slums of Chica; 
from the wharves of Cairo, the State of Illinois will not he 
when need be to call them forth in her defence to spill their 
or risk their lives. Them too, Illinois will entrust with the s 
ballot and them she will expect to be able to solve the inti 
political and social problems of an increasingly complex ci 
tion. To them Illinois owes a duty commensurate with wh: 
expects of them. Then Illinois must educate, if not for thei 
then for her own. If this great experiment in democracy goes 
it will be for lack of sufficient elementary and high school edu 
of the right sort. And such an education is after all largely a 
of revenue. Good revenue systems have done much to mal 
bad to unmake great states. Our liberties, which have be 
in battles over taxation during the last thousand years, ar 
preserved in struggles of the same sort. It is to-day ff 
teachers and the people of Illinois to tiptoe a little, look o 
beyond the hedges of all narrow and individual and class int 
stop trying to preserve the obsolescent, and unite to give 
an adequate school revenue system.

fact that, in the future, from four to five millions of dollars

State the greatest possible benefit. The question of its 
le distribution is a serious one indeed when we study exist-

   tion as high as $4,000,000 while in the northern counties are to 
ships with a valuation of $3,000 or less. In the southern part 
the Lower Peninsula, we have nearly a thousand districts ea 
having a school population of fifteen or less children. The avera; 
attendance at school in these districts is not more than eight pupi 
and many maintain only five months of school. Through the e¢ 
tral part of the Lower Peninsula, where a splendid agricultu 
district is being developed, are good-sized school districts and| 
large school population. Generally, in the northern part of 
Lower Peninsula we find a scattering population, low valuation 
property, and great difficulty in maintaining schools. In 
Upper Peninsula, the population is more generally gathered 
villages and cities, although in recent years the agricultural po: 
bilities are being rapidly developed. There are single rural sc! 
districts in the Lower Peninsula whose valuation is $1,500, 
There are other school districts in the Lower Peninsula wit! 
valuation of less than $1,000. In the counties of Oscoda, Cr} 
ford, Montmorency, Kalkaska, Roscommon, Clare, Lake, 
Newaygo, is found a scattered population and a very low valua 
of property and with this, many times, but few families to com 
a school district. It is extremely burdensome to those peopl] 
raise a school tax sufficient to support their school and, having 
few children, they get but a small amount of the primary s

THE SCHOOL CENSUS BASIS    
The distribution of the primary school interest fund at pres 
based upon the school census of the several districts as tak 
the school directors, or under the authority of the school bi 
during the fifteen days prior to the first Monday in June o! 
year. Fifty per cent of the census lists sent to this Depar 
have to be returned for correction. In some cases we hav 
obliged to order a new census because of inaccuracies and bi 
of violations of the law in including persons not entitled 
included. These inaccuracies are found in city, village, an 
districts, but from the nature of the case it is more difficult to 
an accurate school census in cities than it is in rural distric’ 
many places the enumerators appointed to take the cens' 
been persons entirely unaccustomed to clerical work and es; 
unaccustomed to the arduous task of securing an aj 
census. In one instance, the census was taken by a girl 
years old, In other cases, the census was taken by perso:

direction of a school officer who could neither read nor write. 
some of our larger cities the Department has been obliged to 
uire a large number of names to be stricken from the lists be- 
se they were illegally included. It is a well known fact that 
ple are constantly moving from one ward to another, from one 
to another, from one district to another, and it is clear that 
ol officers are unable to secure an accurate school census. 
Il these things make it clear that to base an apportionment of 
ol funds upon the school census renders some districts liable 
ceive less money than they should and others liable to receive 
le money than that to which they are justly entitled. In the 
township one school district has a large census and an adjoin- 
istrict a very small one, but the fact that the school population 
s is no reason why the public school in each district should 
e thoroughly and amply supported, and yet, with the present 
od of apportionment, the district with a large census receives 
e sum of money, the adjoining district with a smaller census 
es less money, though the latter may be really deserving or 
in need of more money than the first mentioned district. 
condition of things prevails in every township of the State 
ichigan, as reports to this Department clearly show. If the 
is ‘to assist in the support of the public schools, every district 
receive the same treatment at the hands of the State. There 
reason why the children in Clare county, Crawford county, 
other county in the State, who live in the rural districts, 
not have as good educational opportunities as are enjoyed 
children of the cities and villages. The Department each 
leceives letters from parents and taxpayers in different parts 
State, particularly in the northern portion of the Lower 
ula, requesting that something be done that they may have 
ol and their children receive an education. One parent 
hat he had a family of eight children, the oldest seventeen 
f age, that he was eight miles from a school, and not one of 
dren had ever attended school a day in his life. We some- 
e so engrossed with the consideration of how great we are 
at a fine school system we have that we forget that many 
even in the great State of Michigan are practically deprived 
| privileges, whereas if the funds were more equitably dis- 
, or if the State Superintendent had authority to use the 
of these funds in some of these specific cases, very much 
sults might be attained.

The problem of apportioning the primary school interest fun 
Michigan is one of the greatest problems, in my judgment, bef 
the people at this time and one that deserves the most careful 
conscientious consideration. 
The statutes provide in Section 4676 of Compiled Laws, that 
primary school interest fund shall be used for teachers’ w: 
only, and in Section 4665 the one mill tax shall be used for teac 
wages until the district has maintained eight months of sc 
If there is a surplus of one mill tax after having maintained se 
for eight months, such surplus may be used for general run 
expenses of the school. There are rural school districts in the 
which have from $500 to $5,000 of primary school interest fun} 
hand which has accumulated during recent years and which caj 
be used for anything but teachers’ wages. The apportionme’ 
primary school interest fund for the year 1905 was $3.30 per c 
and the reports to this office show that with this rate of appo! 
ment over 300 districts received more primary school interest 
than they expended for teachers’ wages, to say nothing of th 
mill tax, and that 1,700 additional districts received more 
from primary school interest fund and one mill tax than w: 
pended for teachers’ wages. In 1907, 1,296 school districts 
State received more primary school interest fund alone thai 
paid for teachers’ wages, and 3,297 districts received fro: 
primary school interest fund and one mill tax an amount e 
or greater than the amount paid for teachers’ wages. In| 
1908, there were 1,054 school districts in the State having 
primary money on hand to pay the teachers for two years. 
There are 7,330 school districts in the State and, of this m 
more than 1,000 districts receive so small an amount, bec 
the small number of children, that it is of practically no 
whatever, and these people are obliged to support their 
by the one mill tax and the direct taxes levied upon the 
It appears to me, therefore, that the present method of ap; 
ing the primary school interest fund is absolutely unjust 
equitable. I am convinced that the people of the State a 
tically a unit in favor of the proposition that the primar: 
interest fund shall be used for teachers’ wages and tuition 
also that a very large number of our people have no objecti 
ever to the levying of the one mill tax under the statut 
present time, which provide in Section 4705 of the Compil: 
as amended in 1905, that when a district has on hand a s

ts have been laying aside a sinking fund for building purposes, 
generally the balance on hand is composed almost entirely of 
ary school interest fund and one mill tax. Where the census 
low and the valuation high, the surplus will be largely one mill 
Where the reverse is true, the surplus is largely primary

some districts to have on hand a large amount of primary school 
rest fund which is not used, and this money is simply tied up

use of lack of funds with which to maintain even five months 
hool. From the standpoint of the State, such unequal condi- 
ought to be adjusted, because the school exists for the chil- 
and their interests ought to be safeguarded by the State at 
point. The question is, what plan of distribution of this 
y will be for the best interests of our schools.

Il. Tue Distrrpvtion or Scuoot REVENUES 
[From the Report of the Ohio School Revenue Commission, 1 
pp. 41-45.] 
Important as is the raising of sufficient school revenues, the 
tribution of such revenues is even more important. Granted 
we are able to “raise the money,” and that we have “ raised 
money,” the next important question is how to distribute 
money so as to accomplish best the real purpose of public edj 
tion. 
Taxes and all forms of public revenues are designed prim 
to promote the public good. We have systems of govern 
local, state, and national, as the machinery necessary to carr. 
the will of the people in this respect. Government is fo 
people as a whole rather than for the individual apart fro: 
relations to the whole. The beneficent effects of popular educ 
raise the standards of the citizenship of the whole State by r: 
the ideals and efficiency of individuals. As a means of self p 
uation, therefore, the State must provide means for raisin; 
maintaining such standards of efficiency as will effectually peri 
the whole citizenship. The matter of popular education is n 
of personal privilege. Wealth cannot rightly buy immunity] 
its just share of the responsibility in providing educational 
tages for even the most unfortunate or improvident. Edu 
and the consequent advances of civilization make wealth pi 
But the wealth of a man in Chicago may be all produced b. 
of men in Colorado, or by the mere environment of prop’ 
Wisconsin. If wealth has any particular locus, it ought to be] 
it is produced, rather than where its possessor happens to 
Wealth should be levied upon wherever it is found to mak 
the educational advantages of those whose work and citi 
make that wealth possible. The State, then, owes to ever| 
within its borders equal educational advantages up to a mi 
standard of efficiency. A child in the poorest section of t 
has as much right to this minimum of training as the chil: 
wealthiest man within the State’s borders. The geographi 
tribution of wealth has no vital relation to the problems of 
sal education.

    Our present system of distribution of the State Common School 
md in Ohio is almost the poorest that could be devised to accom- 
ish the purpose for which it is supposed to be maintained, — to 
ualize the burdens of taxation for school support. In brief, it is 
follows: One mill is levied equally on all the listed property of 
e State. This amount, $1 on every $1000, is paid to the county 
asurer and the whole amount so collected by him is paid to the 
te treasurer, and this collective sum is known as the State 
mmon. School Fund. Until 1906 the county treasurer retained 
er cent for collecting the tax. The state treasurer, on the war- 
t of the state auditor, showing the total enumeration (unmarried 
th between 6 and 21) in the county, pays back to each county 
surer an amount determined by multiplying $1.70 by the 
ber of school youth enumerated in the county. This total is 
im distributed among the various township, village, special and 
districts in the county on the basis of the school enumeration. 
rate of distribution, $1.70 per enumerated pupil, is deter- 
ed by the legislature by computing the amount of tax that will 
ly be raised by the levy of one mill and dividing this amount, 
any accumulated balance, by the number of school youth 
erated. This amount per enumerated pupil, $1.70, was raised 
1.75 for 1907, due to the fact that the valuation had increased 
r than the school population. The rate fixed by the legislature 
be understood to be the minimum rate and the state auditor 
he right to increase it if there is sufficient balance to warrant 
increase. For more than 30 years prior to 1904 it was $1.50, 
occasionally was advanced to $1.55. Yet for a number of 
prior to 1904 a balance was allowed to increase until it 
ed $318,078. Just why would be hard to tell, but this bal- 
in 1904 made it possible, after a warm fight in the legislature, 
vance the pro rata distribution to $1.70, and it is not likely 
ll below that again. 
ill be noticed from the tables that all but $213,000 of this 
,000 raised in 1905 went back to the counties paying it in. 
was, therefore, no State aid in so far as the remaining 
,000 was concerned. 
this system of distribution is manifestly unfair if the claim 
is, that it will help weak communities to reach the minimum 
cational advantages which the State must make possible if it 
ossible for the community to do so itself. For example, 
is Cleveland, with a large foreign population over 14 and 
1. These people are enumerated but they are not enrolled 
not receiving instruction. In 1905 Cleveland enumerated 
school youth, but the average daily attendance was only

52,102 or 45 per cent of the enumeration. This means that Clev 
land is drawing $1.70 per pupil for 62,291 children who are n 
receiving daily instruction, or $104,894.70 for children who are n 
being taught. If these 62,291 children were in school, it wou| 
require 1,557 more teachers at 40 pupils to the teacher and wou 
add about $1,600,000 to the annual cost of the schools, supposi 
these pupils were all enrolled in elementary schools. The city wo 
also find it necessary to build more school houses, and ha| 
$9,000,000 more invested in school property. This ex 
$104,894.70 which Cleveland draws annually from the State Co; 
mon School Fund, and for which the city gives the State nothi 
in return to these 62,291 children, raises the average received 
pupil actually in daily attendance to $3.73. But take any tow: 
city in which the average daily attendance is higher and quit 
different result will be obtained. There is Painsville, not far f 
Cleveland. The enumeration in 1905 was 1,371 and the aver 
daily attendance was 932, or 68%. Painsville received $1.70 
pupil enumerated, or $2.50 per pupil actually taught, as agai 
$3.73 per pupil actually taught in Cleveland. This discrimina’ 
of $1.23 per pupil actually taught gives Cleveland $64,08 
more than the city would be entitled to on the basis the Sta 
aiding Painsville. In Cincinnati the amount the city rec 
from the State per pupil actually taught is $6.51, or $137,6 
more than that city would be entitled to on the Painsville bas’ 
When we take the cases of the smaller town and rural co 
nities, the discrimination is still greater. The State School 
was originally provided for in 1853 with the thought that it 
equalize the burdens of taxation, but investigation clearly and 
clusively shows that the system extends the greatest favors t 
populous centers where there is always more wealth per c 
and consequently, where the people are better able to help 
selves or make ample provision for their schools without 
aid. Here, for example, is Portsmouth, Ohio, on the op 
side of the State. The enumeration for 1905 was 6837 an| 
average daily attendance was 2812, or only 41% of the| 
meration. The city is drawing money from the State Co: 
School Fund for the 4,025 children of school age not in a 
daily attendance, at $1.70 per pupil, or $6,842.50 — enough 
13 teachers $525 each. The amount Portsmouth receive: 
the State was really not $1.70 per pupil, but $4.13 per 
actually taught. Instead of encouraging communities to 
educational opportunities for all the youth, such a law enc 
a community to enumerate as many youth as possible and 
as few as possible— encourages the non-enforcement of t

sory attendance law. Of course, it is well understood by all 
lat a large percentage of youth not enrolled are beyond the reach 
the compulsory attendance law. But the contention of the 
‘iter is that the present method of distribution of the State 
mmon School Fund is inequitable, unfair, and lacks the essen- 
s of giving an educational incentive to local communities. No 
mium is placed upon the universal education of the people, 
rather upon the lowest average enrollment and attendance. 
is quite well understood, too, that many cities having a low 
entage in actual attendance have many enrolled in private 
ols. But such communities ought not to be given such State 
or share in the distribution of the State funds as will actually 
rage those communities to foster other than public schools 
h State funds. A city or community should not receive money 
the education of children whom it is not educating. This 
igs us to the conclusion that State funds ought to be distrib- 
on the basis of the number of pupils actually taught,— the 
age daily attendance rather than upon the basis of the school 
1S. 
is conclusion is reenforced by a careful study of the statistics 
e cities compared with each other and with those of villages 
rural communities. Here is a table compiled by selecting the 
bs of cities, villages and townships at random over Ohio. In 
ase of villages and townships, only those have been selected 
aintain high schools, thus placing them as nearly as possible 
plane of the cities, so far as educational advantages are 
ered. 
tudy of these tables will make clear the present discrimination 
or of the larger cities in the matter of the distribution of the 
Common School Fund. The twelve cities listed in this 
chosen at random, average $3.64 per pupil taught, while 
ven villages average $2.03 per pupil taught in their sharing 
State Common School Fund. The enrollment of non- 
ts in the villages accounts for their lower value. This 
that the twelve cities average 80 % higher than the eleven 
s. But this is not all. The average tax levy for school 
es is much lower in the cities than in the villages and town- 
showing that they are relatively much better able to main- 
eir schools without aid than the villages and townships.

and townships averaged but a little more than two dollars

Shouldn’t the State place its help where needed? Should not

XPENDITURES FOR ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
financial comparison between the public school system of 1892 
he school system of two decades later makes possible certain 
sting and illuminating conclusions. The number of pupils 
led in 1892 and 1912 was substantially the same, approxi- 
ly 65,000. The average daily attendance increased during 
eriod from 45,057? to 52,160, or nearly 16 per cent. The 
xpenditures for the maintenance of elementary and secondary 
s during the fiscal year 1892 were reported as $743,543, of 
amount $549,980, or about 74 per cent, went for teachers’ 
s. In 1912 the expenditures for current expenses amounted 
672,709, of which $968,382, or about 58 per cent, went for 
rs’ salaries. To view the situation from another angle, 
the total expenditures have increased about 125 per cent 
the past twenty years, the amount expended for teachers’ 
has been raised only about 76 per cent. The average cost

DIRECT STATE SUPPORT AND EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS 
A large number of comparisons similar in general characte 
those just made might be presented as indicative of the e! 
being put forth by the state and the towns to support the pul 
schools. It is essential, however, not to obscure the remai: 
fact that the state needs yet to provide both for a greater eq) 
zation of the burden of school support among the communitie 
the state and for a further enlargement of the funds to be use 
the elementary and secondary schools, if these schools are t 
conducted on the high level requisite for the progressive wel 
of the state. The urgencies of the educational situation rev 
in the portions of this report dealing with the rural and the 
ondary schools are such that additional expenditures on the 
of the state must be resolutely faced. It is not a question of 
much Vermont is expending per capita. It is a question of dj 
oping a school system equal to the needs of its people. 
The development of the state’s school system during the 
twenty years has already been greatly stimulated by direct 
subsidies. The proportion of the total expense for the mainte! 
of the elementary and secondary schools borne directly by the 
was considerably increased during the decade 1902-12. T 
crease of the state school tax from five per cent to eight pe! 
in 1900, the grants of state aid for transportation and bo: 
pupils, for advanced instruction and for union supervision, a 
establishment of the permanent public school fund are imp 
items of this increased proportion. 
In the granting of state aid to the lower schools two d 
ends are now generally recognized by American states: 
equalize the resources of local communities with which t 
definite educational needs, and (2) to stimulate local comm 
to further educational effort. Vermont’s plan of appor 
state funds seeks to accomplish both of these ends. . . . 
In 1912, 772 schools, or practically one-third of the entire ni 
had 15 pupils or less. With this condition, all calculation:

nse based upon the pupil are unsound, even though showing a 
r capita cost that is equal to or above that of other towns or 
ates. The principal item of school cost is the salary of the 
lacher. A normal expenditure per pupil in small schools means a 
salary level for the teachers. This combination of many small 
ools with a high average cost per pupil explains Vermont’s rank 
fourteenth among the states of the Union in the average annual 
ense per child as compared with her rank of forty-third in the 
rage annual salary of teachers. It seems clear that the general 
ndard of the elementary schools of the state will be raised only 
ough an enlargement of the state’s direct support of these 
ler schools, coupled with an intelligent and expert educational 
rsight on the part of the state. The inauguration of an ad- 
istrative system of efficient type will reduce certain expenses, 
in the long run the state must spend more money to obtain a 
dily improved system of schools. No other investment that 
state can make will return so great a profit. 
RINCIPLE UPON WHICH STATE SCHOOL FUNDS SHOULD BE 
DISTRIBUTED 
e practice recently and most widely followed in the distribu- 
of state funds to local communities has had in view solely the 
e of the distribution, and has therefore based its award 
the school census or upon some form of school attendance. 
lan at present in operation in Vermont makes its major grant 
d simply on the number of legal schools, without regard to 
size, or efficiency, or the wealth of the community that 
ains them. Both of these plans are characteristic of the 
when the state confided everything in education to the vary- 
iscretion of the towns, a period when the state itself had no 
e educational policy. This has changed; the state has 
e educationally conscious, intelligent, and ambitious. The 
mendations of this report contemplate for Vermont a strong, 
ntralized and efficient state control in education. It is 
s that with the introduction of such educational leadership 
wer of state funds must be put behind the policies to be 
rated. Hereafter money should no longer be granted on a 
ita, or per school, or other merely numerical basis. State 
en administered by the advice of an informed and vigorous 
authority, should invariably be granted in such a manner 
timulate and reward local effort which is harmonious with 
olicies. Hence in Vermont, what assistance the state can

teachers, for better buildings, for persistent and careful consolid 
tion, and for the revision of the curriculum in the interests 
domestic science, manual training, and agriculture. Details 
such measures must, of course, rest with the educational office 
themselves to elaborate; it is sufficient at this point to urge t! 
the chief tool for realizing their success should be made as resp 
sive as possible to their designs. 
It is not possible without a more intensive study of the separ 
towns and communities to outline a statement of a perman| 
financial policy for the future as between state support and | 
support of elementary and secondary schools. Such a po 
must be worked out gradually by the board of education as 
reorganization of the school system proceeds. State support, 
all other outside support offered to a community, has its dan| 
no less than its advantages. It would be a serious misfortun 
lift the entire burden of school support from the community. 
is a question of judgment as to how far a state can go in hel 
local schools in justice to its other obligations, and how far 
aid stimulates instead of weakens local sense of responsibility. 
In another section attention is called to the present some 
loose methods of accounting and paying school bills, incl 
the payment of teachers’ salaries. So long as collections 
payments depend upon two distinct sources, — state and 
— it is not easy to introduce a uniform, simple, and prompt m 
of accounting and payment. But the solution of this qu 
and the still more pressing one of better salaries for teacher; 
be worked out only by the codperation of the state super’ 
agency with the town authorities. With the stimulus of sta’ 
and of state supervision, it will be entirely possible to bring 
and local authorities to a uniform practice.

this tendency, and also illustrates what can be done in

fund. Before this law was enacted the fund was appo

chool Control and the School Plant. — The school plant, 
which is meant both school buildings and school grounds, 
center about which are grouped numerous problems of 
cational control, and many issues of social importance. It 
e one permanent and concrete evidence for the community 
lhe existence of the public school system. 
s property the school plant represents the corporate com- 
al right to have and to hold; and as such it has readily 
me the center of frequent conflict of individuals, parties 
partisans. The history of the American public school 
lains many, too many, chapters of litigious dispute during 
th the technical rights of property — both public and private 
ave too often obscured the educational rights of children. 
an educational institution the school plant represents 
daptation of means to ends; of small means to small ends; 
ge means to large ends. Its evolution typifies the en- 
g conceptions of the purpose of the public school system, 
lhe widening sphere of the field of the practical operation 
school. Incorporated within every public school structure 
s immediate environment, is a composite of community 
; ideals of teaching, ideals of health and safety of both 
nm and teachers, ideals of economic and esthetic re- 
bility.

Term, 1879, 22 Kansas 366.] 
Brewer, J. The question in this case is as to the pow 
of the district board of the school-district in reference to repai 
on a school-house. The repairs consisted in fixing a door a 
window, and painting over some obscene writing on the wall, a 
the contract price therefor was five dollars. The contention of 
defendant is that the district board is limited to the amount 
money voted for repairs at the school meeting, and to the kin: 
repairs specified in such vote, and the testimony shows that 
board had already exhausted the moneys voted for the rep: 
specified. Hence it claims that the powers of the board were 
hausted, and the contract not binding on the district. The sta 
provides (Laws 1876, p. 248, sec. 11) that the school meet 
shall have power — “ Fifth, to vote a tax annually, not excee 
one per cent, on the taxable property in the district, as the mee|

school-house,”” not merely authorizes, but requires, the boa 
preserve and care for the school-house. And this duty is no 
that of a janitor, one of personal attention and manual labo 
like that of trustees, one of supervision. They are not pers 
to sweep and dust and clean, or bring wood and make fires, 
see that it is done, and to that end may employ assistants, anj 
the district for their pay. They are not chosen because oj 
physical strength and dexterity, but because of their goo 
and intelligence. And “care and keeping,” when used in

this they are but performing the duty cast upon them of 
“care and keeping” of the school-house, and are creating a 
ility against the district, and not upon themselves personally. 
do not think that the board can be considered as simply a 
cial committee to expend certain moneys placed in their hands, 
with no power beyond. The district is a corporation (Laws 
6, p. 245, sec. 2) with the “usual powers of a corporation. 
public purposes,” and the board is its managing authority. 
e, its powers are few and limited; but still reasonable construc- 
must be given to the powers which are granted. And where 
ty is imposed, especially one so vital as this to the well-being

ordinary manner, and by the ordinary means. It will be 
ed by section 21, p. 253, that, when the board builds, hires, 
urchases a school-house, it is expressly stated that it shall 
lone “‘out of the funds provided for that purpose;” but no 
limitation is expressed when the duty is cast of the care and 
ing of the school-house. The reason is obvious. In mere 
r of repairs and preservation, there is little room for expendi- 
in building, hiring, or purchasing there may be great extray-

movement on the part of the state to assume a direct oversig|

Ill. Tse Soctat UseFuLNEss oF THE ScHOOL PLANT 
The isolation of the school from the larger life of the com- 
unity is nowhere better illustrated than in the case of the 
ited utilization of the school building for other than customary 
ool purposes. In considerable measure this isolation has 
en a necessary condition for the protection and conservation 
the school as property. During the pioneer period in all 
the American states the school was, by a prevailing common 
sent, the natural center for those various group gatherings 
racteristic of the gregarious habit of all mankind. The 
sing of the early religious, racial, political and economic 
ogeneity, the rise of a decentralized form of government 
the public school, and the constant urban flow of population 
e all contributed their share of influence for the legal estab- 
ent and the civic acceptance of the doctrine of the in- 
tion of the schoolhouse from social contact. 
he general legal principles governing the use of the school 
ing may be briefly stated thus: In the absence of definite 
te the authorities having control and possession of school 
erty may authorize its use only for school purposes, or 
uch incidental uses as are not inconsistent with its use 
chool purposes. Various interpretations of what uses are 
e not inconsistent with legitimate school purposes have 
given by the courts of the different states! One decision

purposes. .. . 
Brewer, J. This was an action brought to restrain the defen 
ant from leasing its school-building for other than school purpos 
Two questions are raised: First, does the plaintiff show such 
peculiar and personal interest as will enable him to maintain tl 
action? and, second, do the facts alleged disclose grounds for t 
relief sought ? 
The plaintiff alleges that “he is a resident of the school-distr 
and tax-payer therein, and, as such tax-payer, has contributed 
proportion of taxes for the building of the said school-hou 
that his children attend school therein; and that, by the impro, 
uses of the building complained of, the books of his children 
torn, soiled, carried away, lost, and misplaced, their copy-bo

their ink stands upset, and their paper wasted and destroy 
We think this shows such an interest as entitles him to a heai 
upon the question of the alleged misuser of the school-ho, 
When he pays his taxes, he passes over so much money into 
public fund, and the disposition of it is a public duty intruste| 
certain public agents; and the fact that he has contribute 
the payment of taxes to the creation of this public fund doe: 
give him a right to challenge the manner of its use. Cra 
Jackson Co., 5 Kan. 518. He is but one of many contributo 
the same fund. He has no personal interest in it. But he 
shows that his own private property suffers from the alleged w: 
doings. The school books, ete., which he purchases for his 
dren’s use are his individual property. They belong in no 
to the public; and, though they may be but a few dollars in 
he is entitled to have those few dollars protected as fully as tl 
thousands of dollars were in danger. 
As misuser, he alleges that the “ school-house is, by the 
of the directors, leased and let to divers societies, meeting: 
gatherings,” and that thereby large assemblages of persons

     children and adults, gather there, crowding the seats and desks; 
that these assemblages consume the fuel purchased with the 
ublic funds, tear the desks from their fastenings, and cut, scratch, 
nd deface them; that some of these meetings are in the night- 
ime, and that, at such meetings, kerosene or coal-oil is used, which 
in violation of the terms of the insurance policy on the building, 
lhe premium of which has been paid out of the public funds; and 
at to accommodate one of these societies the building has been 
tered by erecting platforms, rostrums, closets, boxes, ete. In 
ort, he alleges that this building, erected by public funds for the 
rpose of a school-house, is, by the order of the directors, used for 
variety of purposes and gatherings wholly alien to schools and 
ucational matters. It does not appear that this is done against 
e wishes or without the consent of a majority of the tax-payers 
d electors of the district, nor that the building is leased without 
eiving adequate rent. Indeed, the question as it comes before 
may fairly be thus stated: May the majority of the tax-payers 
id electors in the school-district, for other than school purposes, 
or permit the use of the school-house built with funds raised 
taxation? The question is one which in view of the times, and 
attacks made in so many places, and from so many directions, 
m our public-school system, justifies, as it has received at our 
ds, most serious consideration. We are fully aware of the 
that all over the state the school-house is, by general consent, 
t least without active opposition, used for a variety of purposes 
x than the holding of public schools. Sabbath schools of sep- 
e religious denominations, church assemblies, sometimes politi- 
eetings, social gatherings, etc., are held there. Now, none of 
e can be strictly considered among the purposes for which a 
ic building can be erected, or taxation employed. But it 
happens, particularly in our newer settlements, that there is 
ther public building than the school-house,—no place so 
lenient as that. The use for these purposes works little 
ge. It is used by the inhabitants of the district whose money 
uilt it, and used for their profit or pleasure. Shall it be said 
this is illegal? Doubtless, if all in the district are content, 
estion will ever be raised; and, on the other hand, if a major- 
ject, the use for such purposes will cease. It is only when 
ajority favor, and a minority object, that the courts are 
led to. That minority may be but a single individual, 
y be influenced by spite or revenge, or any other unworthy 
le; but, whatever the motives which prompt the litigation, 
cision must be in harmony with the absolute right of all.

     be answered in the negative. The public school-house cannot be 
used for any private purpose. The argument is a short one. 
Taxation is invoked to raise funds to erect the building; but taxa- 
tion is illegitimate to provide for any private purpose. Taxatio’ 
will not lie to raise funds to build a place for a religious society, 
political society, or a social club. What cannot be done directl; 
cannot be done indirectly. As you may not levy taxes to buil 
a church, no more may you levy taxes to build a school-house an 
then lease it for a church. Nor is it an answer to say that its us 
for school purposes is not interfered with, and that the use for thj 
other purposes works little, perhaps no immediately perceptibl 
injury to the building, and results in the receipt of immedia’ 
pecuniary benefit. The extent of the injury or benefit is somethi 
into which courts will not inquire. The character of the use is t! 
only legitimate question. A municipal bond of five cents in aid 
a purely private purpose is as void as one of a thousand dollar 
and that, too, though the actual benefit to the municipality {| 
exceeds the amount of the bond. The use of a public school-hot 
for a single religious or political gathering is legally as unauthoriz| 
as its constant use therefor. True, a court of equity would 
interfere by injunction after a single use, and where there was 
likelihood of a repetition of the wrong, for it is only apprehen 
wrongs that equity will enjoin. Here the unauthorized use 
charged as a frequent fact, and one likely to occur hereafter. I

     III. Vaccination 
No problem of the health and sanitary control of publ 
schools has presented more complications than that of co 
pulsory vaccination. This question, apparently in all of 
possible ‘aspects, has been frequently submitted for determi 
tion to all grades of courts from those of minor local jurisdict; 
to the Supreme Court of the United States. All disputes 
garding the right of state legislatures, in the exercise of the po| 
power, to enact statutes making vaccination compulsory 
definitely settled by the decision of the United States Supri 
Court in the case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts (197 U. S. 
“Tt is within the police power of a State to enact a compul 
vaccination law, and it is for the legislature, and not for, 
courts, to determine in the first instance whether vaccin: 
is or is not its best mode for the prevention of small pox 
the protection of the public health.” This Court had al 
enunciated, in the case of Lawton v. Steele (152 U. S. 
the principle that the state might require the comp 
vaccination of children. “The extent and limits of w 
known as the police power have been a fruitful subje 
discussion in the Appellate Courts of nearly every sti 
the Union. It is universally conceded to include ever 
essential to public safety, health, and morals... . 
this power it has been held that the state may order . 
compulsory vaccination of children.” The New York d 
included here presents the fundamental questions of publi 
and of educational control raised by the vaccination iss

ent. 
Application of Edmund C. Viemeister for writ of mandamus 
Patrick J. White, president of the board of education of the 
rough of Queens, and others. From a judgment of the appel- 
e division (84 N. Y. Supp., 712), affirming an order of the 
cial term denying the writ, relator appeals. Affirmed. 
ANN, J. The relator moved for a writ of mandamus to compel 
officers having control of a public school in the county of 
eens to readmit his child, a lad of 10 years of age, to said school 
hout requiring him to be vaccinated. It appeared from the 
ving papers that the boy had been in regular attendance at the 
lool, and that the principal thereof, pursuant to the instructions 
he board of education, had excluded him therefrom, because he 
sed to be vaccinated. It appeared from the papers read in 
losition to the motion that when the relator’s son was excluded 
the school there was a regulation of the board of education 
lull force which provided that “no pupil shall be allowed to 
d any school, nor shall any teacher be employed in the same, 
ss such pupil or teacher has been vaccinated.” It further 
pared that the lad had never been vaccinated, and that he re- 
to submit to vaccination; but it was not alleged that at the 
of such exclusion smallpox was prevalent in the neighborhood, 
lat there was any special danger, from recent exposure or other 
s, of an immediate spread of the disease.

enance and support of a system of free common schools, 
in all the children of this State may be educated.” Consti- 
, article 9, section 1. The public-health law provides that

passage of the public health law in 1893. Laws, 1860, page 761 
chapter 438. 
The question presented is whether the legislature is prohibite 
by the constitution from enacting that such children as have ni 
been vaccinated shall be excluded from the public schools. T! 
appellant claims that the public-health law places an unreasonal 
restriction upon the right of his child to attend school, and that 
violates the section of the constitution already quoted, as well 
the general guaranties for the protection of the rights, privileg 
and liberties of the citizen. Constitution, article 1, sections 1, 
The respondents claim that the object and effect of such legislaty 
is the protection of the public health, and hence that it is a v: 
exercise of the police power. The police power, which belongs 
every sovereign State, may be exerted by the legislature, subj 
to the limitations of the constitution, whenever the exercise thei 
will promote the public health, safety, or welfare. The powei 
the legislature to decide what laws are necessary to secure t 
objects is subject to the power of the courts to decide whethe 
act purporting to promote the public health or safety has su 
reasonable connection therewith as to appear upon inspectio: 
be adapted to that end. A statute entitled a health law mu: 
a health law in fact as well as in name, and must not attem 
the name of the police power to effect a purpose having no ade 
connection with the common good. As we have recently 
it “ must tend in a degree that is perceptible and clear towar 
preservation of the... health... or welfare of the 
munity, as those words have been used and construed in the 
cases heretofore decided.” Health Department of New Y 
Rector, etc., 145 N. Y., 32, 39; 39 N. E., 833; 45 Am. Stat. 
579. When the sole object and general tendency of legisla 
to promote the public health, there is no invasion of the co 
tion, even if the enforcement of the law interferes to some 
with liberty or property. These principles are so well esta’ 
as to require no discussion, and we cite but a few out of 
authorities relating to the subject. (Matter of Jacobs, 98

The right to attend the public schools of the State is necessarily 
subject to some restrictions and limitations in the interest of the 
ublic health. A child afflicted with leprosy, smallpox, scarlet 
ever, or any other disease which is both dangerous and contagious 
ay be lawfully excluded from attendance so long as the danger 
f contagion continues. Public health, as well as the interest of 
he school, requires this, as otherwise the school might be broken 
p and a pestilence spread abroad in the community. So a child 
lecently exposed to such a disease may be denied the privilege of 
ur schools until all danger shall have passed. Smallpox is known 
f all to be a dangerous and contagious disease. If vaccination 
rongly tends to prevent the transmission or spread of this disease, 
logically follows that children may be refused admission to the 
blic schools until they have been vaccinated. The appellant 
aims that vaccination does not tend to prevent smallpox, but 
nds to bring about other diseases, and that it does much harm, 
ith no good. 
It must be conceded that some laymen, both learned and un- 
red, and some physicians of great skill and repute, do not be- 
ve that vaccination is a preventive of smallpox. The common 
lief, however, is that it has a decided tendency to prevent the 
read of this fearful disease and to render it less dangerous to 
se who contract it. While not accepted by all, it is accepted 
the mass of the people, as well as by most members of the medi- 
profession. It has been general in our State and in most civil- 
id nations for generations. It is generally accepted in theory and 
erally applied in practice, both by the voluntary action of the 
ple and in obedience to the command of law. Nearly every 
te of the Union has statutes to encourage or directly or indirectly 
equire vaccination, and this is true of most nations of Europe. 
lis required in nearly all the armies and navies of the world. 
cination has been compulsory in England since 1854, and the 
act upon the subject, passed in 1898, requires every child born 
ngland to be vaccinated within six months of its birth. It 
me-compulsory in Bavaria in 1807; Denmark, 1810; Sweden, 
; Wiirttemberg, Hesse, and other German States, 1818; 
ssia, 1835; Roumania, 1874; Hungary, 1876; and Servia, 
It is aided, encouraged, and to some extent compelled, in 
other European nations. (24 Ene. Brit., 30.) It is compul- 
in but few States and cities in this country, but it is counte- 
ed or promoted in substantially all, and statutes requiring

A common belief, like common knowledge, does not require ev} 
dence to establish its existence, but may be acted upon witho 
proof by the legislature and the courts. While the power to ta 
judicial notice is to be exercised with caution, and due care tak 
to see that the subject comes within the limits of common kno 
edge, still, when according to the memory and conscience of tl 
judge, instructed by recourse to such sources of information as 
deems trustworthy, the matter is clearly within those limits, t! 
power may be exercised by treating the fact as proved witho} 
allegation or proof. (Jones v. U. S., 137 U. S. 202, 216, 11 Sup.

As was said by Mr. Justice Swayne in Brown ». Piper, 91 U. S.

there is scarcely any belief that is accepted by every one.

other standard of action; for what the people believe is for the 
common welfare must be accepted as tending to promote the com- 
mon welfare, whether it does in fact or not. Any other basis would 
conflict with the spirit of the constitution, and would sanction 
measures opposed to a republican form of government. While we 
do not decide and can not decide that vaccination is a preventive 
of smallpox, we take judicial notice of the fact that this is the 
common belief of the people of the State, and with this fact as a 
foundation we hold that the statute in question is a health law, 
enacted in a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power. 
It operates impartially upon all children in the public schools, and 
is designed not only for their protection but for the protection of 
ll the people of the State. The relator’s son is excluded from 
chool only until he complies with the law passed to protect the 
ealth of all, himself and his family included. No right conferred 
r secured by the constitution was violated by that law, or by the 
ction of the school authorities based thereon. In view of the 
pinions below, we regard further discussion as unnecessary, and 
e affirm the order appealed from, with costs.

An effective illustration of the enlargement of the scope of 
blic education so as to include opportunity and provision

another 50 by 102, which buildings it is conceded are ample to 
accommodate the present attendance at the school and the antici- 
pated increase in attendance for some time in the future. The 
additional grounds sought to be acquired abut upon the existing 
site and form therewith a single tract or parcel of land. The testi- 
mony of the school officers was to the effect that the present grounds 
were adequate for the purposes of the school in the sense that they 
afforded sufficient room for ingress and egress to and from the 
school buildings and sufficient room for the necessary auxiliary and 
outbuildings, but that they were inadequate in the sense that they, 
afforded no room for the pupils attending the school to exercise 
the superintendent of the school testifying that it had been foun 
almost impossible, without forbidding all forms of play and exer. 
cise, to keep the pupils from trespassing on the adjoining property 
and that much complaint had been made to him by adjoining prop; 
erty holders of such trespassing, and that the additional groun 
sought was desired at the present time to afford additional pla: 
grounds for the pupils of the school, that they might have groun 
upon which the common athletic games current among schools 
its class could be played. The preliminary proceedings for t 
acquisition of the lands had by the school board seemed to have be 
in compliance with the statutes save in one particular. At t 
special meeting of the voters of the district called to determi 
whether the board of directors should be authorized to acqui 
the additional tract for school purposes, the vote was taken 
calling on the voters present to stand up and be counted, inste: 
of by ballot, as the statute directs. On the hearing in the co 
below, at the conclusion of the petitioner’s case, the responde: 
moved for a dismissal of the proceedings on the grounds: Fir 
that the petitioner had not shown a compliance with the law w 
reference to the selection of the land sought to be taken; seco: 
that the act under which the petitioner is proceeding is invalid 
void; and, third, it is seeking to take the land for a purpose 
authorized by law. The motion was granted, and the petitio 
brought the proceeding to this court by a writ of review. 
(1) The contentions of the respondents are the same in 
court as they were in the court below, and we shall notice the 
the order in which they are stated in the motion. By the Cod 
Public Instruction it is provided (Laws 1909, p. 349) that any b 
of directors may at its discretion call a special meeting of 
voters of the district to determine whether the district shall 
chase any schoolhouse site or sites or additional grounds t 
existing site, at all of which such meetings the “ voting shal

quality.” As we have elsewhere stated, the voting at the special 
meeting in which it was determined to purchase the school site in 
uestion here was not by ballot, but by standing vote, and it is this 
‘act that is thought to render the preliminary proceedings void. 
There is here no contention that the election complained of 
id not express the popular will of the electors, and we hold it valid. 
* * * * * * * 
(4) Finally, it is urged that the use for which the land is sought 
be taken is not a public use. It is contended that the land is 
ught rather as a playground for the pupils attending the school 
an for strictly school purposes. The testimony of the super- 
tendent of the school from which we have hereinbefore cited 
doubtedly lends color to this contention, but nevertheless we 
ink the use for which the land is sought to be taken is a public 
e. The physical development of a child is as essential to his well- 
ing as is his mental development, and physical development 
mot be had without suitable places for recreation and exercise. 
acquire such grounds is therefore within the province of the 
blic_ schools.

the cause reinstated, with instruction to proceed with the hear-

      CHAPTER XXI 
TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES 
From among the large amount which has been written on th 
question of textbooks we reproduce four editorial articl 
and all of the argument of the report of a recent legislati 
investigating committee. The first really sums up the who! 
question in a clear and forceful manner, stating as it does t 
problem of publication, supply, and adoption in almost all 
its phases. The second and third deal particularly with t 
question of state publication, and the fourth with the tenden 
of many of our American states to enact foolish laws on the su| 
ject. The legislative report, which closes this chapter, de 
chiefly with the question of the cost of textbooks.

{An article printed as an editorial in the Sierra Educational N 
the official organ of the California Teachers’ Association, 
the issues for October and November, 1911.] 
At the last session of the Legislature, the Senate appointe 
committee of five of its members to investigate the general q 
tion of textbooks for our elementary schools. This committee 
made a promising beginning. Its recent hearings in San Frane 
have fully sustained the charges made by the State Board of 
trol that for years there has been shameful mismanagement of 
State Printing Office. It was shown that if a business-like ad 
istration of that office could be secured, the price of our textb 
would be materially reduced.

especially in the cost feature. The press of the State has com- 
ented freely on the investigation. An editorial in the San 
‘rancisco Chronicle is especially stimulating : 
“The investigators of the State Printing Office are merely 
nding out the details of what all those familiar with such busi- 
ess have always known must exist there. 
“ Any State Printing Office is, and will remain, a State scandal. 
‘here may be a temporary spurt of purification ‘such as is now 
oing on, but unless human nature has suddenly experienced a 
volutionary change the office will speedily drift back into its 
id rut. 
“For, frankly, that is precisely what the office is intended for.

ildren, and to enable the State Printer to do politics or worse

It is perfectly easy to beat any cost system when those in 
trol so desire, and the very existence of such a system will make 
safer by allaying public suspicion. 
‘The Chronicle will not, and the people should not, prejudge 
personal conduct of the State Printer. That will be justified 
otherwise by the facts as they appear. 
‘ But we shall none of us err if, without further knowledge than 
already have, we make up our minds that the system itself is 
ten.” 
AN EXPERIMENT IN TEXTBOOKS 
his editorial in the Chronicle would seem to indicate that the 
le of California are about to come out of a twenty-six year 
ce. Back in 1885 California ventured upon an experiment 
no other state had ever tried, and one that no other state since 
has deemed it wise to try. Through specious argument and 
misrepresentation, the people of California voted in 1885 to 
ile and publish their own textbooks. It was loudly proclaimed 
fondly believed that such a system would yield superior books, 
reduced cost, to those offered by the several publishing firms 
nominated for political purposes as “ the book trust.” Thus 
eople enthusiastically created a real monopoly in the author- 
manufacture and sale of textbooks. All competition was 
ated. The grave responsibility of compiling the books was 
sted to the State Board of Education —a board containing 
embers experienced in producing texts. It was cheerfully

assumed, however, that successful authors of textbooks were 
indigenous to California even as the giant redwoods. The serious 
task of managing the business end of the undertaking — the man- 
ufacture of the books — was placed in the hands of a politicia 
selected, in nearly every instance, by big business interests whic! 
hoped to profit from favorable contracts. Truly a promising com: 
bination of politics and business to handle free from competitio 
an enterprise running well toward a quarter million dollars a year 
And this combination could not lose because it had the big purs 
of the State to fall back upon. The cheerful confidence of th} 
people in 1885 in establishing this system seems pathetic to 
now. 
FRUITS OF THE SYSTEM 
Was not the plan in both its features an invitation to disaster 
On the authorship side we deliberately turned our backs on boo 
that had been tested in the fierce heat of competition all over t 
United States. Surely it was a provincial, short-sighted pri 
that refused the best the country at large had to offer, in favor 
the work of unknown, untried California authors! On the busin 
end we provided an unholy combination of politics and busin 
thereby laying a sure foundation for faulty service and gr: 
scandals. With such a plan, what could we expect? Do 
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 
We were not slow in harvesting the natural crop. We sad 
the children of California with books that were worse than dis 
pointments. As a whole they were a crime against helpless chi 
hood. Competent students of education bear witness that of 
eighteen books prepared by local authors and published at 
State Printing Office from 1885 to 1903, not one book coul 
considered a thoroughly satisfactory text; not one could

law requiring children to use the State texts was evaded thr 
the purchase by the districts of large numbers of supplemei 
books, which were quietly used in place of the State texts, 
many instances children bought these other and better bool 
place of the State texts — a clear violation of the law — while 
in authority winked at it. Teachers and principals talked lear 
of the advantages of the topical method, and under its 
brought in supplementary books galore. Thus, for the sake 
children, did we circumvent a bad law. The habit of suppl

tary books became so strong that when a happier day dawned, in 
1903, it required a firm crusade to place reasonable restrictions on 
the use of supplementary books. Hundreds of thousands of dol- 
lars were spent by parents and districts for supplementary books 
as a direct result of the rotten series of State texts. And yet the 
lan of state publication was adopted as an economy measure ! 
REFORMING THE AUTHORSHIP FEATURE 
Finally the storm of complaint against the State texts became 
‘o fierce and continuous from teachers and parents alike, that the 
ttorney General came to the rescue. In 1903 he rendered an 
pinion that the constitutional provision requiring state compila- 
ion and publication of textbooks would be complied with if the 
jooks were actually printed at the State Printing Office. A statute 
as framed accordingly, enabling the State Board of Education 
adopt the best books from the open market, leasing the plates 
om the original publishers and paying a royalty on each book 
Id. By this legal legerdemain we managed after eighteen years 
squirm out of one-half of a bad plan. But the other half — 
e manufacture of the books in the State Printing Office — is 
ill with us. For several valid reasons, this feature also must go 
fore we shall have a system worthy of California. 
MISLEADING COMPARISON OF PRICES 
n the first place, the character of the work done in the State 
inting Office confirms the belief that the fundamental plan is 
erently wrong, as pointed out in the editorial in the Chronicle. 
can not reasonably expect a clean, businesslike administration 
that office. A strong, efficient Governor, an alert Board of 
trol, and a determined Senate committee may force a tem- 
ary reform. But so long as the product of that office, freed by 
from competition, is accepted by the State, just so long will 
office remain a political one, whether elective or appointive. 
it will remain an asylum for political henchmen, who will deter- 
le for themselves what constitutes a fair day’s work. A few 
trations of the character of the work done may prove illumi- 
ve of the contention that the State Printing Office must go. 
e State Printing Office recognizes only one fundamental 
lem — that of publishing the books adopted by the State 
d at a few cents less than the list prices of these same books 
Id by the publishers. Now a book is a book to some people, 
s a horse is a horse to others. But a lover of books recognizes 
 
-P-A-G-E-570
548 ENVIRONMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
a difference in books just as a lover of horses recognizes a difference 
in horses. Two men may both have a set of Shakespeare, but 
one set may be worth ten times the other. Since the plan of leas- 
ing plates was adopted in 1903, the State Printing Office has not 
issued one book equal in binding and paper to the same book as 
published regularly. To bring this point home with its attendant 
implications, compare our present State text in history with the 
same book (McMaster’s Brief History of the United States) as 
sold in the open market. In the State text we find paper so poor 
that the illustrations are not clear; the margins have been reduced, 
evidencing skimpiness and stinginess; and, worst of all, the leave’ 
are merely pasted to the back, while the regular publishers’ editio 
is strongly mounted with a reinforced linen back to which th 
leaves are securely stitched. Any competent bookbinder will 
testify that the book from the publisher will easily last twice a: 
long as the book from the State Printing Office. What is true oj 
the history is true of the other books. Compare the geographie} 
published by the State with the same books issued by the regul: 
publishers. But why multiply instances? 
The State Printer claims with pride that he can undersell t! 
regular publishers. Can he really undersell them, quality f 
quality? His one great advantage is a ready market — safel 
his by law. With no expense for establishing a demand for 
goods, such as all regular publishers must meet, he issues boo! 
that no reputable publisher would dare offer the public. In ea 
case the State Printer prepares for the use of our children an illegi 
mate brother of a well-born book, a counterfeit presentment of f 
days and full of trouble for the children. When the State Prin 
can produce books equal in paper and binding to the regular e 
tions of these books, we shall listen to a comparison of prices. 
comparison of prices that does not take varying qualities i 
consideration is worthless. This comparison at the present tij 
on a false assumption of equal paper and binding is thoroug 
reprehensible because its deliberate intent is to mislead. It is 
fair to the publishers and also to the children. For have we 
vaunted ourselves, saying that the best is none too good for 
children? But we continue a system that places in the hand: 
these children books that are decidedly inferior in paper 
binding to those used in any of the other states of the ra 
California. 
THE COMING OF FREE TEXTBOOKS 
There can be little question that we shall soon have free 
books in California. Since the State undertakes at great ex 
 
-P-A-G-E-571
  TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES 549 
the education of her children, it would seem that she must not 
stop short of providing the necessary tools for doing the work. 
Well-equipped buildings and competent teachers are provided, 
but these will fall short of the goal unless supplemented by good 
books in the hands of all the children. The textbook is an indis- 
ensable part in the circle of instruction, second only to the teacher. 
e endanger the whole edifice of public education when we leave 
his gap. For many parents are unable to furnish books for their 
hildren, but still are unwilling to confess pauperism to secure the 
ooks under the present law for indigents. Free textbooks have 
een tried in other states, and under certain safeguards the plan has 
orked well. A sentiment in favor of free texts is growing rapidly 
California. Is it not wise to face the situation now and prepare a 
refully considered plan against the day of their introduction? 
In maturing this plan we shall find a compelling reason why 
e State Printing Office must go. If that office were charged with 
e duty of furnishing free textbooks, there would be less incentive 
keep its work up to a decent standard than at present. For 
long as parents pay directly for textbooks, they will have an 
ive interest in the quality and cost of the books. But with 
tbooks furnished at public expense, this critical interest would 
materially lessened. To the average man there is a big dif- 
ence between the misappropriation of a dollar that comes out 
his pocket and one that comes out of the public purse. The 
ce indignation throughout the State at the shameful mismanage- 
mt of the State Printing Office is due in considerable measure to 
alization of personal loss. Why do we hear so much discussion 
he cost of textbooks? On its face it seems strange, when we 
sider that of all the money spent annually in California for 
cation, not more than four per cent goes for textbooks. And 
ninety-six per cent of all the talk concerns the four per cent 
t for books! Why? Because the ninety-six per cent is raised 
axation, while the four per cent is paid directly from our own 
idual pockets. Furnish textbooks at public expense, and we 
hear no more criticism of the cost of textbooks than of build- 
desks, supplies and teachers’ salaries. 
it not clear that before we may safely lessen the public scrutiny 
e introduction of free texts, we should reject a plan that has 
ed conducive of poor books at high prices? Before com- 
ng ourselves to free textbooks, we should evolve a plan that 
safeguard the securing at reasonable prices of good books, 
ly printed and well bound. We believe that we should stead- 
resist free textbooks in California until the State Printing 
is done away with.

     We believe that a frank examination of our system of uniform 
State texts will point to a solution of the problem. State publi- 
cation and state uniformity go naturally hand in hand. If the 
reasons for doing away with state publication are valid, we believ 
that it can be shown that we should profit educationally by sub: 
stituting local adoption for state uniformity of texts. While thi 
assertion may seem a little startling in California, it would b 
considered a truism in every other progressive, well-settled stat 
in the Union with the exception of Indiana. Let us name all th 
states that have uniform textbooks: Virginia, North Carolin: 
South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabam: 
Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizon: 
Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Kansas, Indiana ai 
California. This list contains food for thought. With the exce 
tion of the last four named, the list falls into two big classes 
the Southern States and the Plateau States. In a broad way 
see clearly that the two most sparsely settled sections of our count 
favor state uniformity. Is this merely a happening, or is there 
reason for it? We believe that state uniformity in those two 
groups of states is a genuine educational adaptation to environme! 
In a sparsely settled section public education costs far more 
capita than in more populous regions. The schools must m 
humble beginnings and develop with the section. The cost 
education is usually so great that only the rudiments can 
attempted at first. And to make sure of even a humble beginni’ 
the power and assistance of the state are invoked. Until a syst

to make sure that certain minimum requirements are enfor 
State uniformity of texts is a natural means of handling the p 
lem. Thus we should expect to find state uniformity in the So 
for the public school systems in those states have been built s

all new states, as evidenced by the Plateau group as a whole. 
Does it not follow conclusively that with the gradual settle 
and development of a state, the plan of state uniformity of 
must complete its purpose and give way to a system more res 
sive to the needs of the people? With an effective public s 
system in full swing, backed by an alert public consciousne

  TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES 551 
that bases itself on variety as co-equal with unity in achieving 
progress; that stimulates progress by permitting ready adjust- 
ment to organic variations. 
This process of educational evolution has been shown clearly in 
the state of Washington. When it was first made a state, the plan 
f state uniformity rightly imposed upon it as a territory was 
ontinued. But with the rapid settlement of the state, with the 
‘owth of great cities, with varying needs among the people, Wash- 
ngton a few years ago set aside its outgrown system of uniform 
lexts in favor of a progressive system of local adoptions. Several 
ther states have done the same. 
Now let us turn to the four states that seem to be out of their 
ew in favoring state uniformity. Kansas and Oregon may not 
ve developed sufficient educational momentum safely to do 
ay with state uniformity. But how about Indiana and Cali- 
rnia? At last we understand why Indiana has been called “ the 
oosier State.” Even Missouri has been “ shown,” changing a 
years ago from state uniformity to local adoptions. Why 
ould our own beloved California, progressive as she truly is, 
nd squarely across the path of educational evolution? Why 
uld California and Indiana have the unenviable distinction of 
ving as the exceptions that prove the rule? We believe that 
it for our system of state publication, we should have discarded 
plan of uniform texts long ago. May they both soon pass 
y together and keep themselves company in the limbo of worn- 
plans ! 
  UNITS OF LOCAL ADOPTION 
      we do away with state uniformity of texts in California, what 
d be made the unit or units of local adoption? The unit of 
1 adoption should always coincide with the unit of supervision. 
supervisory units in California are the counties and the cities. 
same authority that prepares the course of study and super- 
its execution in the schools should select the books that will 
e most effective in carrying out that course of study. As no 
courses of study ought to be alike, the folly of uniform texts 
ll these courses is apparent. It may safely be assumed that 
verage county board of education understands the needs of 
chools of that county better than does the State Board of 
ation, none of whose members has direct contact with elemen- 
chool work. The selection by the State Board of the books 
used in all the schools of the State is truly an anachronism. 
nly way to make that function of the Board consistent would 
add another requiring the adoption of a uniform course of

prescribe the tools. Supervision, course of study, and adoption 
of texts rightly belong together. Educational evolution in Cali- 
fornia has brought supervision and the course of study together 
in their rightful place. One step more —local adoption — and 
we shall have adjusted the three main factors of effective adminis- 
tration of schools.

THE COST OF TEXTBOOKS 
Since educational experience and educational theory bot 
strongly sanction local adoptions and optional free texts, we mig) 
fairly rest the case at this point. But we desire to meet the adv 
cates of state publication on the only point left — cost of boo! 
Some people might be disposed to put up with a confessedly po, 
system if it could be shown that such a system is cheaper than t 
one proposed. A system of local adoptions necessarily invol 
the purchase of books in the open market. It does away nec 
sarily with state publication. Can books be purchased un 
local adoptions at prices comparable with those. charged un 
state publication? 
A study of conditions and prices in states having local adopti 
will prove instructive. Where boards representing cities

—45 cents; fourth reader — 60 cents; fifth reader — 60

   books as published regularly follow: Aldine Primer (Newson & 
Co.) — 32 cents; Progressive First Reader (Silver, Burdett & 
Co.) — 32 cents; Brooks’ Second Reader (American Book Co.) 
'— 35 cents; Brooks’ Third Reader (American Book Co.) — 40 
ents; Stepping Stones Fourth Reader (Silver, Burdett & Co.) 
60 cents; Stepping Stones Fifth Reader (Silver, Burdett & 
0.) — 60 cents. The total list price of the six is $2.59. Deduct- 
Ing 20 per cent we have $2.07, the price at which the books would 
e delivered to city and county boards, or to dealers in non-free- 
lext territory. Adding 10 per cent of the list price for the cost of 
andling by superintendents or dealers, we have $2.33 as the price 
be paid by the children. This is 15 cents less than we are paying 
w for these books on inferior paper and with poor bindings. 
But some one objects that the total cost of $2.48 for the State 
aders would be materially lessened if all the graft could be 
ueezed out of the State Printing Office and business-like methods 
troduced. This is certainly true. Fortunately we have the 
ures of the secretary of the State Board of Control, an expert 
countant, to help us on this point. He furnished the senatorial 
estigating committee with an estimate of the rightful cost of 
primer and the first three readers as follows: primer — 24 
ts; first reader — 22 cents; second reader — 25 cents; third 
der — 33 cents. This estimate makes a total cost of $1.04 
the four books as against the present price of $1.28, the differ- 
e of 24 cents representing the extracted graft. Under local 
ptions, what would the four books cost our children? The list 
es of the four total $1.39. Deducting 20 per cent for county 
ity adoption, and adding 10 per cent for handling, we have 
5 as against the estimate of $1.04. But let us remember that 
apparent difference of 21 cents is not based on equal values in 
r, binding, and workmanship. It means the difference 
een books properly made and those that readily fall to pieces. 
eans books that will last twice as long. The difference in 
ity and lasting power probably more than offsets the 21 cents. 
lhermore, be it remembered that the estimate of $1.04 is merely 
timate that rests upon an assumption of a business-like ad- 
tration of the State Printing Office — an assumption nega- 
by the experience of twenty-six years.

ever, let us be optimistic. Let us assume that the State 
sell these four books at $1.04 without calling upon the legis- 
for a special appropriation for the State Printing Office.

     Let us also waive the question of qualities in paper, binding, an 
workmanship. In connection with that apparent difference of 
21 cents, there still remains another consideration which knocks th: 
last prop from under a belief in the lower cost of State texts. W. 
refer to the exchange of books granted by publishers under local 
adoptions. On a four years’ adoption, publishers would grant i 
California an exchange price of 40 per cent off on all books sold th 
first year of the adoption. Figures show that under exchange n 
less than 40 per cent of all books sold under a four years’ contra: 
are sold the first year, and that 75 per cent of these purchases ai 
on exchange. This represents an average reduction of 12 per ce 
on every book sold during the entire period of adoption. Und, 
our plan of state publication there is a total loss whenever a bo 
is changed. Since educational progress makes occasional chang 
in texts necessary, would it not be far better to have a system t 
would not leave the old books a dead loss to pupils and paren 
If the book bills of some families could be cut 40 per cent thro 
the privilege of exchange, there would be a strong incentive 
keep books against the day of exchange. 
EXCHANGE AND THE DEALERS

Practically every teacher, principal and superintendent in

State are voicing the complaints of superintendents. The r 
for this state of affairs is not far to seek. Usually the State 
ing Office is partly at fault; but even when its skirts are clea: 
trouble persists owing to the unwillingness of local dealers to 
freely for school opening. With cash accompanying all 
for State books, with no return privileges, and with only a 
margin of profit, the dealers dare not take the chance of 
“stuck.” Hence they invariably order light and continj 
re-order for two or three months. Experience has shown the 
that this is the only safe way. Meanwhile the schools

ever a book is displaced under local adoptions, the publishers of 
the new book take from the dealers at dollar for dollar all the stock 
on hand. Thus protected against loss, dealers have no hesitancy 
to order freely on the estimate which the superintendent or princi- 
pal is always glad to furnish. In free-text territory the problem 
of securing books on time solves itself. To encourage boards to 
rder adequately for prospective needs, publishers grant a return 
rivilege on the books up to 20 per cent of the original order. 
TWO PAYMENTS UNDER STATE PUBLICATION 
There still remains’ another important factor in the cost of text- 
ooks that usually is lost sight of completely. Under state publi- 
lation the people of California have been called upon to make an 
direct second payment for textbooks in addition to the sums paid 
irectly by parents. From the inception of state publication 
June 30, 1910, the parents in this State paid $2,553,824.29 
rectly for textbooks. No doubt the great majority of these 
rents believed they were paying the entire cost of the books. 
r from it. During the time mentioned the legislature made 
ecial appropriations aggregating $607,600 to further the work 
state publication. Thus in addition to the sums paid directly 
parents for books, we were obliged to add from the State treasury 
per cent more. However, the man who paid four dollars for 
children’s books did not realize that he was adding nearly 
ther dollar for books in his taxes. If he had realized it, we 
uld have heard from him. That realization would have shaken 
loyalty to a professedly independent system that needs 23 per 
t of coddling from the State to make it go. If this parent were 
usiness man, his loyalty to the system would probably have 
m completely destroyed by the consideration that if these special 
ropriations of $607,600 had been placed at interest at 5 per cent, 
would now amount to at least $1,250,000, or approximately 
er cent of the amount paid by the parents. Any comparison 
lhe cost of books under state publication with the cost under 
1 adoptions that does not take these special appropriations into 
unt is manifestly incomplete and unfair. For, waiving the 
tion of interest, these appropriations aggregating 23 per cent 
e sums paid directly for the books loom up in any honest dis- 
ion of the subject. Though usually overlooked in textbook 
ssions, these appropriations are as big and significant as the 
ont Hotel on the skyline of San Francisco. They are sig- 
nt, first, in removing the last reasonable doubt as to relative 
under state publication and local adoptions. Secondly,

     because of the ease with which we lose sight of these appropriations 
— the money of all the people rather than of individuals — they 
are significant in enforcing the necessity of a system of publication 
and adoption close to the people and responsive to their varying 
needs, before we dare commit ourselves to free texts. No more 
serious educational blunder could be made than free texts under} 
state publication. Since free texts are right and desirable, it i 
evident that our rigid, cost-concealing system of state publicatio 
must give way for the introduction of free texts under an open 
elastic, less expensive and more democratic plan. 
SUMMING UP THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT 
In summing up the economic points disclosed in this comparis 
of state publication and local adoptions, we believe that the fac 
clearly confirm the belief that state publication is the more ¢e 
pensive plan. Under local adoptions our children would ha’ 
books strongly and artistically dressed. This fundamental rig! 
of California childhood has been persistently denied under st: 
publication. If the State Printing Office could produce bos 
equal in paper, binding, and workmanship to the books issued 
regular publishers, it is highly probable that the cost of these bo 
would equal, if not exceed, the list prices of the publishers. Un 
county and city adoptions, however, these list prices would 
materially reduced through eliminating the profits of jobbers 
retailers. Under local adoptions, a generous allowance of 40 
cent would be made for the exchange of books. Under state 
lication every change means a dead loss. Under local adopti 
our schools would be supplied on time, for boards of educa 
and dealers in non-free-text territory, would both be prote 
against loss. Under state publication we can not hope to 
books enough on opening day, for dealers are wary of a plan 
carries high risks and small profits. Finally, under local adop 
we should be obliged to pay only once for our books. Under 
publication we have added 23 per cent to the sums paid dir 
by parents. In view of all these economic factors, who can ho’ 
doubt that state publication is the more expensive plan? 
POLITICAL BENEFICIARIES OF STATE PUBLICATION

prejudices realizes that state publication is not only undes 
educationally but is also more expensive than local adoptio:

grasps the real reason why critics of state publication are per- 
sistently accused of being “ pliant tools of the book trust.” From 
the day years ago when Supt. J. W. Linscott, one of the most 
highly esteemed schoolmen in California, raised his voice against 
ithe evils of state publication, and paid for his temerity by having 
is political aspirations killed and his personal character assailed ; 
‘rom that day to the present, the honest critic of state publication 
as been abused and his motives impeached. Why do not the 
dvocates of state publication join battle fairly without abuse 
nd without misrepresentation? Do they not realize that abuse 
nd misrepresentation are always a confession that the system under 
vestigation will not bear the light? As might have been expected, 
e system of state publication soon developed a well-organized 
dy of beneficiaries. Many a soft job has it furnished for political 
nchmen! Many a juicy contract has it awarded to big business 
r timely assistance in political stress! A fine political asset, the 
achines of the two great parties have fought persistently to con- 
1 it. What more natural than a fixed policy of both parties to 
sh criticisms that might possibly lead to the removal of the 
lum”? What more natural than for the beneficiaries of the 
stem to resent attacks upon it? And was not the weapon of 
ense ready at hand? ‘The critic could be dubbed “ an enemy 
the peerless school system of California,” and a sure means of 
pleting his public discomfiture was to brand him as “ an emis- 
try of the book trust.” This waiving the red rag of “ the book 
st ”’ was cleverly and persistently done to confuse the great mass 
honest voters. Apparently this appeal to prejudice — this little 
e of stop thief — would have worked forever had it not been 
a progressive, honest governor and an inquiring State Board of 
trol. , Even then the comments from a goodly portion of the 
spapers of the State on the shake-up in the State Printing 
e were singularly interesting. The headlines showed that 
y an editor somehow felt it incumbent upon himself to blame 
le book trust” for the misdeeds of the system designed and 
lished “to free the people from the cruel exactions of the 
trust.” The editors were honest, too. The habit of making 
book trust ” the scapegoat for all our educational ills was so 
ig upon them that they were simply unable to adjust them- 
is promptly to the real situation.

of the system. Their method was the time-honored dodge of an 
appeal to state pride on the one hand, and to prejudice against 
publishers on the other. This hoary political ruse worked unfail- 
ingly up to the exposé of the real inwardness of the State Printing, 
Office. But that revelation opened the eyes of the people an

There can be little doubt that the people are beginning to realiz

It is being made plain to all that state publication is without hono}

reported against it. These adverse reports were based on tl 
clearly perceived educational and financial shortcomings of 1 
system. ‘These reports now have added confirmation through t

mands that California replace her system of uniform texts wit

aside the swaddling clothes of state uniformity and don the oJ 
dress worthy of a grown-up state—local adoptions. But

sible and no satisfactory system of free texts can be devised. 
II. Miscettansous Epiroriats 
1. School Books and Home Industry 
[Houston (Tex.) Post, April 27, 1907.] 
There is not a more faithful advocate of the home ind 
principle than the Post. It believes in building up Texas 
tutions by patronizing home industry and keeping Texas mon 
home, but it can not agree with the idea advanced at the m 
of printers in Waco with respect to the printing of Texas 
books in Texas, except such books as may be written by 
authors. For the Legislature to provide that all text-book:
-P-A-G-E-581
OED Pg ie RE ede PP PW Rae eS Oe eR Te EE eee Ss eee ee eee ere ee 
TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES 559 
in the public schools must be printed in Texas would play havoc 
with our schools. It would ultimately compel the selection of 
many books of inferior merit and this would incalculably injure the 
entire system of public education. 
The text-book board should be free to select the very best books 
written, regardless of authorship or by whom published. Mani- 
estly the first consideration is the welfare of the million school 
hildren and not the welfare of several hundred printers. All the 
books now in use in Texas and those likely to be used for many 
rs are copyrighted works owned by publishers residing in other 
tates. These outside publishers can not be expected to turn over 
he printing of their books to forty-five different printing estab- 
ishments in as many States. Even if they should agree to do so, 
e element of economy would be lost, and economy was the main 
ason for uniformity. 
When Texas text-book writers prepare as good books as out- 
ders, Texas will adopt them and in doing-so will provide for their 
blication in Texas. Until that time comes, however, it would 
folly to undertake to compel outside publishers to print their 
oks in this State. The only way in which State publication could 
had would be the adoption of books which are obsolete and upon 
ich copyrights have expired. We do not desire such books and 
profit to be derived by the printers could not possibly com- 
sate for the lasting injury to the school children. 
‘exas buys school books as cheaply as they can be purchased. 
e competition is keen and the books are sold at a slight margin 
profit. Moreover, there is no such sum as $3,000,000 a year 
ested in new books in Texas. That would imply that the chil- 
in are equipped with practically a new set of books a year, which 
ot the case. The average school book is good for at least 
e years or longer and the new books annually required are 
ely the number needed for the increased enrollment and to 
lace those lost or destroyed. 
ye can not afford to adopt a policy that may injure the public 
ol system, for the sake of obtaining a small profit which may 
t be realized. The text-book commission must be free to 
se the best books, which means copyrighted books owned for 
ost part by publishers in other States. The printers must 
until Texas authors prepare our books, and even then sound 
ic policy will require their purchase of publishing houses that 
‘urnish them at the lowest prices.

     2. About Home-Printed Text-Books 
[Houston (Tex.) Post, May 4, 1907.] 
The Post is a believer in home industry and it is a tireless toiler 
in the work of stimulating home industry sentiment throughout the 
State. It believes, however, that the Legislature should g 
slowly in adopting a provision requiring all text-books used in th 
public schools to be printed within the State. It would inevitabl, 
embarrass the school system, for few of the publishers would car 
to establish branch printing houses in Texas. And suppose, fo) 
instance, that every State using McGuffey’s readers or any othe 
copyrighted work — and they are all copyrighted — should als 
require the printing of the books within its borders, what would 
the result? Inevitably an increase in the price of text-books. 
Unfortunately, Texas teachers have done very little in t 
way of writing text-books suitable for the public schools. Most 
the books used are owned by the publishing houses located els 
where. It would be absurd to require these publishing houses 
establish branch printing offices in every State where their boo 
may be used, and they can not be expected to turn over th 
plates to Texas printing houses. 
The text-books should be selected solely upon their merits 
text-books and the children should have the benefit of the bi 
text-books in existence, regardless of where the publisher or aut! 
resides. 
In time, and it will come about gradually if at all, we s 
probably have first class text-books written by Texas authors 
printed by Texas houses, but at present we must get the best bo} 
from publishers living outside of the State just as other States h 
to purchase them. The economical production of text-books w: 
be impossible if it were necessary for a publisher of a copyrig! 
book to conduct forty-five printing establishments in forty: 
States, and no publisher of a copyrighted book is going to pe 
some other publishing house to do his printing. 
If the State should employ authors to write text-books for 
Texas public schools, it would be well enough to have such b 
printed in Texas, but copyrighted books owned by outside 
lishers can not by legislative enactment be printed within| 
State. The Legislature might say that unless such book be pr: 
in Texas its use will not be permitted in the public schools. 
that would deprive the children of the benefit of the best bj 
The point the Post wishes to make is that the Legislature s 
not tamper with a question so full of menace to the welfare 
public school system. The idea is impractical.

3. Foolish Textbook Legislation 
[From the Dial of November 1, 1909, pp. 319-320.] 
That public education is the function of the State rather than of 
the municipality is a principle that we have always maintained. 
The State is bound to see to it that throughout its area the means 
f education are provided upon as ample a scale as the general pros- 
erity of the commonwealth makes advisable. The parsimony of 
particular locality must not be permitted to keep its schools 
elow the generally accepted standard, and the locality which would 
d it a real hardship to provide the needed support is entitled 
io assistance at the expense of the more favored communities. 
m the other hand, the essentials being secured by law, the business 
ff administration is distinctly a local affair, and it is in the last 
legree unwise for the State to prescribe matters of detail, or to 
terfere in questions that call for expert educational knowledge. 
Ihe average legislature is about as well fitted to handle such 
licate questions as it would be to regulate the circulation of books 
public libraries or the scientific management of hospitals. 
If we try to imagine the law of the State declaring that no library 
all pay more than a dollar a volume for any of its books, or that 
le patients in every hospital shall be given fixed doses of certain 
cified drugs once a week, we shall have an exact parallel to the 
t of educational legislation which is imposed with blithe and 
f-satisfied ignorance upon the hapless schools of many a town 
city throughout this country. Through the efforts of well- 
aning people, whose judgment is as faulty as their inten- 
s are good, a considerable number of our states have long 
n burdened with laws imposing upon their schools a cast- 
requirement concerning the teaching of physiology with 
rence to the use of alcohol and tobacco. The mischievous 
nuity of these laws is almost beyond belief. They demand 
certain dogmas be enforced upon children with the most 
nable iteration year after year, — dogmas that even a child’s 
rience knows to be unsound; and they make it almost impos- 
for textbooks of physiology written in scientific language to 
sed in the public schools. Men of science are practically 
imous in condemning these requirements, but the fanatics and 
rinaires have their way with the legislatures, and the voice 
ason avails for nothing. Thus science is discredited, the 
er of insincerity affects the teacher’s work, the reasonable 
nition against the evils of intemperance misses its opportunity 
ether.

562 ENVIRONMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
The Illinois legislature at its last session distinguished itself 
by imposing two singularly foolish laws upon the public schools 
of the State. One of these laws fixes a maximum price for every. 
textbook used in the elementary schools; that is, forbids the au- 
thorization of any textbook that the publishers do not offer to 
supply at or below the price thus specified. The other law impose: 
upon all teachers in the State the obligation to devote a certai 
amount of time each week to the inculcation of ideas concerning th 
humane treatment of the lower animals. 
Considering now the first of these amazing prescriptions, it i 
to be noted that the prices fixed are far below those at which th 
best books are obtainable. There is no reason to believe that th 
best books will be offered at the specified prices, for the simpl 
reason that competition has already forced their prices to about 
low a level as possible. Despite the “book trust” bogey th 
obsesses many minds, competition among schoolbook publisher 
has already made unreasonable prices a practical impossibilit; 
and the margin of practicable reduction is a narrow one in mo! 
cases. The only possible effect of the new law must then be 
force the substitution of distinctly inferior books for many 
those hitherto in use. Now to save the child a few cents in t 
price of one of his school books is as good an example of a penn, 
wise and pound-foolish policy as could well be imagined. It ru 
counter to the elementary truism that a textbook is a tool, 
instrument of precision, and that it has to be employed in one 
the most delicate of the arts. A teacher who does not have 
use of the best book available is like a railway engineer furnis| 
with a cheap watch, a meteorological expert with a cheap barome' 
or a violinist with a cheap fiddle. In these cases, the use of 
inferior implement would be universally recognized as an inc 
ceivable folly; but in the case of the teacher, there seems to e} 
in many minds a notion that the implements he uses do not gre 
matter. The making of textbooks is now comparable in re 
ment, in the nice fitting of means to ends, with the makin; 
microscopes and chronometers, and the best of them would] 
cheap at almost any price. The injury done to education 
debarring the best books from use is immeasurably greater 
the benefit derived from the trifling economy that is thus effe

CoMMITTEE 
[Made to the General Assembly of Georgia, 1914.] 
To the Members of the General Assembly of Georgia: 
GENTLEMEN: The following resolution, known as House Res- 
lution No. 17, was approved August 18, 1913: 
“ Wuergas, The contract for school books for the public schools 
f Georgia expires this year, and, 
“ Wuereas, It appears that the present prices paid for school 
ooks are exorbitant when compared to the prices of other school 
ooks, 5 
“Be it resolved therefore by the House of Representatives, 
lhe Senate concurring, That a joint committee of eight, composed 
ff the State Superintendent of Schools and two other members 
ff the State Board of Education, in addition to said Superin- 
ndent, to be selected by said Board, who, together with two 
embers of the Senate, appointed by the President of the Sen- 
e, and three members of the House, appointed by the Speaker 
the House, shall be a committee to inquire into and report 
soon as practicable on the reasonableness of the present price 
school books, and inquire into the prices of books used else- 
ere, and also as to the practicability of the State furnishing 
ool books for use in the public schools at cost of publication, 
d to make all investigation that may be necessary touching 
on the furnishing of all books used in the Common and High 
ools receiving State aid at cost of publication, and delivery 
the same. 
‘ Be it further resolved, That said Committee is hereby clothed 
h authority to subpoena witnesses, to take evidence, to employ 
ttenographer, and compel the production of documents and do 
h other acts as are necessary for this investigation. 
Be it further resolved, That said Committee shall make a 
lort of its investigation, together with the testimony thereof, 
the present session of the General Assembly, provided the 
stigation shall be concluded in time to render such report 
he present session of the General Assembly. If the report, 
ther with the testimony thereof, be not rendered to the pres- 
session of the General Assembly, then such report, together 
the testimony thereof, shall be made at the next regular 
ion of the General Assembly. . . .

   to inquire into the present prices of school books used elsewhere, 
the practicability of the State furnishing school books used in the 
public schools at cost of publication, and have endeavored to 
secure all information possible concerning the furnishing of books 
used in the Common and High Schools of the State at cost of 
publication and delivery. The minutes of these various meetings, 
together with all books, pamphlets and correspondence are on file 
at the State Department of Education, and this material is acces- 
sible at any and all times to any member of the General Assembly 
who may desire to inspect the original documents. 
COMPARATIVE PRICES 
One of the first duties placed upon the Committee was to repor 
upon the prices of books used elsewhere in order to be able t 
make comparison with the prices paid in Georgia. With thi 
end in view, letters were written to all of the States of the Unio: 
and countries abroad in addition. The statement having bee 
circulated that “ most of the leading countries of Europe publis 
their own books and deposit them where the users can secure the! 
at the least expense,” the United States Bureau of Education w 
consulted. In a letter dated April 14, 1914, Professor Smith, t 
specialist in Foreign Educational Systems, writes, ‘‘ In Europe: 
Countries, in general, text books are prepared by professo 
teachers, and others engaged in the work of education and a 
placed on the market by publishing houses practically in the sai 
way as in this country.” Comparison as to prices could not, 
made in some of the States by reason of the fact that in them fi 
liberty as to adoption and purchase is given to local authoriti 
and parents. Conditions have, however, enough similar 
to our own in 21 other States to enable us to tell as to whet 
or not we pay extravagant prices for our school books. Th 
use practically our texts for the required basal books in the e 
mon schools and where the number varies this fact is indicat 
(Here follows a detailed statement as to books and costs for 
states.) 
* * * * * * * 
The foregoing evidence clearly proves that, in compari 
with the other States like situated, our people do not pay 
travagant prices for these books. It appears, for instance, 
every neighboring southern State pays more than Georgia 
these texts; so far then as concerns the prices recently sec 
by the Georgia State Textbook Commission it is evident that

     not only are not extravagant but are more economical than those 
secured by other Boards using the plan of uniform State adop- 
tion. 
ANNUAL EXPENSE OF BOOKS 
Perhaps, also, it is due the General Assembly to give the results 
of our effort to find, approximately at least, about the amount 
of money expended for school books in this State, especially since 
many widely divergent estimates and statements on this subject 
ave been given to the public. So far as the elementary schools 
re concerned the sworn figures of the dealers are to the effect 
hat the total sales for the regular adopted texts during the past 
en years are a little less than $150,000 annually. Some effort 
as been made to check these figures and there were selected for 
his purpose the counties of Habersham, Schley, and Early and the 
igures given appear to corroborate the previous conclusion. Not 
mly so, but testimony has been secured from the country as a 
hole, other states, and cities at this point. The report of the 
nited States, Commissioner of Education shows twenty mil- 
ms of pupils in the schools of this country and the total expen- 
ture of not quite seven million dollars for school books (Volume 
, 1912, page 17), thus confirming the Georgia figures. In Penn- 
lvania, for instance, the books are bought by Boards of Edu- 
tion and furnished free to the children; the law there requires 
der such circumstances, a complete report of the cost of the 
oks thus furnished. Since the books are free any variation would 
turally be that more books would be used and the expenditure 
uld be correspondingly greater in Pennsylvania than in Georgia, 
say nothing of the fact that the former state is larger and has 
re per capita wealth. State Superintendent, N. C. Schaeffer, 
es the enrollment of pupils in Pennsylvania, for the year end- 
June 30, 1913, as 1,343,055 and the cost of text books for 
se pupils as $1,157,930.27. The average cost per pupil in that 
te is, therefore, 86.2 cents; note also that the Pennsylvania 
requires free books furnished for high schools and normal 
ols. High school books are always more expensive. It is 
Inly true, therefore, that the cost of books for the elementary 
es in Pennsylvania as well as Georgia would be much less than 
ents per capita each year. Furthermore, another proof as 
lhe cost comes from our own State. The City of Fitzgerald 
for some years been furnishing the text books free to the 
lls. Superintendent Ritchie writes that the cost for that city 
913 was less than 74 cents per capita, and regretfully we know 
it is much less than this on the average for the country child,

   just as indicated by the figures noted above by the dealers. The 
City Boards of Education are always more insistent upon a liberal 
supply of books and other educational material for their pupils 
—some, perhaps, with not enough attention to economy. It is 
true, however, that there is much loss to the child from error in 
the opposite direction and that the argument is decidedly in 
favor of taking into consideration the value of his time and the 
necessity for furnishing him with proper tools with which to 
work. It is poor reasoning to prefer a saving of 5 cents on an 
inferior text book on which a child must spend 6 months of time 
to a better one even at a greater cost. 
STATE PUBLICATION BY THE CALIFORNIA PLAN 
Of the 48 States in this country, 46 use either the Georgia plan! 
authorize the purchase by Boards of Education, or else do no’ 
interfere at all in the purchase and supply of text books. Tw 
however, Kansas recently, and California for 30 years past, hay 
undertaken to establish plants and to print books used by th 
State. In the message of Governor W. Y. Atkinson, of Georgi 
to the General Assembly in 1897, giving the report of the Scho 
Book Commission at that time, the following occurs: 
“ California is the only State that has undertaken to publi 
its own books. The experiment has cost the State, according 
the late report of the Secretary of State, something like $1,700, 
Deducting the estimated value of the manufacturing plant, ma 
tial on hand, plates or books which have been condemned as ed 
cationally worthless, and the stock on hand of the same bool 
finished and unfinished, all being valued in the report at $348,7 
we find the net cost to the State of the school book enterprise 
been $1,351,299; so that the interest on the $1,351,299 inves 
at six per cent would furnish books practically free to all the ¢ 
dren of California.” 
Since this date, after much trouble, conditions have been 
nounced more favorable and the expense of publishing and 
tributing these State made books has been lessened. It se 
beyond doubt, however, that during the years during which C| 
fornia has been manufacturing her own school books that 
following may be fairly stated as the result: 1. The cost to 
parent of the books made by California, all things conside 
has not been upon an average, cheaper than the Georgia tej 
2. It is only just to state that there has always been consij 
able question, expressed sometimes even by the California pe 
themselves, as to the quality of their books; 3. It is beyond d

true that these California texts are inferior from the standpoint 
f paper, print, and binding — this fact is apparent even to the 
areless observer. That we might have the benefit of professional 
skill at this point, however, at some considerable difficulty, there 
lhas been secured a number of these books. They were submitted 
to the State Printer, Mr. Chas. P. Byrd, and he was asked to give 
is opinion of these texts from the mechanical side. His letter 
peaks for itself : 
; Atlanta, Ga., April 2, 1914. Complying with your request, I have examined the books printed 
y the State of California and those furnished under your adoption. 
find the California books are decidedly inferior as to the material 
ind construction, and the matter is one of contrast rather than of 
mparison. = : 
My information is that the State of California has appropriated over 
million dollars on a plant to do this work, which in my opinion is 
ore than is necessary for such an equipment. The only solution to 
e problem is the fact that it takes more than a printing office to pro- 
ce satisfactory school books. Experience in handling this partic- 
lar class of work is an essential element which appears to have been 
king in the California books. 
This answers your inquiry in a general way; if you wish me to be 
ecific in the matter, covering in detail the difference between the 
oks submitted, I will do so. 
Trusting this will meet your requirements, I am,

t may be added that these books are in the State Depart- 
nt of Education, where members of the General Assembly may 
them at any time. 
ven now, with all the experience of that State and with the 
t efforts of the most successful State Printer they have ever 
re secured, the basal books for the public schools do not seem 
e able to be placed in the hands of the children of California 
h cheaper than with us, to say nothing whatever of the salaries

waste of unsatisfactory books which have been made and

     to enlarge an already established printing office for the publi. 
cation of school books. The first book to be published is a Primer 
and $2,000 was paid to the author for the manuscript, whic! 
the Text Book Commission purchased as the official Primer t 
be used in the schools of the State during the next five years, 
In addition to this, illustrations for the text will cost approxi. 
mately $2,500. The second text selected was a history, or a 
the Kansas City Journal terms it, “A Historical Novel,” foi 
the manuscript of which $3,000 was paid to the author, and $5! 
additional to other persons for revision. The Teachers’ Asso} 
ciation of Kansas has requested that the School Book Commi 
sion discontinue its work, temporarily at least, until the Legi: 
lature shall have assembled again for the reconsideration of t! 
question. One of the school officials of that -State writes 
follows: “It seems reasonable to believe that a publishing co 
cern whose principal business is the selection and publication 
books is better prepared to handle the business more successfull 
than a State which has so many other matters of importance 
deal with.” It will be seen, therefore, that from the situati 
in this State, it is difficult to secure much argument, as yet 
least, to authorize the creation of a printing plant and the p 
lication of school books by the State. 
THE ONTARIO PLAN 
More frequently than any other, however, what is known 
the Ontario plan has been advanced as the best and most e¢| 
nomical for this State. Its history is interesting. The Ca) 
dians found that there was a tendency on the part of their teach 
and parents to use the books published by their great neighl 
the United States. The subject attracted attention, more t 
60 years ago. 
It was clear that these books were fostering our ideas of lib 
and even causing rebellious sentiment against British rule. 
counteract this, books had to be made by Canadians or, at | 
by English subjects. They began first with the Irish Nati 
Series and naturally the present forced use of British and 
nadian texts, no matter how inferior to those published by 
United States, has followed. In 1868 and in 1894 the con 
for readers, for instance, was given to Canadian Publishing 
panies. The Whitney Government in 1907, stating that 
Ontario text books were inferior to those of similar grade i 
country, authorized the Minister of Education to secure an 
with power to have texts prepared, electroplates made and

   ‘inted by contract. The department store of T. Eaton Com- 
ny, Limited, which has a printing plant for its large mail order 
siness, was the lowest bidder. The offer was to furnish the 
imer and the first four Readers at a total cost of 49 cents. With- 
t saying anything as to the quality of these books, although edu- 
tional experts have been practically a unit in pronouncing them 
ferior to our own texts, it is a fact easily ascertained that they 
e able to be sold at so low a price because of two reasons: first, 
part of the expense is borne by the Government and second, 
other part by the department store for the sake of the adver- 
ing. 
The same thing is true with regard to certain others of the 
tario books, particularly the arithmetic furnished by the Rob- 
+ Simpson Company, Limited. Some of the books, however, 
e printed by regular publishing companies and undoubtedly 
ith little, if any, help from the advertising idea already men- 
ned. 
[Here follow a number of letters and replies, and a summary of 
ts under the Ontario plan.]

t will naturally occur to any thoughtful mind as strange that 
Ontario System was not adopted by New York and Ohio if 
vere so far superior to our own as is frequently asserted. The 
teen million inhabitants of these two of our most progressive 
thern States are not generally suspected of being willing to 
more for school books or anything else than might be neces- 
and reasonable. The impression is somewhat more than a 
icion, and indeed is quite general, that these are the most 
te and economical business men we have in the country. 
ly are separated only by the St. Lawrence River and Lake 
from Ontario; trains and boats cross from one side to the 
r every hour and there is continuous communication. This 
been going on during all these years while Ontario has been 
ng her own school books, and what these near neighbors and 
trymen of ours have never even thought worthy of imitation 
sideration, is not likely to be so wonderfully to the advantage

    ordinary observer as clearly inferior to the United States tex 
and all the experts to whom they have been submitted, with o 
exception, agree that this is true with regard to the workma 
ship and material used. 
SUMMARY 
Summarizing for your convenience, therefore, our answe 
to the questions which we were asked by you to secure are 
follows: 
First. Compared with the prices paid for similar books 
other States in this country, the cost in Georgia is not only re 
sonable but actually considerably less than the average paid i 
the other forty-seven commonwealths of this Union. 
Seconp. The California plan, which involves the purcha: 
and equipment of a printing plant, managed by State officials, f 
the purpose of printing State school books, does not appear 
be desirable for Georgia. 
Six members agree to the foregoing: 
M. L. Brittain, 
J. T. Peyton, 
H. C. Sauprrine, 
W. J. NUNNALLY, 
G. R. GLENN, 
T. J. Woorrer. 
Five members of the Committee namely, Messrs. J. T. Peyt 
H. C. Shuptrine, W. J. Nunnally, G. R. Glenn, and T. J. Woof 
sign the following as the third and closing recommendation : 
Tuirp. We would not recommend the publication of 
school texts by the Ontario plan. (Chairman M. L. Brit 
believes that the Ontario plan is worth a trial.) 
One member of the Committee, due to illness, did not par 
pate in its findings, and one member dissented from the e 
report.

secure a supply of trained teachers by utilizing the high 
hools.

‘ow great a part personal and institutional ambition has played 
the development of educational politics it would be difficult to 
, but the results of it can be seen in every state where the 
ided institution exists. These appear usually in two forms: 
it, the endeavor of each institution to cover the whole field of 
cation and the consequent duplications which ensue; secondly, 
widespread tendency to drop the legitimate work for which 
institution was founded in order to take up some other work, 
ich appeals to the ambitions of its president, or of its board of 
tees, or of its faculty or alumni. 
xamples of the first sort have just been alluded to. Other 
ples in the educational history of Iowa, Colorado, Michigan, 
various other states will readily occur to the reader. 
here three or four state institutions exist, this rivalry has 
itably led to much commerce with the legislature, to over- 
ing institutions, and in nearly all cases to a strenuous struggle 
itudents. The three-cornered rivalry between the, university, 
gricultural and mechanical college, and the normal school in 
ates like Iowa and Kansas are typical instances of the results 
h a régime. 
ingular outcome of this situation in recent years has been the 
of the normal school in many states to transform itself into 
college. The normal school is at best a singular institu-

   tion, seldom related logically to the educational system of“ 
state. (Its weakness from the educational point of view lies in» 
fact that it undertakes to make a teacher of a man or woman whit 
education is so limited as to afford slender basis for a teac! 
training.) From the time of Horace Mann, however, it has be 
the agericy upon which our states have come more and more 
depend for the. training of teachers for the elementary school 
and particularly for the rural elementary schools, since the larg 
cities have in many cases provided agencies to train teachers f 
their own schools. Notwithstanding its educational isolatio 
some such agency as the normal school seems necessary at t 
present stage of our educational organization, and probably w: 
be necessary for many years to come. When one considers th 
in many of the middle western states not more than ten per cel 
of all the public school teachers have had the equivalent of a hi 
school education, one realizes that in order to obtain the nece| 
sary teachers for the common schools of the country, some agent 
must for a long time prepare a large number as best it may. O} 
may well hope that the low standards of training for rural teach 
now in use in many states may be raised, and that the necess 
number of teachers may be forthcoming at a continually hig 
level, and that school teachers may soon be themselves fai 
educated men and women. In any case the function of the nor 
school in our present situation is definite, clear, and of imme! 
importance. (Tt is therefore little less than astounding to 
normal schodls in so many states ready to turn aside from 
definite and important work, in the effort to transform themsel 
into weak colleges, and this, too, in states where the numbe 
such colleges is already larger than the ability of the populatioi 
sustain This movement has arisen in some cases out of 
ambitions of the heads of these institutions and of their facul 
who somehow have the mistaken feeling that the work of 
college is more honorable and more desirable. In some cas 
has been undertaken with the honest belief that the two ins 
tions, college and normal school, would grow side by side, a r 
which would: be against all our educational experience; but 
whatever motive undertaken, it has inevitably involved 
schools in politics. 
An illustration of such legislation is found in the measure p: 
by the last session of the Wisconsin legislature to the foll 
effect: “The Board of Normal School regents may exten 
course of instruction in any normal school so that any cours 
admission to which is based upon graduation from an accr 
high school or its equivalent, may include the substantial

    nt of the instruction given in the first two years of a college 
use. Such course of instruction shall not be extended further 
.an the substantial equivalent of the instruction given in such 
Pollege course without the consent of the legislature.” 
This language is capable of at least two interpretations. It 
might mean the extension of the normal school course for two years 
long normal school and pedagogical lines equivalent in intellec- 
ual demand to the corresponding years in college, thereby train- 
ng a better teacher, or it might mean the superimposing on the 
ormal school of two years of ordinary college work. Apparently 
oth of these ideas were in the minds of those interested in the 
gislation. As a matter of fact, however, the normal schools 
ave immediately translated this legislation into the authority for 
tablishing the first two years of an arts college. 
It requires no prophet to see whither this movement leads. 
nder the arrangement college students and normal school students 
e in the same classes. It will not be long before there is an at- 
pt to so extend the curriculum that the equivalent of four 
lege years will be given. (Already the normal schools are in- 
ducing technical studies and asking for credit for the first half 
curricula in agriculture and engineering) There are 
sin eight state normal schools, and more are in prospect. This 
nt méans-the transfortiation-of-these schools from insti- 
ions primarily designed for the training of teachers to colleges 
ying the ordinary college atmosphere with all the distractions 
ch differentiate the American college from the professional 
ol. It may be wise for these professional schools to be trans- 
ed into colleges, but if this is to be done, it should come only 
a fair and full discussion of the whole matter from the edu- 
mal point of view. There are those who contend that the 
sphere and spirit of the present day college can be success- 
grafted upon the professional school. Perhaps this is true, 
ugh the evidence would seem to be against it. The result of 
a mixture is likely to be an institution lacking the best qual- 
of both. But in any case, such legislation should not be 
ed until those responsible for it have had a full discussion of 
hole matter by men familiar with educational problems and 
re not directly interested in the problems either of the Wis- 
normal schools or the Wisconsin endowed colleges. Wis- 
has in many respects led the way among American com- 
ealths in the intelligent use of experts in the solution of leg- 
le problems. This question is one which ought not to be 
ited upon without the light of expert and unbiased educational 
lent. To legislate on such a technical question in the ab-

1. Report of the “ Finance Committee” to the State Board of Educatio 
[From the 2d Bien. Rept. Iowa State Bd. of Education, pp. 60-61. 
In the public mind, especially in Iowa, there is confusion as t 
the function of a normal school. By very general consent, sul 
stantiated by wide practice in the United States, the followii 
definition of a state normal school is accepted : 
“A state normal school is a professional school of seconda: 
grade established, maintained and administered by the state f 
the purpose of training teachers. It should be superimpos 
upon the high school and should require two years of acade 
and professional work in about equal proportion, its main pi 
pose being to develop scholarly habits, professional knowled; 
mental attitude and teaching power in the teachers of the elem 
tary schools.” 
The normal school, as a professional school, should be dit 
entiated from a department of education of a college or universij 
The function of the former is to train elementary school teac'! 
and of the lattey. to train secondary school teachers and scl 
administrators. ts normal school is not a high school or coll 
It is distinctly professional and cannot be substituted for the 
or the other), 
In the state of Iowa an excellent normal school has been di 
oped in the State Teachers College. In recent years a co 
department of education has also been fostered at this ins 
tion, resulting in duplication of similar work at the Unive 
This duplication, again, leads to extravagance and a loweri 
quality in the work. At the State Teachers College there are 
499 students registered in college work in education beyon 
sophomore year. At the University 290 are carrying si 
work. These students will presumably become high 
teachers and school administrators. 
At the Teachers College there are 1,645 students in true n 
courses, preparing to serve in elementary school work. 
At the present time there are employed in Iowa 16,000 te 
in the rural schools and elementary grades. About 5, 
teachers are needed annually in order to maintain this m
-P-A-G-E-599
  THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS 577 
Surely Iowa needs teachers professionally qualified for this work, 
teachers who see in a clear light the need of hitching our rural 
schools to rural life. In the secondary or high school field and 
in the field of school administration there are employed in the 
state about 4,000 teachers. About 300 new teachers are needed 
annually in order to maintain this number. If Iowa is to hold its 
wn in social rank with other states, these teachers must have 
college training as well as professional training in education. Al- 
eady many of the higher positions are open only to those who, 
n addition to a college course, have pursued a year or more of 
raduate study. In states where legislation has defined the way, 
s in California, college graduation is required of all secondary 
chool teachers; and this is the usual requirement to-day among 
‘ity school boards. 
Tn order now to supply the demand in Iowa for secondary school 
achers and school administrators, one of two courses is open to 
e Iowa State Board of Education. 
1. To develop a thorough college of liberal arts at the Teachers 
lege in connection with professional courses in education. Such 
velopment necessitates strong departments in the modern and 
cient languages, in philosophy, in psychology and in each of the 
ences. It necessitates extensive laboratories, and museums. 
. To centralize at the University all of the training of high school 
chers and of school administrators. 
easons for the latter course on the part of the Board are: 
irst. That a strong college of liberal arts already exists at 
University and must continue to exist at the University. 
annual cost of this work in salaries to professors and instruc- 
is $167,805. 
cond. That the facilities for professional training in educa- 
are thoroughly established at the University and by com- 
tively slight increase in expenditure would be adequate to 
ly the entire demand. 
ird. That advanced and graduate courses in the various 
1 arts subjects are established at the University, enrolling 
raduate students, most of whom expect to teach. To dupli- 
hese courses at the Teachers College would be futile extray- 
e. 
rth. That the most potent educational need in Iowa to- 
is a supply of properly trained teachers for the rural and 
mtary schools. To meet the demand in this field will more 
xhaust the present resources of the Teachers College. This 
‘tion should not only bend all of its energies to this mission, 
should encourage the establishment of several additional

institutions in other parts of the state to aid in the same service. 
There are in Iowa 16,000 teachers in the elementary field and to 
work out the problems in connection with their task is a century’s 
solid struggle. With this division of this field, the University 
would, in connection with the colleges of Iowa, work intensively 
upon the secondary problem. 
Fifth. That this general plan of coordination is in line with the) 
resolutions of the National Educational Association (Report of the 
Committee of Seventeen, 1907). It is approved also by Dr. Ken-| 
drick C, Babcock, Specialist in Higher Education in the Burea 
of Education at Washington; by Dean James E. Russell, of Teach: 
ers College, Columbia University, and by Dr. Henry 8. Pritchett, 
President of the Carnegie Foundation. 
Tn view of these considerations, we recommend that the functio 
of the Iowa State Teachers College be to train teachers for the rur: 
and elementary schools; and that all work in professional ed 
cational training and in liberal arts beyond the sophomore yea: 
or two years beyond a four-year high school course, be discontinu

The following letter from Dean Russell, setting forth 
conception of the relations that should exist between a st

training of teachers, sets forth in remarkably clear langu 
the fundamental principles involved, and is reproduced

My Dear Sir: 
In reply to your letter of the 16th instant, I beg to say thi 
one who is not intimately familiar with the local situation in 
is competent to judge on all the points submitted in your 
randum. I assume, however, that you are asking advice o 
more general problems in order that you may settle the s; 
ones in the way most agreeable to all concerned. My an 
{

therefore, have reference to the general policy applicable to any 
State, rather than to the adjustment which may best fit Iowa. 
1. The foundation of all our educational system is the elementary 
school. In most states the elementary school is rural. Every- 
where it is conceded that our rural schools are lamentably defi- 
cient, chiefly so because teachers are poorly trained and ill-equipped 
to give instruction that fits into farm life. We are slowly coming 
to realize that a rural school is bound to fail if it is run on the lines 
of the city elementary school. ‘he present situation is largely 
due to the fact that our normal schools have been working on city 
lines.) I say that without intending to criticize the normal schools. 
They have been obliged to meet the most pressing demands, and 
the call from the city has so far been the most insistent and remu- 
nerative. But I am convinced that from this time on rural teachers 
will be better paid and that those who are thoroughly fitted for 
ithe work will be in great demand. (In my judgment, therefore, 
he chief task of the normal school in the next generation will be 
o ascertain how to train teachers for rural schools, to educate 
ural communities to the point of demanding a suitable rural 
ducation and to elevate the professional position of the rural 
leacher.) All this is a great work — probably the greatest edu- 
ational work ever attempted in this country. It is the most 
teresting and inspiring task that has ever been proposed to any 
dy of educators. Any institution fortunate enough to be 
rmitted to enter upon it is to be congratulated. iii 
2. The training of teachers for high schools and of administra=- 
e officers should be superimposed upon a sound collegiate foun-— 
tion. It is useless to talk of professional training for persons 
0 do not have a good academic training. In fact, the ordinary 
lege course is insufficient. High school teachers need special- 
id information, in precisely the way that lawyers, engineers or 
mers need specialized information. The ordinary Arts course 
s not give that kind of training. Hence the criticism of those 
advocate normal school training as a corrective, and of those 
would remedy defects by a post-graduate course in academic 
ies. Both are right and both are wrong. What is wanted 
general education as broad and liberal as circumstances will 
it; next, specialization along the lines which the teacher 
follow; then training to develop technical skill in teaching. 
It needs no demonstration that the cheapest way for any 
to train its secondary teachers is in connection with the State 
ersity. Every department of such an institution is already 
ped to give the first steps in the preparation of the high school 
er. The diversity of interests in secondary education makes

imperative a wide range of studies. The necessary subjects can 
be given, of course, anywhere, but when a state needs only a 
few hundred teachers a year it is not good financial policy to du- 
plicate collegiate courses for a few when they must be given in a 
university for many. Moreover, it is no easy task to build up 
a thoroughly good Arts course even in one institution; to say 
nothing of the difficulty and indirect loss involved in trying to 
maintain two or more such courses under one general management. 
If the two were equally good the chances are that both would be 
inferior ; while with the funds expended upon two, one good school 
might be maintained. In other words, I regard the separation 
of the Arts work into two institutions as tending to lower the 
quality of both, or as increasing unduly the expense of what the 
state needs. 
4. '‘The chief criticism of the University as a training school fo 
teachers is that it restricts itself to the academic work and oppose: 
all professional interests.) We should have no law school, or medi: 
cal school, or engineering school, worthy of respect if these school: 
were relegated to the position of departments in a college and th 
administration vested in the typical college faculty. Profession: 
work presupposes specialized knowledge— mechanics as_ wel 
as physics, statute law as well as economics and ethics, patholog| 
as well as physiology. So the teacher needs to study every subjet 
in the light of its uses in the school-room and from the viewpoit 
of the school pupil. Next comes the practical application of 
knowledge in actual school work, as guided and determined 
sound educational theory and practice. Unless the University 
prepared to do for the teachers what it does for the engineer, t 
lawyer, and the physician, the training of teachers might bet 
be entrusted to the normal school — better a poor training al 
right lines, than something supposedly better directed a 
from the proper goal. tr believe that a School of Education shot 
be a part of every State University, that it should have charg 
the instruction in specialized academic courses and give the t 
retical and practical courses in secondary education and sc 
management, and that it should have access to a real school 
school system for the same reasons that a clinic and a hospital 
needed in connection with a medical school.)

   training of teachers for elementary schools} In order to 
expense, until the school becomes unduly large, I would 
both phases of elementary education (rural and urban) taug! 
the same institution, but there is enough difference in poi 
view and in spirit to warrant two distinct courses — one for

teachers, the other for teachers in city schools. Of course, there 
would be much overlapping, but in some way rural teachers must 
be made to feel that they are in no sense inferior to city teachers. 
The creation of a proper attitude of mind and the infusion of high 
ideals are quite as important in teacher training as anywhere else 
in the world — much more important, in fact, than in most other 
vocations and professions. Hence, I would do everything possible 
to exalt the work of the rural teacher, as compared with the teach- 
ing in city schools; and for similar reasons I would dignify the 
study of elementary education in general. Such a process is most 
difficult in a university atmosphere. Almost to the present day 
ollegiate conventions and traditions have succeeded in strangling 
he training of secondary teachers. In many universities the 
rocess is still going on, but it can be overcome, and the university 
sociation can be made a source of strength in the training of sec- 
mdary teachers and school administrators. I doubt if it is pos- 
ble in the elementary field. Fortunately, the great number of 
achers needed annually in elementary schools makes it quite 
economical to segregate them in a special institution. Hence, 
separate normal school. 
6. So far as the situation in Iowa is concerned, I think the 
rmal school has been fully justified in training secondary teachers, 
tt my opinion is based on the wretchedly poor Ge mo given to 
     
    
       
    
      
    
     
         
      
      
    department of education in the University. @he moment the 
‘iversity is prepared to treat secondary educatton as it treats 
er professional work, that moment the normal school can go 
r body and soul to the greater task of meeting the needs of the 
e in elementary education.) The elementary field, including 
1 education, offers incompfrably the greater and more inspir- 
work, but it will need all the ingenuity and self-sacrifice of the 
al school faculty, coupled with the strongest support that 
board can give, to educate the state to a realization of its 
ndence upon the elementary teacher (rural as well as urban) 
the conveyance to the people of that culture and scientific knowl- 
which the University and the Agricultural College are designed 
ord. 
ealize that this is a long letter; perhaps too long to be of any 
io you, but I am greatly interested in what you are doing, and 
gladly be of some service to you. According to my present

Both Kansas and Nebraska have done very remarkable work 
in the development of high school training classes as a mean: 
for securing a supply of trained teachers for the rural school:

The correlation of the industrial work with that of training 
teachers is a marked point of merit in the Kansas plan. I

    Hon. E. T. Fairchild, State Superintendent of Public Instructi 
Topeka, Kan. : 
Dear Str — In the line of my duty, I beg to submit the follo 
ing report of normal and industrial training in high schools for 
biennium 1911~13. For the sake of comparison, I have al 
deemed it advisable briefly to review the history of normal w 
in Kansas high schools from its inception. 
Since 1886 there have been a few high schools in the state aut 
ized to offer normal-training courses and to grant graduates fr] 
such courses a two-year county teacher’s certificate; but t 
schools never exceeded twenty-three in number, were widely s 
tered, and benefited only their own immediate localities. 
Realizing the need for better schools, particularly better r 
schools, and recognizing that the first requisite for better sc 
is better trained teachers, the Kansas Educational Commi: 
of 1908 recommended the enactment of a law providing f 
normal-training course in at least one high school in practi 
every county in the state. In pursuance of this recommend: 
the legislature passed the normal-training act, which be 
operative May 29, 1909. By the provisions of this act, the 
Board of Education was empowered to prescribe regul 
under which accredited high schools might offer a course in n 
training for prospective teachers. To further the work $5
-P-A-G-E-605

per year were appropriated for the biennium. This money was 
to be used only for the payment of additional teaching force, 
and was to be apportioned by the State Board of Education 
to deserving schools in such a way as best to serve the school 
interests of the entire state, provided that the amount apportioned 
to any one county was in no case to exceed one thousand dollars: 
The law further provided that to be eligible to participate in the 
fund a school must have at least ten students each semester in 
egular attendance upon the normal-training course. At the com- 
letion of their course these students should be given an exami- 
ation by the State Board of Education, and upon passing such 
xamination should receive a normal-training teacher’s certificate, 
ood in the public schools of any county in the state for a period 
f two years, and to be indefinitely renewable for two years at a 
ime upon conditions fixed by the Board. Accredited academies 
ight receive all the privileges and benefits of the act except that 
state aid. 
The more important regulations as first prescribed by the State 
ard of Education for the conduct of normal-training classes 
re: 
‘he distinctively normal-training work should be given only in 
senior year of a four years’ high-school course, and only seniors 
postgraduates should be permitted to take it. This work was 
consist of one-half year in psychology, one-half year in methods 
management, a year in American history and a review of 
hmetic, geography, grammar and readingX A pedagogical 
rence library consisting of not fewer than thirty volumes was 
lbe provided by each school. All teachers teaching normal- 
ing classes were required to be graduates of accredited col- 
or state normal schools, to have had at least two years’ 
ing experience, and to be approved for the work in question 
he state superintendent of public instruction. Observation 
-were made a regular part of the normal-training course, and 
visits were to be made once a week, or at least often enough 
at the class should make at least one visit to each grade in 
each subject was taught. 
will be observed, the normal-training work was originally 
ed to the senior year. This was done in order that existing 
chool courses might be disturbed as little as possible. But 
’s experience with the work as first outlined, together with 
pular demand for its extension, led the State Board to pro- 
at, beginning with the school year 1911—12, one-half year of 
ic physiology, one-half year of civics and one-half year of 
logy should be required of all normal-training students

in the junior year, together with sufficient other work from any 
regular high-school course to make the necessary four units; and 
that after that date the work in the senior year should consist of 
a year of American history, a year of physics, one-half year of 
methods and management, and a review of one-half year in arith- 
metic and of twelve weeks each in geography, grammar and read- 
ing, the reviews to be presented with special reference to methods 
of teaching. With the exception of this extension of time, the 
provisions and regulations as first adopted are still in effect and 
have proved eminently satisfactory. 
For the year 1909-10 the normal-training course was institute 
in 110 high schools and academies; of the 105 counties in thi 
state, every one in which there was a school able and willing t 
meet the requirements was represented in the list — 78 in all. L 
these schools 721 seniors and postgraduates completed the normal 
training work and took the prescribed examination. Of this nu 
ber 615 were successful and received the state-wide renewab 
normal-training teacher’s certificate. 
For the year 191011, 125 schools, representing 80 counti 
were approved in accordance with the provisions of the nofm: 
training act. In these schools 946 seniors and postgraduates co: 
pleted the course and wrote upon the examination; of this num 
704 were successful. 
During the year 191112 the normal-training course was offer 
according to the regulations, in 160 schools, representing 90 co 
ties. In these schools 1256 applicants took the examination, 
of these 1125 secured certificates. 
For the year 1912~13, 189 high schools and academies loca 
in 92 different counties of the state are offering the normal-trai 
work, and have an enrollment in the normal-training classe: 
more than 2500 junior, senior and postgraduate students. 
That the normal-training movement is rapidly accomplis! 
‘the purpose for which it was instituted and is furnishing b: 
prepared teachers in increasing numbers for our common sc! 
is clearly demonstrated by the following figures: Your bie 
report for 1910-11 shows that there were then 7873 teas 
employed in the rural schools of the state. Of this numbe 
197 had a normal-school training or its equivalent; 2379 
high-school graduates, and 1639 had attended high school 
year or more, while 3658 had only such training as could 
tained in the common schools. Elsewhere in this volum 
shown that there are now 7842 rural teachers employed 
state. Of this number 238 are graduates of colleges or 
schools, 2980 are high-school graduates and 1654 have at

igh school one year or more, leaving but 2970 with only a common- 
school training. 
Indeed, the normal-training act, in conjunction with the recent 
egislation requiring a graduated increase in the preparation for 
aching, means that within a decade no teacher will be teaching, 
‘ven in the rural schools of Kansas, who has not had at least 
. full four years’ high school course, including specific work in nor- 
nal training. 
Graduates of the state normal schools are almost always able 
0 secure grade- and high-school positions, and. consequently 
arely go into the country schools, nor would the establishment 
f additional state normal schools greatly improve conditions in 
his respect, because students would not feel that they could go 
the expense of leaving home and taking a four years’ course in 
der to prepare themselves to become country teachers. But 
e fact that under the normal-training act they can get a year’s 
ofessional training in the local high-school course, and at the 
id of it secure a state-wide certificate good indefinitely if suecess- 
ly used, is serving at once to induce more young people to enter 
h school with the intention of becoming teachers and to hold 
re of those entering school until the course is completed. 
oreover, this new course has given the high school itself a 
her place in the esteem of the people, because it serves in part

gain, the introduction of the normal-training course has had 
lost salutary effect upon the entire school life of the communities 
erned. It is the common observation of superintendents that 
interest in school work is stimulated by the very immediate 
definite end which the normal-training young people have in 
, and that this feeling reaches and influences students not 
g the normal work. The study of psychology, methods and 
gement gives a new view to school problems and school 
sibilities, and this awakening has had a marked effect on 
ttitude of the whole school toward matters of discipline and 
istration. Then, too, the observation work has not only 
ly benefited the prospective teachers but by reacting upon 
ork of the teachers visited has also resulted in infusing new 
d energy into the work of the grades. ,In view of all these 
therefore, I believe that the legislature could not spend the 
money more wisely than by adding at least $5000 a year

next biennium, to the end that additional schools might be ap 
proved. 
Actuated by the growing demand for industrial work in ou 
schools, and influenced by the success of the normal-training move 
ment, the legislature of 1911 appropriated $25,000 per year for th 
biennium to encourage the introduction of courses in agricultur 
and home economics in schools already recognized under the nor 
mal-training act. The terms of the appropriation provided tha 
schools approved for the normal-training course might also receiv 
$250 each for offering courses in agriculture and home economics 
under such regulations as the State Board of Education migh 
prescribe, provided that no school should receive the benefits o 
the act unless it had at least ten pupils enrolled in the industria 
courses each semester. In conformity with this legislation, th 
State Board of Education adopted the following regulations : 
1. The amount of work in agriculture required shall be o 
year; agriculture being defined as follows: A study of soils, a: 
farm, garden and orchard crops; or a study of soils, farm, gard 
and orchard crops and animal husbandry. Laboratory work sh 
require two double periods per week. 
2. The amount of household economics required shall be oj 
year, and may consist of a year of cooking, or a year of cooki 
and sewing combined. In the event cooking and sewing are co 
bined, three days out of the week shall be devoted to cooking 
two days to sewing, laboratory work requiring double periods. 
3. The ten pledgers to the industrial work required by law 
be divided in any proportion between agriculture and house! 
economics, but classes in both subjects must be maintaine 
entitle a school to the state aid. 
4. Teachers in either of these courses must satisfy the 5 
Board of Education of their fitness to teach the subjects, an 
approval of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
be required in every case. General-science teachers may b 
proved to teach the agriculture if their preparation seems 
cient; but a year’s special training for the work in some recog! 
industrial school is the minimum requirement for teache 
household economics. 
For 1911-12, 90 high schools qualified under the ind 
training act and enrolled 3031 students in their classes in a; 
ture and home economics. For 1912—’13, 96 schools have| 
approved and are offering these very popular and practic:

  588 que STATE AND THE TEACHER 
The greatest difficulty has been to secure teachers of agriculture 
who combined general scientific knowledge with practical agricul- 
tural training. But now that the need for such training is be- 
coming manifest, more teachers will seek specially to prepare them- 
selves for the work, and with the increased emphasis that is being 
placed upon agricultural education by our higher institutions, the 
means for such preparation will manifestly become constantly} 
easier. I would therefore recommend that at the earliest feasible 
moment the requirements for teachers of agriculture in the recog- 
nized schools be both increased and made more specific. 
The work in cooking and sewing has in every instance been done 
by specially trained teachers. These teachers have not only know: 
their subject matter, but almost without exception have been abl 
to present it effectively and to conduct the classes in general i 
a most acceptable and satisfactory manner. 
In view of the excellent results obtained from this industri 
work, and because of the need and desire for its extension to othe] 
schools, I would respectfully suggest that the nest legislature bj 
asked to increase the appropriation $5000 per annum for the co 
ing biennium.

wenty-five years of good work, however, there are fewer than 350 
inthrop graduates now teaching in South Carolina. This is 
ess than half the present student body. The explanation is easy. 
‘he average Winthrop graduate marries before she has spent as 
uch time in the schools as she spent in the college walls. Her 
aining course is by no means wasted, but this fact does not sim- 
lify the problem of those who are endeavoring to find trained 
eachers for the country schools of the State. The same is true 
f the graduates of other colleges... . Most of our country 
teachers are at best high school graduates, and we must meet the 
ondition which actually presents itself. If they are to have any 
special preparation for teaching it must be given in connection 
ith the high school. In my opinion the situation imperatively 
mands a short training course for rural teachers in connection with 
elected four-year high schools of the State. In proportion to the 
penditure, this would give the largest immediate returns for the 
untry schools.

The average teaching life of a South Carolina teacher is four 
ars. We cannot afford to let her spend even one year of this 
e in painful groping or hopeless inefficiency. It may be urged 
at a teacher should complete a college course before taking up 
fessional work. This may be true, but we must remember that 
are dealing with conditions and not with theories. As long as 
ir country schools are taught by people who have had only a high 
ool training or less, it is nonsense to argue that preparation should 
delayed till the completion of a college course. If our country 
s and girls are to have satisfactory educational opportunities, 
ething must be done. At present, because of lack of prepara- 
, most of our country boys and girls are debarred from college 
larships, and consequently many who because of their country 
lerience would make good rural teachers have no opportunity 
preparation. A girl reared in the city cannot enter into full 
pathy with country conditions, and is naturally not inclined 
ibmit to the inconveniences which fall to the lot of the country 
her. The result tends to perpetuate and accentuate differ- 
which are already too great. The high school training course 
give a measure of relief.

   I. Tue Licenstne or Teacuers In INDIANA 
[From Rawles, W. A., The Centralization of Administration 
Indiana, pp. 85-92.] 
From the first attempt to establish a school system, it was re 
nized in theory that some special test of the fitness of teac' 
should be required. The law of 1824 gave the sub-trustee 
the school district authority to employ a teacher, who was requ 
“to produce the certificate of the township trustees that 
have examined him touching his qualifications and particu 
as respects his knowledge of the English language [reading 
spelling], writing and arithmetic.” Althoygh this provision 
mandatory, the practical operations of the law could scarcel 
called a test. The officers who passed upon the qualificatio: 
teachers seldom had qualifications sufficient to apply the 
Incapacity to earn a living in any other way seemed often the 
recommendation of the teacher. State Superintendent 
Hobbs said: ‘“ The pioneer teachers were generally advent 
from the East or from England, Scotland or Ireland, who s 
590  
-P-A-G-E-613
  THE CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS 591 
temporary employment . . . or men unsuccessful in trade, or who 
were lame or otherwise disabled.” 
In 1833 it was provided that no teacher should be employed 
unless he should “ sustain a satisfactory examination before the 
district trustees, touching his ability to teach reading, writing and 
arithmetic.” An effort was made in 1834 to give to the examina- 
tion a more professional nature. The Circuit Court was given 
power to appoint annually for each county three examiners, whose 
duty it was “ to certify the branches of learning each applicant was 
qualified to teach.” Their authority was not final; for they were 
“ only an auxiliary to aid” the district trustees, who still possessed 
the right to examine the teachers. In other words, a teacher 
holding a certificate of qualification from the examiners might be 
refused employment if he had not been examined and approved 
yy the district trustees. A few years later trustees were forbidden 
o employ any teacher who did not hold a certificate granted by 
me of the examiners; but the district trustee enjoyed the privi- 
lege of subjecting the applicant to further inquiries, to ascertain 
hether or not he was of good moral character. The following 
ear it was made optional with the district trustees to require any 
acher asking for employment to procure a certificate from the 
hool examiners, stating the branches which he was qualified to 
ach. 
In spite of this reactionary provision, there was a growing 
mviction that the improvement of the schools was dependent 
on the elevation of the teacher’s calling to the rank of a pro- 
sion by requiring of him the possession of higher ability, more 
rough preparation and finer character. The personnel of the 
ching corps was gradually improving. However, it is not to 
supposed that in all sections the law was enforced with uniform- 
and impartiality. Often it was necessary to lower the stand- 
in order to secure any one who was willing to accept the meagre 
pensation offered. 
‘he law of 1843, designating the Treasurer of State ex officio 
erintendent of Common Schools, instituted no connection 
een that officer and the county examiners, and required 
eport from them. The lack of system and uniformity is well 
trated by the special laws for sixteen different counties, per- 
ling their boards of county commissioners to appoint one or 
persons in each civil township of their respective counties 
aminers of common school teachers. 
1847 the standard was raised somewhat by the requirement 
teachers should be qualified to teach orthography, reading, 
g, arithmetic, English grammar and geography; but the

last two requirements might be waived by a request of a majority 
of the voters at a district meeting. Four years later a still greater 
concession to the wishes of individual neighborhoods was given, 
by making it lawful for a majority of the voters at a school district 
meeting to dispense with such legal qualifications of school teachers 
as they might deem proper. 
In 1852 a decided step towards centralization was taken. The 
office of examiner was abolished and the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction was given power, either by himself or his deputy,! 
to examine all applicants for license and to grant certificates for 
one or two years. Such licenses could be revoked by him if the 
teachers should prove incompetent. No officer could employ a 
teacher who had not procured a license. The law did not require 
the deputy to use questions prepared by the State Superintendent, 
and but few deputies were appointed under this act. 
There is little doubt that this centralization of authority w: 
unpopular, for in the next year the office of county examiner 
was revived. The examiners were required to forward an annual 
report to the State Superintendent, showing the dates of issuanc 
and expiration of all licenses granted by them. ‘The terms varie 
from three to twenty-four months. The State Superintende 
still had authority to license teachers at his pleasure. As this la’ 
applied to all counties and districts without exception, it assur 
a greater degree of uniformity. At the same time, its flexibili 
made it adaptable to the needs of all communities and thus, in 
a measure, silenced objections. The purpose of having a graduat 
scale was to set a high standard of qualification at which all p 
sons proposing to teach should aim, and at the same time to provi 
for the existing emergencies, owing to the scarcity of teache 
by authorizing a short-term license to persons who might not 
able to pass a rigid examination. From the subsequent repo} 
of examiners, this seemed a wise and necessary expedient. 
The regulation of the issuing of teachers’ licenses was far fr 
satisfactory. A license granted in one county under a leni 
examiner was legal in any other county where a more exact 
test was required. There was no authority for the revocatio' 
a license issued by an examiner. There were serious charge 
partiality where private examinations were permitted. T 
was no uniform standard in the examinations even within a si 
county. ‘He who was most lenient and superficial was 
patronized. A teacher failing to pass with one examiner 
quently applied to another and received a license.” Wit!

   increase of the powers and duties of the examiners in 1861, there 
went a corresponding centralization of authority over examinations. 
Licenses were limited in their authority to the county in which 
they were issued. The examiner was required to report to the 
State Superintendent the names of the persons to whom he had 
granted licenses. He had discretion to omit from the test any 
of the six required branches? if requested to do so by the proper 
trustee. The mischievous effects of this clause were abated by 
the proviso, that such a license should be limited to the particular 
school in which the holder wished to teach, could not exceed six 
months, and could not be repeated to the same person. He had 
power to revoke licenses for incompetency, immorality, cruelty or 
general neglect of school business, the defendant having the right 
to appeal to the State Superintendent. That officer still had 
authority to issue licenses at pleasure and could revoke certificates 
which he had granted. ‘These changes resulted in the elevation 
f the standard of the scholarship of the teachers at least fifty per 
ent. In some quarters there were at first considerable feeling 
nd opposition, but in a short time the law proved eminently satis- 
actory to teachers and school officers alike. The State Super- 
intendent expressed the belief that but few “ special” or “ lim- 
ed” licenses were issued. 
A tendency in the opposite direction was shown in the law 
acted in 1865. It provided that if the school meeting should 
lesignate the teaching of other subjects or a less number of branches 
an those required by law, the teacher was to be examined in 
ly those branches. This change received the almost universal 
sapproval of teachers and examiners; and the provision was in 
short time repealed. 
'The practical questions of the best methods to raise the stand- 
of qualification and to provide for the issuing of licenses 
re annually discussed by school officials and associations of 
chers and of school officers. There was a feeling that suitable 
vision should be made for the issuing of a teacher’s license that 
uld be good in any part of the State and for the lifetime of the 
ler. The difficulty of finding a suitable board to conduct the 
mination was solved satisfactorily in 1865, by giving the State 
rd of Education power to grant “ State Certificates of Quali- 
jon to such teachers as may, upon a thorough and critical 
ination, be found to possess eminent scholarship and profes- 
lal ability and shall furnish satisfactory evidence of good moral 
acter.” Such a certificate entitled the holder to teach in any 
rthography, reading, writing, geography, arithmetic and English grammar.

school of the State without further examination, and was valid 
during the lifetime of the holder.1_ The law very wisely left much 
to the wisdom and discretion of the Board, who prescribed the 
) conditions upon which State certificates should be issued. 
In the local examination of teachers there was'great diversity. 
Each of the ninety-two examiners fixed the standard for his own 
county; hence no common standard prevailed throughout the 
State. In some instances the questions were provokingly difficult ; 
in others they were puerile. In 1871 the State Board of Educa- 
tion took a new departure by preparing a series of twelve sets of 
examination questions upon the branches required to be taught, 
and sending one set each month to the examiners with instructions 
to use them in the examination of teachers on the last Saturday 
in the month. The examiners generally accepted the questions 
and acted upon the instructions. The result was the elevation 
of the general average of the examinations and their complete} 
unification. This is a good example of the wise exercise by th 
State Board of its advisory power. 
An attempt was made in 1899 to constitute the State Super. 
intendent of Public Instruction and the State Board of Educatioi 
the exclusive agencies for issuing licenses. The arguments ad 
vanced in support of the proposition were as follows: It woul 
insure the same standard in all counties; it would equalize wag 
and elevate the school work in the poorer sections of the Stat 
it would remove the possibility of using personal influence to sec’ 
a certificate; it would save teachers the time, expense and anno 
ance in going from one part of the State to another to take th 
examinations; and finally, it would give the county superinte} 
dents their summer months in which to plan their work for t! 
ensuing year, or to attend advanced schools. This seemed to mai 
conscientious friends of education too great a centralization 
power, and the law finally enacted was a compromise. The 
of the questions furnished by the State Board of Education 
now for the first time made obligatory. Applicants were gi 
the right to elect to have their manuscripts sent to the State Su 
intendent for examination, and a license granted by him is vy: 
in any county. The State high school licenses were made| 
include, in addition to the common branches, such additi 
subjects as the State Board may elect. The State Board also

cation of licenses, was extended to those hereafter granted by the 
State Superintendent, with the right of appeal to that officer by 
the defendant. 
The experience in respect to the subject of licensing teachers 
may be briefly summarized as follows: Prior to 1852, complete 
decentralization, with the authority vested in district and town- 
ship trustees (1824-1834) and later in the county examiners (1834- 
1852) ;1 complete centralization in the hands of the State Super- 
intendent and his deputies (1852-1853); a compromise, effected 
by giving this authority to county officers (examiners, 1853-1873, 
and county superintendents, 1873-1902), with the right ? to grant 
icenses retained by the State Superintendent until 1865. Since 
hat date there has been a gradual extension of the powers of the 
tate Board of Education and the State Superintendent until 
lhey have become the controlling authorities in this matter. 
In 1907 a further step in advance was made by a law which 
nstituted the State Board of Education a State Training-School 
joard, gave it power to accredit colleges and normal schools in the 
ate and to outline courses for the training of teachers, and pro- 
ded that all new teachers must have taken a course of not less 
an twelve weeks in professional work as a prerequisite for certi- 
tion. A minimum salary law also graded salaries on the basis 
certification and training.

for the twenty-eight states tabulated, it is possible to secure 
third-grade teacher’s certificate in 90 per cent. of the number wit! 
no educational test beyond the common-school branches; and fo

These low-standard certificates are wholly out of place to-day 
and ought to be eliminated at the earliest possible moment.! 
The great diversity in our requirements and our unwillingness t 
recognize equivalents are two of our marked educational charac 
teristics. So great is the diversity that a good teacher to-day i 
unnecessarily hampered in his ability to move about, not onl 
from state to state, but also from county to county, and often fro: 
county to city and from one city to another. Many of the: 
restrictions are not warranted by any educational standards, bi 
are more of the nature of a protective tariff levied on forei; 
capacity and in favor of home production. This makes the lo¢| 
examination system, with its accompanying barriers, in the nat 
of a protected industry, and this is not in the interests of go 
education. The strict county system too often perpetuates t| 
tule of the weak by shielding them from the competition of 
strong. All barriers to competency are wrong. 
That these barriers exist has been pointed out frequently in 
vious chapters, and need only be summarized here. In fourti 
states there is no admission to the teaching profession except 
examination. In eleven of these states forty or more subjects 
required to secure the highest certificate granted, and all mus’ 
secured on examination. In fourteen states no recognition is gi 
to diplomas from normal schools or other institutions of lear 
within the state. The graduates of such institutions are pl: 
on a par with the “ graduates” of the country school. In 
teen states absolutely no recognition is given to any form of 
dential from another state. Only eleven states recognize no 
school diplomas from other states; seventeen recognize colle, 
university diplomas from outside the state; and eighteen r, 
nize a life-diploma or state professional certificate from 
where. In a number of our states there is no recognition o! 
tificates from one county to another within the state. M

THE CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS 597 
_ The great diversity of our requirements may be seen from 
Table III in chapter iii, and Table V in chapter v. We ought to 
‘work toward greater uniformity by the establishment of educa- 
tional prerequisites, common requirements or norms within sub- 
jects, options and equivalents as between subjects, and the entire 
abolition of certain other subjects from the list of tests. We need 
o do in the examinations for teachers’ certificates what the col- 
ileges have done in the matter of entrance requirements, viz., unify 
las much as possible and then accept evidences of education, equiv- 
lent subjects, and equivalent certificates, so far as they go, leaving 
he candidate to supply the balance by an examination instead of 
equiring him to pass on the entire list. This could be done by 
greements between the states. 
The low standards are also apparent in the requirements for 
ife certificates. This is evident from Table V, pp. 54-55. While 
state life-diploma ought to be of such a standard that it would 
e accepted willingly anywhere in the United States, many of the 
w-standard life-diplomas now granted certainly ought not to be 
cognized from state to state. A life certificate ought to be led 
to by a series of graded certificates, each demanding higher and 
igher standards; and the state life certificate, the culmination 
a teacher’s certificating career, should be given only to those 
ose education and professional standing single them out as the 
te’s most capable teachers. In a number of our states, on the 
trary, a life-diploma is obtainable on the single basis of a defi- 
e number of months of teaching experience, and hence involves 
educational standards of any consequence and really stands 
nothing. 
‘ach state must, of course, be allowed to set its own standards, 
it cannot be expected to accept certificates or diplomas from 
es having a distinctly lower standard. This should be recog- 
d and accepted, and reciprocity should not be expected. In- 
d of being “ uppish” about it and striking back by way of 
liation, as certain states do because their credentials are not 
edited by some more progressive state, they should on the 
rary welcome a teacher from such a state because of his better 
ing and what he may bring. 
is possible, though, for most of our states to determine the 
of credentials from elsewhere, and to recognize them as far 
ey apply. The work of California in this respect is most 
endable. This state has a published list of accredited uni- 
ies and normal schools throughout the United States and 
da, and a list of accredited state diplomas. Anyone possess- 
y of these credentials may be certificated in any county in

the state, without examination, and on the same terms as the 
holders of similar local documents. A fundamental principle in 
California is that the certification door should always be open 
for competency, from whatever quarter it may come. 
In almost every state, too, these low-standard certificates are 
good for teaching in any part of the school system in which the 
holder can secure employment. This should not be allowed to 
continue, but separate certificates should be erected for special 
fields of work. In the case of high-school teachers this is especially 
important. Teachers in all branches of the service should be re 
quired to know more than they are expected to teach, and the im. 
portance of this for high-school teachers cannot be overemphasized 
In the field of supervision we have scarcely made a beginning i 
the preparation and selection of a body of educational leaders, an 
we are tied to present practices by a political string. In our lac! 
of leadership we partake of a common weakness of democrac 
— that of emphasizing the importance of the masses and forgetti 
the leader who must lead and direct them. The soldier, the la’ 
yer, the doctor, and the engineer have cast aside the apprentice: 
ship and the successful-practitioner methods, but the educat 
has not as yet evolved that far in his thinking. Our pedagogi 
departments and the organized body of our pedagogical knowled; 
are too recent to have reached the point of general use and ap, 
cation. We are in education where the army and the navy w 
before the establishment of West Point and Annapolis, and wh 
the engineer, the doctor, and the lawyer were a generation a, 
before the development of modern professional schools for 
training of leaders in these fields. Yet leaders must be trained 
work in education, as in these other professional fields, if we 
to make any great and worthy progress in the future. 
In the matter of examinations there is great need of our decr 
ing the emphasis we now place on the written test. We c 
greatly improve our certificating systems by erecting certain ed 
tional prerequisites and accepting evidence of education in lieu 
least part of the examinations. As fast as can be done, the 
odical written examination ought to be diminished in import 
as a means of recruiting our teaching force. We ought to ij 
more and more on securing the educated and trained teacher in: 
of the raw recruit. Not only should the number of examina 
be decreased, but teachers of training or of long and satisfa 
experience ought to be relieved of the necessity of frequent

education and better professional preparation than the county 
examination represents, and if she is not superior to the untrained 
product of the county examination method, then it is time either 
to renovate the normal schools of the state and put in a corps of 
teachers who can produce a better output, or to abolish them 
entirely and save an unnecessary expense. 
The securing of the educated and trained teacher instead of the 
raw recruit is, however, an economic problem as well as an edu- 
cational one, though this economic problem has an educational 
aspect as well. There never can be high educational standards for 
teachers in states which are organized on the district system, and 
which apportion their money on the very objectionable census basis 
and which raise but a small general tax, until there is a radical 
eform in the methods of raising school revenue and of apportion- 
ing funds after they have been raised. In the ultimate analysis 
here are but three primary problems in education. The first is 
iow properly to finance a school system. The second is how to 
ecure a trained teaching force for it. The third is how to super- 
ise it and to produce leaders for its management and improvement. 
he financial problem always underlies the other two.

‘he certificating power does not necessarily imply the power 
xamine the candidate to test his scholarship. In the plan pro- 
led this function is assigned to the State Board of Education. 
examination questions should be prepared by the State Board 
ducation, or under its direction, should be uniform throughout 
State, and all examination papers should be graded by it or 
r its direction. This is one of the most important features of 
proposed certificating plan. The arguments that may be 
ced in support of it are many and, we think, incontrovertible. 
the first place it guarantees complete fairness in examina- 
The questions for all applicants are identical. No personal 
erations affect the grading of papers. Every candidate 
s squarely on his own merits so far as his scholarship is con- 
id. If he fails he cannot blame anyone but himself. Thus 
ly superintendents will be relieved of unfavorable criticism by 
ants and friends of applicants who are rejected on the grounds

of insufficient scholarship. Superintendents will be relieved also 
of the importunity of persons who, though lacking in scholarship, 
endeavor to secure a certificate on grounds personal, social or polit- 
ical. In Wisconsin in 1900, according to returns made to the 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, ninety per cent of the county 
superintendents were unable to limit the issue of certificates to 
thoroughly qualified applicants! It is not so bad as that in 
Illinois, but there are few superintendents in the State who have 
not been embarrassed by this kind of pressure. 
In the second place the assumption by the State Board of Edu- 
cation of the work of preparing examination questions and grading 
papers will relieve the county superintendent of schools of a large 
amount of clerical work, and thus increase his opportunity for 
effective supervision. The average number of days employed by 
the county superintendent of Iowa in grading papers and makin; 
out and mailing returns, prior to the passing of the new law in tha’ 
state for certificating teachers, was fifty days.* In Illinois the tim 
thus consumed is less since there are fewer examinations than ther 
were in Iowa. But it is considerable, and to add this time to thaj 
which is now devoted by the superintendent to school inspectio 
should greatly increase the educational efficiency of our count; 
school system. 
In the third place uniform examinations will insure inter-coun’ 
recognition of certificates and thus obviate the necessity of t! 
teacher’s passing an examination every time a county line is crosse 
At present there are 102 county examining authorities in the Sta’ 
Consequently there are 102 standards and modes of testing the 
ness of candidates. It is to be expected that the examinatij 
questions in different counties would not be calculated to t 
equally the applicant’s scholarship and that the markings of exa: 
nation papers would not be uniform. Hence inter-county ree} 
nition is impossible under the present system. But under 
proposed plan there would be but one examining authority in 
matter of scholarship and the only ground for the refusal of a co’ 
superintendent to recognize a certificate from another cor 
would be lack of personal fitness of the candidate, and of co 
that would not be acted upon except in individual cases. The 
posed plan, therefore, gives us what at present we do not

xaminations is of such importance that it deserves further 
hasis. Minnesota and South Dakota tried the plan of leaving 
grading of papers with the county superintendents, but were 
iged to give it up. If the State Board of Education should 
rely prepare the examination questions and leave the grading 
the papers to the county superintendent, it is obvious that there 
ould not be or could not be general inter-county recognition of 
ertificates. One county superintendent would not accept the 
grading of another county superintendent. But the principle of 
inter-county recognition is fundamental. If it were necessary for 
the county superintendent to surrender an important prerogative 
in order to secure the operation of this principle, the advantages 
hat would accrue to the school system are sufficiently great to war- 
ant such surrender. But the really important power, the certifi- 
ating power, should not be withdrawn from the county super- 
tendent. He should merely be relieved of the task of testing the 
plicant’s scholarship. 
It is easy to exaggerate the importance to the superintendent 
the power to grade the papers of an applicant for a certificate. 
has been held that it serves three purposes: First, it enables the 
unty superintendent to judge the applicant more accurately 
an he otherwise could; second, it gives the superintendent power 
keep out of his corps of teachers anybody he has a mind to keep 
it, simply by increasing the strictness of his grading; third, it is 
eans of maintaining the authority of the county superintendent 
r his teachers. 
s to the first point it may be said that the estimate of the 
mty superintendent is formed not by grading the papers of the 
licant, but by reading them and this privilege is not withheld 
him by the proposed plan. He may read the papers. If 
superintendent should be in doubt as to the personal fitness 
m applicant he ought indeed to read his papers and take into 
unt his style and method and the general appearance of the 
rs as to form and neatness in arriving at his final judgment. 
opportunity to do so is left with the county superintendent 
therefore it cannot be rightly claimed that the proposed 
deprives him of any basis or means of judging an applicant 
is now in his possession. 
to the shutting out of undesirable candidates it is difficult 
how the grading of an applicant’s answers to questions set 
e State Board of Education could be made to serve that 
se without injustice to the applicant. If he fails to pass 
holarship test he excludes himself. If his scholarship is up 
standard it would be unfair to reject him on the ground that

      he failed in the examination. If he is rejected at all it shou! 
done frankly on the ground that he lacks the necessary per: 
qualifications. It is doubtless an unpleasant duty to tell 
person who applies for a certificate and passes the scholarship 
that the certificate is refused him on the ground of his lackt 
personal fitness to teach, and it may be that for that reason un 
the proposed plan incompetency seeking entrance to the scho 
will not always meet with a determined resistance. Nevertheles: 
as all will agree, the duty of the county superintendent to thi 
children of his county is perfectly plain. It is to reject incom. 
petency. This is a duty which should not be shirked and to th 
imposition of which no really valid objection can be offered. 
Finally, as to the maintenance of the superintendent’s authorit; 
it may be true that when a certain kind of teacher feels that he i 
entirely dependent upon the county superintendent for his grad 
and his certificate the authority of the county superintendent 
more instantly and permanently recognized. But authority resti 
on this foundation and maintained in this manner is not of tl 
kind coveted by thoughtful superintendents. There are other ai

The Experience of Other States with Uniform Examinatio: 
The most convincing argument in favor of the adoption o: 
plan of certification proposed by the commission is perhap: 
invariably successful experience of other states with the uni 
system. This experience amounts practically. to a demonst 
that the plan would operate successfully in Illinois. Fifteen 
already require that all examination questions be prepared ai 
examination papers be graded either by the superintendent of 
instruction or by a state board. Inquiry has been made 
superintendents of these states in regard to how this syste:

vorked. Without a single exception they have asserted its superi- 
rity over the county system. The following are extracts from 
ome of the letters received: 
Minnesota. — “‘ Prior to 1899 the examination questions in this 
tate were uniform. They were prepared by a committee of county 
uperintendents and generally used throughout the state, but each 
ounty superintendent had his own standard of marking and was 
he sole judge of the fitness of candidates for certificates. Since 
hen the system has been in vogue under which the State Super- 
ntendent’s office prepares the questions, designates the time when 
he examinations must be held and examines the manuscript sub- 
nitted by teachers. There is no difference of opinion among edu- 
ators in Minnesota as to the great advantages of the present sys- 
em over the old one. It has resulted in raising the standard of 
equirements for teachers, has given the state a much better quali- 
ied force than it had before. Many of our county superinten- 
lents, being elected by small majorities, were, under the old 
stem, subjected to severe pressure to issue certificates to those 
t qualified, and too often they yielded to this pressure, which, 
many counties, resulted in having a majority of teachers of very 
ferior grade. The State Superintendent’s office, of course, is 
far removed from local pressure that it is not in any way affected 
it. The county superintendents are very glad to be relieved of 
responsibility of passing upon the academic applications of 
licants for certificates. I do not know of one who is in favor of 
ealing the present law and returning to the old system. I 
ieve that some system of state uniformity and of examinations 
a state board is desirable for every commonwealth in the union.” 
. W. Olsen, Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
ew York. — “ Up to 1887 we had no uniform basis for teachers’ 
ificates in this state. Local commissioners or superintendents 
sed whomsoever they saw fit, and it must be admitted that 
saw fit to license a great many who were not deserving. The 
was much influenced by politics and often teachers’ certifi- 
were given in consideration of political support. In 1887

604 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
Alabama. — “ Previous to 1899 the several counties in this 
state conducted their own examinations through a county board 
of education. Nearly as many standards obtained as we have 
counties. In some counties but little care appeared to be exer- 
cised at times in the work of conducting the so-called examinations. 
Nine years ago the legislature of this state enacted a law requir- 
ing teachers, who receive any of the general school fund, to hold 
a certificate granted by a state board of examiners. * * * This 
law has proved one of the most popular and beneficial of all the 
legislative enactments touching schools during the last quarter of 
a century. The standard of teachers has been gradually raised, a 
uniformity exists throughout the state, the work of teaching is 
being recognized as a real profession, the increased efficiency of 
the public school system is everywhere apparent, inefficient teacher: 
in the olden time have entered upon other means of obtaining a 
livelihood, and there is a general uplift and awakening among out 
people in all matters educational.” — Harry C. Gunnell, Super 
intendent of Education.

in operation in Nebraska for nearly three years. We find thi 
system working with reasonable satisfaction. There is a marke

system being carried on successfully in [linois. Mail and expr

examination. For the welfare of schools and the encouragement 
of teachers to do thorough preparation this system is excellent. 
It removes the marking of manuscripts to disinterested parties 
and avoids the local, political and social pressure sometimes brought 
to bear under the systems where the manuscript is marked by the 
county superintendent. It is the fairest system that can be 
devised to the school children.” —H. A. Ustrud, Superintendent, 
South Dakota. 
North Dakota. — “ Our present examination law is reasonably 
satisfactory, so far as it applies to county superintendents. The 
questions are prepared under the direction of the state superinten- 
dent and he appoints the persons who read and mark the exami- 
nation papers written by the applicants. This obviates, to a great 
extent, favoritism and the bringing of pressure to bear upon the 
examiner by parties interested. It makes one standard for the 
entire state, which is something desirable.” —W. L. Stockwell,

    County Superintendents and the State System 
An inquiry concerning the state system of examining teachers 
compared with the county system was also sent to county super- 
tendents in different states. The replies have been invariably 
vorable to the state system. The following are extracts from 
‘ew letters received : 
‘No county system of granting certificates can do justice to 
teachers certified. Personal interests will creep in. The sys- 
now in use in New York weeds out the poor scholar, but not 
ays the poor teacher. However, with a state board grading 
answer papers and a competent board of inspectors it is pos- 
le to have teachers of ability both as to education and as to‘abil- 
to instruct. This we are beginning to have in New York 
le.” — Pratt E. Marshall, Com. First Chautauqua District, 
‘man, N. Y. 
esponding to your circular of July 9th, I would say first, 
in general I prefer the state uniform system to any of the va- 
county systems for the examination and certification of 
ers. This conclusion has been reached after personal experi- 
with the systems in vogue in Kansas, North Dakota, Penn- 
ia, and West Virginia, and after a careful study of the matter, 
irman of the committee on education in the House of Dele- 
which passed our present uniform law. In my judgment,

606 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
the state system is preferable, first, because of its advantages t 
the teachers. By it the teacher has a standing throughout the stat 
and the way is open before him for a broader view of educationa 
interests. The consequent wider exchange of teachers and schoo 
ideas is a healthful stimulation to better work. Second, the state 
system is preferable because it prevents the unwise lowering o! 
standards that always occurs in more or fewer instances under the 
county system. This system also takes the examinations anc 
granting of certificates further out of the reach of political or othe1 
local influences.””— M. P. Shawkey, County Superintendent anc 
Editor West Virginia Educator, Charleston, W. Va. 
“The present system of having the questions made out anc 
the papers corrected by the state committee is entirely satisfactory 
The uniformity thus brought about has raised the standard of the 
teaching profession and stimulated effort throughout the whole 
educational system. We would not willingly go back to the old 
way.” — Margaret E. Brown, County Superintendent, Grand Island 
Nebraska. 
“As county superintendent of schools of this county I hav 
worked under the system of examinations by this office and am no’ 
working under the new plan of examinations by the state. R 
sults prove conclusively that the present system gets better resul 
in the school room.” — W. F. Lorin, County Superintendent, May} 
dan, North Dakota. 
“There is hardly a teacher in the state who would like to reve 
to the old system of examination by questions prepared and grad: 
by the county superintendent. This system has culled out t 
incompetent teachers, thus causing a scarcity of teachers throu; 
out the state, hence an increase of wages and better teach 
Certificates granted under this system are valid throughout 
state, hence doing away with the necessity of teachers taking 
examination in different counties. Salaries have increased f: 
a minimum of $28.00 to $40.00 per first grade certificates, 
other grades in proportion. Taken as a whole this system is b 
ing up the schools of West Virginia rapidly and is a step far in|

) The Great School Problem is First and Last the Problem of 
Maintaining Efficiency 
In the present agitation for better things in education there are 
lew fundamental propositions that teachers, citizens and legislators 
d to keep in mind if anything is to be accomplished. The 
t of these and the one that overshadows and conditions all the 
it is that we have come to a stage in educational affairs in which 
question of efficiency is involved. It is not a commercial 
stion at all. It is not merely a question of securing more 
for teachers. That is a secondary proposition. Primarily 
a question whether we can any longer under the present con- 
ms secure and maintain efficiency in our schools. The worth 
progress of any calling depends upon efficiency. Its rank and 
ity are determined by the competency of its men and women. 
professional plane of any calling depends finally upon the 
ity of its own members. . . . 
aching is not a profession in Indiana. Almost anybody can 
ry to teach school. There is practically no professional test 
he scholarship requirements are very low. Neither public 
m nor law has set up any barrier to the sacred precincts of 
607
-P-A-G-E-630
  608 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
this calling. If a young man hasn’t made up his mind what he 
wants to do in the world, he teaches school. If he fails at some- 
thing else, he teaches school. If he is out of a position, he teaches 
school. If he wants to prepare for medicine, or law, or the ministry, 
he teaches school. From one cause or another a large percentage 
of our teachers drift into the calling. It is not to be denied that 
many of these classes do temporarily fair work and that some of 
them become permanently good teachers, but the calling cannot 
afford to take such risks, to say nothing of how much the schools 
have suffered in furnishing them raw materials to practice on. 
Despite all this, it ought to be said that thousands of competent 
“men and women have deliberately chosen the calling and have 
prepared themselves to be teachers, and are doing efficient work ; 
but the existing conditions make,their work difficult, and even 
call their efficiency in question, so that the public is in danger of 
losing their services sooner or later. 
There is an element in the teacher’s calling that places it at a 
disadvantage when compared in the score of efficiency with other 
professions. In law and medicine and in the ministry the peopl 
sit in direct judgment and sooner or later put incompetence int 
its proper rank. In teaching it has been and is possible for on 
reason or another, through one influence or another, for incompe| 
tents to entrench themselves so securely that the children suffe 
for years before they are dislodged. This is made possible by tl 
fact that the schools are still in the hands of politicians and th 
there are no qualifications, educational, intellectual, moral 
otherwise, for members of school boards. However, no great 
tribute could be paid to our people than to say that public opini 
has done much to overcome this defect in our system. Paradoxi 
as it may seem, in the light of what has just been said, one of t] 
worst defects in our system is to be found in the short average 
the life of the teacher. This is particularly true in the dist 
schools, where twenty-five or thirty per cent of the teachers ev 
year are new. Having tried teaching without any forethough 
definite purpose, many move on as aimlessly to try sometl 
else, or having taken the work without preparation, many

     (2) Efficiency in School Work demands Competent Men and We 
So we have come to a time when something definite shoul: 
established in the teacher’s work. There is a problem of teac 
or there is not. If there is such a problem every teacher who 
up the work should have studied it. Teaching should be put
-P-A-G-E-631
  APPOINTMENT, TENURE, PAY, AND PENSIONS 609 
a professional plane. Certain, definite requirements should be 
fulfilled before anyone is permitted to teach school. That is, a 
standard of efficiency should be established and maintained. 
There should be distinct tests of personality, scholarship, and 
professional ability. A date should be set, far enough in the future 
to be just, at which time the requirements should go into effect. 
The general assembly can help the cause of education and mate- 
rially hasten the day of larger efficiency by putting the dignity of 
the law back of these provisions. This is the first step to be 
taken. Provide for efficient work by eliminating the unprepared 
and the incompetent from the ranks of the profession. 
(3) Competent Men and Women command Good Salaries 
4 
But at the same time the state sets up new standards of efficiency 
for teachers it must hold out larger inducements in the way of sal- 
aries. The compensation for teaching has always been inadequate ; 
and while it is true that real teaching cannot be paid for in dollars 
land cents, we have come to a time when the public must more 
early recognize its worth. The laborer is worthy of his hire, 
nd the teacher is no exception to the rule. Teachers have hither- 
0 seemingly been afraid that the public would think that they 
ere teaching for money, and the kind public has saved them from 
his humiliating reputation. With the demands made upon their 
urse in keeping awake and alive it has been almost impossible 
r men and women who have no other source of income to remain 
the calling. Somehow the public has gone on demanding 
at teachers appear as well as other people, that they travel and 
ep up with the times, that they buy books and pictures and 
gazines, and at the same time the public has not concerned it- 
f about the funds with which all this is to be done. It would 
bably be a revelation to many good people to know that the 
rage teacher must stop to consider whether he can afford to 
nd five dollars for books which he really needs in his busi-     
    
       
      
        
      
   
       
      
   ce 
it is possible that the public would consider it a great joke to 
about teachers living as well as other people. But why is 
this the proper basis? Teaching is difficult work; it takes 
and brains and vitality. Why should it not bring as much 
‘iting briefs, or dispensing medicine, or selling dry goods? 
, indeed! Simply because teachers have not demanded it. 
remarkable thing about it all is that we have gone on all 
years with such miserable pittances and have accepted them 
0 much charity. ‘Teaching has, as Dr. Van Dyke said, been 
2R
-P-A-G-E-632

610 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
the poorest paid and the best rewarded of all callings, but we have 
come to a time when more pay will not affect the reward. Let us 
say again that the question has come to be one of maintaining 
efficiency in our schools. .. . 
In addition to frequent changes, and consequently decreasing 
efficiency among teachers, the scarcity of men teachers may be 
mentioned as a great defect in our schools, growing out of our poor 
remuneration. This may be regarded as a national calamity. 
There has been no incentive for men to prepare for this calling, 
and they have left the field. And now it is difficult to keep the 
places filled with competent women. Professor Miinsterberg 
says: “There was never before a nation that gave the education 
of the young into the hands of the lowest bidder.’ In this state- 
ment he strikes the strongest reason for the absence of men in 
the calling. The efficiency of our schools is already in danger, 
for brains and energy are paid for in other callings and many 
competent women will no longer teach school. 
(4) Good Salaries require Larger Funds than are at Present pro: 
vided for in Indiana 
      
   
   
    
    
     
      
        Although Indiana is able under present conditions to pay mu 
better salaries than she is paying now, she can never pay wha 
teachers deserve till larger provision for funds is made. The 
are several ways to do this. The state tax could be increased 
where it was some years ago, when a mistaken notion of econo: 
reduced it. The local levy could be increased in many comm’ 
nities without any hardship. 
We suggest that every taxpayer in the state make an estimate 
just how much of his tax goes to education and how much g 
to other purposes. Then, that he raise the question whether m 
given to education would not shortly reduce his taxes in ot! 
directions. We cannot discuss here in detail the ways in w! 
the funds may be increased, but it must be borne in mind t| 
increased efficiency, increased salaries, and increased funds 
come together in the solution of this problem. 
(5) To increase Salaries without raising the Standard of Effict 
would Commercialize the Calling 
Another principle ought to be kept in mind in considering 
whole question, and that is that this is not a fight for higher 
aries on the part of the teachers. It is a struggle to mai 
the present efficiency of the schools and a demand that the
-P-A-G-E-633

APPOINTMENT, TENURE, PAY, AND PENSIONS 611 
be put upon a plane that will make larger efficiency possible. To 
this end teachers want conditions established which will make 
merit the sole measure of tenure and pay. At the same time that 
the pay is increased it ought to be made impossible for unprepared, 
incompetent teachers to profit by the increase. Otherwise the 
calling will be commercialized and cheapened. Competent teachers 
are not begging, they are simply asking for their own. This point 
cannot be made too strong. While good teaching cannot be paid 
for in dollars and cents, poor teaching is paid infinitely too much. 
Anybody who knows anything at all about schools knows that 
there are scores of teachers who: earn less than nothing. These 
should be taken off the pay rolls and it ought to be made impos- 
sible for them ever to get back on. Any new provisions which 
would make it possible for them to continue and draw larger pay 
would put teaching on a lower plane than it now is. And so every 
teacher who has the right view is insisting that a new standard 
f qualifications and increased pay must come together. More 
ay is not what we want, but larger efficiency and more pay. Two 
ears ago when it was proposed to raise salaries for certain grades 
f efficiency in teaching it was found that teachers who knew they 
ould not profit by the provision were opposed to it. The same 
ing will happen again, and legislators should not be deceived by 
ich opposition. 
       
      
   
       
   
    
      
        
   ) To raise the Standard of Efficiency without increasing Salaries 
would make it impossible to secure Competent Men and Women 
inally, to impose a new standard of efficiency without increas- 
salaries is useless. That kind of a scheme cannot deceive 
chers any longer. They have finally realized that they can’t 
on high ideals. With eggs at 25 cents and butter at 40 cents, 
has come to be a simple bread and butter problem. Prosperity 
ard on the salaried man or woman. And so raising the standard 
ualifications without increasing wages would simply make it 
lossible to fill the places at all. We have probably said enough 
how that it would be unwise to raise the standard and in- 
e the salaries without providing means for paying the salaries. 
law makers will not make this mistake. In this campaign for 
r things teachers have had the sympathy of the people, the 
ises of candidates and politicians, and the earnest support of 
ewspapers. It rests wholly with the legislators at this junc- 
hether our portion shall consist of sympathy.

  612 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
Partly in response to the foregoing paper the Indiana legis- 
lature enacted a minimum wage law, in which an attempt was 
made to, adjust wages in part to experience, certificate held, 
and training. This we reproduce as a type of one of the best 
of the state laws on the subject of minimum wages for teachers. 
Il. Tae Inpiana Miniuom Wace Law 
[Approved March 2, 1907.] 
Sec. 1. Minimum wages. That the daily wages of teacher: 
for teaching in the public schools of the state shall not be less. 
in the case of beginning teachers, than an amount determined 
by multiplying two and one-half cents by the general averagé 
given such teacher in his highest grade of license at the time o' 
contracting. For teachers having had a successful experience 
for one school year of not less than six months, the daily wage: 
shall not be less than an amount determined by multiplying thre 
cents by the general average given such teacher on his highes| 
grade of license at the time of contracting. For teachers havin; 
had a successful experience for three or more school years of n 
less than six months each, the daily wages shall be not less th: 
an amount determined by multiplying three and one-half cen 
by the general average given such teacher on his highest gra 
of license at the time of contracting. All teachers now exempt 
hereafter exempt from examination shall be paid, as daily wa: 
for teaching in the public schools, not less than an amount det 
mined by multiplying three and one-half cents by the gene 
average of scholarship and success given such teachers: Provid, 
That the grade of scholarship accounted in each case be that gi 
at the teacher’s last examination, and that the grade of suc 
accounted be that of the teacher’s term last preceding 
date contracting: And, provided further, That two per ¢ 
shall be added to the teacher’s general average of scholarship 
success for attending the county institute the full number of 
and that said two per cent shall be added to the average sch 
ship of beginning teachers. (R. S. 1908, § 6599 as ame 
1911, p. 131.) 
Sec. 2. Qualifications. The qualifications required for t 
ing for the different classes shall be as follows: 
(a.) A teacher without experience: Shall be a graduate 
high school or its equivalent. Shall have had not less tha 
term of twelve weeks’ work in a school maintaining a profes:

course for the training of teachers. Shall have not less than a 
welve months’ license. 
(b.) A teacher with one school year’s experience: Shall be a 
sraduate of a high school or its equivalent. Shall have had not 
ess than two terms or twenty-four weeks’ work in a school main- 
aining a professional course for the training of teachers or the 
quivalent of such work. Shall have not less than a two years’ 
icense. Shall have a success grade. 
(c.) A teacher with three or more years’ successful experience: 
Shall be a graduate of a high school or its equivalent. Shall be 
1 graduate from a school maintaining a professional course for the 
raining of teachers, or its equivalent. Shall have a three years’ 
icense or its equivalent. Shall have a success grade. 
Provided, That for teachers already in the service, success- 
‘ul experience in teaching shall be accepted as an equivalent for 
nigh school and professional training, as required by all the above 
lassifications. (R. S. 1908, § 6600.) 
Sec. 3. Payment at less rate— Penalty. If any school officer 
hall pay to any teacher for school services at a rate less than 
at fixed by this act, he shall be fined in any amount not exceed- 
g $100.00 and shall be liable in a civil action for wages to such 
acher at the rate provided in this act, which may be recovered by 
ch teacher, together with an attorney’s fee of $25.00, in any 
urt of justice of competent jurisdiction. (R. S. 1908, § 6601.) 
Sec. 4. State board of education — Duties. It shall be the 
ity of the state board of education, from time to time, to provide 
ulations which shall define the words “high school” and 
quivalent ” in this act, it being the intent hereof that only such 
ols be recognized as high schools as maintain a standard of 
olarship and efficiency and course of study to the approval of 
state board of education, and that the word “ equivalent ” as 
in this act shall mean such a course of study or training or the 
lity to pass such an examination as in the judgment of the state 
d of education would as fully qualify the applicant for teach- 
as the qualification of high school or normal school work and the 
se respectively named above requires. (R. S. 1908, § 6602.)    
        
    
   
    
    
     
    
      
   
   
    I. A Feasrste Pension System ror Pusiic ScHoon 
TEACHERS 
hett, Henry S., in the 7th An. Rept. Carnegie Foundation, 
1912, pp. 70-77.] 
ile the work of the Carnegie Foundation has to do primarily 
ensions to the teachers in a limited number of colleges and
-P-A-G-E-636
  614 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
universities, it goes without saying that a keen interest is taker 
in the problem of pensions for public school teachers. The report: 
of the Foundation have continually aimed to emphasize the inter- 
dependence of the college and the public school system. Our edu 
cational problem is one problem, and if there is a justification for 
pensions for teachers in the colleges, there is a still stronger justi- 
fication for pensions for teachers in public schools, where salaries 
are lower, work is harder, and the conditions of service are in every 
way more difficult. One of the great weaknesses of our public 
school system to-day lies in the fact that only a small number o! 
men can be induced to undertake permanent careers in it. Be 
fore we can hope for the best results in education, we must make a 
career for an ambitious man possible in the public schools. Tc 
do this, dignity and security must be given to the teacher’s calling 
and probably no one step could be taken which will be more influ- 
ential in inducing able men and women to adopt the professior 
of the teacher in the public schools than to attach to that vocation 
the security which a pension brings. 
This problem is now before the legislatures of many stages. I 
is going to be an increasingly insistent question. In the presence 
of such suggested legislation, the thoughtful legislator will wis! 
to ask at least four questions : (1) Upon what grounds are pensioi 
for public school teachers justified? (2) Assuming that pensioi 
ought to be paid, who ought to pay them? (3) What form 
pension system would it be fair to adopt, having regard both to tl 
individual teacher and to the state? (4) What will such a pensi 
system cost the individual teacher and what will it cost the stat 
When these four questions have been answered, a feasible pe} 
sion system for the public school teachers of a state will have be 
described. 
While it-is not possible to answer these finally for a particu 
state without a thoroughgoing examination of the salaries, a, 
and lengths of service of the teachers who compose the system 
is nevertheless possible to give a general answer, sufficient to g 
the inquirer in forming a judgment. The literature of the sub, 
is extensive, both in English and in German, and the experi 
already gained has demonstrated certain fundamental princi 
which may be considered as settled. I venture, therefore, to 
line the following answers to these four questions in the ligh 
the experience of existing pension systems in this country 
England, and on the continent of Europe. 
1. Pensions are justified upon practically two grounds: 
those of a larger social justice; secondly, as a necessary cond| 
to an efficient public school system.     
    
    
   
    
        
   
    
      
      
    
-P-A-G-E-637
  APPOINTMENT, TENURE, PAY, AND PENSIONS 615 
       
   
    The first of these reasons applies in marked measure to pensions 
ike that of the teacher. Society, as at present organized, desires 
0 get the best service it can out of the various vocations and 
allings into which men are naturally distributed. In some of 
ese callings great prizes are to be won, and these serve as incen- 
ives for high performance. In other callings, like that of the 
eacher, there are no large prizes in the way of pecuniary reward 
(it would be a wise thing in society to create such). Society de- 
ires to obtain of the teacher a service quite out of proportion 
to the pay which he receives. Intelligence, devotion, high char- 
acter — all are necessary, and the state seeks to obtain them at an 
average salary of $500 a year. It is clear that, if the state is to 
receive such service, some protection for old age and disability 
must be had, if the best men and women are to be induced to enter 
upon such a calling as a life work. 
Secondly, from the standpoint of efficiency in organization, 
hether a governmental one or a business one, there must be some 
eans for retiring, decently and justly, worn-out servants. In 
ie past we have in most cases turned out men and women no 
mger able to teach, but the conscience of our time does not per- 
it such action. Out-worn teachers remain to the direct injury 
the pupils themselves. As a matter of efficiency, some humane 
ethod of retirement for public school teachers is necessary. 
These two reasons for the establishment of pensions for the 
achers in state schools are sound and unanswerable. 
2. Three plans for securing protection against disability and the 
akness of old age are proposed: a pension system borne wholly 
the employer, a pension system borne wholly by the employee, 
ension system conducted jointly by both employer and em- 
yee and supported by their joint contributions. 
hile there are some variations of opinion among those who 
e studied the question, the overwhelming weight of opinion 
favor of the third plan. 
pension system resting upon the contributions of the em- 
er alone has many objections, not the least being the lack of 
eration and of the incentive to thrift which are likely to be 
luced by it. 
system of pensions depending on the contributions of em- 
ees alone amounts practically to a compulsory system of 
g. In order that the benefits may be large enough to form 
is for retirement, the contribution must be so large as to be 
ically prohibitory. 
e third plan seems to me justified not only on the ground of 
, but upon the ground of self-interest, whether the employer

  616 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
be a corporation or a government. All salaries such as teachers 
are relatively low, and while the question of a just salary must not 
be confused with the equity involved in a relief plan, it neverthe 
less remains true that the general equities of service demand that 
a part of the pension of a servant be borne by the employer. A 
state still owes to the faithful teacher something after it has paic 
his salary. He has been required to regulate his life in large 
measure for the common interest. In addition the employer. 
whether a corporation or a state, secures a higher efficiency by 2 
well-ordered pension system. Finally, only by such joint action 
can be secured the right codperation between employer and em- 
ployee. On all three grounds — the ground of general equity, of 
increased efficiency, of a better social codperation — it is desirable 
that a system of pensions rest upon the joint contribution of the 
employer and the employee. 
I assume that on the whole it is fair for the teacher to bear half 
the cost of the annuity and the state the other half. 
3. The form of pension system at once just and feasible would 
involve the consideration of many details, but at least these genera! 
principles may be assumed as proven: 
(a) The pension obligation should be compulsory upon ever 
teacher who enters the service. 
(b) The amount of the contribution should be determined b; 
thorough actuarial investigation, but each teacher shall form 
unit, and the annuity which he is to receive shall be based upon 
own payment plus that granted by the state. Such an arrang 
ment is just and fair, and is capable of actuarial computatio 
Every individual, whether he survives, resigns, or dies, thus ft 
nishes the basis for the action taken. 
(c) Contributions levied upon teachers who resign or are di 
missed must be returned with a moderate interest — say three 
cent — and similar returns must be made to the widows or hi 
of those who die. 
(d) A central administration for the pensions of all public sel 
teachers should be provided, constituted of a small commiss 
serving without salary, with a paid executive who should at 
same time be a competent actuary. 
4. The cost of such a pension system to the state or to the i 
vidual can be approximated only after some assumption is 
as to the amount of the pension to be paid in the individual 
In order to arrive at some estimate, I assume that the teach 
to receive a pension of fifty per cent of his pay at the time oj 
tirement, one-half of the pension to be provided by his own 
ments, the other half by appropriations from the state trea:

APPOINTMENT, TENURE, PAY, AND PENSIONS 617 
Thus, a teacher in the grammar school who receives $500 a year, 
vhich is somewhat higher than the average, would be paid at 
he assumed age of retirement — say, sixty years —a pension of 
5250, of which his own contributions must furnish an amount 
ufficient to supply an annuity of $125, and the state the remain- 
ng annuity of $125. The teacher who enters at twenty-five would 
1eed to pay, in order to provide his annuity at sixty, about three 
ind a half per cent of his salary — in other words, something less 
han $20 a year, which, compounded at four per cent, would take 
are of his half of the annuity. Should the teacher die or resign 
n the interval, the state would repay his accumulations with 
nterest at three per cent, a process which ought to furnish a small 
srofit, but which, on the other hand, gives to the teacher’s family 
. protection which is most important and most needed. On the 
vhole, therefore, for a pension system which aims simply to retire 
ndividuals at sixty, the teacher must expect to pay a proportion 
f his salary amounting to from three and a half to six percent, 
uccording to the age at which he enters. 
Assuming a school system comparable with that of, let us say, 
e state of Kansas, or the state of Virginia, or the state of Iowa, 
ith approximately 12,000 school teachers, how much would such 
system cost the state? And what rules should be inaugurated 
the start which may be at once consistent with the security of 
jose who contribute and with the dignity and honor of the state? 
when once the state accepts the contributions of these teachers 
id enters into a contractual relation with them, it cannot insert 
0 the provisions of its pension system a clause reserving the right 
lamend the conditions at will. Assuming a constituency of public 
ool teachers of a state to number 12,000, and that they receive 
average salary of $500, what would the system ultimately cost 
state, if it paid one-half of the pensions which might accrue 
er such a simple pension scheme as I have assumed, namely, a 
ion system which retired teachers at sixty years of age upon 
pay, the teacher providing one-half of the pension? 
is question is the hardest of all to answer. The wisest actuary 
make only a guess. The chief uncertainty arises out of the 
that comparatively few teachers remain permanently in serv- 
the age of sixty. At present the great bulk of teachers are 
m. Many of these marry. Others, for one reason or an- 
, drop out of teaching. The number who take their calling 
sly and who will persist to the end of their active life is, of 
, increasing, but any estimate as to the number who will 
tely earn pensions under such a plan is subject to large

618 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
In Virginia, for example, the men teachers in the calling at th 
age of sixty form about 5 per cent of those who started; if ther 
had been no retirements, they would be about 60 per cent. Simi 
larly for women teachers, those at the age of sixty form about 1 
per cent of those who started, while had all persisted to the ag 
of sixty except those removed by death, the percentage would b 
67. As the women teachers far outnumber the men, it may b 
said roughly that the fluctuations lie between 15 per cent at th 
present time and a possible 65 per cent. The statistics for Ili 
nois are quite near these. Perhaps the assumption of 40 per cent 
the arithmetical mean of these two limits, would be as close a1 
approximation to the facts a generation hence as could be made 
Such a school system of 12,000 teachers at an average pay of $50! 
and paying pensions on the basis assumed would therefore develo) 
a charge upon the state treasury of $600,000 a year, which is 1 
per cent of the salary cost, and which probably represents approxi 
mately the maximum load which a state like Kansas or Iowa woul 
in the course of a generation assume in adopting such a system 
This load would, of course, be greatly reduced by advancing th 
age of retirement from sixty to sixty-five. 
The form of pension system here assumed is the simplest po: 
sible. It provides a pension in but one case, namely, that of tl 
individual who has come to the age of sixty. It does nothing f 
the teacher who has become disabled at an earlier period, or for t! 
families of those who died. Such a provision would, howev 
take care of that main load which affects both the question 
justice and the question of efficiency, and would go far to sol 
the wants which a pension system can meet. It will be wise, 
my judgment, for such systems to be formed upon very sim 
lines, and not to attempt to meet every individual case, but 
provide justly for the one or two great sources of need wi 
appeal both to our sense of justice and to our ideals of efficiel 
There is one modification of this simple scheme which w 
add little to the expense, but which would cover practically] 
that a pension system for public school teachers should at this 
attempt to do, that is, the payment of a proportionate pensio: 
a given length of service in case of disability. For examp! 
state might well afford to pay, after fifteen years of service a 
contribution, an agreed-upon proportionate pension to the te: 
who had broken down in its service. 
These general principles will, I believe, be found to cove; 
essentials of a state-wide pension system for public school tea 
Such pensions undoubtedly are to be paid. Both our se 
justice and our ideals of efficiency demand it. The danger i

they will be begun under unwise and imperfect conceptions, which 
‘ultimately will defeat, or at least retard, as was the case in New 
‘South Wales, the whole movement. The one word which needs 
to be spoken to any association of teachers and to any body of 
legislators who are to deal with the question is, to take no step 
without sound actuarial advice, and to make use of the rich experi- 
ence of the past which is now available. 
As pension systems become numerous, it will be desirable to 
arrange some equitable plan for the reciprocal exchange of contri- 
butions and liabilities, so that a teacher, transferring from a school 
under one pension system to a school under another system, will 
‘not lose the accumulated right to a provision in old age. 
In the minds of many there will still remain the question whether, 
in the light of what the Federal Congress has done in the matter 
of civil war pensions, any state government can be trusted to con- 
trol such a relief system, free of politics. The Commission on 
Economy and Efficiency appointed by President Taft recom- 
ended as a plan of retirement for civil employees of the Federal 
overnment a system of annuities supported from the contributions 
f employees alone, based upon the age of entrance into the sery- 
ice; the maximum annuity to be $600. The government is to 
rovide for the accrued liabilities in excess of eight per cent of the 
mployee’s salary, and to guarantee four per cent upon the contri- 
utions of the employees. The system will apply to government 
ployees in the District of Columbia only. The plan, which 
been worked out in most complete actuarial form by Mr. Her- 
rt D. Brown of the Department of Commerce and Labor, con- 
mplates the return to an employee leaving the service prior to 
le age of retirement of all contributions with interest at four per 
tt compounded annually, and the return to the legal represen- 
ives of an employee dying either before or after retirement of 
amount in hand not yet paid out to him in annuities, with 
lerest. The retiring age is seventy. 
his plan is really not a relief plan, but a system of compulsory 
ing. The Commission was evidently strongly influenced in its 
clusions by the fear that any pension system administered by 
gress which involved a payment by the government of even 
of a retiring allowance would be subject to political abuse. 
lone familiar with the history of civil war pensions can doubt 
possibility of such a misuse of public money. The civil war 
ion history constitutes our greatest political scandal. To 
ess and to the country it has been a source of untold demoral- 
m, and the presidents of the United States share with Con- 
the responsibility for this legislation. Except Grover

Cleveland, no President of the United States has shown courage 
in the face of a pension bill. 
* * * * * * * 
Will a state legislature and a state governor administer justly 
a matter in which the general government and the chief executives 
have been so weak? 
In answer to this it may be said that a pension system in which 
the employee contributes does not present the same opportunity 
for political exploitation that the civil war pensions have pre- 
sented. The man who believes in the future of his country and in 
democratic progress will be slow to admit that either Congress or 
the state governments will be found permanently incapable of 
carrying out so simple an obligation. If our democracy cannot 
learn from such an experience as that of the civil war pensions, it 
is helpless to solve the problems that confront it on every hand. 
In any event, the argument that our government is not hones! 
enough to conduct a justly planned relief system for its employ 
is a weak reason for inaugurating an unsatisfactory system.

CHAPTER XXV 
IMPROVING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 
Many plans have been tried, in different states and cities, to 
improve teachers in service. The most important of these 
classify themselves under the headings of teachers’ institutes, 
and reading circles for professional improvement. Much has 
been written on each of these plans, and we reproduce here 
only a few selected articles. The first suggests a substitute for 
the old type of teachers’ institute, and appended to it is the 1911 
revision ‘of the California law relating to institutes, which was 
enacted as a result of this article. Of the state reading circles, 
e reproduce the plan of organization of the Indiana Teachers’ 
eading Circle. This organization has rendered a very con- 
picuous educational service during the quarter century of its 
xistence.

‘Two hundred and forty thousand dollars a year is subtracted 
m the money provided for the education of the children of the 
tte and spent for teachers’ institutes. In many counties two- 
rds the cost of the institute can be saved to the children; and 
, not only without impairing its usefulness, but, on the con- 
y, actually strengthening some of its weak places and making 
ore effective. 
NOT ENOUGH THINKING 
ong the weaknesses of the institute is the fact that the great 
rity of teachers are, from its opening to its closing moment, in 
te of passivity towards all that goes on. In the school the 
teacher acts as far as possible on the principle of learning by

doing, for he knows that mental alertness depends mainly on the 
self-activity of the learner. His constant aim is, not to do for the 
learner, but to keep the learner doing for himself. In the institute 
on the other hand, young teachers sit, hour after hour, and session 
after session, passive as pitchers waiting to be filled, as if the best, 
the only, way to learn is by listening to the expression of the prod- 
uct of other people’s thinking. 
Again, the institute program is frequently so overcrowded that 
towards the close of the sessions it is a weariness to the flesh to sit 
politely still, and pretend to be listening. And even where the 
program is not over-crowded it is necessarily so extensive, occupy- 
ing from three to five days, and covers such a variety of topics, that 
adequate reflection on the ideas presented, and consequent as- 
similation, is quite out of the question. A too generous supply of 
rich food clogs the mental digestion. 
LINCOLN’S PERFECT ENGLISH 
Abraham Lincoln said on one occasion that he did not profess to 
be an educated man, and that it was a source of constant surpris 
to him that learned men, professors in universities, should hold hi: 
speeches as models of English, and use them to exemplify rhetorica) 
principles. He said, however, that from his youth up he had ha 
the habit of turning over and over in his mind any new thoug! 
that was presented to him until he understood it thoroughly, in a 
its length and breadth and thickness. And having thus master 
it, he sought the words to give it clear and precise expression, nev! 
satisfied until he had clothed it in language that seemed exac' 
fitting. 
Here was perfect assimilation of new ideas. Has pedago; 
ever discovered a bettermethod of education? In most education 
institutions, from the elementary school up,. there is prop} 
tionately too much listening, as well as too much reading, and 
little use of the thinking powers of the individual; and this we 
ness shows at its feeblest in the teachers’ institute. The net 
sult of the institute is often a vague impression of good 
heard on many different subjects, not a clear, definite, thor 
grasp of new ideas on any subject.      
         
     
     
    
     
    MUST EXCHANGE IDEAS 
Mainly because of the inadequacy of the institute for the j 
change of ideas on school problems, associations like schoolma 
clubs are growing in number all over the state. In the meeti
-P-A-G-E-645
  IMPROVING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 623 
these associations a topic presented by a leader is discussed by the 
comparatively few members with a freedom that in an institute is 
impossible. Each feels the interest that comes with the oppor- 
tunity to express his opinions, and each also has the stimulus which 
comes from the knowledge that he himself will be called upon at 
some future time to present a subject for the discussion of the mem- 
bers. 
Another weakness of the institute is that it is too much a teachers’ 
institute. In it teachers listen to more or less able speakers, who 
present greater or fewer new ideas, who stir their interest more or 
less, and at times arouse their enthusiasm. And then, they “reso- 
lute,” and frequently go to the trouble and expense of printing their 
resolutions and broadcasting them over the land. Last year the 
Ventura County Institute sent a copy of one resolution to each 
trustee in the county. And what good came of it? If any result 
followed, good, bad or indifferent, it has not thus far become appar- 
ent. What is needed is that school trustees and patrons should\ 
attend the institutes; they should hear the able speakers, they | 
‘also should get the new ideas, their interest should be stirred, and \ 
their enthusiasm aroused. Any reform shown to be advisable |, 
could then be effected, for the ideas, the interest and the enthusiasm 
would be in the minds of the people who possess the power to make 
the reform. 
What is the use of arousing enthusiasm in a teachers’ institute 
ver raising teachers’ salaries, or over a dozen other subjects often 
iscussed? A teacher may leave the institute in a blaze for the im- 
roving of school grounds, or the decoration of school-rooms; but 
he comes to trustees who are not at all interested, who don’t see 
here the money is to come from, and whose lack of sympathy acts 
m her generous emotion like a wet blanket. Sometimes, of course, 
lersistence overcomes apathy; but more often the fire is quenched, 
d nothing is done.    
      
      
        
    
        
    
      
   
    INSTITUTES EXPENSIVE 
Finally, the present institute is extremely expensive. A three 
s’ session in Ventura County, which has only one hundred thirty 
chers, costs $3,000, $1,000 a day. A teacher’s salary for the 
ion averages $20, and the other expenses approximate $400 
e. Los Angeles, city and county, with four thousand teachers, 
s in salaries for the institute week, $80,000. That is to say, 
children of these counties are, for the sake of the institutes, 
ived of the schooling which these sums of money would pay for. 
ay be worth it; but if a cheaper method, which may possibly 
 
-P-A-G-E-646
  624 “THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
produce as good results educationally, can be found, it ought to be 
given a chance to demonstrate its usefulness. 
The plan of local evening institutes is believed to be such a 
method. It is desired that the legislature shall, without abrogat- 
ing the present law governing institutes, amend that law so as to 
permit a school superintendent who may so elect, to hold, instead of 
the annual institute, local evening institutes at different points in 
the territory under his jurisdiction, at various times throughout 
the school year. 
PLAN IN BRIEF 
To put the matter, for the sake of clearness, in concrete form, 
Ventura County could be divided into five or six sections in such 
a way that the teachers, trustees and people of each section could 
come together at a convenient central point in each section for a 
local evening institute. The superintendent would then advertise 
the first series of evening institutes throughout the county, say, for 
the moonlight week of October. On Monday evening, he, with 
a good lecturer, would meet the teachers and people of section 
number one. The first hour of the meeting might be devoted to 
short papers or talks by two or three teachers and trustees, followed 
by an open discussion; and the program would conclude with a 
first-class educational lecture. On Tuesday the superintendent 
and lecturer would repair to the central point of section number 
two and hold a similar institute in the evening. On Wednesda; 
and Thursday and Friday the program would be repeated at th 
central points of sections three, four and five. Thus, during th 
week, an evening institute would be held in the county at each oj 
five points accessible to teachers, trustees and people of the su 
rounding school districts. 
          
   
    
   
   
    
     
     
      
    
    ONE SERIES EACH MONTH 
This would be all for the month of October; but in the moonlig 
week of November the superintendent would get another go 
lecturer for another series of five evening institutes, omitting o| 
of the five places visited before, in order to hold an institute at 
eentral point of the sixth section. Again in December th 
would be another week’s series, and others in January and F 
ruary and March and April. The institute would thus be spr 
over seven months of the school year, instead of being crowded i 
one week of from three to five consecutive days. 
One advantage over the present plan would be that the teac 
would be more active in the work of the institute. There b
-P-A-G-E-647
  IMPROVING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 625 
fewer teachers, each would have opportunity to take part in the 
discussions ; and many of them in each section of the county would 
be called upon, at some time during the year, to take the leading 
part in a discussion by preparing a short paper or talk upon some 
problem of school work with which they were familiar. Putting 
more of themselves into the institute, they would unquestionably 
get more out of it. 
TIME TO THINK IT OVER 
Again, there would be ample time for the assimilation of new ideas. 
After one evening of institute a whole month would elapse before 
the next session, plenty of time for reflection, for the interaction 
of old and new ideas upon each other, for, as it were, the mixing 
of the old and new into a solution, and the crystallization of an en- 
tirely new thought product. In other words, the mental food, 
thoroughly digested, would go to upbuild the intellectual system 
of the consumer. 
       
    
    
        
    
    
    
   
       
         
   PUBLIC GENERALLY BENEFITED 
Furthermore, trustees and patrons would be in attendance at the 
institutes, would take part in the discussions, and would view 
school matters from what would be to most of them an entirely 
mew and helpful standpoint. More or less complete sympathy 
nd hearty co-operation of teachers, trustees and parents might 
e hoped for as a result of the frequent interchange of ideas in such 
local institutes. Moreover, the people of every community in the 
county would be given opportunity to enjoy a series of first-class 
ducational lectures, as good as can be heard by residents of Los 
geles or San Francisco. Many of the great minds of the land 
e concerned with the means to make life on the farm better worth 
ing; and as one of the means to this end the evening institute 
ay well be of immense value to the community. 
WHERE THE SAVING COMES IN 
‘inally, in the matter of cost the local evening institute has an 
rmous advantage over the present plan. An excellent lecturer 
be employed for from $100 to $125 for five evenings. Other 
enses may bring the total cost to $150 a week, $900 for six series 
ughout the year. This would effect a saving of $2100 a year 
the cost of the present institute in Ventura County; or, as 
teachers would probably earn their salaries by teaching during 
week which they now spend at the institute, the school funds 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-648
Se he Ce 
626 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
would be drawn upon for $900 more than at present. But by the 
investment of this $900 there would be saved to the children of the 
county $3000 worth of schooling every year. 
FOUR EXCELLENT REASONS 
The next legislature, then, ought to pass a bill embodying an 
amendment to the present law, so as to permit the holding of local 
evening institutes in lieu of the present annual institute. It 
ought to do it, first, because the local institute will be, at least, 
as helpful to the teacher as the present institute; second, because 
it will be better for trustees and school patrons, ninety per cent 
of whom are now precluded from attendance; third, because its 
lectures will be an educational force of the highest value for the 
people of every community; and fourth, because it will save for 
the schooling of the children two-thirds of the large amount which 
the present institute costs.

    II. History or THe Inpiana Teacuers’ Reapine Circie 
[From the official booklet of the organization.] 
At a meeting of the Indiana Teachers’ Association, held at 
dianapolis, beginning December 26, 1883, the following reso- 
tions, introduced by W. A. Bell, were adopted : 
Resotvep, I. That the Association proceed at once to inaugu- 
ite an organization among the teachers of Indiana, for reading 
id study, to be known as the “Indiana Teachers’ Reading Circle.” 
Il. That this Circle be under the care and direction of the 
iana State Teachers’ Association. 
II. That this association proceed to choose a Board of Direc- 
, to which shall be intrusted the selection of a course of profes- 
al and literary reading, the issuing of certificates of progress 
the granting of diplomas as evidence of its completion. 
V. The Board of Directors of the Indiana Teachers’ Reading 
le shall consist of eight members, selected by the Association 
its own members, two of whom shall serve for one year, two 
wo years, two for three years, and two for four years, and here- 
two members shall be elected annually to serve for four years. 
Board shall elect its officers, arrange its meetings, and record 
ublish its proceedings. 
accordance with the above resolutions the President, Supt. 
S. Irwin, of Fort Wayne, appointed a committee consisting 
   
-P-A-G-E-650
  628 THE STATE AND THE TEACHER 
of W. A. Bell, H. S. Tarbell, and W. W. Grant, to select the Board 
of Directors. 4 
This committee, before the adjournment of the Association, 
announced the following persons to constitute the Board of 
Directors : 
Geo. P. Brown, J.J. Mills, 
Hubert M. Skinner, Emma Mont. McRae, 
Mattie Curl Dennis, Richard G. Boone, 
John C. McPherson, Harvey Hill. 
The first meeting of the Board of Directors was held at the State 
Building in Indianapolis on February 9, 1884. At this meeting a 
very full discussion of ways and means to be employed resulted 
in the appointment of a committee on plans of organization. A 
month later this committee reported the following plan :

  “1. Any teacher or other person in the State of Indiana ma, 
become a member of this circle by forwarding his name to th 
manager of his county, together with a pledge to faithfully pursu 
the prescribed course of study, and paying a fee of twenty-fiv 
cents for the present year, and for future years, such fees as ma 
be decided upon at the beginning of the year. 
2. In case there is no manager within a county, any teach 
may become a member of the State Circle and receive all the ben: 
fits of the same by applying to the manager of an adjoining count 
The members of the State Circle resident in any town, townsh 
or neighborhood, may form a local circle, which shall meet on| 
every week or fortnight, as they may elect, for the purpose of re 
ing and discussion. 
3. Each local Circle shall elect a secretary, whose name shall 
reported to the County Manager, and who shall act as the medi 
of communication between the local circle and the county mana, 
but this provision shall not preclude the possibility of individ 
who are not members of a local circle reporting directly to 
county manager. 
4. The general direction of the work in each county shall

at the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
7. It shall be the duty of the State Board of Directors to arrange 
and prescribe two or more courses of readings, along which the read-

but the amount of reading to be done within any given time and 
other details of the work not herein provided for shall be arranged 
by the county manager in conjunction ‘with the secretaries of the

                      The State Board of Education has recognized the importance 
the Teachers’ Reading Circle to the profession by offering 
edits on examination for county and State licenses. At the 
ctober meeting, 1885, the following order was passed by the 
ard : 
“Ordered, that the Reading Circle examinations in the Science 
Teaching (Science of Education or Theory) be accepted by the 
unty Superintendents in place of the county examinations on 
t subject, and that the average of their four successive yearly 
minations in the Science of Teaching be accepted by the State 
rd of Education in the examinations for State Certificates.” 
gain, at the May meeting, 1896, the following order was 
nimously adopted : 
Ordered, that the Reading Circle examination in the General 
ure book be accepted by the County Superintendents in place 
e county examinations in literature, and that the average of 
four successive yearly examinations in the General Culture 
be accepted by the State Board of Education in the exami- 
s for State Certificates.”

The growth of interest has been most gratifying. It is no 
an unusual thing for a new venture to meet with success in thé 
beginning, and then gradually lose its hold and pass into neglect, 
leaving little but a remembered failure. But the Indi-#1é 
Teachers’ Reading Circle has steadily grown, each year -ully 
justifying its existence by the improvement in the work done 
in the schools as a direct result of the fostering of highéf édu- 
cational standards, and of encouraging a finer professional 
spirit. 
The membership for 1887-1888 was, in round numbers, seven 
thousand, every county in the State, and in thirty counties 
almost every district, being represented in this faembership. 
At present the membership is about fourteen thousand. 
In 1887 a proposal to organize a Children’s Reading Circl

THE STATE AND THE CHILD 
' The State: Its Parental Responsibility and Police Power. — 
Any deep-seeing account of the nineteenth century develop- 
ment of those social practices and institutions which have given 
distinctive character to the culture of western nations, would 
ot fail to dwell upon that succession of events that have resulted 
the continued and conspicuous aggression by the state into 
at territory, assigned by the old common law, and recognized. 
the established political philosophies, for the exercise of the 
eming natural liberties of the individual. Such extending 
te oversight of those numerous activities, which from their 
ent and influence are to be broadly classified as educational, 
ears to have two principal motives. The state first assumes 
become the Great Parent, to protect and to conserve chil- 
n for themselves. It assumes secondly to become the Great 
er, to restrain, to compel and to provide for the promotion 
e public welfare, which means for its own sake. The one 
ntered in the constant of human sympathy; the other is 
rmined, by the iron law of social self-preservation. 
materials assembled in this and the succeeding chapter 
epresentative of the contemporary attitude of the Ameri- 
tates for devising those conditions whereby children may 
ss at least the minimum of opportunity to receive that 
education and training which are inherent in the responsi- 
s of parenthood; and whereby children may enjoy those

[From Giddings, Franklin H., The Social and Legal Aspect of 
Compulsory Education and Child Labor (Proceedings of thd 
National Education Association, 1905, pp. 111-113).] 
The educational problem and the industrial problem of child 
labor cannot be separated. This is true, whether every parent 
is permitted to deal as he will with his child, or whether he is 
compelled, as in most American commonwealths, to withhold his 
child from gainful employment and to keep him in a school, o1 
otherwise to provide systematic instruction for him, during certait 
weeks of each year. Child labor itself is a kind of education which, 
according to its nature and extent, may be consistent or altogether 
inconsistent with other kinds. The labor that American boys an 
girls had to perform on the farm a generation and more ago wa: 
often an invaluable discipline of mind and character, fitting the 
for self-reliant and useful careers quite as effectively as thei 
meager school training did. Such labor did not necessarily u 
the child for the enjoyment of the highest educational advantag 
Exhausting confinement in stores, sweat-shops and factories 
child labor of an altogether different sort. It is antagonistic 
the child’s mental and physical development and it cannot be co! 
bined with any sound educational policy. 
Compulsory education by the state and the prohibition of ¢ 
labor are policies undoubtedly socialistic in character. T 
assert the supremacy of the state’s interest in the child as agaij 
any opposing interest of the parent. The American people h 
never been afraid of socialism to this extent, and within the 
ten years it has greatly extended both compulsory education 
the prohibition of the labor of children between ten and fo 
years of age. It would not be inaccurate to say that public si 
ment at the present time in New England, in the Northwest, 
in most of the North Central states demands an increasingly 
enforcement of child-labor legislation, and that a similar senti 
is rapidly growing in the South. 
This policy encounters, however, important obstacles, 
call for intelligent examination. Not much difficulty has 
encountered in the courts. The constitutionality of both co} 
sory school attendance and of the restriction of child emplo 
in the interest of health, intelligence, morals, and citizen: 
everywhere upheld. The real difficulties are of quite aj 
character.

THE STATE AND THE CHILD 637 
It is not easy to maintain the administrative machinery to en- 
force child-labor restriction and the truancy laws. Experience 
has shown that compulsory school attendance is itself the best 
enforcement of the laws against child-labor; but this is difficult 
where school accommodations are inadequate, and where popu- 
lation is either dense and heterogeneous, as in the tenement-house 
quarters of our great cities, or sparse and indifferent to educational 
interests, as in the mountain regions of the South. 
, A very special difficulty and one that puts all our theories and 
our devices to the severest test, is that which is presented by desti- 
tute families. The practical question, which has to be answered 
over and over, is: Is it right to take a strong overgrown boy thir- 
teen years of age, from money-earning employment, and force 
him to attend school, when by so doing, we compel a widowed 
mother to apply to private or public agencies for help, thereby mak- 
ing her, and perhaps the boy also, a pauper? 
The only answer to this question, consistent with the policy of 
compulsory education itself, is the proposition that in such cases 
ladequate public assistance should be given, not as charity, but as 
right. To shrink from this course because it is socialistic is 
oroughly illogical and inconsistent. Compulsory education itself, 
s I have said, is socialism pure and simple. State interference 
ith the parent’s disposition of the child’s energy and time is a 
rther extension of socialism. These policies have never been 
ything but socialistic. They never by any possibility can be 
thing less than socialistic. Let us, therefore, not balk at a fur- 
er provision by the state which happens to be necessary to make 
em effective. Let us make our socialistic scheme complete and 
sistent, or confess that it is altogether wrong and abandon it. 
final and deeper difficulty exists, which has received curiously 
le attention. We hear a great deal lately about “ race suicide.” 
‘ge families are no longer seen, especially in the so-called middle 
s. It is strange that no one has pointed out the connection 
een the increased demand upon parents to maintain their 
dren in school, foregoing the earnings that children might add 
he family income, and the diminishing size of the average 
ily. The connection, however, is undoubtedly a real one, and 
practical inference is obvious. If the restriction of child- 
is desirable, if compulsory education is desirable, and if at 
ame time larger families also are desirable, the state must 
up to the family at least some part of the income that 
en could earn if they were permitted freely to enter upon 
trial employments. The question, therefore, that we shall 
ito face and to answer is this: Shall the state pay parents for

keeping their children in school between the ages of ten and four- 
teen? This would be a policy of socialism, undoubtedly. I do 
not pretend to say whether the American people will or will not 
adopt it. I only say that, as a matter of social causation, they 
will be compelled to adopt it, if they try to maintain both large 
families and compulsory education, while prohibiting child labor 
in department stores and factories. It is not my intention to ad- 
vocate the measure, or to argue against it. My purpose is served 
in calling your attention to the logic of facts. | 
In the development of the policy of state compulsion for 
guaranteeing educational privileges to children, Massachusetts 
has been a pioneer. Her first compulsory attendance law, if 
certain colonial and pre-revolutionary measures regarding 
schools be excepted, was passed in 1852. It required, however, 
nearly a half a century of nurturing a favorable public opinio: 
and perfecting the necessary administrative machinery befor 
this first ineffective statute was brought to a form capable o 
successful enforcement. The requirements of Massachusett, 
have served as a guide for a great majority of the America; 
states, all of which now (1915), excepting Alabama, Florid: 
Georgia, and Mississippi, have statutes regulating and enfor 
ing the school attendance of children.

CHAPTER XXVIL 
THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES 
Legalized Humanitarianism.—In no respect has modern 
humanitarianism left a more characteristic impress than in the 
matter of the legalized treatment of children who belong to the 
so-called special classes — defectives, dependents, delinquents. 
The contemporary attitude assumed toward these classes by the 
general social mind, by the law, and by the school is reflected 
in the three selections that follow: 
I. Drrectives 
The Classification of Exceptional Children 
[From Van Sickle, J. H., et al., Provision for Exceptional Children 
in Public Schools, Bulletin No. 14, 1911, U. S. Bureau of 
Education, pp. 19-23.] 
We assume that this bulletin is addressed to those who are 
interested primarily in questions relating to the proper treatment 
of exceptional children rather than in a scientific classification based 
upon a recognition of the causes of exceptional character in children. 
The most significant distinction is that between children who can 
not properly be educated in the public schools and children who 
can be adequately instructed and trained in day classes. We 
shall therefore make our primary classification the distinction 
between institution cases and public-school cases. 
It is difficult to state any one basis for the establishment of this 
lassification. There are at least three grounds for this distinc- 
jon. In the first place, there are children idiotic and imbecile, 
hildren morally degenerate and delinquent, children severely 
rippled or suffering from a disease like epilepsy, whom any super- 
tendent would recognize as being unfit for association with nor- 
al children in the grade. Many of these children are the subjects 
custodial treatment only, even inside the institution in which 
ley may be segregated.    
   
          
     
    
    
    
   655
-P-A-G-E-678
EEE 
656 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
A second basis for this distinction has reference to the cura- 
bility or relative permanence of the child’s condition. Certain 
children who are approximately normal in appearance and in 
mental character are yet hopelessly degenerate. For their own 
safety and for the safety of the children with whom they may 
be associated in the public schools, it is desirable that they should 
be removed from the schools and placed in institutions. Some of 
them are educable and can perhaps be trained in the public day 
schools, but it would be undesirable for them to be thus treated. 
The most dangerous types of moral imbeciles come in this class. 
These children some competent authority connected with the 
public-school system should be quick to recognize. Experts should 
be called in and the school authorities ought to lend their every 
assistance to obtain legal sanction for the segregation of these chil- 
dren in special institutions, in order that they may not pass their 
lives among normal children, with the danger of moral contagion 
and the possibility of propagating their kind. 
The third basis for the distinction between an institutional and 
a public-school case is amenability to treatment in the public 
schools and institutions. It stands to reason that an institution 
which controls every hour of a child’s existence — sleeping or awake 
— ought to be able to provide more effective training for difficult 
cases than can the public schools in day classes. In distinguishing 
between those cases which should be sent to institutions and those 
which should not we must take into consideration whether the 
child requires the kind of work which the public school cannot 
supply in day classes. 
A most confusing circumstance arises from the fact that the 
various types of exceptional children shade off into normal types 
of children. From children who are slightly slow and dull by 
nature, there is a steady gradation through children that are 
only touched with feeble-mindedness to children who are classified 
in institutions as “high-grade imbeciles,” ‘“ middle-grade im- 
beciles,” “low-grade imbeciles,” “superficial, and profound 
idiots.”” Ordinary teachers, superintendents, and casual observers 
will have no difficulty whatever in excluding idiots and low-grad 
imbeciles from the public schools. Indeed, it is very rare tha 
children below the grade of middle-grade imbeciles are foun 
in the public schools. The border-land cases, high-grade im; 
beciles, perhaps even middle-grade imbeciles, will be inte 
preted very diversely by those who are not familiar with the 
classes of children. Some teachers and superintendents wi 
think that they have in middle-grade imbeciles very good m: 
terial to work with in the public schools; whereas expert opini      
     
    
     
    
         
  
-P-A-G-E-679
ee ee 
THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES 657 
may advise the removal of such children from public day classes 
to institutions. 
Another circumstance is that many children are what some call 
apparently feeble-minded or imbecile; that is to say, they present 
all of the features of permanent imbecility excepting that they 
very rapidly recover or are restored to approximately normal 
condition under proper physical and mental treatment. Some 
distinguish these types of children as suffering on the one hand 
from imbecility and on the other from pseudo-imbecility. We 
distinguish between them as being permanently feeble-minded or 
imbecile, and curably retarded in development. Two children 
may present exactly similar characters and yet one child may, 
as the result of a year’s special training, be restored to the grades 
and be capable of continuing in the grades and making normal 
progress; whereas the other child may, after a year’s trial, be 
finally sent to the institution to which he should have been sent 
without the waste of a year’s time. 
The expert is more capable of classifying children into these two 
groups of institutional and public-school cases than is the unin- 
structed teacher or layman; but there are doubtful cases where 
even expert opinion is unable to decide. There will, therefore, 
always be reason for keeping some of these children in special 
classes, under observation pending a final diagnosis. 
We shall now briefly and concisely distinguish between those 
cases which we regard as institutional and the cases of those whom 
we regard as susceptible of treatment in special classes. It will 
be necessary for us to recognize a third group, comprising types of 
children concerning whose treatment, whether in institutions or 
in public day classes, there may be diversity of opinion and prac- 
tice. It must be premised that our treatment is largely experi- 
‘mental and will probably remain so for many years to come. What 
lace institutions for the training of blind, deaf, and other types 
f exceptional children shall play in the future and especially in 
hose communities which are approaching this problem for the 
rst time, it is impossible for us to say. Modern criticism of 
stitutional life has led to many reforms in institutional procedure. 
uch objection that can at present be laid against many institu- 
ions for children will undoubtedly be set aside in the future as 
stitutions encourage and develop separation into small groups; 
example, separate homes or cottages. There can be no doubt 
t an institution which need not consider per capita cost can 
vide children with homes and schools of a character which will 
serve the whole life of the child. On the other hand, there is 
trong tendency toward the unification of all educational insti- 
20 
     
      
    
       
       
            
       
-P-A-G-E-680
  658 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
tutions and there is little doubt but that the public schools will 
be held responsible by many communities for the educational treat- 
ment of types of children who in the past have been committed to 
special institutions. For some cases, ¢.g., persistent truants, dis- 
ciplinary cases, children suffering from ill health, children who are a 
heavy economic tax upon theirfamilies and children whose home life 
negatives completely the influence of the school, the public schools 
of the future may be required by an awakened community to pro- 
vide parental schools, where children will be boarded as well as 
educated, and where the advantages of home training and disci- 
pline will be combined with the special class of instruction. 
The grouping which we make, therefore, is to be regarded as a 
tentative or temporary effort, one which we shall feel under no 
obligation to defend but which we embody in this bulletin for the 
purpose of assisting in clarifying the thought of those who are 
professionally interested in the treatment of exceptional children.

    SPECIAL MESSAGE 
the Senate and House of Representatives : 
On January 25-26, 1909, there assembled in this city, on my 
itation, a conference on the care of dependent children. To 
s conference there came from nearly every State in the Union 
and women actively engaged in the care of dependent chil- 
, and they represented all the leading religious bodies. 
‘he subject considered is one of high importance to the well- 
g of the nation. The Census Bureau reported in 1904 that 
e were in orphanages and children’s homes about 93,000 de- 
ent children. There are probably 50,000 more (the precise 
ber never having been ascertained) in private homes, either 
ard or in adopted homes provided by the generosity of foster 
ts. In addition to these there were 25,000 children in insti- 
s for juvenile delinquents.

I S_E_— A 
660 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
Each of these children represents either a potential addition 
to the productive capacity and the enlightened citizenship of the 
nation, or, if allowed to suffer from neglect, a potential addition 
to the destructive forces of the community. The ranks of crimi- 
nals and other enemies of society are recruited in an altogether 
undue proportion from children bereft of their natural homes and 
left without sufficient care. 
The interests of the nation are involved in the welfare of thi: 
army of children no less than in our great material affairs. 
Notwithstanding a wide diversity of views and methods repre- 
sented in the conference, and notwithstanding the varying legis- 
lative enactments and policies of the States from which the mem- 
bers came, the conference, at the close of its sessions, unanimously 
adopted a series of declarations expressing the conclusions whick 
they had reached. These constitute a wise, constructive, anc 
progressive program of child-caring work. If given full effect 
by the proper agencies, existing methods and practices in almost 
every community would be profoundly and advantageously 
modified. 
More significant even than the contents of the declarations i: 
the fact that they were adopted without dissenting vote and witl 
every demonstration of hearty approval on the part of all present. 
They constitute a standard of accepted opinion by which each com- 
munity should measure the adequacy of its existing methods anc 
to which each community should seek to conform its legislatior 
and its practice. 
The keynote of the conference was expressed in these words :   
   
   
      
     
   
   
   Home life is the highest and finest product of civilization. Childr 
should not be deprived of it except for urgent and compelling reasons. 
Surely poverty alone should not disrupt the home. Parents 
good character suffering from temporary misfortune, and abo 
all deserving mothers fairly well able to work but deprived of 
support of the normal breadwinner, should be given such aid 
may be necessary to enable them to maintain suitable homes 
the rearing of their children. The widowed or deserted mo: 
if a good woman, willing to work and to do her best, should o; 
narily be helped in such fashion as will enable her to bring 
her children herself in their natural home. Children from 
homes, and children who have no homes, who must be care 
by charitable agencies, should, so far as practicable, be car 
in families. * * 
I further urge that nae legislation be enacted as may be

sary in order to bring the laws and practices in regard to the care 
of dependent children in all federal territory into harmony with 
the other conclusions reached by the conference. 
Legislation for the District of Columbia 
Congress took a step in the direction of the conclusions of this 
conference in 1893, when, on the recommendation of the late 
‘Amos G. Warner, then superintendent of charities for the District 
of Columbia, the Board of Children’s Guardians was created, with 
authority, among other things, to place children in family homes. 
‘That board has made commendable progress, and its work should 
be strengthened and extended. 
I recommend legislation for the District of Columbia in accord- 
ance with the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth sections of the con- 
clusions of the conference, as follows: 
1. That the approval of the Board of Charities be required for 
the incorporation of all child-caring agencies, as well as amendments 
of the charter of any benevolent corporation which includes child- 
caring work, and that other than duly incorporated agencies be 
forbidden to engage in the care of needy children. This legislation 
is needed in order to insure the fitness and responsibility of those 
who propose to undertake the care of helpless children. Such 
aws have long been in satisfactory operation in several of the 
arger States of the Union. 
2. That the Board of Charities, through its duly authorized 
gents, shall inspect the work of all agencies which care for depend- 
t children, whether by institutional or by home-finding methods, 
d whether supported by public or private funds. The state has 
lways jealously guarded the interests of children whose parents 
ve been able to leave them property by requiring the appoint- 
mt of a guardian, under bond, accountable directly to the courts, 
en though there be a competent surviving parent. Surely the 
erests of the child who is not only an orphan but penniless ought 
be no less sacred than those of the more fortunate orphan who 
erits property. If the protection of the Government is neces- 
in the one case, it is even more necessary in the other. If we 
to require that only incorporated institutions shall be allowed 
ngage in this responsible work, it is necessary to provide for 
lic inspection, lest the state should become the unconscious 
ner of those who either from ignorance or inefficiency are un- 
d to deal with the problem.

vision of the board of education, in order that these children may 
enjoy educational advantages equal to those of the other children. 
Normal school life comes next to normal home life in the process of 
securing the fullest development of the child. 
4. That all agencies engaged in child-caring work in the District 
of Columbia be required by law to adopt adequate methods of 
investigation and make permanent records relative to children 
under their care, and to exercise faithful personal supervision over 
their wards until legally adopted or otherwise clearly beyond thd 
need of further supervision; the forms and methods of such inves- 
tigation, records, and supervision to be prescribed and enforced 
by the Board of Charities. 
I deem such legislation as is herein recommended not only im- 
portant for the welfare of the children immediately concerned, but 
important as setting an example of a high standard of child protec- 
tion by the National Government to the several States of the 
Union, which should be able to look to the nation for leadership 
in such matters. 
I herewith transmit a copy of the full text of the proceedings.

     The White House, Feb. 15, 1909. 
Hon. THEODORE RoosEveELt, 
President of the United States. 
Sir: having been invited by you to participate in a conferen 
on the care of dependent children, held at Washington, D. 
January 25-26, 1909, and having considered at the sessions of su 
conference the various phases of the subject as stated in the mem| 
randum accompanying your letter of invitation, and such oth 
as have been brought before us by the executive committee, 
desire to express the very great satisfaction felt by each mem! 
of this conference in the deep interest you have taken in the w 
being of dependent children. The proper care of destitute ¢ 
dren has indeed an important bearing upon the welfare of 
nation. We now know so little about them as not even to 
their number, but we know that there are in institutions al 
93,000, and that many additional thousands are in foster or bo: 
ing homes. As a step, therefore, in the conservation of the prot 
tive capacity of the people and the preservation of high stan 
of citizenship, and also because each of these children is en 
to receive humane treatment, adequate care, and proper educ: 
your action in calling this conference, and your participati 
its opening and closing sessions, will have, we believe, a pro!

offect upon the well-being of many thousands of children, and upon 
the nation as a whole. 
Concerning the particular objects to which you called attention 
in the invitation to this conference, and the additional subjects 
brought before us by the executive committee, our conclusions are 
is follows : 
Home Care 
1. Home life is the highest and finest product of civilization. 
[t is the great molding force of mind and of character. Children 
should not be deprived of it except for urgent and compelling 
reasons. Children of parents of worthy character, suffering from 
temporary misfortune and children of reasonably efficient and 
Jeserving mothers who are without the support of the normal 
oreadwinner, should, as a rule, be kept with their parents, such 
uid being given as may be necessary to maintain suitable homes 
or the rearing of the children. This aid should be given by such 
nethods and from such sources as may be determined by the gen- 
ral relief policy of each community, preferably in the form of 
rivate charity, rather than of public relief. Except in unusual 
‘ircumstances, the home should not be broken up for reasons of 
overty, but only for considerations of inefficiency or immorality.    
     
       
     
    
    
   
       
   Preventive Work 
2. The most important and valuable philanthropic work is not 
le curative, but the preventative; to check dependency by a 
rough study of its causes and by effectively remedying or eradi- 
ing them should be the constant aim of society. Along these 
s we urge upon all friends of children the promotion of effective 
sures, including legislation, to prevent blindness; to check 
lerculosis and other diseases in dwellings and work places, and 
‘ies in hazardous occupations; to secure compensation or 
rance so as to provide a family income in case of sickness, 
lent, death, or invalidism of the breadwinner; to promote 
-labor reforms, and, generally, to improve the conditions 
nding child life. To secure these ends we urge efficient 
ration with all other agencies for social betterment. 
Home Finding 
s to the children who for sufficient reasons must be removed 
heir own homes, or who have no homes, it is desirable that, 
al in mind and body, and not requiring special training,
-P-A-G-E-686
EESSSS'’S3 
664 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
they should be cared for in families whenever practicable. The 
carefully selected foster home is for the normal child the best 
substitute for the natural home. Such homes should be selectec 
by a most careful process of investigation, carried on by skilled 
agents through personal investigation and with due regard to the 
religious faith of the child. After children are placed in homes, 
adequate visitation, with careful consideration of the physical, 
mental, moral, and spiritual training and development of each 
child on the part of the responsible home-finding agency is essen- 
tial. 
It is recognized that for many children foster homes without 
payment for board are not practicable immediately after the 
children become dependent and that for children requiring tem- 
porary care only the free home is not available. For the tem- 
porary, or more or less permanent, care of such children different 
methods are in use, notably the plan of placing them in families 
paying for their board and the plan of institutional care. Con: 
tact with family life is preferable for these children, as well as fot 
other normal children. It is necessary, however, that a large 
number of carefully selected boarding homes be found if thes¢ 
children are to be cared for in families. The extent to which suc! 
families can be found should be ascertained by careful inquir: 
and experiment of each locality. Unless and until such homes ar 
found, the use of institutions is necessary.     
        
    
    
    
    
   
   
    
   Cottage System 
4. So far as it may be found necessary temporarily or peri 
nently to care for certain classes of children in institutions, th 
institutions should be conducted on the cottage plan, in or 
that routine and impersonal care may not unduly suppress it 
viduality and initiative. The cottage unit should not be la 
than will permit effective personal relations between the a 
caretaker or caretakers of each cottage and each child ther 
Twenty-five is suggested as a desirable cottage unit, subjec 
revision in the light of further experience in the manageme: 
cottage institutions. The cottage plan is probably some 
more expensive, both in construction and in maintenance, tha: 
congregate system. It is so, however, only because it secur 
the children a larger degree of association with adults and a 
approach to the conditions of family life, which are requir 
the proper molding of childhood. These results more than j 
the increased outlay and are truly economical. Child- 
agencies, whether supported by public or private funds, sho
-P-A-G-E-687

ll legitimate means press for adequate financial support. Inferior 
nethods should never be accepted by reason of lack of funds with- 
mut continuing protest. Cheap care of children is ultimately enor- 
nously expensive, and is unworthy of a strong community. Ex- 
sting congregate institutions should so classify their inmates and 
egregate them into groups as to secure as many of the benefits of 
he cottage system as possible, and should look forward to the 
idoption of the cottage type when new buildings are constructed. 
The sending of children of any age or class to almshouses is an 
inqualified evil, and should be forbidden everywhere by law, with 
uitable penalty for its violation. 
Incorporation 
5. To engage in the work of caring for needy children is to assume 
, most serious responsibility, and should, therefore, be permitted 
nly to those who are definitely organized for the purpose, who are 
f suitable character, and possess, or have reasonable assurance of 
ecuring, the funds needed for their support. The only practicable 
lan of securing this end is to require the approval, by a state 
oard of charities or other body exercising similar powers, of the 
ncorporation of all child-caring agencies, including the approval 
f any amendments of the charter of a benevolent corporation, if 
is to include child-caring work; and by forbidding other than 
uly incorporated agencies to engage in the care of needy children.    
       
     
      
    
       State Inspection 
6. The proper training of destitute children being essential 
the well-being of the State, it is a sound public policy that the 
te, through its duly authorized representative, should inspect 
work of all agencies which care for dependent children, whether 
institutional or by home-finding methods, and whether sup- 
ited by public or private funds. Such inspection should be 
le by trained agents, should be thorough, and the results thereof 
ld be reported to the responsible authorities of the institution 
gency concerned. The information so secured should be 
dential, not to be disclosed except by competent authority. 
Inspection of Educational Work 
Destitute children at best labor under many disadvantages 
e deprived in greater or less degree of the assistance and 
ce which parents afford their own children. It is important,
-P-A-G-E-688
EEE _— 
666 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
therefore, that such children be given an education which will fi 
them for self-support and for the duties of citizenship, and th 
State should provide therefor. In order that this education ma, 
be equal to that afforded by the schools attended by the othe 
children of the community, it is desirable that the education o 
children in orphan asylums and other similar institutions or place 
in families should be under the supervision of the educatione 
authorities of the State. 
Facts and Records 
8. The proper care of a child in the custody of a child-carin 
agency, as well as the wise decision as to the period of his retentio 
and ultimate disposition to be made of him, involve a knowledg 
of the character and circumstances of his parents, or survivin 
parent, and near relatives, both before and at the time the chil 
becomes dependent, and subsequently. One unfortunate featur 
of child-caring work hitherto is the scanty information availabl 
as to the actual careers of children who have been reared under th 
care of charitable agencies. This applies both to institution 
which too frequently lose sight of the children soon after they leav 
their doors, and home-finding agencies which too frequently hav 
failed to exercise supervision adequate to enable them to judge o 
the real results of their work. It is extremely desirable that, ta 
ing all precautions to prevent injury or embarrassment to tho: 
who have been the subjects of charitable care, the agencies whi 
have been responsible for the care of children should know to wh: 
station in life they attain and what sort of citizens they beco 
Only in this manner can they form a correct judgment of t 
results of their efforts. 
We believe, therefore, that every child-caring agency should 
(a) Secure full information concerning the character and 
cumstances of the parents and near relatives of each child in wh 
behalf application is made, through personal investigation by 
own representative, unless adequate information is supplied 
some other reliable agency. 
(b) Inform itself by personal investigation at least once each 
of the circumstances of the parents of children in its charge, w 
the parents have been legally deprived of guardianship, and w 
this information is supplied by some other responsible agenc; 
(c) Exercise supervision over children under their care until 
children are legally adopted, are returned to their parents, 
their majority, or are clearly beyond the need of further super 
(d) Make a permanent record of all information thus sec

Physical Care 
9. The physical condition of children who become the subject 
of charitable care has received inadequate consideration. Each 
child received into the care of such an agency should be carefully 
examined by a competent physician, especially for the purpose of 
ascertaining whether such peculiarities, if any, as the child pre- 
sents may be due to any defect of the sense organs or to other 
physical defect. Both institutions and placing-out agencies should 
take every precaution to secure proper medical and surgical care 
of their children and should see that suitable instruction is given 
them in matters of health and hygiene. 
Cooperation 
10. Great benefit can be derived from a close cooperation be- 
tween the various child-caring agencies, institutional and other- 
wise, in each locality. It is especially desirable that harmonious 
relations be established in regard to the classes of children to be 
received by each agency, the relations of such agencies to the 
parents of children received, and the subsequent oversight of 
children passing from the custody of child-caring agencies. The 
establishment of a joint bureau of investigation and information 
by all the child-caring agencies of each locality is highly com- 
mended, in the absence of any other suitable central agency through 
hich they may cooperate.      
     
        
      
       
      
   Undesirable Legislation 
11. We greatly deprecate the tendency of legislation in some 
tates to place unnecessary obstacles in the way of placing children 
family homes in such States by agencies whose headquarters 
e elsewhere, in view of the fact that we favor the care of desti- 
te children, normal in mind and body, in families, whenever 
cticable. 
erecognize the right of each State to protect itself from vicious, 
leased, or defective children from other States by the enactment 
reasonable protective legislation; but experience proves that 
reception of healthy normal children is not only an act of 
anthropy, but also secures a valuable increment to the popu- 
m of the community and an ultimate increase of its wealth.

668 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
We earnestly protest, therefore, against such legislation as is 
prohibitive in form or in effect, and urge that where it exists it be 
repealed. | 
Permanent Organization 
12. The care of dependent children is a subject about which 
nearly every session of the legislature of every State in the Union 
concerns itself; it is a work in which State and local authorities 
in many States are engaged, and in which private agencies are 
active in every State. Important decisions are being made con- 
stantly by associations, institutions, and public authorities affect- 
ing questions of policy, the type of buildings to be constructed, 
the establishment of an adequate system of investigating homes 
and visiting children placed in homes, and scores of important 
matters affecting the well-being of needy children. Each of these 
decisions should be made with full knowledge of the experience of 
other States and agencies, and of the trend of opinion among those 
most actively engaged in the care of children, and able to speak 
from wide experience and careful observation. One effective means 
of securing this result would be the establishment of a permanent 
organization to undertake, in this field, work comparable to that 
carried on by the National Playground Association, the National 
Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, the 
National Child Labor Committee, and other similar organizations 
in their respective fields. It is our judgment that the establish-; 
ment of such a permanent voluntary organization, under auspice: 
which would insure a careful consideration of all points of view, 
broad mindedness and tolerance, would be desirable and helpful 
if reasonably assured of adequate financial support.     
      
         
      Federal Children’s Bureau 
13. A bill is pending in Congress for the establishment of 
federal children’s bureau to collect and disseminate informati 
affecting the welfare of children. In our judgment the est: 
lishment of such a bureau is desirable, and we earnestly recomm: 
the enactment of the pending measure. 
Summary 
14. The preceding suggestions may be almost completely s 
marized in this—that the particular conditions and nee 
each destitute child should be carefully studied and that he sh 
receive that care and treatment which his individual needs req

and which should be as nearly as possible like the life of the other 
children of the community. 
15. We respectfully recommend that you send to Congress a 
message urging favorable action upon the bill for a federal chil- 
dren’s bureau and the enactment of such legislation as will bring 
the laws and the public administration of the District of Columbia 
and other federal territory into harmony with the principles and 
conclusions herein stated, and we further recommend that you 
cause to be transmitted to the governor of each State of the Union 
a copy of the proceedings of this conference for the information of 
the state board of charities or other body exercising similar powers.

[From Mack, Julian W., “The Law and the Child,” Survey, Vol. 
23 (1910), pp. 638-643.] 
The legal questions involved in the problem of the delinquent 
hild, while not complicated, have nevertheless given rise to some 
iscussion and to some slight dissent from the standpoint of the 
nstitutional law. 
We are familiar with the conception that the state is the higher 
ultimate parent of all the dependents within its borders. What- 
er may have been the historical origin of the practice, we know 
at for over two centuries the Courts of Chancery in England have 
lercised jurisdiction for the protection of the unfortunate child, 
evidenced by judgments of the House of Lords and of the 
ncellors.
-P-A-G-E-692
  EE ESSSS’’='S:'3~ 
670 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
The proposition that the Court of Chancery could not act unless 
the infant had property, has been declared in many cases to be 
wholly unsupported by either principle or authority. 
In the early case of Cowles vs. Cowles (3 Gilman, 435, 1846), 
Caton, J., said: 
The power of the Court of Chancery to interfere with and control not 
only the estates but the persons of all minors within the limits of its juris- 
diction, is of very ancient origin and cannot now be questioned. This is a 
power which must necessarily exist somewhere in every well-regulated so- 
ciety, and more especially in a republican government. A jurisdiction thus 
extensive and liable, as we have seen, to enter into the domestic relations — 
of every family in the community, is necessarily of a very delicate and even 
of a very embarrassing nature ; and yet its exercise is indispensable in every 
well-governed society. It is indispensably necessary to protect the persons 
and preserve the property of those who are unable to protect and take care 
of themselves. 
And shortly thereafter in the case of Miner vs. Miner [11 IIl., 
40 (1849)], he enunciated the practically unanimous American,” 
doctrine that the parents’ rights are always “subject to control 
by the Court of Chancery when the best interests of the child 
demand it.” 
Support was found for the erroneous contention that a property 
interest is essential to jurisdiction in the fact that, until compar-- 
atively recent times, the aid of the court in England was seldom 
sought except when the child had an independent fortune; but, as 
was said by Lord Eldon, whose decree in the Wellesley case [2 
Russ., 1 (1827)] was affirmed by the House of Lords [2 Bligh, N. S., 
124 (1827)]: 
It is not from any want of jurisdiction that it does not act, but from 
want of means to exercise its jurisdiction, because the court cannot tak 
upon itself the maintenance of all the children in the kingdom. It cai 
exercise this jurisdiction fully and practically only where it has the mean| 
of applying property for the maintenance of the infant. 
        
     
   
   
    
     
   
   This want has been met both through the extension of paren 
obligations and through public grants of money or institutions fi 
the support, maintenance, and education of the children. 
While in most jurisdictions the Juvenile Court laws make pi 
vision for the dependent as well as for the neglected, the truant 
the delinquent child, some of the best workers in this field hi 
objected to a court having anything to do with the strictly depe} 
ent child — the child whose parents must ask assistance met 
because of poverty or misfortune. If friends or the church
-P-A-G-E-693
THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES 671 
and the aid of the state is sought, it should be granted through poor 
law or relief commissioners, they argue. The court should be called 
upon to act only in the case of a persistent truant or a victim of 
neglect or wrong-doing on the part of others or of itself. 
| It is particularly in dealing with those children who have broken 
the law or who are leading the kind of life which will inevitably 
result in lawbreaking, that the new and distinctive features of the 
Juvenile Court legislation appear. 
Our common criminal law did not differentiate between the 
adult and the minor who had reached the age of criminal respon- 
sibility — seven at common law and in some of our states, ten in 
others, with a chance of escape up to twelve if lacking in mental 
and moral maturity. The fundamental thought in our criminal 
jurisprudence was not, and in most jurisdictions is not, reformation 
of the criminal, but punishment; punishment as expiation for the 
wrong, punishment as a warning to other possible wrongdoers. 
The child was arrested, put into prison, indicted by the grand jury, 
ried by a petit jury, under all the forms and technicalities of our 
criminal law, with the aim of ascertaining whether it had done the 
specific act — nothing else — and if it had, then of inflicting the 
punishment of the state upon it. 
It is true that in the modern reformatories which supplanted 
the penitentiary for youthful offenders guilty of serious crimes, 
an endeavor was made, while punishing, to reform, so that at the 
expiration of his term the prisoner could go out into the world ca- 
pable at least of making an honest living. And in course of time, 
in some jurisdictions, youths were separated from older offenders 
even in police stations, jails, and workhouses. But the state 
criminalized the boys in its very effort to reform them. Instead 
of aiming to find out the history of the accused lad, his heredity, 
environment, associations; how he had come to do the act which 
brought him before the court, it asked but one question, ‘‘ Has he 
vommitted this crime?” If the answer was “ Yes” it did not 
leven then inquire, ‘‘ What is the best thing to do for him?” It 
id not punish him in a manner that would tend to improve him. 
‘he punishment was proportioned to the degree of wrongdoing 
videnced by the single act; not by the needs of the boy, not by 
he needs of the state. 
To-day, however, the thinking public is putting another sort 
f question, Why is it not just and proper to treat these juvenile 
enders as we do neglected children, as a wise and merciful father 
ndles his own child whose errors are not discovered by the 
thorities, by finding out what he is, physically, mentally, morally, 
id then if he is treading the path that leads to criminality, by   
   
-P-A-G-E-694
      
672 = THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
taking him in charge, not so much to punish as to reform, not to 
degrade but to uplift, not to crush but to develop, to make him 
not a criminal but a worthy citizen. 
And it is this thought that predominates to-day; that the 
child who has begun to go wrong, who is incorrigible, who has 
broken a law or an ordinance, is to be taken in hand by the state 
not as an enemy but as a protector, as the ultimate guardian, be- 
cause the unwillingness or the inability of the natural parents to 
guide it toward good citizenship has compelled its intervention. 
‘This principle, which to some extent was applied earlier in Australia 
and a few American states, was first fully and clearly declared in 
the act under which the Juvenile Court of Cook county, IIl., was 
opened in Chicago, on July 1, 1899, Judge R. S. Tuthill presiding. 
Colorado followed soon after, and since that time similar legisla- 
tion has been adopted in over thirty American jurisdictions, as 
well as in Great Britain and Ireland, Canada, the Australian 
colonies and to some extent continental Europe. 
Juvenile Court legislation has assumed two aspects. In Great 
Britain, New York, and a few other jurisdictions, protection is 
accomplished by suspending sentence and releasing the child 
under probation, or, in case of removal from the home, by sending 
it to a school instead of to a jail or a penitentiary. The criminal 
proceeding remains, however. The child is charged with the 
commission of a definite offense, of which it must be found either 
guilty or not guilty. If not guilty of the one certain act it is dis- 
charged, however much it may need care or supervision. If guilty, 
it is dealt with, but as a criminal. And this would seem to be true 
even under the New York statute of May 25, 1909, which seems 
merely to change the old name of the crime to “ juvenile delin- 
quency.” 
But in Illinois, and following the lead of Illinois in most juris- 
dictions, the form of procedure is totally and wisely different. 
It seems obvious that if the common law can fix the age of criminal 
responsibility at seven, and if the Legislature can advance that 
age to ten or twelve, it can also raise it to sixteen or seventeen or 
eighteen, and that is what in some measure has been done. Under| 
most of the Juvenile Court laws a child under the designated ag 
is not to be proceeded against as a criminal in the first instance 
except when, in the judgment of the judge of the Juvenile Court 
the interests of the state and of the child require it. Unl 
the act is clear on this point, criminal proceedings will be uphel 
as they were in New Hampshire [State vs. Burt, 71 Atl., 30 (1908) 
but if the act is clear they will be quashed [State of Louisiana 
Reed, 49 So. 3 (1909)].

      THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES 673 
The case is now heard in the court that represents the parens 
patrie power of the state—the Court of Chancery. Pro- 
ceedings are brought to have a guardian or representative of the 
state appointed to look after the child, to have the state intervene 
between the natural parent and the child because some acts of the 
child show a need for it, and because the parent is either unwilling 
, or unable to train the child properly. 
The objection made from time to time that this is nevertheless 
a criminal proceeding, and that therefore the child is entitled to a 
trial by jury and to all the constitutional rights that hedge about 
the criminal, is well answered in the language of the Pennsylvania 
Court, in Commonwealth against Fisher (213 Pa. St., 48): 
To save a child from becoming a criminal, or from continuing in a career 
of crime, to end in maturer years in public punishment and disgrace, the 
legislature surely may provide for the salvation of such a child, if its 
parents or guardian be unable or unwilling to do so, by bringing it into one 
of the courts of the state without any process at all, for the purpose of 
subjecting it to the state’s guardianship and protection. 
The action is not for the trial of a child charged with a crime, but is 
mercifully to save it from such an ordeal, with the prison or penitentiary 
in its wake, if the child’s own good and the best interests of the state 
justify such salvation. Whether the child deserves to be saved by the 
state is no more a question for a jury than whether the father, if able to 
save it, ought to save it. The act is but an exercise by the state of its 
supreme power over the welfare of the child, taking its age into consideration. 
The design-is not punishment, nor the restraint, imprisonment, any 
more than is the wholesome restraint which a parent exercises over his child. 
The severity in either case must necessarily be tempered to meet the neces- 
sities of the particular situation. There is no probability, in the proper 
administration of the law, of the child’s liberty being unduly invaded. 
Every statute which is designed to give protection, care and training to 
children, as a needed substitute for parental authority and performance of 
parental duty, is but a recognition of the duty of the state, as the legiti- 
mate guardian and protector of children where other guardianship fails. 
No constitutional right is violated. 
Juvenile Court acts framed on this theory must not provide for 
at which is clearly punishment as e.g., a fine, or imprisonment, 
r they will be unconstitutional [Robinson vs. Wayne Circuit 
udges, 151 Mich., 315, 115 N. W., 682, (1908); People ea rel. vs. 
‘urner, 55 Ill., 280 (1870)]. The spirit of this latter case is to 
ange what would otherwise be a moral obligation of the state 
to a legal duty, the obligation in taking a child away from its 
tural parents, to give it a real home and school and not a prison 
disguise. The parents should always be made parties to the

   proceedings and an opportunity be given them to be heard in 
defense of their parental rights. 
The main principles involved in Juvenile Court legislation, as 
pointed out by Herbert Samuels in introducing into the House of 
Commons his excellent children’s bill, are that the child offender 
be kept separate from the adult criminal; that the courts be 
agencies for the rescue as well as the punishment of children; that | 
the parent be made to feel more responsible for the wrongdoing of 
his child, and that the commitment of children to jails, no matter 
what the offense, is an unsuitable penalty. To these, however, 
should be added that taking a child away from its parents is as 
far as possible to be avoided; and, as the most important princi- 
ple, that when it is allowed to return home it must be under pro- 
bation, subject to the guidance and friendly interest of the proba- 
tion officer as the representative of the court. To raise the age of 
criminal responsibility from seven or ten to sixteen or eighteen 
without providing for an efficient system of probation, would 
be disastrous. Probation is the keynote of Juvenile Court legis- 
lation. 
The jurisdiction to hear cases is generally granted to an existing 
court having full equity powers. Some cities, however, have pro- 
vided special courts with judges devoting their entire time to this 
work. If these special courts can constitutionally be vested with 
full and complete chancery and criminal jurisdiction, much is to 
be said in favor of their establishment. In the large cities partic- 
ularly the entire time of one judge may well be needed. It has 
been suggested from time to time that all the judges of the mu- 
nicipal or special session courts be empowered to act in these cases, 
but while it would be valuable in metropolitan communities to 
have more than one detention home and court house, it would 
seem to be even more important to have a single Juvenile Court 
judge. The British government has adopted this policy for, 
London. 
By the Colorado act of 1909 provision is made for hearing: 
before masters in chancery, designated as masters of discipline 
to be appointed by the Juvenile Court judge and to act unde 
his directions. This may prove to be the best solution of a 
eult problem, combining as it does the possibility of a quick disposi 
tion of the simpler cases in many sections of a large city or count; 
with a unity of administration through the supervisory power 
a single judge. 
The personality of the judge is an all-important matter. TI 
public at large, sympathetic to the work, and even the probati 
officers who are not lawyers, regard the judge as one having alm
-P-A-G-E-697
THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES 675 
~ autocratic power. Because of the extent of his jurisdiction and the | 
tremendous responsibility that it entails, it is, in the judgment of 
the writer, absolutely essential that he be a trained lawyer thor- 
oughly imbued with the doctrine that ours is a “ government of 
laws and not of men.” 
He must, however, be more than a lawyer. He must be a 
student of and deeply interested in the problems of philanthropy 
and child life and a lover of children. He must be able to under- 
stand the*boys’ point of view and ideas of justice; he must be 
willing and patient enough to search out the underlying causes of 
the trouble and to formulate the plan by which, ofttimes through 
the cooperation of many agencies, the cure may be effected. [See 
Mill vs. Brown, 88 Pac., 609 (1907), Utah.] 
In some very important jurisdictions the vicious practice is 
indulged in of assigning a different judge to the Juvenile Court 
work every month or every three months. It is impossible for 
these judges to gain the necessary experience or to devote the nec- 
essary time to the study of new problems. The service should 
under no circumstances be for less than one year and preferably 
for a longer period. In some of our cities, notably in Denver, the 
judge has discharged not only the judicial functions but also those 
of the most efficient probation officer. Judge Lindsey’s love for 
the work and his personality have enabled him to exert a powerful 
influence on the boys and girls brought before him. While doubt- 
less the best results can be obtained in such a court, lack of time 
would prevent a judge in the largest cities from adding this work 
to his strictly judicial duties, even were it not extremely difficult 
to find the necessary combination of elements in one man. Judge 
Lindsey is unique. 
The child brought into court should be made to know that he 
is face to face with the power of the state, but at the same time and 
more emphatically he should be made to feel that he is the object 
of its care and solicitude. The ordinary trappings of the court 
room are out of place in such hearings. The judge on a bench, 
looking down upon the boy standing at the bar, can never evoke 
a sympathetic spirit. Seated at a desk, with the child at his side, 
where on occasion he can put his arm around his shoulder and draw 
the lad to him, the judge, while losing none of his judicial dignity, 
will gain immensely in effectiveness. Moreover, in this way, 
even in a large room, the proceedings can be conducted more 
quietly and sympathetically and without undue publicity. Then, 
too, the child can be made to feel that he is talking directly with 
the judge and that the judge is carefully heeding his story. If the 
child be made to feel that the judge is endeavoring to get the truth 
 
-P-A-G-E-698
676 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
from him rather than from witnesses and that he is trusting him, 
far better results will be obtained. It is wiser, too, to follow the 
practice of those cities which have attendants and officials, includ- 
ing police officers, appear without uniform. 
The court must always aim not to destroy but to better the 
relations between the parent and the child, and it is therefore 
seldom wise to reprimand the parent, no matter how deserving of 
it he may be, in the presence of the child. 
While the proceedings in this court, as in all courts, should be 
public, so as to avert danger even of unjust suspicions, the greatest 
effort should be made to limit the extent of publicity. Mere idlers 
and those impelled by curiosity should be excluded from the room ; 
earnest students, on the other hand, should be admitted, and full 
opportunity given them to study the proceedings. While stim- 
ulating the public interest which is essential to the work of the 
court, the press should be induced to spare the feelings of the 
children, their relatives and friends by not printing real names or 
addresses. 
The object of the Juvenile Court and of the intervention of the 
state is, of course, in no case to lessen or weaken the sense of 
responsibility, either of the child or of the parents. On the con- 
trary, the aim is to develop and to enforce it. Therefore, it is 
wisely provided in most of the recent acts that the child, if of 
working age, may be compelled when on probation to make resti- 
tution for any damage it has done. Moreover, the parents may 
not only be compelled to contribute to the support even of the chil- 
dren who are sent to institutions, but, following Colorado, in many 
states, they, as well as other adults, may be made liable for their 
acts or neglect contributing to a child’s dependency or delinquency. 
In most of the jurisdictions which have established separate Juve- 
nile Courts, as well as in some of the others, all criminal cases affect- 
ing children are tried by the Juvenile Court judge. In legislation 
making adults criminally liable for such contributory acts the 
constitutional rights of the defendant must be carefully safe- 
guarded. Such penal acts are strictly construed, and therefore in 
the recent case of Gibson vs. People, 99 Pac., 333 (1909), the 
Colorado Supreme Court limited the application of the act of 1903 
to the parents and those standing in a parental relation to the child. 
Colorado, in 1907, however, as well as other states, expressly ex- 
tended the scope of such statutes so as to include any person, 
whether standing in loco parentis or not. ‘The Supreme Court of 
Oregon in State vs. Dunn (99 Pac., 278 (1909)) construed such leg- 
islation to refer only to misconduct not otherwise punishable. 
Kentucky, in 1908, followed by Colorado in 1909, has enacted 
   
-P-A-G-E-699
        THE EDUCATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES 677 
» a statute providing for the enforcement of parental obligations not 
in the criminal but in the chancery branch of the Juvenile Court. 
A decree not merely for the payment of support money, but for 
the performance or omission of such acts as under the circumstances 
of the case are found necessary, may be enforced by contempt 
proceedings. 
The work of the Juvenile Court is, at the best, palliative, curative. 
The more important, indeed the vital thing, is to prevent children 
from reaching that condition in which they have to be dealt with 
in any court, and we are not doing our duty to the children of 
to-day, the men and women of to-morrow, when we neglect to de- 
stroy the evils that are leading them into careers of delinquency, 
when we fail not merely to uproot the wrong, but to implant in 
place of it the positive good. We must study thoroughly the 
underlying causes of juvenile delinquency in order to apply these 
preventive and positive measures. As was well said (186 Hans. 
Parl. Deb., 4th series, 1262) in the course of the debates on the 
children’s bill in the House of Commons: ‘‘ We want to say to 
the child that if the world or the world’s law has not been his 
friend in the past, it shall be now. We say that it is the duty of 
this Parliament and that this Parliament is determined to lift if 
possible and rescue him, to shut the prison door, and to open the 
door of hope.”

   THE CHURCH AND EDUCATION 
The Secularization of Education. — Throughout the colonial 
period social customs and institutional life were naturally 
dominated by mother country traditions; none of which ex- 
erted a more persistent influence than that of the accepted 
relation and responsibility of the church as regards education, 
in all of its stages. The taproot of early nineteenth century 
democracy was necessarily nurtured in the conception of the 
free and universal school, untrammeled by the restrictions of 
religious orthodoxy or the conflicts of creed. The secular 
common school came as the inevitable result of the adjust- 
ment of the new relations of men which were grounded in 
the religious freedom of individuals and in the political rights 
of majorities. 
The entrance of the state with the secular school into the 
field of education could have but a single series of results; 
the more or less immediate withdrawal of the church, and of 
private and philanthropic enterprise from elementary education 
activities; and thenceforth a gradually diminishing range of 
influence of the non-state institutions of education, of higher 
as well as of middle grade. 
The Roman.Catholic Church, notwithstanding the social 
trend by which the system of general state education ha 
expanded and enlarged, has continued to retain its ancien 
responsibilities for the education of itsadherents. Theprincipa 
selections for this chapter pertain to the existing attitude of th 
church to the question of education, and the problems presente 
by this attitude.

1. State Schools and Parish Schools — Is Union between them 
Impossible? 
[From Ireland, John (Archbishop), Proceedings, National Education 
Association, 1890, pp. 179-185.] 
I will beg leave to make at once my profession of faith. I 
declare most unbounded loyalty to the constitution of my country. 
I desire no favors. I claim no rights that are not in consonance 
with its letter and its spirit. The rights which the constitution 
allows I do claim, and in doing so I am but the truer and more 
loyal American. In what I may say to this distinguished audience, 
the principles of our common American citizenship shall inspire 
my words. I beg that you listen to me and discuss my arguments 
in the light of those principles. 
I am the friend and the advocate of the state school. In the 
circumstances of the present time I uphold the parish school. 
I do sincerely wish that the need of it did not exist. I would have 
all schools for the children of the people state schools. 
The accusation has gone abroad that Catholics are bent on 
destroying the state school. Never was there an accusation 
more unfounded. I will summarize the articles of my school 
oe they follow all the lines upon which the state school is 
uilt. 
The right of the state school to exist, I consider, is a matter 
beyond the stage of discussion. I most fully concede it. To 
the child must be imparted instruction in no mean degree, that the 
man may earn for himself an honest competence, and acquit him- 
self of the duties which society exacts from him for its own pros- 
perity and life. This proposition, true in any country of modern 
times, is peculiarly true in America. The imparting of this instruc- 
tion is primarily the function of the child’s parent. The family 
is prior to the state. The appointment of Providence is that 
under the care and direction of the parent, the child shall grow both 
in body and in mind. The state intervenes whenever the family 
cannot or will not do the work that is needed. The state’s place 
in the function of instruction is loco parentis. As things are, tens 
lof thousands of children will not be instructed if parents remain 
olely in charge of the duty. The state must come forward as an 
gent of instruction; else ignorance will prevail. Indeed, in the 
bsence of state action, there never was that universal instruction 
hich we have so nearly attained and which we deem necessary.    
    
     
      
    
-P-A-G-E-702
} : 
; } 680 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
In the absence of state action I believe universal instruction would . 
never, in any country, have been possible. 
State action in favor of instruction implies free schools in which 
knowledge is conditioned in the asking; in no other manner can 
we bring instruction within the reach of all children. Free schools ! 
Blest indeed is the nation whose vales and hillsides they adorn, 
and blest the generations upon whose souls are poured their treas- 
ure! No tax is more legitimate than that which is levied for the 
dispelling of mental darkness, and the building-up within a 
nation’s bosom of intelligent manhood and womanhood. The 
question may not be raised: how much good accrues to the indi- 
vidual tax-payer; the general welfare is richly served, and this 
suffices. It is scarcely necessary to add that the money paid in 
school tax is the money of the state, and is to be disbursed solely 
by the officials of the state, and solely for the specific purposes in 
view of which it was collected. 
I unreservedly favor state laws making instruction compulsory. 
Instruction is so much needed by each citizen for his own sake and 
for that of society that the father who neglects to provide for his 
child’s instruction sins against the child and against society, and 
it behooves the state to punish him. Of course, first principles 
must not be forgotten, and since instruction is primarily the func- 
tion of the parent, the state entering into action loco parentis, the 
parent enjoys the right to educate his child in the manner suitable 
to himself; provided always that the education given in this 
manner suffices for the ulterior duties of the child toward himself 
and society. Compulsory education implies attendance in schools 
maintained and controlled by the state only when there is no attend- 
ance in other schools known to be competent to impart instruc- 
tion in the required degree. The compulsory laws recently enacted 
in certain States of the Union are, to my judging, objectionable in 
a few of their incidental clauses. These, I am confident, will 
readily be altered in approaching legislative sessions. With the 
body of the laws, and their general intent in the direction of hasten- 
ing among us universal instruction, I am in most hearty accord. 
It were idle for me to praise the work of the state school of 
America in the imparting of secular instruction. We all confess its 
value. It is our pride and our glory. The republic of the United 
States has solemnly affirmed its resolve that within its borders no| 
clouds of ignorance shall settle upon the minds of the children off 
its people. To reach this result its generosity knows no limit. 
The free school of America — withered be the hand raised in sig 
of its destruction ! 
Can I be suspected of enmity to the state school because I fai

would widen the expanse of its wings until all the children of the 
* people find shelter beneath their cover, because I tell of defects 
which for very love of the state school I seek to remedy? 
I turn to the parish school. It exists. I repeat my regret 
that there is the necessity for its existence. In behalf of the state 
school I call upon my fellow-Americans to aid in the removal of 
this necessity. 
Catholics are foremost in establishing parish schools. Seven 
hundred and fifty thousand children, it is estimated, are educated 
in their parish schools. A lack of material means prevents them 
from housing their full number of children. Lutherans exhibit 
great zeal in favor of parish schools. Many Episcopalians, and 
some different other Protestant denominations, commend and 
organize parish schools. The different denominational colleges 
of the country are practically parish schools for the children of 
the richer classes. The spirit of the parish school, if not the school 
itself, is widespread among American Protestants, and is made 
manifest by their determined opposition to the exclusion of Scrip- 
ture-reading and other devotional exercises from the school-room. 
There is dissatisfaction with the state school, as at present 
organized. The state school, it is said, tends to the elimination of 
religion from the minds and hearts of the youth of the country. 
This is my grievance against the state school of to-day. Believe 
me, my Protestant fellow-citizens, that I am absolutely sincere, 
when I now declare that I am speaking for the weal of Protestantism 
as well as for that of Catholicism. I am a Catholic, of course, to 
the tiniest fiber of my heart, unflinching and uncompromising in 
my faith. But God forbid that I desire to see in America, the 
ground which Protestantism occupies exposed to the chilling and 
devastating blast of unbelief. Let me be your ally in stemming 
the swelling tide of irreligion, the death-knell of Christian life and 
of Christian civilization, the fatal foe of souls and of country. 
This is what we have to fear — the materialism which sees not 
beyond the universe a living, personal God, or the agnosticism 
which reduces him to an indescribable perhaps. The evil is abroad, 
scorning salvation through the teachings and graces of Christ 
Jesus, sneering at the Biblical page, warring upon the sacredness 
of the Christian Sabbath and the music of its church-bells, telling 
of Heaven and of the hopes of immortal souls. Let us be on our 
guard. In our jealousies lest Protestants gain some advantage 
over Catholics, or Catholics over Protestants, we play into the 
hands of unbelievers and secularists. We have given over to them 
ithe school, the nursery of thought. Are we not securing to them 
e mastery of the future?

i 682 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
} 
The state school is non-religious. It ignores religion. There . 
is and there can be no positive religious teaching where the prin-' 
ciple of non-sectarianism rules. What follows? The school 
deals with immature, childish minds, upon which silent facts and 
examples make deepest impression. The school claims nearly all 
the time remaining to pupils outside of rest and recreation; to the 
school they will perforce amid the struggles of later life look back 
| for inspiration. It treats of land and sea, but not of Heaven; 
. it speaks of statesmen and warriors, but is silent on God and 
Christ ; it tells how to attain success in this world, but says noth- 
ing as to the world beyond the grave. The pupil sees and listens; 
the conclusion is inevitable, that religion is of minor importance. 
Religious indifference will be his creed; his manhood will be, as 
his childhood in the school, estranged from God and the positive 
influences of religion. The belief and hurried lessons of the 
family fireside and the Sunday school will not avail.. At best, the 
time is too short for that most difficult of lessons, religion. The 
child is tired from the exacting drill of the schoolroom, and will 
not relish an extra task, of the necessity of which the teacher, in 
whom he confides most trustingly, has said nothing. The great 
mass of children receive no fireside lessons, and attend no Sunday 
school, and the great mass of the children of America are growing 
up without religion. Away with theories and dreams: let us read 
the facts. In ten thousand homes of the land the father hastens 
to his work in the early dawn before his children have risen from 
their slumbers, and in the evening an exhausted frame bids him 
seek at once repose, with scarcely time allowed to kiss his little 
ones. The mother toils from morning to night, that they may 
eat and be clothed; it is mockery to ask her to be their teacher. 
What may you expect from the Sunday school? An hour in the 
week to learn religion is as nothing, and only the small number 
will be present during that hour. The churches are open and 
teachers are at hand, but the non-religious school has claimed 
the attention and the hard work of the child during five days of the 
week; he is unwilling to submit to the drudgery of a further hour’s 
work on Sunday. Accidentally and unintentionally, it may be, 
but, in fact, most certainly, the state school crowds out the work of 
the church, and takes from it the opportunities to secure a hearing. 
The state need not teach religion; but for the sake of its people, 
and for its own sake, it should permit and facilitate the action of 
the church. It hinders and prevents this action. The children| 
of the masses are learning no religion. The religion of thousands, 
who are supposed to be religious, is the merest veneering of min 
and heart. Its doctrines are vaguest and most chaotic notions a:

  THE CHURCH AND EDUCATION 683 
to what God is, and what our relations to Him are. Very often it 
is mere sentimentality, and its precepts are the decorous rulings of 
natural culture and natural policy. This is not the religion that 
built up in the past our Christian civilization, and that will main- 
tain it in the future. This is not the religion that will subjugate 
passion and repress vice. It is not the religion that will guard the 
family and save society. 
Let the state look to itself. The mind which it polishes is a 
two-edged sword — an instrument for good or an instrument for 
evil. It were fatal to polish it without the assurance that in all 
likelihood it shall be an instrument for good. I am not questioning 
how far we may lay at the door of the non-religious school the 
breaking up of Christian creeds, the growth of agnosticism and 
unbelief, the weakening of public and private morals, and the al- 
most complete estrangement of the poor and the working classes 
from church organizations. But I do.submit that these dreaded 
evils of our day should awaken us from our lethargy, and compel 
us to bestow more than the ordinary care upon the religious instruc- 
tion of the children of the land, that they may have the strength 
to withstand the fierce temptations surrounding them, and not, 
rather, by their precipitation into the maelstrom, intensify the 
evils. 
Do not say that the state school teaches morals. Christians 
demand religion. Morals, without the positive principles of 
religion giving to them root and sap, do not exist. What seems 
to be morals without religion are the blossomings of fortunate 
and kindly disposed natures, or habits fashioned upon Christian 
traditions that grow weaker as the traditions become remote. 
To the American people at large — religious-minded and God- 
fearing as I know them to be —I put the question: Ought we not 
to have, in connection with the school, religious instruction? That 
there are serious difficulties in the way, I confess. But are we to 
stop at difficulties, when it is incumbent upon us to reach the 
goal? I do not mistrust the reply. 
Secularists and unbelievers will interpose their rights. I allow 
them their rights. I will not impose upon them my religion, 
which is Christianity. But let them not impose upon me and my 
fellow-Christians their religion, which is secularism. Secularism 
is a religion of its kind, and usually a very loud-spoken and intol- 
rant religion. And when non-sectarianism is intended, the 
ecularist sect must not claim for itself the field which it refuses 
lo others. I am taking my stand upon our common American 
itizenship. The liberty I claim, that I grant. 
I come to the chief difficulty in the premises. The American       
  
-P-A-G-E-706

people at large are Christians; but they are divided among them- 
selves. Yes, they are divided. Not to speak of other differences, 
there is a radical and vital one between Protestantism of all forms 
and Catholicism. I am not arguing. I am relating facts. Well- 
meaning and well-deserving men have proposed as a remedy in this 
instance, that there be taught in connection with the schools a 
common Christianity. This will not do. Catholics in fidelity 
to their principles cannot accept a common Christianity. What 
comes to them not bearing on its face the stamp of Catholicity, 
is Protestant in form and in implication, even if it be Catholic 
in substance. This being the settled fact, American Catholics 
will not, of course, inflict Catholicism upon non-Catholic or Protes- 
tant children, and with similar fair-mindedness American Protes- 
tants will not inflict Protestantism upon Catholic children. Some 
compromise becomes necessary. Is it not ten thousand times 
better that we make the compromise rather than allow secularism 
to triumph and own the country? 
I turn to all Americans — secularists as well as Christian believers 
—and I address them in the name of American citizenship. We 
are a practical people, and when we find facts before us, whether 
we like or dislike them, we deal with them with an eye to the gen- 
eral good. Dissatisfaction does exist with the state school because 
of its exclusion of religion. The dissatisfaction will exist so long 
as no change is made. It is founded on conscience. 
Is not the fact of this dissatisfaction sufficient that Americans 
set to work earnestly and with a good will to remove its cause? 
The welfare of the country demands peace and harmony among 
citizens. Let us put an end to the constant murmurings and bitter 
recriminations with which our school war fills the air. Since we 
are proud of our state school and prize its advantages, let us make 
an effort that all the children of the people enjoy those advantages. 
If there be a public institution, as the state school, supported by all 
the people, avowedly for the benefit of all the people, let it be such 
that all may use it. Be there no taxation without representatio: 
in the enjoyment of the benefits thereof. Let us most studiousl. 
avoid raising barriers to the use of those benefits, and in a mos 
especial manner, such barriers that the opposition to them come 
in the name of conscience. 
LT invoke the spirit of American liberty and American institution: 
Our views, perhaps, differ diametrically from those of others 
our fellow-citizens; we may deem their views utterly wron, 
Still, is not the duty of Americans that of peace and concessio 
so that others be as undisturbed in their conscience as we are 
ours? Does it matter that we happen to be in the majorit

    Brute numerical force may be legal; it is not justice, it is not the 
spirit of America. Minorities have rights, and as speedily as it is 
possible with the public weal should the majority recognize them. 
It is no honor to America that ten millions or more be compelled by 
law to pay taxes for the support of schools to which their conscience 
forbids access, and to be furthermore, in order to be conscientious, 
compelled by their zeal for the instruction of their children, to 
build school-houses of their own, and pay their own teachers. It 
is no honor for the remaining fifty millions to profit for themselves 
of the taxes paid by the ten millions. The cry that the state 
schools are open to them, if they silence their consciences, is not a 
defense that will hold before the bar of justice. The aspect of the 
case is the more serious when we consider that those ten millions 
are largely among the poorer classes of the population, and that 
they are sincerely and loyally desirous to obtain the benefits of the 
state school, if only the obstacles be removed. 
It is no honor to the American republic that she be more than 
any other nation foremost in efforts to divorce religion from the 
schools. No country goes in this direction so far as ours. We 
have entered upon a terrible experiment; the very life of our civil- 
ization and of our country is at stake. I know not how to account 
for this condition of things, passing strange in America. Neither 
the genius of our country nor its history gives countenance to it. 
The American people are naturally reverent and religious. Their 
laws and public observances breathe forth the perfume of religion. 
The American school, as it first reared its log walls amid the villages 
of New England, was religious through and through. The present 
favor to a non-religious school is, I verily believe, the thoughtless- 
ness of a moment, and it will not last. 
I solve the difficulty by submitting it to the calm judgment of 
the country. No question is insoluble to Americans which truth 
and justice press home to them. Other countries, whose civiliza- 
tion we do not despise, have found a solution. I instance but Eng- 
land and Prussia. We are not inferior to them in practical legis- 
lation and the spirit of peaceful compromise. Suggestions of mine 
must be necessarily crude in form, and local and temporary in 
application. I will, however, speak them. I would permeate the 
regular state school with the religion of the majority of the chil- 
en of the land, be it as Protestant as Protestantism can be, 
nd I would, as they do in England, pay for the secular instruction 
iven in denominational schools according to results; that is, each 
upil passing the examination before state officials, and in full 
ccordance with the state program, would secure to his school the 
‘ost of the tuition of a pupil in the state school. This is not pay-
-P-A-G-E-708
    686 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
ing for the religious instruction given to the pupil, but for the secu- 
lar instruction demanded by the state, and given to the pupil as 
thoroughly as he could have received it in the state school. 
Another plan: I would do as Protestants and Catholics in Pough- 
keepsie and other places in our own country have agreed to do to 
the greatest satisfaction of all citizens and the great advancement 
of educational interests. In Poughkeepsie the city school board 
rents the buildings formerly used as parish schools, and from the 
hour of 9 a.m. to that of 3 p.m. the school is in every particular a 
state school — teachers engaged and paid by the board, teachers 
and pupils examined, state books used, the door always open to- 
superintendent and members of the board. ‘There is simply the 
tacit understanding that so long as the teachers in those schools, 
Catholic in faith, pass their examinations and do their work as 
cleverly and as loyally as other teachers under the control of the 
board, teachers of another faith shall not be put in their places. 
Nor are they allowed to teach positive religion during school hours. 
This is done outside the hours for which the buildings are leased to 
the board. The state, it is plain, pays not one cent for the religious 
instruction of the pupils. In the other schools Protestant devo- 
tional exercises take place in fullest freedom before the usual school 
hour. 
Do not tell me of difficulties of detail in the working-out of 
either of my schemes. There are difficulties; but will not the 
result be fullest compensation for the struggle to overcome them? 
Other schemes, more perfect in conception and easier of application, 
will perhaps be presented in time; meanwhile, let us do as best 
we know. 
Allow me one word as a Catholic. I have sought to place on the 
precise line where it belongs, the objection of Catholics to the state 
school. Is it fair, is it honest, to raise the cry that Catholics are 
opposed to education, to free schools, to the American school sys- 
tem? I do lose my patience when adversaries seek to place us in 
this false position, so contrary to all our convictions and resolves. 
In presence of this vast and distinguished assembly, to have 
addressed which is an honor I shall never forget, I protest with 
all the energy of my soul against the charge that the schools of th 
nation have their enemies among Catholics. Not one stone o! 
the wondrous edifice which Americans have built up in their devo: 
tion to education, will Catholics remove or permit to be remov

     2. The Educational Propositions of 1892 
One of the most comprehensive statements of the position 
of the Roman Catholic Church on the subject of education 
makes no explicit reference to a division of funds, but deals 
almost entirely with the duty of the Church and its members 
toward the schools. It consists of fourteen propositions pre- 
sented by Cardinal Satolli to the Archbishops, assembled for 
their annual meeting in New York, November 16, 1892. Cardi- 
nal Satolli, representing the Holy See at the Columbian Ex- 
position of 1893, had been commissioned by Pope Leo XIII 
to speak, in his name, on the question of Catholic education, 
the recent discussions of which had aroused much sharp con- 
troversy, within and without the Church. The several prop- 
ositions were as follows :!

The Most Rev. Francis Satolli, Archbishop of Lepanto, Delegate 
of the Apostolic See to the United States of America to the 
Archbishops Assembled in New York: 
I. All care must be taken to erect Catholic schools, to enlarge 
and improve those already established, and to make them equal to 
the public schools in teaching and in discipline. (Conc. Plen. 
Balt. III, No. 197, p. 101.)

iis available is little fitted for giving the children an education in

attended with a safe conscience, the danger of perversion being * 
rendered remote by opportune remedial and precautionary meas- 
ures, a matter that is to be left to the conscience and judgment 
of the ordinaries. (Ibid., No. 198, p. 103.) 
III. We enact and command that no one shall be allowed to 
teach in a parochial school who has not proven his fitness for the 
position by previous examination. No priest shall have the right 
to employ any teacher, male or female, in his school without a 
certificate of ability or diploma from the diocesan board of exam- 
iners. (Ibid., No. 203, p. 108.) 
IV. Normal schools, as they are called, are to be established 
where they are wanting and are evidently necessary. (Ibid., 
No. 205, p. 110.) VY. We strictly forbid anyone, whether bishop or priest, — and 
this is the express prohibition of the Sovereign Pontiff through 
the Sacred Congregation, — either by act or by threat, to exclude 
from the sacraments as unworthy, parents (who choose to send their 
children to the public schools). As regards the children themselves, 
this enactment applies with still greater force. (Ibid., No. 198, 
p- 104; Conf., Tit. VI, Cap. I, II; Tit. VII.) 
VI. To the Catholic Church belongs the duty and the divine 
right of teaching all nations to believe the truth of the Gospel, 
and to observe whatsoever Christ commanded (Matth., xxviii, 19) ; 
in her likewise is vested the divine right of instructing the young 
in so far as theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven (Mark, x, 14) (Conf. 
Cone. Balt., Pl. III., No. 194); that is to say, she holds for herself 
the right of teaching the truths of faith and the law of morals in 
order to bring up youth in the habits of a Christian life. Hence, 
absolutely and universally speaking, there is no repugnance in 
their learning the first elements and the higher branches of the arts 
and the natural sciences in public schools controlled by the state, 
whose office it is to provide, maintain, and protect everything by 
which its citizens are formed to moral goodness, while they live 
peaceably together, with a sufficiency of temporal goods, under 
laws promulgated by civil authority. 
For the rest, the provisions of the council of Baltimore are yet 
in force, and, in a general way, will remain so; to wit: “ Not only 
out of our paternal love do we exhort Catholic parents, but we 
command them, by all the authority we possess, to procure a truly 
Christian and Catholic education for the beloved offspring give 
them of God, born again in baptism unto Christ and destined fo 
Heaven, to shield and secure them throughout childhood and yout! 
from the dangers of a merely worldly education, and therefor 
to send them to parochial or other truly Catholic schools.” Unit

THE CHURCH AND EDUCATION 689 
with this duty are the rights of parents, which no civil law or 
authority can violate or weaken. 
VII. The Catholic Church in general, and especially the Holy 
See, far from condemning or treating with indifference the public 
schools, desires rather that, by the joint action of civil and eccle- 
siastical authorities, there should be public schools in every State, 
according as the circumstances of the people require for the culti- 
vation of the useful arts and natural sciences; but the Catholic 
Church shrinks from those features of public schools which are 
opposed to the truths of Christianity and to morality; and since, 
in the interest of society itself, these objectionable features are 
removable, therefore, not only the bishops, but the citizens at large 
should labor to remove them, in virtue of their own right and in the 
cause of morality. : 
VIII. It is long since the Holy See, after consultation with the 
bishops of the United States of America, decreed that parish 
schools and other institutions under the direction of the bishops, 
each according to the conditions of its own diocese, were oppor- 
tune and necessary for Catholic youth, from the fact that it was 
held for certain that the public schools bore within themselves ap- 
proximate danger to faith and morals for various reasons (Cone. 
Pl. Balt., III., No. 194, seq.; App., p. 279); viz., because in the 
public schools a purely secular education is given — inasmuch as 
it excludes all teaching of religion — because teachers are chosen 
indiscriminately from every sect, and no law prevents them from 
working the ruin of youth —so that they are at liberty to instill 
errors and the germs of vice in tender minds. Likewise, certain 
corruption seemed to impend from the fact that in these schools, 
jor at least in many of them, children of both sexes are brought 
together for their lessons in the same room. 
Wherefore, if it be clear that in a given locality, owing to the 
wiser dispositions of public authorities or the watchful prudence 
lof schoolboard, teachers, and parents, the above-named dangers 
o faith and morals disappear, then it is lawful for Catholic parents 
o send their children to these schools, to acquire the elements of 
letters and arts, provided the parents themselves do not neglect 
heir most serious duty, and the pastors of souls put forth every 
ort to instruct the children and train them in all that pertains 
Catholic worship and life. 
IX. It is left to the judgment and the wisdom of the ordinaries 
decide whether, in a certain part of their respective dioceses, 
parochial school can be built and kept up in a fitting condition, 
t inferior to the public schools, taking into consideration the 
poral condition of the parents, while graver needs for procuring

their spiritual welfare and the decent support of the Church are 
pressing. It will be well, therefore, as was the wont of our fore- 
fathers, and as was done in the early days of the Church, to estab- 
lish weekly classes of catechism, which all the children of the parish 
should attend; for the better success of this measure let the zeal 
of pastors in fulfilling their duty and the love of Catholic parents 
leave no effort unspared. (Cf. Conc. Pl. Balt. III., No. 198.) 
X. No reproach, either in public or in private, shall be cast 
upon Catholic parents who send their children to private schools 
or to academies where a better education is given under the direc- 
tion of religious or of approved and Catholic persons. If they 
make sufficient provision for the religious training of their children, 
let them be free to secure in other ways that education which the 
position of their family requires. 
XI. It is greatly to be desired, and will be a most happy arrange- 
ment, if the bishop agree with the civil authorities or with the mem- 
bers of the school board, to conduct the school with mutual atten- 
tion and due consideration for their respective rights. 
While there are teachers of any description for the secular 
branches, who are legally inhibited from offending Catholic reli- 
gion and morality, let the right and duty of the Church obtain 
of teaching the children catechism, in order to remove danger to 
their faith and morals from any quarter whatsoever. 
It seems well to quote here the words of our Holy Father, Leo 
XIII (see the Pope’s letter to the archbishop of New York and to 
the bishops of the province): ‘‘ We further desire you to strive 
earnestly that the various local authorities, firmly convinced that 
nothing is more conducive to the welfare of the commonwealth 
than religion, should by wise legislation provide that the system of 
education which is maintained at the public expense, and to which, 
therefore, Catholics also contribute their share, be in no way preju- 
dicial to their conscience or religion. For we are persuaded that 
even your fellow-citizens who differ from us in belief, with their 
characteristic intelligence and prudence, will readily set aside all 
suspicions and all views unfavorable to the Catholic Church, and 
willingly acknowledge her merit, as the one that dispelled the 
darkness of paganism by the light of the Gospel and created a new] 
society distinguished by the luster of Christian virtues and by 
the cultivation of all that refines. We do not think that anyon 
there, after looking into these things clearly, will let Catholi 
parents be forced to erect and support schools which they can no 
use for the instruction of their children.” 
XII. As for those Catholic children that in great numbers ai 
educated in the public schools, where now, not without dangei

- they receive no religious instruction at all, strenuous efforts should 
be made not to leave them without sufficient and seasonable in- 
struction in Catholic faith and practice. We know by experience 
that not all our Catholic children are found in our Catholic schools. 
Statistics show that hundreds of thousands of Catholic children 
in the United States of America attend schools which are under 
the control of State boards, and in which, for that reason, teachers 
of every denomination are engaged. Beyond all doubt the one 
thing necessary, i.c., religious and moral education according to 
Catholic principles, is not to be treated either lightly or with 
delay, but on the contrary with all earnestness and energy. 
The adoption of one of three plans is recommended, the choice 
to be made according to local circumstances in the different States 
and various personal relations. 
The first consists in an agreement between the bishop and the 
members of the school board, whereby they, in a spirit of fairness 
and good will, allow the Catholic children to be assembled during 
free time and taught the catechism ; it would also be of the greatest 
advantage if this plan were not confined to the primary schools, 
but were extended likewise to the high schools and colleges, in the 
form of a free lecture. 
The second : To have a catechism class outside the public-school 
building, and also classes of higher Christian doctrine, where, at 
fixed times, the Catholic children would assemble with diligence 
and pleasure, induced thereto by the authority of their parents, 
the persuasion of their pastors, and the hope of praise and rewards. 
The third plan does not seem at first sight so suitable, but is 
bound up more intimately with the duty of both parents and 
pastors. Pastors should unceasingly urge upon parents that 
most important duty, imposed both by natural and by divine law, 
of bringing up their children in sound morality and Catholic faith. 
Besides the instruction of children appertains to the very essence 
of the pastoral charge; let the pastor of souls say to them with 
the Apostle: “ My little children, of whom I am in labor again 
until Christ be formed in you.” (Gal., iv., 19.) Let him have 
classes of children in the parish such as have been established in 
[Rome and many other places, and even in churches in this country, 
ith very happy results. 
Nor let him, with little prudence, show less love for the children 
hat attend the public schools than for those that attend the 
arochial; on the contrary, stronger marks of loving solicitude 
re to be shown them; the Sunday school and the hour for cate- 
ism should be devoted to them in a special manner. And to 
tivate this field, let the pastor call to his aid other priest, reli-

gious, and even suitable members of the laity, in order that what ~ 
is supremely necessary be wanting to no child. 
XIII. For the standing and growth of Catholic schools, it seems 
that care should be taken that the teachers prove themselves 
qualified, not only by previous examination before the diocesan 
board and by certificate or diploma received from it, but also by 
having a teacher’s diploma from the school board of the State, 
awarded after successful examination. This is urged, first, so as 
not to appear regardless, without reason, of what public authority 
requires for teaching. Secondly, a better opinion of Catholic 
schools will be created. Thirdly, greater assurance will be given 
to parents that in Catholic schools there is no deficiency to render 
them inferior to public schools; that, on the contrary, everything 
is done to make Catholic schools equal to public schools, or even 
superior. Fourthly, and lastly, we think that this plan would 
prepare the way for the State to see, along with the recognized and 
tested fitness of the teachers, that the laws are observed in all 
matters pertaining to the arts and sciences, to method and peda- 
gogics, and to whatever is ordinarily required to promote the 
stability and usefulness of the schools. 
XIV. It is necessary that what are called normal schools should 
reach such efficiency in preparing teachers of letters, arts, and 
sciences, that their graduates shall not fail to obtain the diploma 
of the State. For the sake of the’ Catholic cause, let there be 
among laymen a growing rivalry to take the diploma and doctorate, 
so that, possessed of the knowledge and qualifications requisite for 
teaching, they may compete for and honorably obtain positions 
in the public gymnasia, lyceums, and scientific institutions. 
The knowledge of truth of every kind, straightforward justice 
united with charity, the effulgence and appreciation of the liberal 
arts — these are the bulwarks of the church. 
All the above was read and considered in the meeting of the 
archbishops, the difficulties answered, and the requisite alterations 
made, November 17, 1892.

1. That the Federal Council again place on record its resolu- 
tions of 1908: 
“That there can be no true and complete education without 
religion; to provide adequate religious instruction for their chil- 
dren is the duty of the churches, a primal and imperative duty. 
That the hour at Sunday-school, the religious exercises of the 
public school and the ethical instruction of the public school, 
through the personal influence of the great body of religious public 
school teachers, do not meet the requirements of adequate religious 
instruction. That to provide religious instruction for their chil- 
dren is not only the duty of the churches, it is their inherited and 
inherent right, and this right should be recognized by the State 
in its arrangement of the course of school studies.” 
2. That whenever and wherever public sentiment warrants such 
a course, the public schools should be closed for half a day for the 
purpose of allowing the children to attend instruction in religion 
in their own churches. As compared with other Christian coun- 
tries, an allotment of eight per cent. of school time for religion 
would not be an immoderate allowance. 
3. That where it is not feasible to obtain a portion of the time 
belonging to the school curriculum, the churches should see to it 
that after school hours on week-days, at least one hour’s instruc- 
tion in religion be given to each child of the congregation. 
4. That ecclesiastical bodies and theological seminaries be urged 
to give increased attention to the pedagogical training of candi- 
dates for the ministry. 
5. That as citizens, having in mind the highest ideals of educa- 
tion, we exercise care in the selection of teachers and superintend- 
ents of public schools with respect to their religious character and 
the personal influence they would be likely to have upon their pupils. 
6. That we invite the National Education Association, the Reli- 
gious Education Association, and other Associations interested 
in this subject, to appoint committees to confer with our committee 
on ways and means for promoting week-day instruction in religion. 
7. That the further consideration of the subject be entrusted 
ito the Federal Council’s Standing Committee on Education, with 
he request to report from time to time to the Executive Committee, 
nd at the next meeting of the Federal Council.

The new relations that are developing between the Church ~

    [From “ Church Work in State Universities,” Report of the Third 
Annual Conference of Church Workers in State Universities 
(1910). Edited by Galpin, C. J., and Edwards, R. H.] 
1. POINTS OF GENERAL AGREEMENT 
(1) Each denomination ought to give national recognition to 
the church movement at state universities. 
(2) The local church of each denomination at the state univer- 
sity center has a special function as an agent of the denomination 
in the state and nation, acting for the various churches where 
they cannot act for themselves. 
(3) The work of the denomination by and for the university 
constituency, both teachers and students, should be done in close 
connection and coéperation with this local church. 
(4) The pastor of this local church should be one of the most 
capable leaders of his denomination. 
(5) In the several larger state university centers, a special 
representative should be provided by the state or national denomi- 
national body, to do religious work in the university community. 
This religious worker should be closely related to the local church. 
(6) The Young Men’s Christian Association and the Young 
Women’s Christian Association are specialized institutions acting 
in certain inter-denominational connections where the denomi- 
nations cannot effectively act themselves. 
(7) The placing of capable men at once on the university field 
should precede the determination of what kind of buildings to 
erect, and should not be delayed for the raising of pps 
endowments.

for religious courses given outside the university, on examinatio: 
and approval by a committee of the university faculty. 
(2) A School of Religion at the University of Michigan whic] 
brings together all the courses of religious instruction given by t

    “various agencies at Ann Arbor, and offers them through a printed 
announcement, at the beginning of the year, after the manner of a 
University department catalog. 
(3) A Biblical Institute at the University of Kansas under the 
official direction of the University. Several days together each year 
are set apart for special attention to Biblical and religious topics. 
University professors, during these days, in their regular courses 
touch in their lectures the points of religious significance. Emi- 
nent religious leaders are guests of the university and address the 
whole body of students in mass meetings. 
(4) At the University of Wisconsin, a codperative plan shared 
in by the University Pastors’ Association and the President and 
Regents of the University, under which, at intervals each year, 
three or four men of national eminence in religious work are invited 
officially to the University to address the whole University at a 
Convocation upon some theme of general interest, not specifically 
religious. Each man also gives, under the auspices of the Univer- 
sity Pastors’ Association, a series of moral and religious addresses 
in the auditorium of the Young Men’s Christian Association, open 
to men and women. 
(5) The new Roman Catholic University chapels at the Uni- 
versity of California and at the University of Wisconsin. 
3. SOME SUCCESSFUL WORKING AGENTS 
(1) The Woman’s Mission Board of the Christian denomination, 
in founding Bible Chairs at State Universities. 
(2) The Presbyterian Board of Education coéperating with state 
synods, in providing adequate Presbyterian pastoral leadership 
at state university centers. 
(3) The University Pastors’ Association at the University of 
Wisconsin, composed of the five Protestant University pastors and 
the secretaries of the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Chris- 
tian Association in working out an aggressive program of local 
odperation both among themselves and with the university 
uthorities. 
4. IMPORTANT ADVANCES TO BE MADE 
(1) Close codperation of all religious workers, at each state 
iversity, in a program for the year so as to present a united front. 
(2) Each denomination at large should investigate its local 
urches at all state university centers with a view to enlarging 
eir effectiveness.

     (3) Methods of financing the state university pastorate so as to™ 
insure stability. 
(4) Each church college should think out its religious and de- 
nominational relationship to the state university in its own state, 
and prepare for united denominational effort, state-wide. 
5. A PERTINENT SUGGESTION 
Financial aid should be given the local church at the state uni- 
versity center, by the denomination at large, if necessary, to enable 
it to have capable pastoral leadership. 
IV. Epvucationan Work In THE Youna Mesn’s CurIsTIAN 
ASSOCIATIONS 
[Hodge, George B., Educational Secretary, International Com- 
mittee of Young Men’s Christian Association. Report, 
Commissioner of Education, 1913, Volume I, pp. 578-580.] 
NEED, PURPOSE, AND NATURE OF ASSOCIATION EDUCATIONAL 
WORK 
1. Need. —We believe in the American public-school system 
with its unbroken course from the kindergarten to the university. 
Only when these opportunities are used universally and effectively 
can best dividends be realized. But the majority of men and boys 
have not profited as much as they should by the great wealth of 
public-school facilities. 
When we learn from authorities that two-thirds of the boys 
have left school by the end of the eighth grade; that the average 
length of a boy’s schooling is less than six years; that only 5 per 
cent of all males are fitted by definite educational training for their 
vocations; that illiteracy among voters in the United States is 
many times more prevalent than in England, Scotland, or many| 
other nations; that there is much less opportunity here for voca: 
tional training than in other nations — then we may realize th 
great need for supplementary educational facilities for men an 
boys in America. 
2. Purpose. —To meet the demands of our present-day co: 
plex civilization, there is great opportunity for the service of indi 
viduals, of clubs, of the church, and of the Young Men’s Christia| 
Associations. All forms of supplementary agencies for traini 
men and boys may well be enlarged to encourage, strengthen, ai
-P-A-G-E-719
   
  THE CHURCH AND EDUCATION 697 
+ expand the usefulness of the public schools. As the church, through 
the past 200 years, has so often wisely led in providing educational 
training through college, technical schools, and other appropriate 
features, so its leaders through the associations are now striving 
to help meet the need of the time. The purpose in so doing is to 
develop Christian manhood; to help men and boys help them- 
selves; to inspire them to higher ideals of life and service; to 
acquaint them with, and help them wisely to develop, their own 
capabilities; to increase habits of industry and thrift; and to 
prepare them to render more easily, willingly, and effectively the 
highest type of industrial, social, and Christian service. 
Association educational work thus encourages and strengthens 
other good forms of educational work; improves citizenship and 
assists commerce and trade through appropriate facilities offered 
at any time of the day or night, and it places emphasis upon 
Christian character building as fundamental. 
3. Scope and nature of the work. — Many years of experience in 
an ever-enlarging program of practical educational activities, 
conducted either in the association building or outside of it, have 
developed the following general classes of privileges. The figures 
presented are for the school year 1912-1913: 
(a) Reading rooms. The association provides, cares for, and 
encourages the careful reading of the best periodicals, magazines, 
technical and trade journals. Nearly 1,000,000 persons enjoy 
this privilege daily. 
(b) Books and libraries. The reading of good books is con- 
stantly stimulated. The working library for study and research 
is the means of most efficient and permanent educational service. 
Public and private libraries are used increasingly; 700,000 good 
books were read. 
(c) Educational lectures. Formal high-grade lectures for mixed 
audiences, and with paid speakers of national reputation, are 
promoted; 3,412 such lectures were given. 
(d) Practical talks. Informal talks or demonstrations are given 
by local talent to small groups at any time or place, day or night; 
7,700 were given, attended by 416,000 employed men and boys. 
(e) Educational tours. Weekly or monthly trips to places of 
istorical, social, industrial, scientific, or religious interest are 
njoyed under competent leadership. 
(f) Educational clubs. Many different kinds are promoted 
lor research, study, discussion, reading, and service. There are 
,023 such groups, with 23,821 members. 
(g) Class-lecture series. Professional, semiprofessional, and 
cational subjects for mature men are handled by experienced      
   
    
       
              
                                  
         
    
     
    
-P-A-G-E-720
  698 THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
teachers and leaders. Tuition fees are charged, which usually ~ 
more than cover the expenses. The work requires much reading, 
discussion, conversation, and demonstration. Such courses in- 
clude law, accountancy, real estate, advertising, salesmanship, 
fruit culture, credit work, poultry raising, eugenics, and the like. 
Over 7,300 business and college men are students in such courses. 
(hk) Educational classes, These include commercial, industrial, 
trade, academic, language, and high-school subjects, taught by 
experienced and successful men teachers. The courses usually 
run during a term of 25 sessions or during the entire year of 80 or 
100 sessions. Students pay tuition fees of varying amounts, 
depending upon the subject and the expense of its conduct. In 
elementary subjects the fee does not, and should not, cover the 
expenses. Instruction is given in 120 subjects to 72,842 employed 
men and boys by 2,646 teachers. The students pay $714,035 in 
tuition fees. 
(i) Tutoring. In addition to the work in the classroom, the 
association often arranges with some teacher to meet the indi- 
vidual needs of a student seeking personal instruction. Such fees 
are 50 cents or more per hour. 
(j) Individual altruistic service. Aside from the above stand- 
ard activities, many associations, through whole-souled Christian 
teachers and leaders, conduct: unadvertised altruistic service, in 
which each person gladly invests some of his time and effort with 
no thought of financial return, to help, to teach, and to be a real 
friend to some other person, like the spirit and practice of the big- 
brother movement. The amount of such service now rendered 
is very large and increasing, but there is opportunity for its infinite 
expansion. 
(k) Extension features. Over 100 associations are helping 
to meet educational needs of men and boys outside the association 
building, using the above features in various kinds of city centers 
as in shops, offices, stores, homes, clubs, rented halls, school build- 
ings, and other places. Over 100,000 men and boys were thus aided. 
(1) Coming Americans. Many associations are teaching non- 
English-speaking males in commercial and industrial life to speak, 
read, and write in English. As far as possible, and by wise counsel] 
and instruction, they are led into intelligent American citizenship. 
Over 15,000 students were thus aided. 
(m) Day privileges. In addition to the evening facilities 
number of associations now conduct regularly organized educ: 
tional privileges in the daytime, including various kinds of school: 
courses, and subjects for males of all ages over 14. About 7,00 
are enrolled.

                   (n) Among special groups. While the great majority of this 
supplementary practical educational work is conducted for city 
men and boys in general, yet there is a growing work with similar 
privileges among each of the following groups of men and boys; 
Railroad employees, the Army and Navy, industrial workers, 
farmers, negroes, Indians, and college students. 
(0) Among boys. A large and growing movement with over 
16,000 boys already enrolled in definite evening classwork is in 
operation. Employed boys, who have left the public schools 
and among whom there is such need for educational training, form 
the largest single opportunity. Over 11,600 of these are now 
in association classes. About 2,000 boys are studying in 
association camp schools, and over 4,000 in vacation or summer 
schools in association buildings. 
(p) Vocational training. Such subjects as industrial education, 
continuation schools, apprentice schools, vocational guidance, etc., 
are demanding large and increasing attention. The associations 
find here a favorable field for service, and are already making com- 
mendable progress. About 35,000 men and boys are in these 
various courses under association auspices. . . .

  CHAPTER XXIX 
NON-STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES 
Educational Initiative: Individuals; Social Institutions. — 
The extension and expansion of the educational system, or- 
ganized and controlled directly by the state, has very naturally 
reduced the fields of educational activity of the major social 
institutions, such as the church, the family, and vocation. 
Furthermore, the influence of individual initiative and effort 
tends to be lost sight of in themidst of the enveloping parentalism 
of the modern state in all essential educational enterprises. 
Even so, a certain balance of power is still exerted by institutions 
and organizations that owe their origin either to private bene- 
faction, or to the missionary and constructive zeal of voluntary 
associations. The three sections of this chapter contain evi- 
dence of the great potential worth to the cause of education 
of representative agencies operating outside of the limits of the 
educational system belonging to the state. 
I. Tae Great Founpations 
The so-called great foundations must be included among th 
great nationalizing influences in American education. Of th 
more important of those foundations, The Peabody Educatio: 
Fund, The John F. Slater Fund, The General Education Boar 
The Carnegie Institution, The Carnegie Foundation for t 
Advancement of Teaching, The Anna T. Jeanes Foundati 
and The Russell Sage Foundation, — documents relative 
three have been selected for the purpose of representing tl 
character of the educational forces that have become organiz 
about modern munificent philanthropy.

TRUST DEED BY ANDREW CARNEGIE 
Creating a Trust for the Benefit of the Carnegie Institution of Wash- 
ington, D.C. 
I, Andrew Carnegie, of New York, having retired from active 
business, and deeming it to be my duty and one of my highest privi- 
leges to administer the wealth which has come to me as a Trustee 
in behalf of others: and entertaining the confident belief that one 
of the best means of discharging that trust is by providing funds 
for improving and extending the opportunities for study and 
research in our country; and having full confidence in the gentle- 
men afternamed, who have at my request signified their willing- 
ness to carry out the Trust which I have confided to them, There- 
fore I have transferred to these, the: Trustees of the Carnegie

meetings or otherwise in carrying out the business of the Trust: ~ 
And Second, for paying the sums required by the said Trustees 
to enable them to carry out the purposes hereafter expressed. 
I hereby confer on the Trustees all the powers and immunities 
conferred upon Trustees under the law, and without prejudice to 
this generality the following power and immunities, viz.: Power 
| to receive and realize the said Bonds, and the principal sums therein 
contained and the interest thereof, to grant discharges or receipts 
| therefor, to sell the said Bonds, either by public sale or private 
bargain, at such prices and on such terms as they may deem 
reasonable, to assign or transfer the same, to sue for payment of 
the principal sums or interest, to invest the sums which from 
time to time may be received from the said Bonds on such securi- 
ties as Trustees are authorized by the law of the State of New York, 
Pennsylvania, or Massachusetts, to invest Trust Funds, —and 
also on such other securities as they in the exercise of their own 
discretion may select, and to alter or vary the investments from 
time to time as they may think proper; 
And I hereby expressly provide and declare that the Trustees 
shall to no extent and in no way be responsible for the safety of the 
said Bonds, or for the sums therein contained, or for the securities 
upon which the proceeds of the said Bonds may be invested, or 
for any depreciation in the value of the said Bonds or securities, 
or for the honesty or solvency of those to whom the same may be 
entrusted, relying, as I do, solely on the belief that the Trustees 
herein appointed and their successors, shall act honorably ; 
And I further hereby empower the Trustees to administer any 
other funds or property which may be donated or bequeathed to 
them for the purposes of the Trust; and I also empower them 
to appoint such officers as they may consider necessary for carrying 
on the business of the Trust, at such salaries or for such remunera- 
tion as they may consider proper, and to make such arrange- 
ments, and lay down from time to time such rules as to the signa- 
ture of deeds, transfers, agreements, cheques, receipts, and other 
writings, as may secure the safe and convenient transaction of the 
financial business of the Trust. The Committee shall have the 
fullest power and discretion in dealing with the income of the 
Trust, and expending it in such manner as they think best fitted 
| to promote the objects set forth in the following clauses : — 
The purposes of the Trust are as follows, and the Revenues} 
therefrom are to be devoted thereto: — 
It is proposed to found in the city of Washington, an institutio 
which with the codperation of institutions now or hereafter estab

4 manner encourage investigation, research, and discovery — 
show the application of knowledge to the improvement of man- 
kind, provide such buildings, laboratories, books, and apparatus 
as may be needed; and afford instruction of an advanced char- 
acter to students properly qualified to profit thereby. 
Among its aims are these: 
1. To promote original research, paying great attention thereto 
as one of the most important of all departments. 
2. To discover the exceptional man in every department of 
study whenever and wherever found, inside or outside of schools, 
and enable him to make the work for which he seems specially 
designed his life work. 
3. To increase facilities for higher education. 
4. To increase the efficiency of the Universities and other insti- 
tutions of learning throughout the country, by utilizing and add- 
ing to their existing facilities and aiding teachers in the various 
institutions for experimental and other work, in these institutions 
as far as advisable. 
5. To enable such students as may find Washington the best 
point for their special studies, to enjoy the advantages of the 
Museums, Libraries, Laboratories, Observatory, Meteorological, 
Piscicultural, and Forestry Schools, and kindred institutions of the 
several departments of the Government. 
6. To ensure the prompt publication and distribution of the 
results of scientific investigation, a field considered highly impor- 
tant. 
If in any year the full income of the Trust cannot be usefully 
expended or devoted to the purposes herein enumerated, the 
Committee may pay such sums as they think fit into a Reserve 
Fund, to be ultimately applied to those purposes, or to the con- 
struction of such buildings as it may be found necessary to erect 
in Washington. 
The specific objects named are considered most important in our 
day, but the Trustees shall have full power, by a majority of 
two-thirds of their number, to modify the conditions and regulations 
under which the funds may be dispensed, so as to secure that these 
shall always be applied in the manner best adapted to the changed 
conditions of the time; provided always that any modifications 
shall be in accordance with the purposes of the donor, as expressed 
in the Trust, and that the Revenues be applied to objects kindred 
ito those named, —the chief purpose of the Founder being to 
ecure if possible for the United States of America leadership in 
he domain of discovery and the utilization of new forces for the 
enefit of man.

2. Tae GrneraL Epucation Boarp 
The General Education Board was organized, under a charter 
granted by Congress in 1903, to assist Mr. John D. Rockefeller 
in distributing his gifts to education and to serve as a medium 
through which other men of means could promote education 
in the United States in a systematic and effective way. The 
following paragraphs are from an unprinted memorandum 
issued by the Board in January, 1914. 
The General Education Board has four main lines of work: 
(1) The promotion of practical farming in the Southern States ; 
(2) The development of a system of public high schools in the 
Southern States ; 
(3) The promotion of higher education throughout the United 
States; and 
(4) The promotion of selected schools for negroes. 
(1) The Promotion of Practical Farming in the Southern States 
For the first three years of its existence the Board, through its 
representatives, made a careful study of public education in the 
Southern States. As a result of this study it reached the conclu- 
sion that the greatest present need of that part of our country is 
the increased productive efficiency of rural life. Eighty-five per 
cent of the people of the Southern States live in the country and 
by farming. 
Careful inquiry was therefore made in the United States and in 
other countries regarding methods of delivering to farmers the prac-| 
tical agricultural knowledge that has been developed by National 
and State Departments of Agriculture, experimental farms, ete. I 
the course of this inquiry the representatives of the Board mei
-P-A-G-E-727
NON-STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES 705 
Doctor Seaman A. Knapp, who by demonstration farms was suc- 
cessfully combating the boll weevil in Texas and Louisiana. It 
was the opinion of the Board that the demonstration farm methods 
of Doctor Knapp could be employed successfully in promoting 
~ general agriculture, as well as in combating the specific enemy of 
 cotton’industry. A conference was, therefore, had with Sec- 
ary Wilson of the United States Department of Agriculture, 
0 agreed that Dr. Knapp, who was special representative of the 
Department of Agriculture, might supervise the work in other 
states than Texas and Louisiana, provided funds for that purpose 
might be secured. The General Education Board, through the 
Department of Agriculture, under the above agreement, begin- 
- ning in the early part of 1906, has made contributions for this 
‘ purpose now aggregating $910,267. For the fiscal year 1913-14 
the appropriation was $255,050. Since the death of Dr. Knapp, 
his son, Bradford Knapp, has been in charge of the work. The 
latest report from Mr. Knapp shows that in the states thus aided 
by the General Education Board 216 men are at work supervising 
the demonstration farms and about 20,000 farmers are pursuing 
improved agricultural methods under such direction. He further 
estimates that 187,680 farmers are pursuing similar work as influ- 
enced by those farmers who are under the immediate supervision 
of the agents. This work has attracted the favorable attention of 
the Farmers’ Union of the Southern States, of agricultural col- 
leges, public school authorities and the public press. A somewhat 
similar work has been begun in the States of Maine and New 
Hampshire.     
              
   
     
                        
    
          
    
   Boys’ Corn Clubs 
Under the auspices of Mr. Knapp special state agents have been 
appointed in the several Southern States, who are conducting dem- 
onstration work among the boys of the public schools. Approxi- 
mately 91,000 boys from twelve years of age and up, under the 
general designation of Boys’ Corn Clubs, are “ learning by doing; ”’ 
that is, instead of studying textbooks on agriculture they are 
performing practical agricultural demonstration on their fathers’ 
farms and are making these experiments the basis of agricultural 
study in the schools. In his latest communications to our office 
t. Knapp says that the work is developing in importance and 
alue far beyond his most sanguine expectations.

Girls’ Canning and Poultry Clubs 
   
     
   
    
   
   
       
         
    
    
     In 1910 girls’ clubs were organized in South Carolina and Vir- 
ginia. The objects of the Girls’ Demonstration Work are: 
1. To stimulate interest and wholesome codperation among ¥ 
members of the family in the home; 
2. To provide some means by which the girls may earn mor. 
at home and at the same time get the education and viewpou 
necessary for the ideal farm-life ; 
3. To encourage rural families to provide purer and better 
food at a lower cost, and to utilize the surplus and otherwise waste 
products of the garden and orchards ; 
4. To furnish earnest teachers a plan for aiding their pupils 
and helping their communities. : 
The first year 325 girls were enrolled. In 1913, 33,500 girls in » 
fourteen Southern States were enrolled in what are called Girls’ 
Canning and Poultry Clubs. 
(2) The Promotion of Public High Schools 
The general study of educational conditions in the Southern 
States led the Board to believe that the greatest lack in that 
region and, therefore, the greatest need was of public high schools. 
It is the policy of the Board to do this work through existing or- 
ganizations. Arrangement was, therefore, made with the several 
State Universities in the Southern States whereby such univer- 
sities could assume the leadership and direction of a movement 
designed to develop systems of high schools. Appropriations have 
been made by the General Education Board to State Universities 
in the following states: 
Alabama Mississippi 
Arkansas North Carolina 
Florida South Carolina 
Georgia Tennessee 
Louisiana West Virginia 
Kentucky Virginia 
The General Education Board appropriates to each University 
a sum sufficient to pay the salary and traveling expenses of a spe- 
cial high school representative. This man representing the Uni- 
versity and the State Department of Education, goes to counties 
throughout the State, arouses and organizes public sentimen 
favorable to high schools and secures the establishment and main: 
tenance of public high schools.

   (8) The Promotion of Institutions of Higher Learning 
The General Education Board uniformly makes its gifts for 
endowment. Colleges throughout the country decide how much 
,money they wish to raise at a given time. Application is made 
“+> the General Education Board. A careful study of the institu- 
ren is made covering both its financial and educational strength. 
y» is studied not only as a particular institution of learning, but 
in its relation to higher education generally in a particular state. 
.Then to approved institutions the Board makes contributions 
toward the total sums which they themselves have decided to 
raise. These contributions are made to the trustees of the several 
institutions and the General Education Board exercises no super- 
vision or control in any case after the money has been paid. It 
’ first decides that the institution is worthy of aid and then makes 
its gifts without recourse. It is the conviction of the members 
of the Board that they ought not to assume any supervision or 
control of the educational work in colleges. 
Conditional appropriations by the Board for higher education 
have been made as follows: 
In the Southern States. . . . .... +s... $ 2,877,600 
ME HORW CSTOEM SUBLCS Kae Mieie 3 ap + oe) sant ees 4,125,000 
In the Eastern and Middle States . . . . .... 3,115,000 
$10,117,500 
These gifts on the part of the General Education Board are toward 
an approximate total of $48,630,500, which total sum represents 
the increase of educational endowment and equipment largely 
made possible by the contributions of the General Education Board. 
(4) Schools for Negroes 
The Board since its organization has contributed $660,105 
to schools for Negroes. The greater part of this contribution has 
been made to schools which train teachers. Contributions have 
also been made to schools founded and maintained by Negroes 
where such schools have had connection with organizations that 
afford supervision and audit. 
The Board is also meeting the expenses of six Rural School 
Supervisors, whose work is conducted in connection with the State 
Department of Education, in the development of better school, 
economic, and social conditions in rural sections. 
In this connection it should be said that Negro farmers have 
shared fully in the codperative demonstration work supported by 
he Board under the supervision of Mr. Knapp.

THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STATE 
Conclusion 
It should be noted that it is the policy of the General Education 
Board to work through existing institutions and agencies and not 
to undertake independent educational work. 
The contributions for agricultural demonstration work are ex- 
pended under the supervision of the United States Department 
of Agriculture, which, through its accredited representatives, has 
entire control of such expenditures. Payments are made by the 
General Education Board for this work on vouchers certified by 
representatives of the Department of Agriculture. 
It seeks to promote public high schools not by sending its own 
agents into the several states to do this work, but by enabling State 
Universities and State Departments of Education to do the work. 
Here, again, the direction and supervision of the work is entirely 
in the hands of the accredited representatives of the States. 
Its contributions to colleges are not for specific departments in 
colleges or universities, nor for particular kinds of education. 
The contributions are made to the trustees of the colleges, who 
have full power to direct the expenditure thereof. The only 
promise required by the Board in making its gifts is that the money 
which it gives shall be invested and preserved inviolable for the 
endowment of the college or university. 
3. THe Russett Sage Founpation 
[From Ayers, L. P., Seven Great Foundations, New York, 1911, 
pp. 63 ff.] 
The Russell Sage Foundation was incorporated under the laws 
of the state of New York in the month of April, 1907. The endow- 
ment consists of the sum of $10,000,000 donated by Mrs. Russell 
Sage. The purpose of the Foundation, as stated in its charter, is 
“the improvement of social and living conditions in the United 
States of America.” The charter further provides that “ It shall 
be within the purpose of said corporation to use any means which 
from time to time shall seem expedient to its members or trustees, 
including research, publication, education, the establishment and 
maintenance of charitable and benevolent activities, agencies, 
and institutions, and the aid of any such activities, agencies, or| 
institutions already established.” 
In a letter addressed to the trustees in April, 1907, Mrs. Sag 
further defines the scope of the Foundation and its limitations a: 
 
-P-A-G-E-731
NON-STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES 709 
  follows: ‘'The scope of the Foundation is not only national, but 
it is broad. It should, however, preferably, not undertake to do 
that which is now being done or is likely to be effectively done by 
other individuals or other agencies. It should be its aim to take 
up the larger, more difficult problems; and to take them up so 
far as possible in such a manner as to secure codperation and aid 
in their solution.” 
From its very inception the officers of the Foundation received 
many applications from educational institutions of all kinds and 
church institutions of all denominations as well as from individuals 
and associations seeking assistance. This flood of petitions was 
largely attracted by the broad scope of the Foundation. At their 
first meeting the question of scope was carefully considered. 
Among the conclusions reached were the following: The Foun- 
dation will not attempt to relieve individual or family need. Its 
function is to eradicate so far as possible the causes of poverty and 
ignorance rather than to relieve the sufferings of those who are 
poor or ignorant. 
The sphere of higher education, as represented by our univer- 
sities and colleges, is not within the scope of the Foundation. It 
is sufficiently cared for by other large agencies. Not so, however, 
education of the kind that directly affects social and living 
conditions. 
Aid to churches, for church purposes, whatever their denomina- 
tion, is not within the scope of the Foundation. 
In the three years of its existence the work of the Foundation 
has been partly propagandist and partly in the nature of research. 
It has conducted work through its own regularly employed staff, 
and it has in other instances utilized organizations already existing 
to carry on certain kinds of work. In these varying activities its 
degree of control has varied from absolute direction to intrusting 
direction entirely to others. 
Among the movements which the Foundation has assisted 
financially may be mentioned the anti-tuberculosis campaign, 
movements for public recreation, the placing out and management 
of children in institutions, the medical inspection of schools, and 
propaganda in behalf of children’s school gardens. One depart- 
ment of the Foundation has in charge the encouragement and ex- 
ension of charity organization. Extensive work has been accom- 
lished in propaganda for the prevention of blindness, especially 
mong children. 
In the field of research a careful study of working men’s and 
ther forms of small insurance at home and abroad has been made. 
tudies have been conducted in the fields of the salary-loan business    
   
      
       
      
    
    
-P-A-G-E-732

  and the chattel-loan business, the feasibility of establishing an 
employment bureau in the city of New York, and the methods 
used and the results accomplished in relieving the recent earthquake 
sufferers in San Francisco. Another important special line of 
research has been the so-called Pittsburgh Survey, which has been 
an intensive and deep study of social and industrial conditions 
in Pittsburgh as a typical American industrial city. 
Means have been provided whereby the schools of philanthropy 
in Boston, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis have been enabled 
to establish departments for the training of workers in social 
investigation. This assistance has enabled them to offer two or 
three years’ courses to students and to give more thorough prepa- 
ration for work and investigation. 
The Foundation has emphasized the importance of the housing 
problem in the great cities and their suburbs. A considerable 
tract of land has been purchased near New York, and is being 
used for purposes of experiment and demonstration. 
One of the Foundation’s lines of activity has had to do with 
the practical problems of common school administration which 
are related to the progress of children throughout the common 
schools. Investigations have been steadily in progress for the | 
past three years to discover and lessen the factors which prevent 
the regular progress of a large portion of children through the com- 
mon school course and account for our schools being clogged with 
many so-called “backward children.” Encouraging progress has 
been made in this field; and the problem is now being attacked 
in many cities with renewed assurance, as the result of the work 
that has been accomplished. 
This, however, has not been the sole or the ultimate object 
of this particular line of work. The larger object has been the 
discovery of ways of measuring educational progress and educa- 
tional results. The realization that the great development of 
modern science is based upon the perfection of exact methods of 
observation and research has led to the conclusion that one of our 
great needs in education at the present time is to have means of 
checking results, so as to be able to test different methods as accu- 
rately as it is possible to test them in the field of business. The} 
Foundation’s workers feel that we need to be able to measure the| 
relation between educational products and educational processes 
A considerable number of studies have been conducted in thi 
field, and more are in progress. 
Other lines of work in the field of elementary education are rey 
resented by the publications which have already appeared on med! 
cal inspection of schools, the problems of retardation and elimin:

   tion, and open-air schools. There are now in course of prepara- 
tion volumes on the wider use of the school plant, and on the 
problems and results of school feeding here and abroad. 
Among the other activities to which the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion has contributed financial aid are the National Red Cross, the 
President’s Homes Commission, and the Child-Saving Congress 
in Washington. Some idea of the scope of the Foundation’s activ- 
ities may be gained from the following titles of a few of its pub- 
lications : : 
The Standard of Living Among Workingmen’s Families in New 
York City. 
Medical Inspection of Schools. 
Laggards in Our Schools. 
Correction and Prevention. Four Volumes. 
Juvenile Court Laws in the United States: Summarized. 
The Pittsburgh Survey. Six volumes. 
Housing Reform. 
A Model Tenement House Law. 
Among School Gardens. 
Workingmen’s Insurance in Europe. 
The Campaign against Tuberculosis in the United States. 
Report on the Desirability of Establishing an Employment 
Bureau in the City of New York. 
Wider Use of the School. Plant. 
The above statement of some of the activities of the Foundation 
is not inclusive or complete, nor is it intended to be. It is only 
illustrative. The Foundation has never published a complete 
report of all of its activities. 
The fundamental idea of the Foundation is to place in the hands 
of qualified trustees the income of its large endowment and the 
power to use it in any way they think will best make for improve- 
ment in social and living conditions. The Foundation is not 
confined to any single form of social betterment. The provisions 
of its charter are sufficiently elastic to provide for any modification 
ade necessary through the shifting of social conditions. 
II. Votuntary Assoctations 
The following selected list of typical existing (1914) organ- 
ations, the principal object of which is public education, i.e. 
e molding of public opinion, and the stimulation of public 
tivity, is indicative of a tremendous fund of social energy.

TEXT-BOOK SERIES IN EDUCATION

State and County Educational Reorganization 
(The Revised Constitution and School Code of the State of Osceola.) 
By ELLWOOD P. CUBBERLEY 
Professor of Education, Leland Stanford Junior University 
Cloth, 8vo, xx + 257 pages, $1.25 
The revision of the Article on Education of the Constitution and the Revised 
School Code which follows it, for the hypothetical state of Osceola, which is pre- 
sented in this book is an expression, in concrete form, of certain fundamental 
principles relating to the administration of public education in the United States. 
Osceola is, of course, a hypothetical state, supposed to be located somewhere 
in the upper Mississippi Valley, and to contain a few large manufacturing and 
commercial cities, a number of smaller cities, and large and important rural and 
agricultural interests. The state is not supposed to be one of more than average 
size or wealth, but it is supposed to be one which has recently become clearly 
conscious of the need and purpose of public education, and to have resolutely set 
to work to perfect an administrative organization for its schools capable of meet- 
ing the educational needs of the future. It has accordingly made education an 
important state interest in its new constitution, organized a strong and helpful 
state department of education, and abolished the district system of school admin- 
istration for a county-unit system, under which rapid and substantial educational 
progress may now be made.     
                                “Should be carefully read by all who have anything to do with our public 
schools.” — Progressive Teacher. 
“Every point necessary to the consideration of educational reorganization 
seems to be completely covered in the text and the statistical tables give the 
figures to the last digit. The author’s views are supported by wide experience 
and exact information. This book can but increase his reputation for clear 
thinking and convincing utterance.” — Educational Foundations. 
“A broad and carefully constructed basis for discussion of administrative 
reforms in public education.” — Philadelphia North American. 
“A unique contribution to the literature of educational administration.” — 
San Francisco Chronicle.

  AN IMPORTANT NEW WORK 
A Student’s History of Education 
By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES 
Dean of the School of Education and Professor of the History 
of Education in the University of Pennsylvania 
This new book is not a mere condensation of the author’s 
three-volume work, for the whole subject has been re-written 
from a different angle. Some chapters have been added and 
several expanded, but most of the changes are in the nature of 
shortening, making more immediate connections, or of actual 
omission of material that is unessential or belongs more 
strictly to general history or philosophy. 
More than one-half of the book is devoted to the History 
of Education since the eighteenth century, although the 
work includes all educational endeavor from the day of 
primitive man to the year 1915. Other features added for 
the purpose of making a text-book that will actually function 
in training the embryo teacher are the emphasis upon educa- 
tional practice, rather than theory, and upon education in the 
United States. Every chapter has been written with refer- 
ence to producing the greatest efficiency possible in the 
American teacher, present and future.

    Principles of Secondary Education 
Epitep sy PAUL MONROE, Px.D. 
Professor of the History of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University 
Cloth, 8v0, 790 pages, $1.90 
In the preparation of this work Professor Monroe has been 
assisted by a force of some thirty contributors of the highest 
standing in the educational world. Thus, in a single volume 
are presented the most advanced and practical views con- 
cerning the various phases of secondary education, which 
are now attracting public attention. 
“A comprehensive treatment of the high school and its 
problems, noteworthy for the generally high level of the con- 
tributions.” — Mew York Evening Post. 
“The teacher turns with gratitude to these one and twenty 
chapters by leading American experts on the American high 
school and private systems of higher education.... In 
the present work” Dr. Monroe “has ‘ransacked the ages, 
spoiled the climes,’ in gathering together material from what 
future Keplers and Newtons and Kelvins of education can 
formulate laws and propagate light.” — London Times. 
“Probably the most complete and reliable pronouncement 
upon high school matters to be found between the covers of 
a single book.” — Journal of Educational Psychology. 
“This is the most important and valuable work upon its 
subject that has yet appeared. ... It has the merit of pre- 
senting the conclusions reached by the best present thought 
and practice in its field.” — Te Outlook.

  A Cyclopedia of Education 
Eprrep sy PAUL MONROE, Pu.D. 
Professor of the History of Education, Teachers College, Columbia’ University; 
Author of “ A Text-Book in the History of Education,” “ Brief 
Course in the History of Education,” etc. 
The need of such work is evidenced: By the great mass of varied educa- 
tional literature showing an equal range in educational practice and theory; 
by the growing importance of the school as a social institution, and the fuller 
recognition of education as a social process; and by the great increase in the 
number of teachers and the instability of tenure which at the same time marks 
the profession.    
   
                            The men who need it are: All teachers, professional men, editors, min- 
isters, legislators, all public men who deal with large questions of public 
welfare intimately connected with education — every one who appreciates the 
value of a reference work which will give him the outlines of any educational 
problem, the suggested solutions, the statistical information, and in general 
the essential facts necessary to its comprehension, 
Among the departmental editors associated with Dr. Monroe are Dr. 
Emer E. Brown, U. S. Commissioner of Education, Prof. E. F. BUCHNER, 
of Johns Hopkins, Dr. Wm. H. Burnuam, Clark University, M. GaBRIEL

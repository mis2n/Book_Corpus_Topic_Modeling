      PREFATORY NOTE 
While it is the purpose of this little 
book to emphasize the importance of vocal 
culture in its relations to literary and 
general culture, it is not tts purpose, ex- 
cept incidentally, to impart elocutionary 
instruction. Attention ts called toa few 
features of the subject, which, tf realized 
2m any voice, would contribute much to the 
technical part, at least, of good reading. 
Special stress ts laid upon the impor- 
tance of spiritual education as the end 
toward which all education should be 
directed, and as an indispensable condi- 
tion of interpretative reading. Such edu- 
cation ts demanded for responding to, and

assimilating, the informing life of any 
product of literary genius; without it, 
mere vocal training avails little or nothing. 
By the spiritual I mean man’s essential, 
absolute being; and I include in the term 
the emottonal, the susceptible or impres- 
stble, the sympathetic, the instinctive, the 
intuitive,— in short, the whole domain of 
the non-intellectual, the non-discursive. 
With the kind permission of the editor, 
I have embodied in the part of the book 
devoted to the votce, my article on Vocal 
Culture, published in ‘The Atlantic 
Monthly’ for Fune, 1895.

Un des plus réels avantages de la lecture a

les chefs-d’euvre une foule de petites nuances

  THE VOICE AND 
SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 
AN reading be taught? is a ques- 
tion often asked, and partly for 
the reason, it may be, that so many 
readers who have gone through courses 
of vocal training in schools of elocu- 
tion, or under private teachers, so 
frequently offend people of taste and 
culture by an extravagance of expres- 
sion, by mimetic gesture, and by offen- 
sive mannerisms of variouskinds. But 
a reasonable inference cannot be drawn 
from such readers that vocal training 
must necessarily do more harm than 
good.   
-P-A-G-E-10
    10 THE VOICE 
Yes, much can -be taught, and is 
taught, and well taught, it may be; 
the desideratum is the education, in- 
tellectual and spiritual, especially the 
latter, without which the mere teach- 
ing and training are vain and impo- 
tent. 
The organs of speech can be brought 
by intelligent training into a complete 
obedience to the will and the feelings; 
and without this obedience of his vocal 
organs, a reader, whatever be his other 
qualifications, cannot do his best. He 
is in the position of a musical performer 
who has sympathetically assimilated the 
composition he is rendering, but whose 
instrument is badly out of tune. A 
reader may have the fullest possible 
appreciation of the subject matter,

intellectual and spiritual, of a poem, 
and a susceptibility to all the subtlest 
elements of effect involved in its form; 
but if he have not full control of his 
vocal faculties, he can but imperfectly 
reveal through his voice, his apprecia- 
tion and susceptibility. This control 
can be secured only by long and intel- 
ligent training. The voices, generally, 
of even the most cultivated people, 
have gone more or less astray, and 
need to be brought back from the 
error of their ways, before they can 
serve effectively to interpret a literary 
product. 
Many great poets have written subtly 
organic verse, who could not vocally 
realize its potentialities, they not hav- 
ing their organs of speech sufficiently

under control. Samuel Taylor Cole- 
ridge is anexample. ‘Amongst Cole- 
ridge’s accomplishments,’ says De 
Quincey, alluding, in his ‘Literary 
Reminiscences’ to Coleridge’s lectures 
on Poetry and the Fine Arts, at the 
Royal Institution, ‘good reading was 
not one; he had neither voice, nor 
management of voice.’ But he must 
imaginatively have heard the wonder- 
ful verse of Christabel and Kubla Khan, 
as an organic, inseparable part of the 
poetical expression. Mere literary 
skill could not have produced such 
verse. It was a texture woven by the 
spirit, which he could not adequately 
exhibit to the physical ear, as he was 
not master of the physical means for 
so doing.

                        AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 13 
To read naturally is a common and 
avery vague phrase. The question is, 
what zs nature? It is the object of the 
science and art of reading, to realize 
as fully as possible the imperfectly 
realized instincts of the voice. ‘There 
is a power in science which searches, 
discovers, amplifies, and completes, 
and which all the strength of sponta- 
neous effort can never reach.’ 
When people speak of the natural in 
expression, they generally mean nature 
on the plane on which they are best 
acquainted with it— the plane of 
    common speech. But the language 
    of the higher poetry, or of tragedy, 
    or even of impassioned prose, is, more 
    or less, an idealized language, for the 
    expression of which a corresponding 
  
-P-A-G-E-14
14 THE VOICE 
idealization of voice is demanded. 
To read, for example, Milton’s apos- 
trophe to Light, at the beginning of 
the third book of Paradise Lost, 
after the manner of common speech, 
would be somewhat absurd. The 
idealization of voice demanded for 
the reading of such language, is not, 
however, a departure from nature, but 
is nature on a higher plane. 
‘Enter into the svt of what you 
read, read naturally, and you will 
read well,’ is about the sum and sub- 
stance of what Archbishop Whateley 
teaches on the subject, in his ‘Ele- 
ments of Rhetoric.’ Similar advice 
might with equal propriety be given 
to a clumsy, stiff-jointed clodhopper 
in regard to dancing: ‘Enter into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 15 
spirit of the dance, dance naturally, 
and you will dance well.’ The more 
he might enter into the spirit of the 
dance, the more he might emphasize 
his stiff-jointedness and his clodhop- 
perishness. 
Of this distinguished advocate of 
‘natural’ reading and speaking, Mr. 
Grant, writing in 1835, says: ‘Ora- 
tory is not his forte, ... he goes 
through his addresses in so clumsy 
and inanimate a way that noble lords 
at once come to the conclusion that 
nothing so befits him as unbroken 
silence. He speaks in so low a tone 
as to be inaudible to those who are 
any distance from him. And not only 
is his voice low in its tones, but it is 
unpleasant from its monotony. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
16 THE VOICE 
his manner there is not a particle of 
life or spirit. You would fancy his 
grace to be half asleep while speak- 
ing. You see so little appearance of 
consciousness about him that you can 
hardly help doubting whether his legs 
will support him until he has finished 
his address.’ 
The writer of this justly says of the 
Archbishop’s writings: ‘They abound 
with evidences of profound thought, 
varied knowledge, great mental acute- 
ness, and superior powers of reason- 
ing.’ But his ‘natural’ theory in 
regard to speaking, did not, it ap- 
pears, avail with him, even when 
backed by such abilities. 
‘Nature,’ says the Archbishop, ‘or 
custom, which is a second nature, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
     
     
      
     
   
                 AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 17 
suggests spontaneously the different 
modes of giving expression to differ- 
ent thoughts, feelings, and designs, 
which are present to the mind of any 
one who, without study, is speaking 
in earnest his own sentiments. ‘Then, 
if this be the case, why not leave nat- 
ure to do her own work? Impress but 
the mind fully with the sentiments, 
etc., to be uttered; withdraw the atten- 
tion from the sound, and fix it on the 
sense; and nature, or habit, will spon- 
taneously suggest the proper delivery.’ 
Such instruction as this is not unlike 
that which Hamlet gives to Guilden- 
stern, for playing upon a pipe, and 
would be, in the majority of cases, 
hardly more efficacious: ‘Govern these 
ventages with your fingers and thumb,

-P-A-G-E-18
18 THE VOICE 
give it breath with your mouth, and it 
will discourse most excellent music. 
Look you, these are the stops.’ Guil- 
denstern replies: ‘But these cannot I 
command to any utterance of har- 
mony; / have not the skill.’ The last 
sentence tells the whole story. The 
Archbishop, with all his great abili- 
ties, had not the requisite s&z// in ora- 
torical delivery. 
So this may be said to be the con- 
clusion of the whole matter: the main 
result which can be secured in teach- 
ing reading, and in training the voice, 
is technique and elocutionary s&zd// of 
various kinds —a skill which the stu- 
dent can bring into his service, when 
voicing his intellectual appreciation 
and spiritual assimilation of a poem or 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
     
    
             
   
              AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 19 
any other form of spiritualized thought; 
the illumination of the subject-matter, 
intellectual and spiritual, must come 
from the deing of the reader. He 
can’t give to his hearers what he 
doesn’t possess. The saying of Ma- 
dame de Sévigné, ‘// faut étre, si l'on 
veut paraitre,’ 1s applicable to the 
reader. An attempt to express what 
is beyond the range of his spiritual 
life and experience, at once betrays 
his deficiency. And no amount of 
mere vocal training will compensate 
for this deficiency. 
There are two unwarrantable assump- 
tions in what Dr. Whateley writes about 
Elocution: 1. That a reader or speaker 
can do with an untrained voice what 
his mind wills, or his feelings impel   
-P-A-G-E-20
20 THE VOICE 
him, to do. Not one in a thousand 
can. 2. That all principles of Elocu- 
tion which may be taught will continue 
in the consciousness of the reader or 
speaker — that he will be ever think- 
ing of the vocal functions which he 
exercises. ‘The reader’s attention, *he 
says, ‘being fixed on his own voice, 
the inevitable consequence would be 
that he would betray more or less hi 
studied and artificial delivery.’ 
All true culture, to de true, must 
be unconscious of the processes which 
induced it. But before it is attained, 
one must be more or less ‘under the 
law,’ until he become a law to him- 
self, and do spontaneously and un- 
consciously what he once had to do 
consciously, and with effort.     
      
    
         
                     
-P-A-G-E-21
    AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 21 
It may be that Dr. Whateley’s views 
in regard to Elocution were somewhat 
the reactionary product of the highly 
artificial style of pulpit oratory which 
appears to have been the fashion in 
the Dublin of his day. (Noter.) He 
was a man of such perfect honesty 
and integrity, with such a resulting 
aversion to sham and empty display 
of every kind, that he came to regard 
all training in vocal delivery as un- 
favorable to genuineness. His theory 
was fully confirmed, he may have felt, 
by some of the popular theatrical 
preachers around him, who made a 
display of themselves, and who, in 
the Archbishop’s words, ‘aimed at 
nothing, and —hit it.’   
-P-A-G-E-22
    22 THE VOICE 
HEN I was a small boy, at school, 
sixty years ago, all the scholars 
had to read aloud twice a day; the sev- 
eral classes standing while they read, 
and toeing a chalk line. ‘The books 
used were the New Testament and Lind- 
ley Murray’s English Reader. The 
standard instruction imparted was very 
limited, but very good so far as it went, 
namely, ‘Speak distinctly and mind 
your stops.” Each boy read, at a 
time, but a single verse of the New 
Testament, or a single paragraph of 
the English Reader; the ‘master’ him- 
self first reading a verse, or a para- 
graph, each time the reading went 
around the class.
-P-A-G-E-23
          
     
            AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 23 
Well, the result was that all the boys 
acquired at least a distinct articulation 
and a fluent utterance, properly sec- 
tioned off by their minding the stops. 
Some of the boys, of whom I was one, 
had to read aloud, at home, from other 
books. When I showed by my expres-     sion, or, rather, by my want of it, that     I did not understand what I was read-     ing, I was at once told so, the passage     was explained and read to me, and I 
    had to read it again, to show that I 
    had caught the meaning and the 
    proper expression. If I were re- 
    quired to read something which was 
    entirely new to me, my eye was exer- 
    cised in running ahead of my voice, 
    and taking in what was coming, to 
    the extent of a sentence or two, in   
-P-A-G-E-24
24 THE VOICE 
order to read with sufficient expres- 
sion not to be stopped, as I was very 
impatient of interruption, especially 
if I particularly enjoyed the subject: 
matter. 
When I look back upon these daily 
exercises in reading, at school and at 
home, I feel that nothing could have 
been better at the time. There was 
no such thing as ‘speaking a piece,’ 
with gesture, ‘limbs all going like a 
telegraph in motion,’ and straining 
after effect. It was simply careful, 
honest reading, with no attempt at 
make-believe of feeling. No encour- 
agement was given to any affectation 
of that kind; but whatever impressed 
my listeners as genuine feeling and 
appreciation on my part, was duly 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
   
    
    AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 25 
praised; and I was very fond of 
praise, and was stimulated by it to 
do my best. 
I fear that such reading has very 
much gone out of use, and that un- 
timely technical instruction has taken 
its place. Call on a college student 
to read any prose passage extempore, 
and what is the result in ninety-nine 
cases out of a hundred? Why, he 
will read it, experto credite, in a 
most bungling way, with an imper- 
fect articulation, without any proper 
grouping or perspective; and if the 
passage be an involved and long-sus- 
pended period, which his eye should 
run along and grasp as a whole, in 
advance of his voice, he will be lost 
in it before he get half way through       
    
   
              
-P-A-G-E-26
       26 THE VOICE 
it. He has had little or no practice 
in reading aloud. He has ‘parsed’ 
much in the lower schools, but his 
parsing has not resulted in synthesis 
(which should be the sole object of all 
analysis), has not resulted in a knowl- 
edge of language as a living organism, 
and the consequence is that his extem- 
pore vocalization of the passage is more 
or less chaotic and — afflicting. 
Extempore reading requires that the 
eye be well trained to keep ahead of 
the voice, and to take in a whole 
period, or a whole stanza, in order 
that each part of it be read with ref- 
erence to the whole, that is, with the 
proper perspective. To do this de- 
mands an almost immediate synthetic 
grasp, the result of much training.

The perspective of speech is virtu- 
ally a part of the meaning. One who 
reads without perspective does not give 
his hearers the exact meaning, for the 
reason that, subordinate parts standing 
out as prominently as leading parts, the 
hearer does not get a correct impres- 
sion of their various degrees of impor- 
tance, unless he do for himself what 
the reader should do; and, certainly, 
not many hearers are equal to this — 
not one ina thousand. Our estimates 
          
  cf all things are more or less relative, 
so that perspective plays a large part 
in whatever we take account of. What 
would a picture be without perspec- 
tive? But it is of equal importance, 
                
  of greater importance, indeed, in the 
    vocal presentation of language.

A true perspective demands, on the 
part of the reader, the nicest sense of 
the relative values of successive and 
involved groups or sections of thought 
— those belonging to the main current 
of thought being brought to the front 
with a fulness of expression, and the 
subordinate groups or sections accord- 
ing to their several degrees of subor- 
dination, being thrown back with a 
corresponding reduction of expres- 
sion. Along with this, the whole 
must have that toning which reveals 
the spirit of the whole. Could there 
be any better test than reading, of a 
student’s knowledge of the organic 
structure of the language, and the ex- 
tent to which the thought is spirit- 
ualized? Hardly.     The ordinary ex-
-P-A-G-E-29
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 29 
aminations of the schools, through 
questions, are wholly inadequate for 
getting at such knowledge — for evok- 
ing a student’s sense of the //e of the 
language as an organ of the intellectual 
and the spiritual. 
Technical knowledge is a good thing 
in its way, but a knowledge of life, in 
whatever form, is a far better thing. 
And it is only life that can awaken 
life. Technical knowledge, by itself, 
is only dry bones. The technical, in- 
deed, cannot by itself be appreciated. 
It must be appreciated as an expres- 
sion of life—as an expression of the 
plastic spirit of thought and feeling, 
Reading must supply all the deficien+ 
cies of written or printed language. It 
must give life to the letter. How com- f

paratively little is addressed to the eye, 
in print or manuscript, of what has to 
be addressed to the ear by a reader! 
‘There are no indications of tone, qual- 
ity of voice, inflection, pitch, time, or 
any other of the vocal functions de- 
manded for a full intellectual and

not truly a poem until it is voiced by 
an accomplished reader who has ade- 
quately assimilated it—in whom it 
has, to some extent, been born again, 
according to his individual spiritual 
constitution and experiences. The 
potentialities, so to speak, of the 
printed poem, must be vocally real- 
ized. What Shelley, in his lines ‘To 
a Lady, with a Guitar,’ says of what

truth, of the revealings of every true 
poem; it 
‘will not tell 
To those who cannot question well 
The spirit that inhabits it; 
It talks according to the wit 
Of its companions; and no more

by those who endeavor to get at its 
secrets. 
Good reading is a vocal manifesta-     tion of responsiveness, on the part of 
    the reader, to the hieroglyphic letter.

UCH early training in reading as I 
have described, is the best prepa- 
ration for the more elaborate expres- 
sion demanded by the higher litera- 
ture. And we shall not have a true, 
honest vocal interpretation of litera- 
ture until we return to this early hon- 
est reading. I say ‘return,’ for, so far 
as my knowledge goes, there is a plen- 
tiful lack of it, at present, in primary 
schools —a lack somewhat due, no 
doubt, to the ever-increasing amount 
and variety of knowledge which stu- 
dents are compelled to acquire in the 
schools. There ts no time left for edu- 
cation. Hewould be the ideal teacher

who could induce a maximum amount 
of education on the basis of a mini- 
mum amount of acquirement. But 
just the reverse prevails. Acquire- 
ment is made the all in all, and edu- 
cation is left to take care of itself. 
The acquisition of knowledge, too, 
becomes a mere indulgence with thou- 
sands of people, in these days — an in- 
dulgence which renders them more and 
more averse to any of that independent 
activity of mind upon which education 
so largely depends. 
I am quite surprised at what M.

And elsewhere he calls upon 
the people of France to imitate the 
United States of North America, in 
making the art of reading aloud the 
very corner-stone of public education ! 
Where could M. Legouvé have got this 
remarkable opinion of the high esti- 
mate, in this country, of reading aloud, 
as an educational agency? From what- 
ever source he derived it, it is cer- 
tainly most remote from the truth.

fessor Dowden, p. 225), is quite 
applicable to this country. After 
saying that he regards the reading 
of Shakespeare to boys and girls, if 
it be well read and they are apt, ‘as 
carrying with it a deeper cultivation 
than anything else which can be done 
to cultivate them,’ he adds, ‘I often 
think how strange it is that amongst 
all the efforts which are made in these 
times to teach young people everything 
that is to be known, from the cedar of 
Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall, the 
one thing omitted is teaching them to 
read. At present, to be sure, it is a 
very rare thing to find any one who 
can teach it; but it is an art which 
might be propagated from the few to 
the many with great rapidity, if a due

appreciation of it were to become cur- 
rent. The rage for lecturing would 
be a more reasonable rage if that were 
taught in lectures which can be con- 
veyed only by voice and utterance, and 
not by books.’ 
Here, by the way, is indicated what 
the literary lecture should be. It is 
a comparatively easy thing to lecture 
about literary products and to deal out 
literary knowledge of various kinds, and 
cheap philosophy in regard to the rela- 
tions of literature to time and place. 
A professor of literature might do this 
respectably well without much knowl- 
edge of the literature itself. But what 
students especiallyneed is to be brought 
into direct relationship with literature 
in its essential, absolute character; so     
     
                                   
-P-A-G-E-37
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 37 
that the very highest form of literary 
lecturing is interpretative reading. 
Such reading brings home to suff- 
ciently susceptible students what can- 
not be lectured about—namely, the 
intellectually indefinite element of a 
literary product. Much of what is 
otherwise done for students, in the 
way of lecturing, they could do quite 
as well for themselves. 
‘A book of criticism,’ says Hume, 
‘ought to consist chiefly of quotations.’ 
The same should be said of a literary 
lecture, with the important addition to 
the word ‘quotations,’ ‘effectively read.’ 
To return from this digression, what 
seemed so strange to Sir Henry Taylor, 
is not so strange when it is considered 
that the dealing out of knowledge, in
-P-A-G-E-38

the schools, on the part of the teacher, 
and the acquiring of it on the part of 
students, leave no time for education 
of any kind except the little which is 
incident upon the imparting and the 
acquisition of various kinds of knowl- 
edge ‘from the cedar of Lebanon to 
the hyssop on the wall.’ 
Perhaps the greatest danger to which 
education proper will be more and more 
exposed, in the future, will be the great 
increase of knowledge, in every depart- 
ment of thought. This may sound 
paradoxical; but with the increase of 
knowledge, the temptation will corre- 
spondingly increase to make the acqui- 
sition of the greatest possible amount 
of it, in schools, colleges, and univer- 
sities, the leading aim. To give the

student the fullest command of his fac- 
ulties, should certainly be the prime 
object, to which the acquisition of 
knowledge should be subservient; but 
this object seems to be more and more 
lost sight of, while to cram his mind 
to the utmost, with vague, indefinite, 
and heterogeneous knowledge, is get- 
ting more and more to be, if not the 
sole, at any rate the chief, considera- 
tion. This state of things prevails 
from our lowest to our highest schools. 
We hear and read ad nauseam that the 
word ‘education’ means ‘a drawing 
out.” This one etymology everybody 
knows, if he doesn’t know any other. 
Lecturers and writers on education, 
and school circulars, keep reiterating 
it. There are certain truths so ding-

donged in our ears that they lose all 
their vitality. One of these certainly 
is, that the word ‘education’ means ‘a 
drawing out.’ Sometimes a teacher at 
a school institute, after presenting this 
etymology, proceeds to present what he 
considers the best methods of ramming 
in! 
There are schools, and their patrons 
think them excellent, which out-herod 
Herod in their slaughter of the In- 
nocents. Sad, indeed, is it that the 
young are so debarred, as they are, 
by the tasks imposed upon them, from 
all sweet and quickening ‘impressions 
before the letter.’ ‘As in Hood’s ex- 
quisite parody of George Robins’s ad- 
vertisement,’ says George Henry Lewes 
in his novel, Ranthorpe, ‘the pump

is enumerated as having “a handle 
within reach of the smallest child,” so 
do our illustrious educators wish to 
place the pump of knowledge within 
reach of the meanest capacity, that 
infants may forego the mother’s milk 
to drink of its Pierian spring.’ ‘The 
time must come, it is no doubt in the 
very far future, — there are no indica- 
tions, at present, of its being in the 
near future, — when it will be a peda- 
gogical question how to induce a max- 
imum amount of education with a 
minimum amount of brain-slaughter. 
To get back, now, to the leading 
subject, vocal culture: a college stu- 
dent whose voice was neglected in 
early life, and, worst of all, whose 
sympathies were not then so attuned

to good literature, by the influences 
and atmosphere of his home, that he 
came to have an inward impulsion to 
vocalize whatever he specially enjoyed 
in his reading, will not be much prof- 
ited by a course in soulless elocutionary 
spouting. One may have an extraordi- 
nary natural gift of vocal expression 
which is superior to all adverse circum- 
stances; but such an one is a vara avts 
in terris. Unless there be an early ini- 
tiation into literature and its vocali- 
zation, in advance of the benumbing 
technical instruction of the schools, 
much cannot be expected from the 
great majority of students, in a literary 
or elocutionary direction. Truly ‘illu- 
minative reading,’ to use Carlyle’s 
phrase, is, apart from this condition, 
quite out of the question.

e the whole range of linguistic and 
literary studies, English, Latin, 
Greek, German, French, Italian, Span- 
ish, or whatever be the language and 
literature studied, vocalization should 
be made of prime importance. So it 
should even in Anglo-Saxon and early 
English studies. When I conducted 
these studies, which I did, for more 
than twenty-five years, I pronounced to 
my classes all that was gone over. Beo- 
wulf I read to them entire. ‘The in- 
terest of students in this Anglo-Saxon

To know Chaucer as a poet, and not 
merely as a writer of fourteenth-century 
English, his verse, which, after a lapse 
of five hundred years, continues to rank 
with the best in the literature, mzs7 be 
voiced; and to voice it, with the best 
knowledge of its pronunciation which 
has been attained to by Alexander J. 
Ellis, in his ‘Early English Pronunci- 
ation,’ and by other phonologists, re- 
quires a careful training of the voice 
and much practice. A _ susceptible 
reader comes, in time, to feel, to 
some extent, what the zz/onation, also, 
of the verse, must have been. To in- 
spire students with a permanent inter- 
est in ‘the morning star of song,’ the 
teacher must be an accomplished reader 
of his verse, and must train his students

to the best reading of it of which they 
are capable. Of course, a knowledge 
of the language in its historical devel- 
opment, previous to Chaucer, is de- 
sirable, though not indispensable, to 
appreciate his poetry; but the best 
vocalization, in the fullest sense of 
the word, which can be attained to, 
zs indispensable. To know of what 
earlier inflection any final -e is the re- 
sidual, is well enough; but I cannot 
think that any one would insist that 
such knowledge is indispensable to 
an appreciation of the poetry. Phi- 
lology is not the handmaid to poetical 
cultivation. She can be dismissed al- 
together from service. ‘There are no

In the study of JI.atin and Greek, 
even with our imperfect knowledge of 
the ancient pronunciation, and our no 
knowledge of the ancient intonation, 
of these languages, it is all important 
that the student should read Greek and 
Roman authors aloud. A student who 
has first been trained to read Greek and 
Latin prose with fluency and expression 
can then have considerable apprecia- 
tion of verse in advance of any techni- 
cal knowledge. And if he be trained 
to read in time, he will know what 
‘quantity’ really means. As Latin and 
Greek verse is read in the schools 
(when it is read at all), it is accentual, 
not quantitative. I cannot think that 
there was any more quantity in Greek 
and Latin than there is in English, or

in any other modern language, unless 
the Greeks and Romans sfoke more in 
time than we do, which is not likely. 
The Romans were probably more meas- 
ured in their speech than the Greeks. 
Syllables, in Greek and Latin verse, 
must have been made long or short by 
an intoning of the verse. 
When Vergil, or Ovid, or any hex- 
ameter poet, is read in the schools, his 
verse is the same as that of Longfel-

and axx feet. (Note 2.) 
The following verse from Ovid, for

After having been trained in the 
‘scanning’ of the schools (counting 
verses on the fingers), I threw aside 
and tried, and successfully tried, to 
forget all the scholarship of Latin 
verse, and began reading Vergil aloud 
andin time. I felt, at first, the move- 
ment of the verse backward, the ulti- 
mate and the penultimate foot came 
out first to my feelings; and in time, 
the movement of the entire verse be- 
came distinct. 
Chaucer’s verse must be read more 
in time than modern verse. (Note 
3.) But all true verse must be read 
more in time than prose. And even 
impassioned prose, like some of De 
Quincey’s, for example, must be read, 
more or less, in time. Perhaps it 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 51 
may be said that both prose and verse 
should be read in time according as 
the thought is spiritualized. 
The choruses in Milton’s Samson 
Agonistes can be properly appreciated 
only when read in time. The verse has 
been condemned by some critics, as if 
Milton, whose ear, as De Quincey says, 
was angelic, could not compose good 
verse when he dictated, in his blind- 
ness (to which the merit of the verse 
of the Paradise Lost and the Paradise 
Regained, was, no doubt, somewhat 
due), this last of his great poetic com- 
positions! 
Even in the study of modern lan- 
guages, in the schools, there is not 
enough pronouncing of the original. 
It 1s mostly read off in English. Ifa

teacher of a foreign language, whose 
pronunciation is correct (if it is not 
correct, he should not teach it), were 
simply to read aloud to his students, 
they having the text before their eyes, 
and were to require them to read, until 
they could pronounce correctly and flu- 
ently, the language studied, it would 
be a much better introduction to the 
language than the usual grammatical 
grind at the outset. A certain amount 
of grammatical grind is necessary, but 
a thorough training in pronunciation 
should come first of all. And then, if 
a student got nothing other than a good 
pronunciation, it would be certainly 
worth more to him than any amount of 
grammatical drill without it. A living 
language should not be studied scien- 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 53 
tifically until it is kxown. And the 
most important thing to know, at first, 
is its pronunciation. 
Thomas Elwood, Milton’s young 
Quaker friend, tells us, in his autobi- 
ography, of his reading Latin to the 
blind poet, — how he was required to 
get rid of his English pronunciation of 
the language, which his ‘master’ dis- 
liked, and to learn what he calls ‘the 
foreign pronunciation,’ his description 
thereof showing it to have been the 
Italian, —and then adds, ‘Having a 
curious ear’ (that is, a careful, accu- 
rate, nice, keenly susceptible ear), ‘he 
understood by my tone, when I under- 
stood what I read, and when I did 
not; and accordingly would stop me, 
examine me, and open up the most 
difficult passages to me.’
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 THE VOICE 
This sentence suggests that much 
more might be done than is done, in 
the way of getting at students’ appre- 
ciation of the Latin or Greek they may 
be reciting, by requiring them to voice 
the original in advance of translating. 
After having attained, by sufficient 
practice, an easy fluency of utter- 
ance, they could—or some could — 
bring out, through their voices, much 
which they could not reveal through 
translation or any amount of exegesis. 
All the members of the class might be 
on a par, so far as translation and ex- 
egesis go, in exhibiting their knowl- 
edge and appreciation of the original; 
but there would always be a few who 
could reveal through vocalization what 
is beyond translation and exegesis. 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 55 
And the professor would not neces- 
sarily need to have the ‘curious ear’ 
of a Milton to detect this kind of 
superiority of the few. 
This brings me to say that, in liter- 
ary examinations, whatever other means 
be employed, a sufficiently qualified 
teacher could arrive at a nicer and 
more certain estimate of what a stu- 
dent has appropriated, both intellect- 
ually and spiritually, of a literary 
product, or any portion of a literary 
product, by requiring him to read it, 
than he could arrive at through any 
amount of catechising. The requisite 
vocal cultivation on the part of the 
student is, of course, presumed. 
But even an uncultivated voice would 
reveal appreciation, or the want of it,
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 THE VOICE 
to some extent. For, after all, it is 
not so much the cultivated voice as 
spiritual appreciation, which tells in 
reading. I have heard ‘poor, but 
honest’ voices read some poems very 
effectively, and I have heard rich, but 
dishonest voices read very afflictingly. 
To adapt the French saying, & sté, 
c’est homme, it may be said that /a 
lecture a haute voix cest Thomme. 
Reading reveals the reader’s spiritual 
appreciation or the absence of it. And 
it is only to the extent that a reader 
assures his hearers that he has himself 
experienced the sentiments to which he 
gives utterance, that he impresses them. 
To one who has truly appreciated it, 
there is nothing more dreary than the 
usual elocutionary rendering of a poem. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 57 
Suppose a teacher were to examine 
a student on such a poem as Coleridge’s 
Christabel by questioning him about 
it, and the student were to show that 
he was thoroughly acquainted with all 
the facts and details of the poem; there 
would still be no evidence of that stu- 
dent’s susceptibility to what in the 
poem constitutes its mysterious charm, 
~——none whatever. The student might 
be utterly destitute of such suscepti- 
bility, and yet he could just as well 
prepare himself to answer all the teach- 
er’s questions. A very small boy might 
do so, whose appreciation of poetry 
had not gone beyond ‘How doth the 
little busy bee.’ There might be a 
most susceptible literary genius in the 
class, who might fall below the other
-P-A-G-E-58
58 THE VOICE 
student in such an examination! It 
is quite likely that he would, for he 
would be chiefly occupied with the 
poem as a poem, and would assimi- 
late its life without retaining a recol- 
lection of all the details, to which the 
other had given exclusive attention. 
Or suppose the poem were Gray's Elegy 
written in a Country Churchyard, and 
the student were to pass a perfectly 
satisfactory examination thereupon, 
on the basis, say, of the valuable notes 
in Professor Hales’s Longer English 
Poems; what would that signify, in 
comparison with the reading of the 
poem, which would unmistakably show 
whether he had responded, to any ex- 
tent, or not, to its sweet evening pen- 
Siveness, to the general tenor of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
     
    
                 
                AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 59 
theme, to the moulding spirit of the 
whole? 
That he should understand the artic- 
ulating thought, all the grammatical 
constructions (and there are several 
which need to be particularly looked 
into), and all points to which atten- 
tion is called in Professor Hales’s 
notes, is, to be sure, important; but 
an examination confined to these 
would not be any test of his literary 
capacity, of his susceptibility to the 
poem as a poem. 
In these remarks, I assume, of course, 
that the prime object of a literary ex- 
amination should be to test not so much 
a student’s knowingness, as his literary 
capacity, which means a capacity to 
respond to the spiritual life of a poem,
-P-A-G-E-60
60 THE VOICE 
or any other form of literature, in the 
true sense of the word ‘literature.’ It 
is its spiritual life which makes a poem 
a poem, whatever the thought articu- 
lation may be. ‘The student who is 
capable of such response should rank 
higher (nobody but a Dr. Dryasdust 
could deny this) than the student who 
could answer all questions which the 
most prolific questioner could ask him, 
but who could afford no evidence, 
through his reading of it, that the 
poem was anything more to him than 
was a primrose to Wordsworth’s ‘Peter 
Bell.’    
    
                     
   
-P-A-G-E-61

S the student advances to the higher 
literature, he should be trained in 
the higher, more complex vocal func- 
tions demanded for its interpretation ; 
he should understand, all along, in his 
vocal education, the relation of that 
education to the rendering of works 
of genius. He should always know 
what his vocal exercises are for, what 
relation they have to the interpreting 
and symbolizing of thought and feeling. 
I remember a teacher who advised 
his scholars —I was one of them — to 
go out frequently into the open air and 
exercise. their voices. And the poor 
fellows did go, and ‘fright the isle
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 THE VOICE 
from her propriety’ with their bawling 
without having any conception of what 
they were bawling for. Their lungs 
were exercised thereby, but the bawling 
did nothing for their vocal training. 
Vocal exercise must not only be 
physiologically intelligent, but there 
must always be some conception back 
of it which it is the aim of the exercise 
to realize in the voice. One may have 
a conception, more or less distinct, of 
how some very significant sentence in 
Shakespeare, for example, should be 
uttered, and yet his voice is not suff- 
ciently obedient to his will and his 
feelings. He therefore has something 
to work after, and in time may vocally 
realize, to his full satisfaction, his 
conception; and in doing so, he has 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
    AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 6 3 
acquired some new and valuable con- 
trol of his voice, which he can make 
use of, whenever required, in the ren- 
dering of other expressions. 
A true poem is a piece of articulate 
music which may require to be long 
practised upon by the voice before all 
its possible significance and effective- 
ness be realized. But there must bean 
ideal back of the practice (merely to 
keep ‘going over’ the poem will not 
do); not, of course, an entirely dis- 
tinct ideal, it may be more or less 
vague, but such an ideal as may be got 
in advance through a responsiveness 
to its informing life. This ideal will 
become more and more distinct in the 
course of the practice. 
This is true of everv form of art.
-P-A-G-E-64
64 THE VOICE 
The artist starts with an ideal more or 
less vague (but it is an ideal which 
motives all his work), and this ideal 
only gradually takes shape in the pro- 
cess of its realization in a picture or 
a statue. Composing continues to the 
end. The poet is still composing, still 
working after a fuller realization of his 
ideal, when he is making the last ver- 
bal change in his poem. (Note 4.) To 
quote from Browning’s ‘A Death in the 
Desert’: 
God’s gift was that man should conceive of 
truth, 
And yearn to gain it, catching at mistake 
As midway help, till he reach fact indeed. 
The statuary ere he mould a shape 
Boasts a like gift, the shape’s idea, and next 
The aspiration to produce the same; 
So, taking clay, he calls his shape thereout, 
Cries ever, ‘Now I have the thing I see’: 
   
-P-A-G-E-65
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 65 
Yet all the while goes changing what was 
wrought, 
From falsehood like the truth, to truth itself. 
God only makes the live shape at a jet. 
Interpretative reading goes on in 
the same way. After a reader’s long 
familiarity with a poem, and when he 
thinks he has realized all its possibil- 
ities of vocal effectiveness, some new 
vocal movement on a single word, it 
may be, is suggested, which is a de- 
cided contribution to the effect before 
reached. The play of Hamlet abounds 
in little speeches, and single words, 
even, whose possibilities of expressive- 
ness can hardly be exhausted. Every 
great poet writes, at times, more sig- 
nificantly than he knows. 
E
-P-A-G-E-66

In the creation of every great work 
of genius, a large degree of uncon- 
scious might enters; and this uncon- 
scious might the reader with the requi- 
site degree of spiritual susceptibility 
may respond to. This is an activity 
of the highest order on the part of a 
reader. Melody, harmony, and every 
mode of form, are, to some extent, 
the product of an unconscious might. 
Deep feeling attracts to itself such 
elements of language as serve best 
to conduct it. Assonance, especially, 
is a manifestation of it. Paradise 
Lost abounds with the assonance 
which the dominant feeling of the 
poet induced. 
When Hamlet is subjecting his 
friends to a searching examination 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 67 
in regard to the appearance of the 
ghost of his father, he asks ‘His beard 
was grisly?’ and then adds, ‘no.’ (The 
word is followed by a period, in the 
Folio.) What a varied expressiveness 
this little word ‘no’ admits of! When 
Macbeth says to his wife, when they 
are considering the murder of the 
king, ‘If we should fail?’ she replies 
‘We fail?’ Though the interrogative 
is used in the Folio, the period would, 
perhaps, be the better pointing. How- 
ever that be, the reading of ‘we fail’ 
involves much consideration; and so 
does the reading of thousands of single 
words in Shakespeare’s Plays. 
But, after all, it is not upon inflec- 
tions and emphases and other vocal 
functions which pertain more espe-
-P-A-G-E-68
68 THE VOICE 
cially to the interpretation of the artic- 
ulating thought, that the true reader 
chiefly depends. ‘The most important 
thing with him is the choral atmosphere 
in which a spiritualized composition 
requires to be presented. And it is in 
this respect that the art of reading par- 
ticularly corresponds with the sister art 
of painting. ‘The artist in form and 
color bathes his landscape in ‘the light 
that never was, on sea or land,’ or, if 
not that, in some light or other, some 
‘tender light which heaven to gaudy 
day denies,’ and which serves to re- 
veal the feeling which he aimed to 
express through the landscape. The 
landscape itself corresponds in paint- 
ing with the articulating thought in 
reading; but the spiritual attitude of 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 69 
the artist is exhibited through the light 
in which the landscape is bathed. And 
so the spiritual attitude of the reader is 
exhibited through his intonation, which 
corresponds with atmosphere in paint- 
ing. Asusceptible reader will, on the 
first reading of a poem or an impas- 
sioned prose composition, be more or 
less immediately responsive to the key- 
note of the composition. An increased 
familiarity will finally bring this key- 
note fully home to his feelings, or as 
fully as may be; and if he has made 
the articulating thought his own, he is 
now prepared to interpret the compo- 
sition to the ears of others. A reader’s 
success in interpreting such a poem as 
Tennyson’s In Memoriam, for exam- 
ple, can be but partial if he has not 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
     70 THE VOICE 
adequately caught, and does not vo- 
cally reproduce, the key-note, however 
distinctly he may present the articulat- 
ing thought. It is the tone which spir- 
itualizes and quickens the thought; and 
it is the main object in reading, to 
spiritualize and quicken thought, to 
bring it into relation with the spirit- 
ual being of the hearer. 
Vocal training, the most scientific 
and systematic, will not of itself make 
readers, that is, vocal interpreters of 
genius. Something more must be 
done than is at present done, in 
homes and schools, especially in 
homes, for the education of the spir-

-P-A-G-E-71
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 71 
ture forcing open of the bud of reason, 
which now prevails to a lamentable de- 
gree, must receive its due condemna- 
tion. It is a thing to be condemned 
from Christian pulpits. As George 
Henry Lewes says, in his novel, Ran- 
thorpe, ‘the child must /ee/ before it 
can know, and knowledge, great and 
glorious as it is, can never be the end 
of life: it is but one of the many 
means.’

T is quite superfluous to say that a 
reader should have a perfect articu- 
lation; that he should be able to com- 
mand a wide range of pitch; all degrees 
of force, from ~iantissimo to fortissimo ; 
radical, median, vanishing, and com- 
pound stress; every variety of inflec- 
tion, direct upward and direct downward 
inflection; equal and unequal, upward 
and downward, single and double 
waves; accelerated and retarded utter- 
ance; many qualities of voice; not to 
name numerous other vocal functions 
and attributes which are means to 
various kinds of interpretative ends. 
He should also have a complete knowl.      
-P-A-G-E-73
    AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 73 
edge of the language he is rendering, 
as a living organism, — an indispen- 
sable condition of his presenting the 
successive and involved groups of 
thought with the requisite distinct- 
ness of outline, and with the requi- 
site perspective, determined by their 
relative value, of which he should 
have the nicest sense. A very im- 
portant condition of perspective, I 
would say by the way, is the light 
touch which needs to be given to 
whatever is implied, has been antici- 
pated, should be taken for granted, 
etc., —the light touch which conveys 
the impression that the mind of the 
reader does not come down upon the 
parts receiving the same, those parts 
saying themselves, so to speak, but is
-P-A-G-E-74
74 THE VOICE 
occupied with the main current of 
thought. Any untrained voice can 
emphasize, but only a trained or a 
naturally unperverted voice can give 
the light touch successfully. Yet it 
is possible for the heaviest, clumsiest 
voice to be trained to the light touch, 
to delicacy of tint, just as one who is 
clay-fisted may, in time, attain to some 
delicacy of manipulation. The voice 
and the hand have wonderful possibil- 
ities, rarely realized; the former, when 
converted from the error of its ways, 
being, indeed, the most expressive or- 
gan of the soul; the latter being ‘the 
consummation of all perfection as an 
instrument.’ 
One great secret in forcible speech 
is, that all the force be thrown upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 75 
the vowels — the inarticulate elements. 
While sounding them, the organs of 
speech are apart, and if the lungs are 
kept well inflated, the throat is open, 
and no friction results; while articu- 
lating the consonants, certain two of 
the organs of speech are in contact, 
and the throat is more or less closed. 
If force be thrown upon the consonants, 
the articulate elements, or certain of 
them, such as ~ and &, for example, 
there is more or less friction in the 
throat. In uttering forcibly the word 
‘struck,’ for example, all the force 
should be thrown upon the #, the 
consonants s/v and & being about the 
same as in ordinary utterance. 
The music of speech is chiefly in 
the vowels. But the consonants must, 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  
76 THE VOICE 
of course, be distinctly articulated and 
not be drowned in the vocality. 
Sir Henry Taylor writes to Lady 
Taunton, May 23, 1862 (Correspond- 
ence, edited by Edward Dowden), of 
Tennyson’s reading: ‘As to his read- 
ing, he is avery deep-mouthed hound, 
and the sound of it is very grand; but 
I rather need to know by heart what he 
is reading, for otherwise I find the 
sense to be lost in sounds from time 
to time; and, even when I do know 
what the words are, I think more of 
articulation is wanted to give the con- 
sonantal effects of the rhythm; for with- 
out these effects the melodious sinks 
into the mellifluous in any ordinary 
utterance; and even when intoned by 
such an organ as Alfred’s, if the poetry 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
    AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 77 
be of a high order, the rhythm so 
sounded loses something of its musi- 
cal and more of its intellectual sig- 
nificance. In the best verse, not every 
word only, but every letter, should 
speak. Nevertheless, his reading is 
very fine of its kind, and it is a very 
rare thing to hear fine reading of any 
kind.’ 
In regard to inflections, or bends, 
of the voice, of every kind, direct up- 
ward, or downward, or combinations of 
both, which are called waves (upward 
waves being a combination of down- 
ward and upward inflections, or bends, 
and downward waves the reverse, and 
double waves being a combination of 
upward and downward waves, or the 
reverse), I would say, what I have
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 THE VOICE 
said in my ‘Primer of English Verse,’ 
that a reader must have a sub-con- 
sciousness of a dead level, by which, 
or from which, to graduate all his de- 
partures; and it is only by avoiding all 
non-significant departures that he im- 
parts to his hearers a sub-consciousness 
of his own standard. There should 
never be in reading a non-significant 
departure from a pure monotony. Sig- 
nificant vocal intervals lose their effec- 
tiveness when they are mixed up with 
non-significantones. Great effects can 
be secured through very simple means 
by a reader who strictly observes this 
principle. Every little bend of the 
voice tells. But a wriggling voice, 
the general tenor of which is a viola- 
tion of this principle, cannot secure 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
    
AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 79 
such effects. ‘The hearer is presented 
with a jumble of non-significant and 
would-be significant intervals, which 
is less effective than a pure monotony 
would be. 
Appreciative reading is shown as 
much, perhaps, in what I will call 
time melody, as in almost any other 
feature of vocalization. A reader’s 
sense of the relative values of succes- 
sive and involved groups of thought, 
is largely indicated by his varied (me- 
lodious) rate of utterance. And much 
of the pleasure which an appreciative 
listener derives from reading, as read- 
ing, is this indication on the part of 
the reader of a nice estimate of rela- 
tive values. He feels that the reader 
is a qualified interpreter. ‘This esti-
-P-A-G-E-80
  
80 THE VOICE 
mate cannot always be determined 
by what a writer makes, syntactically, 
principal, and what subordinate, in 
the construction of his language. Of 
course, a mere variation of time is not, 
of itself, sufficient. There must be an 
appropriate variation of tone-color, 
etc. 
A simile or comparison, for example, 
must be so read as to indicate the read- 
er’s estimate of what it illustrates; 
and this is particularly shown by the 
accelerated or retarded utterance of it, 
and by the tone-color given to it. 
The following striking simile from 
II Kings, xxi. 13, should be read with 
an accelerated utterance, implying the 
ease with which the act illustrated will 
be performed: ‘And I will stretch over 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 81 
Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the 
plummet of the house of Ahab: and [ 
will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a 
dish, wiping tt, and turning it upside 
down.’ 
The following comparison (Isaiah, 
lv. 10, 11) should be read in slower 
time, in itself considered, and, partly, 
for the reason that it precedes what it 
illustrates (a due expectation must be 
awakened as to what follows): ‘ds 
the rain cometh down and the snow 
from heaven, and returneth not thither, 
but watereth the earth, and maketh it 
bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to 
the sower and bread to the eater; so 
shall my word be that goeth out of my 
mouth: it shall not return unto me 
void, but it shall accomplish that 
F
-P-A-G-E-82
82 THE VOICE 
which I please, and it shall prosper 
in the thing whereto I sent it.’ 
In still slower time, every appreci- 
ative reader would spontaneously read 
the following comparison (Milton's 
Paradise Lost, Book I., vv. 591-600) : 
his form had not yet lost 
All her original brightness; nor appeared 
Less than archangel ruined, and the excess 
Of glory obscured: as when the sun, new risen, 
Looks thro’ the horizontal misty air 
Shorn of his beams; or from behind the moon, 
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds 
On half the nations, and with fear of change 
Perplexes monarchs. Darken’d so, yet shone 
Above them all the archangel. 
An increased time of utterance must 
be secured through the prolongable 
vowels and consonants, rather than 
through pauses, though the latter must 
also be somewhat extended. Acceler- 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 83 
ated utterance must not impress as 
hurry. 
The fifth chapter of the Book of 
Daniel, descriptive of Belshazzar’s 
feast, affords good illustrations of the 
slighting of speech. (Note 5.) Take, 
for example, the first five verses (the 
parts which should be slighted are in- 
dicated by smaller type) : 
1. Belshazzar, the king, made a great 
feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank 
wine before the thousand. 
2. Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, 
commanded to bring the golden and 
silver vessels which his father Nebu- 
chadnezzar had taken out of the temple 
which was in Jerusalem ; that the king, 
and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, 
might drink therein. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  
84 THE VOICE 
3. Then they brought the golden vessels 
that were taken out of the temple of the house 
of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king 
and his princes, his wives and his concubines, 
drank in them. 
4. They drank wine, and praised the 
gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, 
of wood, and of stone. 
5. In the same hour came forth fin- 
gers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against 
the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall 
of the king’s palace; and the king saw 
the part of the hand that wrote. 
The parts in smaller type have vari- 
ous degrees of subordinate value, which 
the nicely appreciative reader would 
indicate by his reading; but they all 
belong to the background of the de- 
scription. Any of these parts, if 
brought fully into the foreground, 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 85 
would be given an undue impor- 
tance, and would reduce somewhat 
the prominence and distinctness of 
the other parts. 
In the first verse, ‘the king,’ should be 
read with an abatement of voice, being 
an understood appositive; ‘to a thou- 
sand of his lords’ (‘thousand’ being 
used for an indefinite large number), 
is sufficiently implied in ‘gave a great 
feast,’ and the voice should be reduced 
upon it, and should not descend upon 
‘lords,’ as it is assumed that the feast 
was given to the chief men of the king- 
dom; ‘and drank wine defore the thou- 
sand;’ the voice after descending upon 
‘wine,’ should drift lightly over ‘before 
the thousand.’ 
In the second verse, ‘whiles he
-P-A-G-E-86
86 THE VOICE 
tasted the wine’ should, as it were, 
say itself; and then the command of 
the king, in regard to the sacred ves- 
sels of the temple, should be brought 
to the front; ‘that the king, and his 
princes, his wives, and his concubines,’ 
should be thrown back with a reduced 
and somewhat accelerated voice, and 
prominence given to ‘might drink 
therein,’ the purpose being to invite 
chief attention to the sacrilegious act 
of making such use of the sacred ves- 
sels. A distinct noting of the differ- 
ent kinds of people present at the feast 
is not called for here. ‘The voice has 
other business on hand, namely, the 
bringing forward of the sacrilegious 
purpose to drink wine from the sacred 
vessels of the temple. Further on in 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
       
                                        AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 87 
the chapter, in the speech of Daniel 
to the king (v. 23), it is necessary to 
bring these people fully to the front, 
the melodious movement of the voice 
being adapted to the special emphasiz- 
ing of ‘thou’ and ‘concubines,’ thus: 
‘and thou, and thy ldérds, thy wives, 
and thy concubines,’ a somewhat in- 
creased pitch and force being given 
to ‘concubines.’ 
In the third verse,‘ Then they brought 
the golden vessels,’ etc., should be read 
as a matter of course, and not as if it 
were necessary to invite the attention 
of the hearer to the fact that the com- 
mand of the king was obeyed. The 
latter mode of reading would be wholly 
gratuitous (as it should be assumed that 
the command of the king was obeyed),
-P-A-G-E-88
88 THE VOICE 
and would waste attention; ‘and the 
king, and his princes, his wives, and his 
concubines’ should be again thrown 
back, and the voice should descend 
somewhat forcibly upon ‘drank,’ thus 
marking distinctly the sacrilege. 
In the fourth verse, ‘They drank 
wine,’ being a mere repetition, should 
say itself (the mind of the reader not 
coming down upon it, but keeping 
along on the upper plane of expres- 
sion), and the voice should come out 
strongly upon ‘and praised the gods of 
gold’; but it should be reduced, and 
somewhat accelerated, upon, ‘and of 
silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and 
of stone.’ Their idolatry having been 
sufficiently brought out through ‘and 
praised the gods of gold,’ it would    
                                         
-P-A-G-E-89
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 89 
waste attention to bring forward also 
the several other materials of which 
their gods were composed. ‘These 
should be expressed, as it were, by 
the way. The mind of the reader is 
done with the fact of idolatry. 
In the fifth verse, ‘In the same hour, 
came forth fingers . . . and wrote,’ 
should be brought fully to the front, 
an increase of time being given to ‘In 
the same hour,’ to mark distinctly the 
fact that divine vengeance followed 
close upon the sacrilege of drinking 
from the sacred vessels of the temple, 
which was aggravated by their idolatry 
(the words ‘hour,’ ‘fingers,’ and ‘wrote,’ 
receiving each the falling inflection) ; 
but ‘ofa man’s hand’ should be slighted, 
the voice being kept up on ‘hand,’ it
-P-A-G-E-90
90 THE VOICE 
being assumed that the fingers were, of 
course, those of a man’s hand, or, at 
least, of a human hand. The place 
just where the writing was done, ‘over 
against the candlestick upon the plas- 
ter of the wall of the king’s palace,’ 
being of no special importance, under 
the circumstances, should be slighted. 
To bring it to the front would cause 
an entirely unnecessary expenditure of 
attention on the part of the hearer. 
It should be left to its own intrinsic 
value, without any enforcement from 
the voice; ‘and the king saw’ comes to 
the front, the voice falling upon ‘saw,’ 
and drifting down over ‘the part of 
the hand that wrote.’ 
As additional examples, take the last 
seven verses of the chapter: they afford 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION gi 
illustrations, too, of the marking of the 
new idea, as distinguished from the 
important idea, of a sentence consid- 
ered by itself: 
25. And this is the writing that was 
written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 
26. This is the interpretation of the 
thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy 
kingdom, and finished it. 
27. TEKEL: Thou art weighed in the 
balances, and art found wanting. 
28. PERES: Thy kingdom is divided, 
and given to the Medes and Persians. 
29. Then commanded Belshazzar, and 
they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a 
chain of gold about his neck, and made a 
proclamation concerning him, that he should 
be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
30. In that night was Belshazzar the 
king of the Chaldeans slain.
-P-A-G-E-92
92 THE VOICE 
31. And Darius the Median took the 
kingdom, being about threescore and two 
years old. 
In the twenty-fifth verse, ‘And this’ 
stands out, ‘this’ being the new idea, 
the voice drifting, with some acceler- 
ation, over ‘is the writing that was 
written’; ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHAR- 
SIN,’ that is, ‘numbered, numbered, 
weighed, divisions,’ ‘mene, mene’ be- 
ing an emphatic repetition. In the 
twenty-eighth verse, ‘peres,’ having 
the same root, and meaning ‘divided,’ 
is substituted for ‘upharsin.’ 
In the twenty-sixth verse, ‘This is 
the interpretation’ stands out, the voice 
coming down on ‘interpretation’ and 
drifting over, and slighting, ‘of the 
thing.’ When ‘mene’ is pronounced 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 93 
by Daniel, it must be supposed that its 
meaning is understood, but not its ap- 
plication; the word ‘kingdom’ must, 
therefore, be marked with the empha- 
sis; ‘and finished it’ must be some- 
what slighted, as the meaning of the 
phrase is anticipated in ‘numbered.’ 
In the twenty-seventh verse, the voice 
moves along with some acceleration, 
over ‘thou art weighed in the balances,’ 
the idea of ‘weighed’ being antici- 
pated in ‘tekel,’ and ‘art found want- 
ing’ is brought strongly out. 
In the twenty-eighth verse, ‘king- 
dom’ must receive the emphasis, ‘di- 
vided’ being anticipated in ‘peres’ ; 
‘and given to the Medes and Persians’ 
we must suppose is not altogether new 
information to Belshazzar, after his hav-
-P-A-G-E-94
94 THE VOICE 
ing been informed that the division of 
his kingdom is at hand. He knows 
who will come into possession of it. 
This phrase, therefore, must not be 
brought fully to the front. It must 
be uttered with some acceleration of 
the voice and in a way to indicate the 
supposed feeling of Daniel in regard to 
the quick work which is to be made of 
the kingdom. 
The twenty-ninth verse should be 
read with some acceleration of voice, 
and without any special expression, the 
reader assuming that the promise made 
by the king to Daniel, in the sixteenth 
verse, if he can interpret the writing, 
was fulfilled. This twenty-ninth verse 
must not, therefore, be read as impart- 
ing new information, 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 95 
In the thirtieth verse, ‘In that night’ 
must be brought fully out, through 
a time emphasis, to mark how imme- 
diate was the fulfilment of Daniel’s 
interpretation; there must be some 
acceleration of voice upon ‘was Bel- 
shazzar the king of the Chaldeans,’ 
and a quite strong emphasis given to 
‘slain.’ 
In the thirty-first verse, ‘took’ is the 
foreground word, the emphasis of it 
implying an accordance with Daniel’s 
interpretation; ‘being about threescore 
and two years old,’ should be read as 
a gratuitously affixed fact, having no 
particular bearing upon what has been 
related. 
Cultivated people cannot away with 
what is generally understood by ‘elo-
-P-A-G-E-96
        
  96 THE VOICE 
    cution,’ which is rather a vocal and 
Delsartian display than an honest vo-     calization, which good reading should     be, of what has been intellectually and     spiritually assimilated. Reading is not 
acting. The first thing to be done to       bring ‘elocution’ into good repute (it 
    is certainly not in good repute at pres- 
    ent) is to free reading from all strain     of expression—to reduce emphasis 
         
            and attain to the greatest degree of 
simplicity compatible with the subject- 
matter, And one important feature of 
reading which should receive special 
attention, as a means to this end, is 
the light touch, which conveys the 1m- 
pression that the mind of the reader 
does not come down upon the parts 
receiving the same, those parts ex-   
-P-A-G-E-97
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 97 
pressing what has been anticipated, or 
should be taken for granted, etc., and 
constituting the remote background of 
expression. 
The highest result which can be ex- 
hibited of literary culture and a cor- 
responding vocal culture, is an organic 
melody, in the reading of a great poem, 
the outcome of the poem’s organic life. 
By melody, in reading, is meant that 
organic variety in the use of all the 
vocal functions and affections, that ar- 
abesqueness of expression, which does 
not allow the ear of the hearer to 
detect a regular recurrence of any of 
these functions and affections. There 
is melody of pause, of inflection, of 
rhyme, of rhythm, of time, of force, 
of emphasis, and of every vocal affec- 
G 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
98 THE VOICE 
tion. In truly melodious reading, the 
design or figure, so to speak, is so ara- 
besque that it is not taken in by the ear 
of the hearer, and does not come to his 
consciousness, but it tells effectively 
on his feelings. And by ‘effectively’ 
I specially mean that the feelings are 
brought into harmony with, into a 
state of elective attraction for, the 
contriving creative spirit which moulds 
the poetic form. Such reading of high 
poetry is the extreme merit of vocal 
expression. Some of its principles 
may be “aught; but the vitality of it 
must be the result of the spiritual ed- 
ucation of the reader, must be exhaled 
spontaneously from his dezng. 
A reader with a nice sense of mel- 
ody may conceal a deficiency of mel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 99 
ody in the poem he is reading; and 
he may do this, without arbitrarily im- 
posing variety. An imposed variety 
is not true melody, which must be 
vital, organic. In the reading of 
Pope’s uniform couplets, for example, 
he may keep down the rocking-horse 
movement of the verse (Note 6) by 
a skilful management of the pauses 
(which come so uniformly in the mid- 
dle and at the end of the verses), and 
of the rhyming words, by an accelera- 
tion and retardation of voice wherever 
these are permissible, by the light 
touch, and by various other means. 
To counteract the uniform construc- 
tion of such verse as the following, 
for example, from the Essay on Man, 
without arbitrarily imposing variety,
-P-A-G-E-100
       I00 THE VOICE     
     
  the reader’s art must approach the 
artful:    
      
  Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, 
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees, 
    Lives thro’ all life, extends thro’ all extent, 
Spreads undivided, operates unspent; etc. 
      
       or the following, descriptive of the 
heroine, in The Rape of the Lock:    
  On her white breast, a sparkling cross she 
    wore, 
Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore. 
Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose, 
         
                     Quick as her eyes, and as unfix’d as those: 
Favors to none, to all she smiles extends; 
Oft she rejects, but never once offends. 
Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike, 
And, like the sun, they shine on all alike. 
Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride, 
Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to 
hide: 
If to her share some female errors fall, 
Look on her face, and you’ll forget ’em all.
-P-A-G-E-101

The absence of enjambement makes 
it somewhat difficult so to keep down 
the rhyme emphasis that it may not 
pester the ear. (Note 7.) 
Where a reader’s feelings have been 
melodized by culture, they will protect 
him against the influence of a too ar- 
tificial construction of the verse. He 
will not impose variety, but he will 
utter humdrum verse, as far as pos- 
sible, under the conditions of his 
melodized feeling.

102 THE VOICE 
HE importance of cultivating the 
speaking voice is quite as great as 
that of cultivating the reading voice. 
Perhaps it is greater; for the speaking 
voice has a wider and more constant 
influence —an-influence which is ex- 
erted in all the relations of life, an 
influence calming or irritating, an in- 
fluence bringing men into friendly or 
unfriendly attitudes toward each other. 
How demulcent the effect of a gracious 
voice, and how rasping that of a snap- 
pish one! ‘The sweetest music,’ says 
Emerson, ‘is not in the oratorio, but 
in the human voice when it speaks 
from its instant life tones of tender- 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
    AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 103 
ness, truth, or courage. ‘The oratorio 
has already lost its relation to the 
morning, to the sun, and the earth, 
but that persuading voice is in tune 
with these.’ 
Of Emerson’s own voice, the Rev. 
Charles G. Ames, in ‘A Memorial Ad- 
dress,’ says: ‘His speech had a subtle 
spell, — a charm like Nature’s own, so 
that he affected men like Old Honesty 
. so silvery, cheery, sane, fearless! 
. . » There was no false ring, no 
trick to catch applause or to turn off 
attention from the message to the mes- 
senger; no show of knowledge or 
power or art. One might forget it 
all next hour, through sheer moral in- 
ability to stay at such an unwonted 
altitude; but while listening to that
-P-A-G-E-104

high discourse it certainly did seem 
as if we belonged up there, —as it a 
man ought to make the very earth a 
pedestal of honor for his feet and wear 
the sky about his brow as an aureole.’ 
How much wrath, with its evil con- 
sequences, might be averted by soft 
answers! How much pleasanter an

How afflicting the chaotic clatter of 
high-pitched voices, at a reception, 
or an evening party! A room jam- 
full of standing people, ‘unaimed prat- 
tle flying up and down’ (true conver- 
sation is out of the question) is hard 
to endure, even with the prospect of 
lobster and of chicken salad, ice 
cream, and numerous other unwhole- 
some things about to be. American 
girls, before they ‘come out,’ may talk 
in a quiet way; but so soon as they 
‘come out,’ many of them think they 
must show that they Aave ‘come out,’ 
by the high pitch and rapidity of their 
voices, which quite deprive a nervous 
man of his self-possession. 
How much ‘the charm of beauty’s

or lowered by the character of the 
voice which goes along with it! 
Woman tells on others by a gracious 
manner, by the beauty of holiness as 
it is manifested in all her ways, in all 
her relations, domestic and social, 
and especially by her voice. A woman 
with a sweet and gracious voice, the 
index of a sweet and gracious nature, 
may exert through it, in the ordi- 
nary relations of life, without even 
knowing it, a better influence than she 
could by advisedly devoting herself to 
doing good, even if such devotion took 
the form of distributing religious tracts! 
The moral atmosphere of a home may 
be not a little due to the voice of the 
wife and mother. The memory, even, 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 107 
of a voice which was toned by love and 
sympathy, may continue to be a sweet 
influence long after the voice itself has 
been hushed in death. The influence 
of the voice for good or evil, in the 
domestic, social, and all other rela- 
tions of life, cannot be estimated. A 
voice may even have a good or bad 
reflex action upon its possessor. A 
slovenly articulation, for example, may 
be the index of a moral slovenliness, 
and may react upon the latter. Subtle, 
indeed, and imperceptible, are the 
influences upon ourselves, for good or 
evil, of all our commonest doings.

hurricanes of notes to a noisy Tophet’ ;

vals that of a Taglioni, and French,

be sent abroad to snatch the graces be-

grand scheme of accomplishments, the 
speaking voice is left out and entirely 
neglected, though she have a voice un- 
pleasantly pitched, and with other re- 
mediable defects which are far, very 
far, from idealizing, transfiguring her!

voted to a careful cultivation of her

accomplishments. 
It is easy to infer what Shakespeare’s 
opinions were on many subjects, al- 
though his Plays are regarded by some 
critics as peculiarly impersonal; but 
they are charged with his personality, 
and shadow forth, not dimly, his views 
in regard to many things. The evi- 
dence is abundant that the voice was 
to him very significant, apart from his 
estimate of its importance, as a pro- 
fessional actor, and that he was most 
susceptible to its charms and td its 
defects. It is her voice which the

grief-stricken Lear is made to speak 
of, when he bends over the dead Cor- 
delia: ‘Her voice,’ he says, ‘was ever 
soft, gentle, and low’; and to this he 
adds, ‘an excellent thing in woman’; 
Shakespeare, no doubt, meaning that 
he had in his mind, at the time, the 
cruel voices, expressive of their hard 
and wicked hearts, of Regan and Gon- 
eril. After the death of Antony, Cleo- 
patra, in her rapturous praise of him, 
says, — 
His voice was propertied 
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends; 
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, 
It was as rattling thunder.

ery, and as his protest against a stilted 
and ranting declamation, which, no 
doubt, characterized many of the act- 
ors of his day. 
There is evidence in the Plays that, 
in the process of composition, he must 
either have heard imaginatively what 
he was writing, or have actually voiced 
his language as he went along. He 
did not write for the eye, but for the 
ear. And the high vocal capabilities of 
his language may be somewhat attrib- 
utable to his hearing of what he wrote. 
Must he not have heard the effect of 
monosyllabic words, uttered with the 
tremor and semi-tone of old age, when 
he wrote King Lear’s speeches?— 
‘You see me here, you gods, a poor 
old man, as full of grief as age,’ etc.,
-P-A-G-E-112
112 THE VOICE 
and ‘When we are born, we cry that 
we are come to this great stage of 
fools,’ etc. And must he not have 
heard the effect of polysyllabic words 
as expressive of Macbeth’s sense of the 
vastness of his guilt, when he wrote, 
‘this my hand will rather the mu/titu- 
dinous seas incarnadine,’ etc.? of the 
guttural emphasis, expressive of detes- 
tation, in the speech of Coriolanus to 
the rabble ?>— ‘Youcommoncery of curs! 
whose breath I /ate as reek o’ the ,vot- 
ten fens,’ etc. 
An interesting compilation might be 
made from the Plays, of passages ex- 
pressive of strong passion of various 
kinds, the several vocabularies of which 
testify to Shakespeare’s having imagi- 
natively or actually voiced what he 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION Irt3 
wrote. The speech of the Bastard to 
Hubert, in King John (A. iv. S. 3), is 
a signal example: 
Bastard. Here’sa good world! — Knew you 
of this fair work? 
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach 
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death, 
Art thou damn’d, Hubert. 
Hubert. Do but hear me, sir. 
Bastard. Ha! I'll tell thee what; 
Thouw’rt damn’d as black —nay, nothing is so 
black; 
Thou art more deep damn’d than Prince 
Lucifer : 
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell 
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child. 
I fancy that Shakespeare had a fine 
voice. If he had not, it is quite cer- 
tain that he had the highest estimate 
and appreciation of the voice as the 
organ of thesoul. His creative spirit, 
u
-P-A-G-E-114

too, attracted to itself the most effec- 
tive vocabulary for the vocal expression 
of every kind of passion — the most 
effective by reason of their monosyl- 
labic or their polysyllabic character, 
of their vowel or their consonantal 
elements. To him, language was for 
the ear, not for the eye. The written 
word was to him what it was to Socra- 
tes, ‘the mere image or phantom of the 
living and animated word.’ (Note 8.) 
The art of printing has caused lan- 
guage to be overmuch transferred from 
its true domain, the sense of hearing, 
to the sense of sight. The lofty ideal- 
ized language of poetry is known, in 
these days, chiefly through the eye, and 
its true power is consequently quies- 
cent for the generality of silent read- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION II5 
ers. In silent reading, an apprecia- 
tion of matter and form must be largely 
due to an imaginative transference to 
the ear of what is taken in by the 
eye. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
116 THE VOICE 
ee impression seems to be get- 
ting stronger and stronger, in 
these days of excessive teaching and 
excessive learning, that no one can 
do anything or learn anything without 
being taught, — without ‘taking a reg- 
ular course,’ as the phrase is. This 
seems to be especially true in the 
matter of vocal cultivation. People 
go to schools of oratory with nothing 
within themselves which is clamorous 
for expression; not even a very ‘still 
small voice’ urging them to express 
something. Many who desire, or 
think they do, to be readers, as there 
are many who desire, or think they do, 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 117 
to be artists, evidently believe that if 
they be trained in technique they can 
be readers or artists. 
But suppose some one is impelled to 
cultivate vocal power because of his 
desire to express what he has sympa- 
thetically and lovingly assimilated, of 
a work of genius: if he endeavor to 
give an honest expression, so far as in 
him lies, to what he feels, and avoid 
trying to express what he does not feel, 
and if he persevere in his endeavor, 
with always a coefficient ideal back of 
his reading, he may — in time, he cer- 
tainly will— become a better reader 
than another could if he should set 
out, with malice prepense, to be an 
elocutionist, and with that malicious 
purpose, were to employ a mere voice-

trainer who should teach him to per- 
petrate all sorts of vocal extravagances, 
to make faces, and to gesticulate when 
reading what does not need any ges- 
ture. Such an one, after passing out 
of the hands of his trainer, is most 
likely to go forth and afflict the public 
with his performances, which will be 
wholly a pitiable exhibition of himself. 
Some of the best readers I have ever 
known have been of the former class, 
who honestly voiced what they had 
sympathetically assimilated, and did 
not strain after effect. But it seems 
that when one sets out to read, with no 
interior capital, he or she, especially 
she, is apt to run into all kinds of 
extravagances which disgust people of 
culture and taste. The voice, instead 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 11g 
of being the organ of the soul, is the 
betrayer of soullessness. 
Without that interior life which can 
respond to the indefinite life of a work 
of genius (indefinite, that is, to the in- 
tellect), a trained voice can do nothing 
of itself in the way of real interpreta- 
tion. It may bring out the definite 
articulating thought, in a way, but 
the electric aura in which the thought 
should be enveloped, will be wanting; 
and where this is wanting, in the ex- 
pression of spiritualized thought, the 
true object of reading is but imper- 
fectly realized. What can be got 
through the eye, it is not the main 
function of the voice to deliver. 
There must be the requisite ‘drift’ 
and choral intonation — drift, the air,

I am pleased to quote, in this con- 
nection, what Professor Edward Dow- 
den writes in his article on ‘The 
teaching of English literature,’ con- 
tained in his recent volume, ‘New 
Studies in Literature’: ‘Few persons 
nowadays seem to feel how powerful 
an instrument of culture may be found 
in modest, intelligent, and sympathetic 
reading aloud. The reciter and the 
elocutionist of late have done much to 
rob us of this which is one of the finest 
of the fine arts. A mongrel something 
which, at least with the inferior adepts, 
is neither good reading nor yet veri- 
table acting, but which sets agape the 
 
-P-A-G-E-121

half-educated with the wonder of its 
airs and attitudinizing, its pseudo-he- 
roics and pseudo-pathos, has usurped 
the place of the true art of reading 
aloud, and has made the word “‘ recita- 
tion” a terror to quiet folk who are 
content with intelligence and refine- 
ment. Happily in their behalf the 
great sense-carrier to the Empire, Mr. 
Punch, has at length seen it right to 
intervene. (Note 9.) The reading 
which we should desire to cultivate is 
intelligent reading, that is, it should 
express the meaning of each passage 
clearly; sympathetic reading, that is, 
it should convey the feeling delicately ; 
musical reading, that is, it should move 
in accord with the melody and harmony 
of what is read, be it in verse or prose.’
-P-A-G-E-122
122 THE VOICE 
A training of the organs of speech 
which brings them into complete ode- 
dience to the will and the feelings, and 
a perfect technique, ‘mportant and 
indispensable as they are, cannot, of 
themselves, avail much in the inter- 
pretation of spiritualized thought. 
This must be mainly the result of 
such education as induces an inward 
preparedness for responding to and 
assimilating the essential life of a 
work of genius. Quxtcquid recipttur, 
recipitur ad modum recipients (what- 
ever is received, is received accord- 
ing to the measure of the recipient). 
And it is, or should be, the leading 
object of literary education to en- 
large the spiritual measure of the 
recipient. 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 123 
Now it must be said that the schools, 
with all their grammars, their rhetorics, 
their philologies, their psychologies, 
their histories and cheap philosophies 
of literature, their commentaries and 
annotations, do not prepare their stu- 
dents to know works of genius in their 
absolute character; for such knowledge 
implies an adequate education of the 
absolute, that is, spiritual man, and 
such education is not induced by the 
above studies as at present conducted. 
It demands spiritual life to respond to 
spiritual life; or, in the words of St. 
Paul, ‘the natural man receiveth no{ 
the things of the Spirit of God, for 
they are foolishness unto him; neither 
can he know them, because they are 
spiritually discerned.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
    
124 THE VOICE 
What is generally understood in the 
schools as a thorough study of a work 
of genius, is occupied quite exclusively 
with the language and with that part of 
the subject-matter which can be intel- 
lectually formulated. That part which 
demands a spiritual response and which 
it is the main object of reading to vo- 
calize for the purpose of calling forth 
such response, is not included in the 
so-called thorough study. The latter 
may do much, indeed, to shut off any 
spiritual response which a_ student 
might give if he were not subjected 
to such study. In this statement no 
depreciation of scholarship is meant 
to be implied. Let us have the most 
thorough scholarship possible; but it 
must not become an end to itself; it 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 125 
must be a means to the higher end of 
intellectual and spiritual life. 
What chiefly afflicts a cultivated 
hearer, in ‘elocution,’ is the conspic- 
uous absence of spiritual assimilation 
on the part of the reader. At best, he 
voices only what the eye of an ordinary 
reader could take in, and leaves the all- 
important part to his face, arms, and 
legs, and various attitudes of the body. 
But the spiritual in literature must be 
addressed to the ear. ‘A spirit aé- 
rial informs the cell of Hearing,’ says 
Wordsworth, in his great poem, ‘On 
the power of sound.’
-P-A-G-E-126
126 THE VOICE 
EADING, I have said, is not act- 
ing. It is the acting which 
usually accompanies the reading or 
recitation of the professional elocu- 
tionist which cultivated people espe- 
cially dislike. When they wish to see 
acting, they prefer going to a theatre. 
When they listen to reading, they want 
serious interpretative vocalization; 
only that and nothing more is nec- 
essary, unless it be a spontaneous and 
graceful movement of the hands, occa- 
sionally, such as one makes in animated 
conversation. 
Again, the most elegant way of vo- 
cally interpreting a poem, is to read | 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 127 
it from a book, rather than to recite 
it. Recitation has much to do with 
this acting business. In fact, elocu- 
tionists recite in order to have their 
arms free to act—to illustrate the 
thought they are expressing. Thought 
should not be helped out by gesture. 
Gesture results, or should result, from 
emotion, and should, therefore, be in- 
definite. Mimetic gesture, or mimetic 
action of any kind, is rarely, if ever, 
in place. If a speaker, addressing a 
very ignorant audience, had to use the 
word ‘rotatory,’ for example, he might 
make a cyclic movement or two with 
his hand, to illustrate its meaning. 
But to do so before an audience pre- 
sumably intelligent enough to know 
the meaning of the word, would be
-P-A-G-E-128
128 THE VOICE 
impertinent —a ‘wasteful and ridicu- 
lous excess.’ So, too, it would be, to 
illustrate the word ‘somersault,’ before 
an audience of ordinary intelligence. 
The absurdity of mimetic action is well 
illustrated in the following: ‘I have 
heard,’ says a writer in ‘Expression’ 
(Vol. I., No. 2), published in Boston, 
‘of a prnular public reader of Boston 
giving last season Wordsworth’s “ Daf- 
fodils’” ; and as she came to the last 
two lines, — 
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils, 
she put her hand to her heart and with 
pleasure indicated by a sentimental 
flash of the eye upon the audience, 
danced a few graceful steps expressive 
of exuberant joy, and bowed herself off 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 129 
the platform amid the vociferous ap- 
plause of the audience. The reader’s 
taste in this case was no worse than 
that of the audience that applauded 
her. The incident shows how great 
the general lack of taste, and the 
need of the systematic study of fit- 
ness in the relation of thought to its 
expression.’ 
I would say rather than ‘lack of 
taste,’ lack of spiritual life, although 
the former is closely allied with the lat- 
ter. A reader who has assimilated the 
‘Daffodils,’ who can sympathetically 
reproduce within himself the heart- 
dance of the poet, can better reveal that 
reproduction through the voice (the 
requisite vocal culture being assumed) 
than through such mimetic foolery as 
I
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 THE VOICE 
the above. He would not and could 
not condescend to the latter, if he had 
feeling deep enough truly to know the 
poem of the ‘Daffodils.’ True feeling 
is always serious, even if it be that of 
deep joy. The trouble with many pub- 
lic readers is, that they don’t truly 
know, have not inwardly experienced, 
what they attempt to interpret vocally; 
and, as a consequence, they resort to 
what disgusts people of real culture. 
I was once present, by accident, at 
a lecture given by a Delsarto-elocu- 
tionary woman, and in the course of 
the lecture, she presented what, she 
said, would be false gestures in recit- 
ing Whittier’s Maud Muller. She then 
recited the poem, with, according to 
her notions, ¢rwe gestures, which were 
   
-P-A-G-E-131
  AND SFIRITUAL EDUCATION 131 
more in number than Cicero made, 
perhaps, in his orations against Cata- 
line, or Demosthenes, in his oration 
On the Crown. Every idea of the 
poem told outwardly on her body. 
If a woman, in reading Maud Mul- 
ler, has emotions which mus¢ find vent 
in gesture, and various physical con- 
tortions, she ought to be put under 
treatment that would tone up her 
system.

The rectification of the intellect must, 
as the greatest poem of the century, 
Browning’s ‘Ring and the Book,’ im-

cation of the spiritual, absolute man. 
As bearing directly on my leading 
subject, the vocal interpretation of lit- 
erature (that is, spiritualized thought), 
I would indicate some of the means and 
conditions of a more spiritual educa- 
tion than is contemplated in the most 
advanced educational schemes of the 
day. 
What may be said to be the pre- 
dominant idea of the present day, en- 
tertained especially by scientists and 
exercising its influence, more or less, 
on the great majority of minds, in re- 
gard to the main avenue to knowledge
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 THE VOICE 
and truth? I answer, and I think not 
unjustifiably, the idea that the analytic, 
discursive, generalizing intellect, is 
adequate to solve all solvable problems 
— that it is the only reliable means of 
arriving at a positive knowledge; that, 
accordingly, education, the highest 
education, consists almost exclusively 
in learning and in being trained to dis- 
cover and apply, the laws, so called, 
of nature, to trace facts to their (sci- 
entific) causes and to advance logically 
from causes to facts — that upon which 
the analyzing and generalizing intellect 
cannot be exercised, being set down as 
unknowable. Of an ¢mtuition inacces- 
sible to analysis, they take little or no 
account. ‘This some future age, with 
a more complete education than ours, 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 135 
will, I am persuaded, regard as the 
cardinal defect in the education and 
philosophy of the present age—a 
defect that tends to deaden, if not to 
destroy, in many minds, all faith in 
those spiritual instincts and spiritual 
susceptibilities and apprehensions, 
which constitute the basis of a living 
hope and faith in immortality, and 
through which, and through which 
alone, man may know, without thought, 
some of the highest truths, truths which 
are beyond the reach of the discourse 
of reason. While the reasoning fac- 
ulties of a man may exist in vigor, the 
ties which unite the soul sympathet- 
cally and through assimilation, with 
universal spirituality, may be sun- 
dered, and a spiritual world for him 
there will then be none.

That there are higher and subtler 
organs of discernment than the dis- 
cursive intellect, and higher things to 
be discerned than can be discerned by 
the senses, the lowliest of men and 
women, no less than the most exalted 
in intellect and genius, have, through- 
out the whole recorded history of the 
race, borne an incontrovertible tes- 
timony. ‘The natural condition of 
humanity,’ says William Howitt, ‘is 
alliance with the spiritual; the anti- 
spiritual is but an epidemic —a dis- 
ease.’ 
Great have been the conquests of 
Science, the last fifty years, and great 
has been their influence on the tem- 
poral well-being of mankind. But it 
must be admitted, perhaps, that these 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 137 
conquests, the product mainly of the 
insulated intellect, have been some- 
what at the expense of ‘the interior 
divinity.’ 
Wordsworth, addressing his friend 
Coleridge, in the second book of ‘The 
Prelude,’ says: 
to thee 
Science appears but what in truth she is, 
Not as our glory and our absolute boast, 
But asa succedaneum, anda prop 
To our infirmity. 
He has been speaking of mental sci- 
ence. 
The present signs of the times, how- 
ever, give promise that humanity, far 
as it has drifted in one direction, will 
assert its wholeness, and will ‘render 
unto Cesar the things that are Czesar’s, 
and unto God the things that are God’s,’
-P-A-G-E-138
138 THE VOICE 
and that the awakening of ‘the interior 
divinity,’ of the spiritual instincts and 
intuitions, will be as much the aim of 
the education of the future as the ex- 
ercise of the mere intellect now is. 
This awakening must begin in infancy, 
when the child first ‘rounds to a sepa- 
rate mind,’ and can respond to its 
mother’s smile, and feel her protect- 
ing care, and the rosy warmth of her 
love. Then will the wise mother re- 
gard her child as almost wholly an 
impressionable being, and will see 
especially to its surroundings and its 
associations whether they are suitable 
to be stamped upon its plastic mind. 
As it grows, she will aim to quicken 
and purify its sentiment, and to culti- 
vate a love of the beautiful in form, in 
   
-P-A-G-E-139
    
AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 139 
color, in sound, especially as these are 
exhibited in the works of Nature; will 
endeavor to bring it into the fullest 
sympathy with all forms of animal life, 
down to ‘the meanest thing that feels.’ 
It is a good sign when a boy loves ani- 
mals and is kind to them; but when 
he is bent on killing things, it can be 
quite safely inferred that he has not 
received at home lessons in love and 
had his sympathies and affections duly 
awakened. Home-life in this country 
is not, as a general thing, such as to 
bring the best affections into a healthy 
play. There is too much worry, too

cares from their minds, to play with 
their children and to show them those 
little attentions which their young 
hearts crave; and mothers expend 
their souls in the cares and vexa- 
tions of housekeeping, or, if, by 
reason of their position and wealth, 
they are free from these, in social or 
other matters which shut them off, 
more or less, from those maternal 
functions which they should consider 
it their highest duty to exercise. Fil- 
ial affection certainly does not increase

their majority, to show a strong attach-

ment either for their parents or for each 
other? And there is a word in our lan- 
guage that has quite survived its useful- 
ness; and if things continue to go on 
as they are now going, it will soon be 
a fit subject for an Archaic Dictionary 
— I mean the word REVERENCE. It still 
maintains its place in our Dictionaries 
of living vocables, but the thing it rep- 
resents 1s a vara avis in lerris nigroque 
similliina cygno. Vain is the attempt 
to awaken the religious sentiment in a 
child, to cause it to fee/ the real signifi- 
cance of the words, as it utters them, 
‘Our Father who art in heaven,’ in 
whom the filial and the reverential 
sentiments are quite extinguished. 
These sentiments are the soil in 
which the religious sentiment can

best germinate, grow, bud, and fra- 
grantly bloom. 
During a child’s earliest years the 
foundation should be laid for that 
spiritual relationship with Nature 
which Wordsworth has presented in 
his great autobiographic poem, ‘The 
Prelude.’ Such relationship but very 
few could realize in themselves as the 
great high priest of Nature realized it; 
but all could be brought into a more 
intimate spiritual relationship with 
Nature than is favored and promoted, 
at present, by home influences and by 
school studies. The latter, when pre- 
maturely analytical, and brain slaught- 
ering, tend rather to shut off such 
relationship. 
What is understood as a scientific 
 
-P-A-G-E-143

observation of nature, is not its high- 
est form, so far, at least, as spiritual 
culture is concerned. It is almost ex- 
clusively an analytic observation, in 
which the conscious intellect plays the 
chief part. It is study, not spiritual 
communion. The highest form of ob- 
servation (if observation it can strictly 
be called, which is to so great an ex- 
tent a rapture of necessity and sponta- 
neity) is that which results from the 
synthetic play of the spiritual faculties, 
and brings the outer world and all its 
minutest features into relation with the 
inner world of man’s spirit, and makes 
him feelhis great allies. Itisthis kind 
of observation rather than the other, 
which ‘adds a precious seeing to the 
eye,’ and gives to aman some measure

of ‘the vision and the faculty divine,’ 
and enables him to know something of 
the fields that are his own; but from 
which spiritual torpor may alienate 
him. 
‘I, long before the blissful hour 
arrives,’ writes Wordsworth, meaning 
when the discerning intellect of man 
shall be wedded to this goodly uni- 
verse in love and holy passion, and 
shall find the ideal forms of Poets, a 
simple produce of the common day, 
I, long before the blissful hour arrives, 
Would chant, in lonely peace, the spousal 
verse 
Of this great consummation; — and, by words 
Which speak of nothing more than what we 
are, 
that is, what we really or potentially 
are,

Would I arouse the sensual from their sleep 
Of death, and win the vacant and the vain 
To noble raptures; while my voice proclaims 
How exquisitely the individual mind 
(And the progressive powers perhaps no less 
Of the whole species) to the external World 
Is fitted : — and how exquisitely, too— 
Theme this but little heard of among men— 
The external world is fitted to the mind; etc. 
The system of general spiritual edu- 
cation which is both explicitly and 
implicitly set forth in ‘The Prelude,’ 
makes this great autobiographical poem 
one of the most valuable productions 
in English Literature; and teachers ca- 
pable of bringing its informing spirit 
home to their students (capable by 
virtue of their own assimilation of it), 
might do great things in the way of a 
spiritual quickening of their students. 
And how much capable mothers

might derive from Wordsworth’s po- 
etry for the spiritual nurture of their 
children! Capable mothers are, alas! 
comparatively few; but forces, to be 
noticed further on, are now at work, 
which are increasing the number of 
such mothers, and will continue to in- 
crease it more and more, as the ideals 
of a true womanhood are more and 
more exalted and realized. The kind 
of regeneration which the world, at 
present, most needs, will have to be 
largely induced by woman, and she 
will induce it according as her true 
rights, which are involved in her ‘dis- 
tinctive womanhood,’ are recognized 
and granted her, by her not over- 
generous brother. 
Spiritual education is not a matter 
   
-P-A-G-E-147
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 147 
of abstract instruction. It must be in- 
duced on the basis of the concrete and 
the personal. The spiritual faculties 
have no affinities for the abstract. 
Christianity was introduced into the 
world through the personal and con- 
crete; rather, it zs the personal and 
the concrete, and its arch-enemy has 
ever been the abstract, in the form of 
dogma and stark-naked doctrine. Dog- 
matism implies materialism. As one 
advances spiritually, dogma declines 
with him, in inverse proportion. 
Christianity is essential being, and not 
a doctrine, not a body of opinions, not 
‘a matter of antiquarian pedantry or 
of historical perspective.’ In the great 
words of the ‘ De Imitatione Christi,’ 
‘Cui sternum verbum loquitur, ille 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
   148 THE VOICE 
a multis opinionibus expeditur’ (he 
to whom the eternal word /speaks, is 
freed from many opinions); and to fit 
the soul to be spoken to by the eternal 
word, is the true, the ultimate object 
of spiritual education. The perma- 
nent, the eternal, that which is alive 
for evermore, should, indeed, be the 
object of all education. Phenomena, 
in themselves, are not educative. A 
feeding on them alone, if that were 
possible (man naturally, whatever his 
condition, seeks other pabulum), would 
soon result in a general atrophy of all 
the faculties, intellectual and spiritual. 
To use the words of St. Vincent de 
Lérins, which he applied to the Cath- 
olic Church, — would that the Church © 
had always made them its controlling

principle !—‘magnopere curandum est 
ut id teneamus quod ubique, quod sem- 
per, quod ab omnibus creditum est’ (it 
must be especially seen to, that we hold 
to that which everywhere, which always, 
which by all, has been believed). 
There is no exclusiveness in the 
eternal word; it speaks to every one 
whose ears are open to it; it enters 
wherever it is not shut out. It speaks 
through Nature, through every form of 
Art (which to be art must be a mani- 
festation of it), through Poetry, ‘the 
breath and finer spirit of all knowl- 
edge,’ through Music, Sculpture, Paint- 
ing, Architecture, through all sacred 
books, and, above all, through sancti- 
fied men and women, of the Present 
and the Past, ‘the noble Living and

the noble Dead.’ In the words of 
Emerson: 
Not from a vain or shallow thought 
His awful Jove young Phidias brought; 
Never from lips of cunning fell 
The thrilling Delphic oracle; 
Out from the heart of nature rolled 
The burdens of the Bible old; 
The litanies of nations came, 
Like the volcano’s tongue of flame, 
Up from the burning core below, — 
The canticles of love and woe.        
               
The word unto the prophet spoken 
Was writ on tables yet unbroken; 
The word by seers or sibyls told 
In groves of oak or fanes of gold 
Still floats upon the morning wind, 
Still whispers to the willing mind.         
        
     The kind of books which the young 
should read, is, of course, an import- 
       ant consideration. If ‘a general in-

sight into useful facts’ be regarded 
as the main thing in a child’s educa- 
tion, such as ‘the royal genealogies 
of Oviedo, the internal laws of the 
Burmese empire, by how many feet 
Mount Chimborazo outsoars Tene- 
riffe, what navigable river joins itself 
to Lara, and what census of the year 
five was taken at Klagenfurt,’ and 
other matters not having much to do 
with the advancement of the millen- 
nium, why the question is easily settled 
as to the kind of books a child should 
be provided with, and be required to 
learn, and recite; but if some vitality 
of soul, the indispensable condition of 
intellectual vitality, in after life, be the 
aim, then a different kind of books 
will be needed —such books as will
-P-A-G-E-152
152 THE VOICE 
serve to vitalize and guide the instincts, 
to bring the feelings into a healthful 
play, and awaken enthusiasm, and thus 
to prepare the way for the later exer- 
cise of the reasoning faculties, and for 
the comprehension of moral and relig- 
ious principles. There is a time to 
feel the True, the Beautiful, and the 
Good, and a time to regard all these, 
as far as may be, under intellectual 
relations. If ‘the years that bring the 
philosophic mind’ be anticipated in a 
child’s education, it will be likely, by 
reason of the premature philosophy 
served out to it, to become a stupid 
man or woman, with a plentiful lack 
of both intellect and soul. Upon the 
closed bud of reason, while it is not 
yet ready to be unfolded, must be

brought to bear the genial warmth of 
sensibility, sympathy, and enthusiasm ; 
and when it opens in its own good 
season, it will not be dwarfed nor 
canker-bitten. 
Sensibility, sympathy, enthusiasm, 
I repeat, are the elements of the at- 
mosphere in which the intellectual, 
the moral, and the religious nature of 
a child can alone germinate and health- 
ily grow, and in later years, bloom and 
shed a wholesome fragrance. 
Stories written for the young must be 
concrete representations of the True, 
the Beautiful, and the Good; in other 
words, they must be works of art. 
Says Browning, in ‘The Ring and the 
Book,’ 
Art may tell a truth 
Obliquely, do the thing shall breed the thought,

that is, bring what is zmp/ce¢t within 
the soul, into the right attitude to be- 
come explicit—bring about a silent 
adjustment through sympathy induced 
by the concrete (it cannot be induced 
by the abstract); in other words, pre- 
pare the way for the apprehension of 
the truth — 
do the thing shall breed the thought, 
Nor wrong the thought, missing the mediate 
word; 
that is, Art, so to speak, is the word 
made flesh, — zs the truth, and, as Art, 
has nothing directly to do with an ex- 
plicit presentation of the truth. ‘The 
highest, the only operation of Art, as 
of Nature,’ says Goethe, ‘is formation’ 
(Gestaltung).

So may you paint your picture, twice show 
truth, 
Beyond mere imagery on the wall, — 
So, note by note, bring music from your mind, 
Deeper than ever the Andante dived, — 
So write a book shall mean, beyond the facts, 
Suffice the eye and save the soul beside. 
The greatest moral teachers the world 
has ever known, have exhibited the 
least of explicit moralizing. They 
have embodied their gospels, — clothed 
them in circumstance, — woven them 
into a tissue of imagery and incident 
and, by so doing, have given them that 
vitality which alone can awaken sym- 
pathy, and thus induce a mental pre- 
paredness for a reception of the higher 
truths, and a comprehension of great 
principles. A deep sympathy with 
truth is the important thing: this im-      
      
   
      
-P-A-G-E-156
       
  156 THE VOICE 
plies a rectification of the spiritual 
      nature — its harmonization with the 
constitution of things. A great amount     of abstract truth may be lodged in     one’s brain, and this sympathy may be     more or less wanting. Tosecure it, the 
      ‘Word’ of the teacher must become 
    flesh, — it must be contemplated in 
the flesh, living and breathing, — it     must be represented as militant, sub-     ject to accident and antagonism, but     assuring men of its unquenchable vi- 
    tality, its relationship with the divine, 
    through the might of its resistance, and 
through its final “vzazmph, though not    necessarily according to earthly stan- 
dards of the triumphant. There are 
novels which exhibit a somewhat low 
ideal of life through the general squar-

being rewarded outwardly and the bad 
punished. But 
In the corrupted ’currents of this world, 
Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice, 
but ’tis not so above. 
The teachings of Jesus are clothed in 
circumstance and imagery which were 
familiar to all whom he addressed. 
‘All these things spake Jesus unto the 
multitude in parables; and without a 
parable spake he not unto them.’ To 
use the words of Archbishop Trench in 
his ‘Unconscious Prophecies of Heath- 
endom,’ ‘In his life and person, the 
idea and the fact at length kissed each 
other, and were thenceforward wedded 
forever.’ 
The liberal-minded reader of the

four records which we have of Christ’s 
life and teachings, must admit that he 
added little or nothing to the pre- 
viously existing knowledge of truth in 
the abstract; he rather caused truth 
which philosophers and moralists had 
already intellectually recognized, to be 
known ‘by heart.’ He presented it 
concretely, in his own life and in his 
teachings, and thus worked it into that 
‘daily bread’ for which he commanded 
us to pray, and which alone will nour- 
ish human sympathy and love. In its 
previous intellectual, abstract form, it 
did not, and could not, become an 
element of spiritual life. 
In the thirty beautiful little stories

the fullest sense, may see the cardinal 
principle of their calling, namely, that 
the greatest power of ethical and relig- 
ious truth can be secured only through 
the concrete, and the personal, through 
that which zs the truth, and not 
through an abstract enunciation — 
through that form which is loved for 
its own sake; whose beauty is its own 
excuse for being; and the sense of 
love and beauty, when awakened, 
makes all things plain. Od: cartéas,

Many who have written books for 
the young professedly to impart Chris-

tion is too explicit. It is presented 
without a sufficiency of concrete cloth- 
ing to keep it warm; sometimes in its 
abstract nakedness. It is thus power- 
less to awaken the love and sympathy 
of young hearts. 
If the views above expressed are 
sound, I would say that, in choosing 
reading matter for the young, special 
preference should be given to such 
stories as serve to awaken the imagi- 
nation, exercise the sympathies, and 
nourish a lively and joyous enthusiasm. 
I should wholly exclude explicitly moral 
and religious stories, and should choose 
in their stead, stories of human sym- 
pathy and sacrifice, heroic endurance, 
and unconscious virtues (conscious 
virtue is always weak), fairy tales, 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 161 
and legends gay and sad. A child 
of healthful, unperverted feelings is 
averse to moral and religious books, 
as aclass. It would rather read about 
Robinson Crusoe and his faithful man 
Friday, and it is far better that it 
should have such preference — far bet- 
ter that it should live, while a child, 
in the golden prime 
Of good Haroun Alraschid, 
instead of being prematurely crammed 
with, to it, lifeless moral and religious 
principles, ‘useful’ knowledge, and the 
sciences. Wholesome to every one 
would be such ‘Recollections of the 
Arabian Nights’ as are expressed by 
Tennyson:

Apart from place, withholding time, 
But flattering the golden prime

A child cannot be made virtuous by 
maxims. The life which is before it, 
is not a scheme to be taught, but a 
drama to be acted.

With men and prosper! Who shall fix 
Her pillars? Let her work prevail.

Of Demons?

‘Who,’ writes George Sand, in her 
‘Lettres d’un Voyageur,’ ‘does not 
remember with delight, the first books 
which he relished and devoured? Has

is it the privilege of childhood and 
youth, and early manhood, to be ad-

Their school tasks and examinations 
absorb all their time, and the accom-

Later on, in the higher schools, col- 
leges, and universities, there is no 
time for communion with great au- 
thors. The reading which is done, is 
largely perfunctory. Speaking from 
my own long experience, I do not 
think that one out of twenty of univer- 
sity students, even of those who elect 
 
-P-A-G-E-166

courses in English Literature, has read 
and assimilated the works of any one 
good author, or any single work. This 
is a statement based on an exception- 
ally long experience. Many have stud- 
ied literature, as the phrase goes, but 
have no literary education, however 
well they may have ‘passed’ in the 
kind of work done. And such stu- 
dents pursue the study of elocution, 
with a sufficiently pitiable result. They 
have never had awakened in them the 
faculties which are demanded for as- 
similating the life of a work of genius, 
and consequently can do nothing in 
the way of vocal interpretation. They 
cannot give through the voice, however 
well trained it may be, what is not theirs 
to give.

ELIEVING as I do, in the impera- 
tive need of the kind of education 
I have suggested, I must, as a natural 
consequence, believe in the co-educa- 
tion of the sexes, in the opening to 
women of all the avenues along which 
men only have hitherto gone, and in 
the removal of all obstacles to the exer- 
cise of the powers inherent in ‘distinc- 
tive womanhood.’ ‘These things will 
do more for civilization, in the high- 
est sense of the word, that is, the spir- 
itual sense, than all other agencies 
combined. A true manhood and a 
true womanhood cannot be reached

-P-A-G-E-168
  168 THE VOICE 
of the sexes upon each other. They 
must be educated together, such edu- 
cation beginning in the family, and 
continuing through all stages of scho- 
lastic training up to and through the 
university. Boys at home, without 
affectionate sisters, and girls without 
affectionate brothers, are at a disad- 
vantage. At no less disadvantage is 
either sex when separated from the 
other, in school, college, or univer- 
sity. For it is only at this period of 
their lives, and in such relations, that 
they can be fitted, if fitted at all, to 
walk the world together, 
yoked in all exercise of noble end. 
The moral insight of man, to say 
nothing of his finer spiritual insight, 
 
-P-A-G-E-169

owes much of its penetrating clearness 
to the feminine element of his nature; 
and unless this element be developed 
in due proportion to the intellectual 
element, he can have, at best, but dis- 
torted views of right and wrong, justice 
and injustice. On this side of his na- 
ture, the rays of an unclouded woman- 
hood must strike, before it can be 
awakened into a genial vitality, and 
thus impart health, vigor, and subtlety 
to the intellectual side. ‘You cannot 
think,’ says Ruskin (Sesame and Lilies: 
2. Of Queen’s Gardens), ‘that the 
buckling on of the knight’s armor by 
his lady’s hand was a mere caprice of 
romantic fashion. It is the type of

woman’s hand has braced it; and it is 
only when she braces it loosely that 
the honor of manhood fails.” On 
the other hand, woman can be a true 
woman, only to the degree to which 
she is permitted to share with man all 
his highest interests, to sympathize with 
all his noblest aims, and to work side 
by side with him in the regeneration 
of the world. That which is especially 
distinctive in her nature, must be sub- 
dued, toned, and guided by a greater 
breadth and solidity of intellectual cul- 
ture; and this can be most effectually 
secured by co-education, and by her 
being afforded the opportunity to move 
with man along the higher planes of 
learning and of thought, and to have 
a larger share with him than she has

hitherto had, in the fruits of the world’s 
intellectual and moral conquests. 
The general recognition and realiza- 
tion which are near at hand, of woman’s 
equal rights with man in all that per- 
tains to the highest good of a human 
being, will have an especially beneficial 
influence in the marriage relation, the 
most important in its bearings of all 
the relations of human life. There are 
numberless husbands who pass in soci- 
ety for kind and generous men, recog- 
nizing the rights of all with whom they 
have dealings, and cheerfully according 
those rights, but who are, in many ways, 
ungenerous and inconsiderate toward 
their wives, and that, too, without 
being in the least aware of it. They 
would be very much surprised if any
-P-A-G-E-172
    
       
    172 THE VOICE 
one were to tell them so. And why is 
this? It is, no doubt, in most cases, 
because of a feeling engendered by the 
whole past constitution of society —a 
feeling that has become so ingrained     as to be an unconscious one — that 
      woman has peculiar duties which she 
must fulfil, but that her rights, apart     from these peculiar duties, depend     upon the arbitrary will of man. Chil-     dren, from a very early age, are made     to feel this more or less, according to     the influences of theirhome-life. When

hero of his nation,’ and, indeed, of 
the whole modern world, wrote in 
1858: ‘Seek in woman not merely a 
comfort, but a force, an inspiration, 
the redoubling of your intellectual 
and moral faculties. Cancel from 
your mind every idea of superiority 
over her. You have none whatever. 
‘Long prejudice, an inferior educa- 
tion, and a perennial legal inequality 
and injustice have created that appar- 
ent intellectual inferiority which has 
been converted into an argument of 
continuedoppression. . .. Like two 
distinct branches springing from the 
same trunk, man and woman are vari- 
eties springing from the common basis 
— Humanity. There is no inequality 
between them, but —even as is the

case among men — diversity of ten- 
dency and of special vocation. 
‘Are two notes of the same musical 
chord unequal or of different nature? 
Man and woman are the two notes 
without which the Human chord is 
impossible. They fulfil different func- 
tions in Humanity, but these functions 
are equally sacred, equally manifesta- 
tions of that Thought of God which 
He has made the soul of the universe. 
‘Consider woman, therefore, as the 
partner and companion, not merely 
of your joys and sorrows, but of 
your thoughts, your aspirations, your 
studies, and your endeavors after so- 
cial amelioration. Consider her your 
equal in your civil and political fe. 
Be ye the two human wings that lift

the soul towards the Ideal we are des- 
tined to attain.’ 
William Lloyd Garrison, in an in- 
troduction to ‘Joseph Mazzini, his 
life, writings, and political principles,’ 
writes: 
‘Mazzini’s concern for the rights of 
man was never, on any pretext, in a 
purely masculine sense. Years ago he 
inculcated the equality of the sexes in 
regard to all civil and political immu- 
nities. Largely indebted to his mother 
Jor the grand impulses which led him 
to consecrate his life to the service of his 
country, his generic respect for woman 
amounted almost to sanchtude : it was 
the embodiment of all that ts tender in 
affection, fragrant tn purity, devout in 
aspiration, and self-sacrificing in love.’

It has never been a matter of much 
regret to me that so little is known of 
Shakespeare’s personal history — the 
circumstances of his outer life. Of 
what his interior life was, we can have 
no doubt. It must have been a life 
capable of sympathetically reproduc- 
ing within itself all the great charac- 
ters, men and women, of the Dramas. 
But if I could wear the wishing-cap of 
Fortunatus, I would wish to know what 
manner of woman, in all particulars, 
was Mary Arden, the poet’s mother. 
The men whose intellectual and, 
more especially, spiritual gifts to the 
world, have been the greatest, and 
most quickening, have oftener, no 
doubt, been more indebted, for those 
gifts, to their mothers than to their

fathers. The radiant shapes of the 
women of Shakespeare’s Dramas cer- 
tainly had their source in the femi- 
nine element, the ewig weibliche, of 
his nature, and this element was as 
certainly, I cannot but think, derived 
from, and quickened by, his mother. 
In what was, without doubt, his earli- 
est play, Love’s Labor’s Lost, Biron, I 
am quite sure, expresses Shakespeare’s 
own opinion of the peculiar power of 
women (A. IV. S. III.): 
   From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive: 
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire; 
They are the books, the arts, the academes, 
That show, contain, and nourish all the 
world. 
   This was as certainly Shakespeare’s 
own opinion about woman as what
-P-A-G-E-180
180 THE VOICE 
Biron says (A. I. S. I.) was his own 
opinion about study: 
Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun, 
That will not be deep-search’d with saucy 
looks; 
Small have continual plodders ever won, 
Save base authority from others’ books. 
These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights, 
That give a name to every fixed star, 
Have no more profit of their shining nights 
Than those that walk and wot not what 
they are. 
Too much to know is to know nought but 
fame; 
And every godfather can give a name. 
Shakespeare must early have felt his 
superiority in true education (the 
nimble play of all the faculties) to 
the merely learned men with whom 
he came in contact, and must soon 
have discovered that Ae drank from 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
     
     
                  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 181 
fountains of which they knew noth- 
ing. His own vitality of soul was 
responsive to the essential life of men 
and things; and it was through this 
responsiveness that he attained to a 
wisdom inaccessible to mere learning 
and intellectual enlightenment. It 
was his mother, I like to think, who 
initiated him into the mysteries of the 
spirit.

ing out tuneful breath upon their fingers, like 
ribbons for topknots, did know the art of 
versification as the old rude Chaucer knew it. 
Call him rude for the picturesqueness of the 
epithet; but his verse has, at least, as much 
regularity in the sense of true art, and more 
manifestly in proportion to our increasing ac- 
quaintance with his dialect and pronunciation, 
as can be discovered or dreamed in the French 
school. Critics, indeed, have set up a system 
based upon the crushed atoms of first princi- 
ples, maintaining that poor Chaucer wrote by 
accent only! Grant to them that he counted 
no verses on his fingers; grant that he never 
disciplined his highest thoughts to walk up 
and down in a paddock—ten paces and a 
turn; grant that his singing is not after the 
likeness of their singsong; but there end your 
admissions. It is our ineffaceable impression, 
in fact, that the whole theory of accent and 
quantity held in relation to ancient and modern 
poetry stands upon a fallacy, totters, rather 
than stands; and that, when considered in

Chaucer, the fallaciousness is especially ap

parent. Chaucer wrote by quantity, just as 
Homer did before him, just as Goethe did 
after him, just as all poets must. Rules differ, 
principles are identical. All rhythm presup- 
poses quantity. Organ-pipe or harp, the mu- 
sician plays by time. Greek or English, 
Chaucer or Pope, the poet sings by time. 
What is this accent but a stroke, an emphasis, 
with a successive pause to make complete the 
time? And what is the difference between 
this accent and quantity but the difference 
between a harp-note and an organ-note ? other- 
wise, quantity expressed in different ways? It 
is as easy for matter to subsist out of space, as 
music out of time. — A/rs. £. B. Browning's

ce qu’il exécutera sur la pierre, sur le marbre, 
sur la toile ot il arrangera toutes ses couleurs.’

  AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATION 185 
Ce modéle immatériel est pour l’artiste, si l’on 
veut, un idéal qu’il se propose de réaliser 
dans son ceuvre: c’est le patron sur lequel il 
travaille et qu’il s’efforce 4 reproduire le plus 
exactement possible. Il y met tous ses soins, 
toute son étude, et il travaille avec crainte et 
tremblement,; il craint de défigurer, de mu- 
tiler image sainte imprimée dans son esprit; 
il craint que sa main, interpréte infidéle, ne 
traduise mal sa pensée; il craint que la copie 
ne soit qu’une caricature de original, et il 
efface, il corrige, il rature, il retouche, il refait, 
il a des hésitations, des scrupules, des repen- 
tirs; souvent il se décourage, il est sur le 
point d’abandonner |’ceuvre commencée, il a 
peur de rester au-dessous de son sujet; la 
perfection du modéle immatériel le désespére, 
et ce désespoir provient d’une illusion. D’or- 
dinaire, ce modéle ne lui semble si parfait que 
parce qu’il est encore vague, confus, indéter- 
miné. Nous prenons volontiers l’indéfini pour 
la perfection; individualiser une idée, c’est 
lui donner un mode particulier 4 l’exclusion de 
tous les autres dont elle était susceptible, et 
cette exclusion nous cofite, c’est une sorte de

sacrifice que s’impose notre imagination; elle 
v a regret, comme |’avare, en dépensant un 
écu pour se donner un plaisir, regrette tous 
les autres plaisirs imaginables que cet écu lui 
aurait pu procurer. Car il ne faut pas ac- 
corder a Schleiermacher que |’ceuvre d’art 
existe déja tout entiére dans |’esprit de |’ar- 
tiste avant qu’il ait réalisé sa pensée dans le 
marbre ou sur la toile. Cette pensée est tou- 
jours plus ou moins enveloppée, plus ou moins 
confuse; elle n’est pas encore dégagée de son 
délivre, ou plutét c’est un rudiment incomplet, 
une ébauche indistincte ot |’on n’apergoit que 
les principaux linéaments de l’ceuvre; c’est un 
embryon dont les organes ne sont pas encore 
développés. C’est en travaillant A exécuter 
son plan que l’artiste parvient a concevoir ce 
plan d’une maniére claire et distincte; c’est 
en manifestant au dehors sa pensée qu’il se la 
rend manifeste 4 lui-méme. Lacomposition et 
l’exécution sont deux périodes de l’activité de 
l’artiste que |’abstraction seule peut distinguer;

Socrates. I cannot help feeling, Phzedrus, 
that writing is unfortunately like painting; for 
the creations of the painter have the attitude 
of life, and yet if you ask them a question 
they preserve a solemn silence. And the 
same may be said of speeches. You would 
imagine that they had intelligence, but if you 
want to know anything, and put a question to 
one of them, the speaker always gives one un- 
varying answer. And when they have been 
once written down, they are tumbled about 
anywhere among those who may or may not 
understand them, and know not to whom they 
should reply, to whom not; and if they are 
maltreated or abused, they have no parent to 
protect them; and they cannot protect or 
defend themselves. Phedrus. That again

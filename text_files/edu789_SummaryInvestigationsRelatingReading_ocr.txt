SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 
(JULY 1, 1924, TO JUNE 30, 1925). I 
WILLIAM SCOTT GRAY 
University of Chicago 
A summary of 436 investigations relating to reading was pre- 
pared last year by the writer under the direction of the Research 
Committee of the Commonwealth Fund. The report, which was en- 
titled, Swmmary of Investigations Relating to Reading, appeared as 
No. 28 of the Supplementary Educational Monographs published by 
the Department of Education of the University of Chicago. The 
studies referred to in that monograph were published or reported 
prior to July 1, 1924. It is the purpose of this article to present an 
annotated bibliography of the scientific investigations of reading re- 
ported between July 1, 1924, and June 30, 1925. Several studies are 
included which were published before the earlier date but which did 
not come to the attention of the writer in time to be included in the 
monograph. A summary of the findings of the studies listed in this 
article will appear in subsequent issues of the Elementary School 
Journal.

SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 
(JULY 1, 1924, TO JUNE 30, 1925). II 
This is the second of a series of articles in which the reading 
investigations published between July 1, 1924, and June 30, 1925, 
are summarized. The first article appeared in the February number 
of the Elementary School Journal and contained an annotated bibli- 
ography of seventy-three investigations. It is the purpose of this 
article and of two which will follow to present a brief summary of the 
findings of these studies. On account of limited space, it will not be 
possible to include detailed criticisms of the methods employed by 
the investigators. 
_ The organization of the articles is similar to the organization of 
the monograph entitled, Summary of Investigations Relating to Read- 
ing. With very few exceptions, each center heading in the articles is 
a part or all of a chapter heading in the monograph. This plan has 
been adopted in order that the results of recent studies may be readi- 
ly compared with the findings of earlier investigations. The reference 
numbers correspond to those in the bibliography. 
FACTS CONCERNING READING IN MODERN LIFE 
Opportunities to read in rural homes.—Vaughn (65) made a ques- 
tionnaire study in Michigan to determine the opportunities for read- 
ing which 488 rural homes provide. The pupils reported the number 
of books in their home libraries which they had read or would read; 
the average number was 1.8; the largest number, 8. In 162 homes, or 
33 per cent of the total, no such books were reported. The small 
number of books in the homes indicates that the parents do little or 
no book reading. “If the child is to read books, it is apparent that 
he must secure his books from sources outside of the home.” The 
average number of magazines and newspapers read was 4.2; the 
maximum number, 9. “If the number of magazines and newspapers 
found in the homes indicates the nature and the amount of adult 
I2
-P-A-G-E-17
SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 13 
reading, we may assume that this type of reading receives greater 
stimulation from the parents than does book reading.” 
Number of books read independently by rural children—Vaughn 
(65) also determined the number of books read independently during 
a school year by the children in forty rural schools in Grades III- 
VIII, inclusive. The maximum number of books read by any pupil 
was seven; only ten pupils read more than four; 15 per cent of the 
pupils read no books; 28 per cent read no books or only one. The 
average number of books read per grade was as follows: third, 1.3; 
fourth, 2.0; fifth, 2.5; sixth, 2.8; seventh, 2.9; eighth, 3.2. The small 
amount of reading was partly explained in the following terms. “The 
number of books in the home libraries probably indicates that the 
parents do not read books. Consequently, the child receives from his 
parents very little stimulation to read. The large number of books 
in the school libraries and the small amount of reading done by the 
children suggest that the pupils are not stimulated to read by the 
teacher.” 
Amount of magazine and newspaper reading among rural children. 
—Vaughn’s study (65) showed that the largest amount of time spent 
by a rural child in reading magazines and newspapers was twelve 
hours a week. A large percentage of third- and fourth-grade pupils 
did little or no reading of magazines and newspapers. Very few 
pupils in the upper grades reported no such reading. The average 
number of hours a week devoted to such reading per grade was as 
follows: third, 0.5; fourth, 2.0—; fifth, 2.2; sixth, 3.0; seventh, 3.4; 
eighth, 4.2. The relatively large amount of time devoted to reading 
newspapers and magazines as compared with the amount of time 
devoted to reading books was explained in part as follows: “If the 
number of magazines and newspapers found in the homes indicates 
the nature and the amount of adult reading, we may assume that 
this type of reading receives greater stimulation from the parents 
than does book reading.” 
The amount and character of the reading done by gifted children.— 
Terman and others (59) selected one thousand gifted children in 
California and made a study of their reading interests. Information 
of two types was secured: (1) answers made to questions by parents, 
teachers, and the children themselves; (2) records kept by the chil-
-P-A-G-E-18
14 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [March 
dren of the books which they read during a period of two months. 
These data were compared with similar data for a group of unselect- 
ed children. The following summary statements are significant. 
The mean number of hours of reading per week by gifted children (parents’ 
estimates) increases from about six at age seven to twelve at age thirteen. At 
all ages below thirteen the mean is slightly higher for gifted boys than for gifted 
trlsa apa e The average gifted child of seven years read more books in the two 
months than did the average of the control group for any age up to fifteen. The 
average of gifted children at eight or nine years is three times that for the control 
group of the same age. By this time the average gifted child has almost attained 
his maximum as to number of books read... . . Classification of the books read 
by the two groups brought out the fact that the gifted children read over a 
considerably wider range than did the control children, and that they read more 
science, history, biography, travel, folk-tales, informational fiction, poetry, and 
drama. On the other hand, in proportion to the total number of books read the 
gifted read fewer books of adventure or mystery and far less emotional fiction 
[s9: 453-54]. 
The position taken by Terman in presenting the results of this 
study is that ‘general intelligence influences not only the amount of 
reading but also its quality and range.’”’ Investigations are needed 
to determine the extent to which the kind of reading done by these 
gifted children affects intelligence. 
Opportunities for reading in the homes of junior and senior high 
school pupils.—In a study among 2,599 junior and senior high school 
pupils of Franklin County, Ohio, Weiser and Ashbaugh (69) found 
that the number of books in the home libraries of pupils in village 
schools averaged 232; of pupils in centralized schools, 143; and of 
pupils in rural schools, 80. These figures are much higher than those 
reported in other studies. “Approximately 30 per cent of the homes 
furnish the boys and girls with reference books, such as The Book of 
Knowledge and The World Book. Between 25 and 30 per cent report 
some kind of encyclopedia, the Brittanica occurring most frequently” 
(69: 253). Less than r per cent of the pupils reported that there was 
no Bible in thé home. Children and parents read practically the same 
magazines, usually popular magazines. Very few pupils read maga- 
zines of the general informational type. On the other hand, the pupils 
frequently reported that their fathers read magazines pertaining to 
their vocations.

1926) SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS a 15 
Amount of reading done by part-time workers.—Rasche (50) col- 
lected information from 7,065 part-time workers in Milwaukee, rang- 
ing from fourteen to eighteen years of age, in order to determine the 
amount and character of their reading of books, magazines, and 
newspapers between July 1 and December 1, 1924. The total num- 
ber of books read during this period was 26,365; the total number of 
different titles was 9,130. Approximately 75 per cent of the girls re- 
ported that they had read one or more books; about 70 per cent of 
the new boys in the part-time schools and 60 per cent of the old boys 
made similar reports. Slightly smaller percentages of both boys and 
girls reported magazine reading. Approximately 95 per cent of both 
boys and girls reported newspaper reading.. 
In discussing the results of his study, Rasche points out the fact 
that ‘“‘the newspaper has a greater grip on young workers than have 
either magazines or books.” His findings also indicate that young 
workers have a very strong interest in the newspaper even before 
they enter employment. This interest strengthens as they become 
older. At the time employment begins, their interest in the reading 
of books is about the same as their interest in reading magazines. 
As they become older, their interest in books drops to third place. 
The figures for the boys show a loss of interest both in books and in 
magazines. As girls become older, however, their interest in maga- 
zines increases, and they retain their earlier interest in books. 
Character of the reading done by part-time workers.—Rasche’s 
study (50) of the titles of the books read by part-time workers 
showed that there were 24,006 readings in fiction and 2,359 readings 
in other types of literature. Of the 9,130 different books read, 2,817 
were not circulated by the public library. Rasche reports that these 
books were not in the library because they were deemed unsuitable. 
Nevertheless, they were read at least one time for every two times 
that suitable books were read. 
The names of the magazines which were reported were listed in 
the order of their popularity. Rasche points out the fact that the 
popular short-story magazines and the salaciously suggestive maga- 
zines are all too frequently read. An analysis of the contents of the 
newspaper enjoyed most by the young workers revealed the follow- 
ing facts: the comics are enjoyed by more than 85 per cent of the
-P-A-G-E-20
16 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL (March 
boys and girls; the city news is read by from 56 to 74 per cent of the 
workers; advertisements are read by from 31 to 52 per cent; the 
story sections are read by from 42 to 82 per cent; and the world- 
news is read by from 48 to 74 per cent. Unfortunately, less than 20 
per cent of the boys and girls have acquired the habit of reading 
editorials. 
Amount of time devoted by college students to unassigned serious 
reading.—Millis (40) and other members of a committee reported the 
results of a questionnaire study made among undergraduate students 
of the University of Chicago to determine the number of hours a 
week spent in reading serious books and magazines not directly con- 
nected with their university courses. A summary of the replies of 
1,492 students follows: “170, or 11.4 per cent, report no time de- 
voted to serious reading; 161, or 10.8 per cent, report 1 hour a week; 
300, the largest number and 20.1 per cent, report 2 hours a week; 
238, or 16.0 per cent, report 3 hours a week; 188, or 12.6 per cent, 
report 4 hours a week; 167, or 11.2 per cent, report 5 hours a week; 
the remaining 268, or 17.9 per cent, report 6 or more hours a week” 
(40: 20). The tabulations show that a majority of the students re- 
ported three or more hours of serious reading each week. The wide 
variation in the amount read is striking and significant. An analysis 
of the students’ reports and university records shows that there are 
no significant differences in the amount of time devoted to serious 
reading by students in different college classes, by students grouped 
according to class marks, or by students taking two, three, or four 
majors of work. 
Nature of the reading done by adults.—In order to determine what 
adults read, Donovan (16) first made an analysis of the material in 
the issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune for July 21, 1924. ‘‘The topics 
which received by far the greatest amount of space, as shown by the 
number of lines devoted to them, were, in the order of emphasis, 
athletics, markets, crime, and government and politics. Of those 
topics which occupied the front page, crime led all the rest. Reports 
of accidents also received prominent placement. Government and 
politics came third” (16: 371). 
The second step was an analysis of the contents of the Literary 
Digest for July 19, 1924. The topics in the order of their importance,
-P-A-G-E-21
1926] SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS £7) 
as determined by the number of column lines devoted to them, were 
government and politics; nature; personal glimpses; music, art, and 
letters; science; religion; investments and finance; wit and humor; 
poetry; current events; and personal items. The topics found in the 
periodical were more cosmopolitan than were the topics found in the 
newspaper. 
The third step was to determine the types of books withdrawn 
from the Chicago Public Library during 1923. The major types of 
books withdrawn and the percentage of each follow: fiction (adult 
and juvenile), 52.3 per cent; arts and sciences, 22.8 per cent; litera- 
ture and language, 8.8 per cent; history and biography, 5.7 per cent; 
foreign life, 4.8 per cent; travel, 2.8 per cent; theology, 2.8 per cent. 
The preference of the public for fiction was verified by inquiry at 
the Kroch International Book Store and Marshall Field’s book de- 
partment, both of which reported greater sales of fiction than of all 
other types of books. They also reported that there is a “liberal and 
apparently growing demand for biography and travel. The sale of 
children’s books is increasing more rapidly than is the sale of adult 
literature. The character of the books demanded appears to be of a 
higher order than formerly” (16: 374). A supplementary fact of wide 
significance is that the reading interests of people at a given time 
may be determined by a passing event or even by a slight suggestion. 
RELATION OF READING TO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
Relation of achievement in reading to progress in school subjects.— 
Dickinson (15) determined the scores of 149 ninth-grade pupils on 
(a) the “Cross Out” Intelligence Test, Schedule E, from Indiana 
University, () the Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading Scale, and (c) 
the Thorndike Visual Vocabulary Scale A2, X Series. He correlated 
these scores with the class marks made by the pupils in the eighth, 
ninth, and tenth years of their school work. The coefficients of cor- 
relation range from .233 to .743. The writer concluded “that reading 
ability plays an important réle in determining scholastic success.” 
DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN TEACHING READING 
Difficulties in teaching reading and their correctives—In 1921-22 
Streitz (55) secured reports from teachers in Illinois schools concern- 
ing the specific difficulties which they had encountered in teaching
-P-A-G-E-22

reading. She then visited these teachers in order to determine cor- 
rectives for the various specific difficulties listed. While the published 
report has very little scientific value, it indicates what teachers be- 
lieve their difficulties are, and it presents facts and suggestions which 
may aid teachers in correcting the difficulties reported. The diffi- 
culties, as classified in the report, follow. 
MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE TEACHING OF READING 
1. Shall script or print be used in presenting words to a beginning reading 
class? 
2. What kind of material should be memorized, and how much memorizing 
should be done? 
3- Should children be encouraged to seek aid from their parents in learning 
to read? 
4. What are the criteria for selecting supplementary reading material? 
GENERAL DirFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN THE TEACHING OF READING 
1. How to develop an interest in reading. 
2. How to enlarge the fundamental experiences of children from which 
meaning is derived. 
3. How to provide for individual differences. 
4. How to get pupils to “‘see’”’ words. 
. How to enable the pupil to acquire an adequate vocabulary. 
. How to get pupils to understand assignments in reading. 
. How to teach children to use the dictionary. WAN

DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN TEACHING SILENT READING. 
18. How to train pupils to be fluent in the recognition of words and phrases. 
19. How to increase the span of recognition. 
20. How to secure appropriate supplementary material in usable form. 
21. How to deal with selections in school readers which are too difficult or 
otherwise inappropriate for a particular class.

24. How to train pupils to recognize certain difficult words or letters. 
25. How to eliminate lip-movement in silent reading. 
26. How to develop speed in silent reading. 
This list of difficulties is very suggestive. It may be used by 
teachers and supervisors in distinguishing the difficulties which they 
encounter. The statement should be added that it is by no means 
inclusive. 
TIME ALLOTMENTS 
A comparative study of time allotments.—Ayer (3) reported a com- 
parative study of time allotments in reading and other elementary-. 
school subjects for 1888, 1904, 1914, and 1924. His records show that

reading received more time in each of these four years than did any 
other subject. The nearest competitor is arithmetic, which received 
about three-fourths as much time. The total number of minutes a 
week devoted to reading in the first eight grades for each of the four 
years studied was 2,332, 2,250, 2,032, and 2,003, respectively. With 
two exceptions, the variation from grade to grade in the amount of 
time given to reading in each of the four years studied is uniform. 
In 1888 there was a distinct tendency in the middle and upper grades 
to give more time to reading than has been given recently, and in 
1904. a relatively large amount of time was devoted to reading in the 
third, fourth, and fifth grades. 
Time allotted to literature and reading in Grades V-IX, inclusive. 
—Glass (23: 106-19) made a study of the time allotted to literature 
and reading in Grades V—IX, inclusive, in fourteen school systems.

The facts secured revealed wide variation in practice. Table I shows

proximately two-fifths of the total English time was devoted to liter- 
ature and reading. This fact indicates a distinct tendency to stress 
social and cultural values rather than to emphasize exclusively the 
purely formal phases of English. 
LIBRARY FACILITIES IN SCHOOLS ; 
Libraries in forty rural schools of Michigan.—Vaughn (65) made 
a questionnaire study in forty rural schools of Michigan to deter- 
mine the number of library books available. The numbers reported 
were surprisingly large, the average being 242. The maximum num- 
ber was between five and six hundred. The large number of books 
“may be partly accounted for by the state’s assistance to the schools 
in buying books.” Funds for school libraries are provided from the 
money paid to the state for penal fines, which is used exclusively for 
this purpose. In addition, ‘‘the school board and also the electors of 
the school district have authority to vote a tax for library purposes. 
The state superintendent of public instructign provides the rural 
school districts with an approved list of books from which to select.” 
Rural-school libraries in fifty-five counties in Minnesota.—In the 
autumn of 1924 a study (56) was made under the direction of Anna
-P-A-G-E-25
1926] SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 2r 
Swenson to determine the number and types of books in rural-school 
libraries, the percentage of each type, and the kinds of books read 
by the children of each grade. Teachers from fifty-five counties in 
Minnesota co-operated. The total number of books reported was 
740,538. “The median number of volumes in the libraries of forty- 
two counties in Minnesota is 204.’ The books read by ten or more 
pupils in the fourth grade are reported; there are more than fifty- 
five titles in the boys’ list and more than seventy-five titles in the 
girls’ list. Some of the important conclusions follow: “The majority 
of rural children read very few books, and some read none at all. 
.... There is a great dearth of children’s reading in the homes. 
.... Children are reading much material that is extremely easy. 
Fourth-grade boys and girls are reading books which are suitable 
for the first and second grades. .... Rural libraries have very few 
books on history, geography, and travel that appeal to children. 
Some libraries are limited largely to fiction for the older pupils” 
(56: 4). 
Rural-school libraries in one county in Ohio.—Buckingham (8) re- 
ports the results of a study made by Ashbaugh concerning the books 
in the libraries of all the rural schools in one county in Ohio. The 
findings showed a range from 16 to 488 volumes. ‘One-half of these 
schools had less than 125 books, and one-fourth had less than go. 
. . .. Aclassification of the titles shows 40 per cent to be in the field 
of English literature, including fiction, descriptive and narrative 
prose, poetry, and essays; 17 per cent were in science; 15 per cent in 
history and citizenship; 11 per cent were textbooks, including sup- 
plementary readers; 8 per cent, geography; 3 per cent, biography; 2 
per cent, agriculture; and 2 per cent, reference works, not including 
dictionaries. Less than 1 per cént were hygiene books, and less than 
I per cent were dictionaries, Bibles, and books devoted to art and 
music” (8: 229). Reports were also secured from the superintend- 
ents of ten other counties, who sent lists of books from their average 
and poorest libraries. Three reported that one or more schools in 
their respective counties had no library at all. “The other seven 
showed their poorest libraries to have from 28 to r21 volumes. The 
number of books per school in the ten libraries classified by the super- 
intendents as average, varied from 29 to 215. The average number of
-P-A-G-E-26
22 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [March 
volumes in the poorest libraries was 50; in the so-called ‘average’ 
libraries, 131” (8: 229). ‘ 
Library books in rural schools in Illinois and Ohio.—Rethling- 
shafer (51) sent questionnaires to the teachers of the rural schools in 
Adams County, Illinois, and Butler County, Ohio, to determine, 
among other things, the number of books in each school library. Re- 
plies were received from thirty-nine one-room elementary schools, 
four centralized schools, and four high schools in Adams County and 
from twelve centralized schools in Butler County. The total number 
of books in the thirty-nine one-room rural schools of Adams County 
was 2,000. Almost one-fifth of these books were reported as unsuit- 
able for use in any grade. There were no library books in nine of the 
schools. The average number of books per pupil was four. 
Inequality of library service was evident in both counties and in 
the various types of schools studied. For example, in the case of the 
thirty-nine one-room schools there were 262 pupils in twenty schools 
who had access to a total of 281 books, while there were 273 pupils 
in nineteen schools who had access to 1,719 books. In the case of the 
centralized schools, gor elementary pupils in nine schools had access 
to 1,210 books, while 916 elementary pupils in seven schools had 
access to 2,723 books. Among the high schools, 247 pupils enrolled 
in eight high schools in Adams County had access to 2,016 library 
books, and 256 pupils in four high schools in Butler County had access 
to a total of 3,933 books. 
The average number of books for each pupil in the elementary 
and high schools ranged from .88 in the first grade to 11.64 in the 
high school. The one-room schools had more books per child than 
did the centralized schools, but, on account of the small enrolments 
in the one-room schools, the children were not in contact with as 
many books as were the pupils in the union schools. 
State aid to rural-school libraries —Rethlingshafer (51) also made 
an extensive study to determine the means used by the forty-eight 
states to provide libraries in rural schools. She first examined the 
state laws and found that in 1923 thirty-eight states made some legal 
provision for rural-school libraries. The following is a summary of 
her findings.
-P-A-G-E-27
1926) SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 23 
1. The laws of nine states fix a certain amount to be expended annually by 
rural-school authorities for library books. The value of a law which requires an 
annual expenditure depends on whether the amount required is large enough 
adequately to equip the schools in proportion to their enrolment. How much 
should be required cannot be determined by this study. California and Idaho 
have the largest annual expenditure required by law for their rural-school libra- 
ries. Twenty-five dollars for each teacher is the sum to be spent in California, 
and 3 per cent of all the moneys apportioned to the school district must be used 
in Idaho in the purchase of library books. 
2. Twelve states limit the expenditures of their school boards for library 
books. They fix by law a maximum amount which can be expended annually for 
such books. Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska restrict the expenditure for this pur- 
pose to twenty cents or less for each person of school age in the district. In other 
states a more generous expenditure may be made if the school boards desire. 
3. Fifteen states encourage the local districts to purchase books for their 
schools by offering state funds, $10 to $268, which can be used for this purpose 
provided a certain amount is first raised by the local community. This law en- 
courages the school board or the community of a rural district to provide for the 
school library. Such a law, however, is subject to the following limitation: every 
rural community will not be sufficiently interested in the schools to gather 
either by subscription or by taxation the necessary sum which the state demands 
before its money can be used. 
4. In nineteen states books bought for the use of rural-school pupils need 
not remain in one school, in order that their usefulness may be increased. This 
circulation of library books among rural schools may be effected in three ways: 
(a) The school board may provide for the redistribution of the library books 
in the schools under their care. (b) The exchange of library books may be made 
through the organization of a township library. (c) The county may be the 
library unit for the exchange of books among the rural schools [51: 37-39]. 
Rethlingshafer also determined the ways in which state depart- 
ments of education and library commissions render aid to rural- 
school libraries. The replies to a questionnaire revealed a number of 
significant facts. Nine states include library standards in the classifi- 
cation of elementary schools. The duties of inspectors in some states 
include the evaluation of libraries. A library director is an officer of 
some state departments of education. State departments of educa- 
tion secure economy and efficiency by contracting with one or two 
companies to provide books at reduced cost. Lists of books for libra- 
ries are supplied by several state departments.

SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 
(JULY 1, 1924, TO JUNE 30, 1925). III 
RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO ACHIEVEMENT 
TYPES OF CLASS ORGANIZATION 
Relation between intelligence and reading’ achievement.—Two 
investigations confirm a fact revealed by earlier studies, namely, 
that there is a positive correlation between intelligence and reading 
achievement. MacGillivray (37) gave the Chicago Group Intelli- 
gence Test and Reading Tests I and II prepared by Luther Case to 
ninety-one high-school pupils. The correlation between intelligence 
and reading achievement as measured by both Tests I and II 
was .42. 
Dickinson (15) gave the “Cross Out” Intelligence Test, Schedule 
E, from Indiana University, the Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading 
Scale, and the Thorndike Visual Vocabulary Scale Az, X Series, to 
149 ninth-grade pupils. The correlation between the scores made on 
the ‘Cross Out” Intelligence Test and the scores made on the Thorn- 
dike Visual Vocabulary Scale was .631+.031; between the scores on 
the “Cross Out” Intelligence Test and the scores on the Thorndike- 
McCall Silent Reading Scale, .649-+.032; between the scores on the 
Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading Scale and the scores on the Thorn- 
dike Visual Vocabulary Scale, .763+.026. 
Reading achievement as related to chronological age and to mental - 
age.—Brooks (7) gave silent-reading tests to 44 fourth-grade pupils, 
42 fifth-grade pupils, 55 sixth-grade pupils, and 108 seventh-grade 
pupils. Through the use of the Pearson product-moment formula, 
he found that the correlation between reading achievement and 
chronological age was negative more frequently than it was positive. 
This finding differs somewhat from the findings reported in the 
monograph, Swmmary of Investigations Relating to Reading. “Positive 
correlation was found between reading achievement and mental age. 
The coefficients varied from .462 in the case of rate of reading, as

measured by the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test, to .774 
in the case of comprehension, as measured by the Courtis Silent 
Reading Test No. 2. 
Partial coefficients of correlation were also determined. When 
mental age was held constant, it was found that the relation between 
reading achievement and chronological age varied from —.152 to 
.184, the partial coefficients averaging —.o13. When chronological 
age was held constant, the relation between reading achievement and 
mental age varied from .391 to .773, the average of the partial co- 
efficients being .595. Other factors which Brooks believes should be 
measured, or estimated and adequately allowed for, or held constant 
are “(r) interest and effort of pupils, (2) methods of teaching, (3) 
quality of instruction, (4) time devoted to reading, (5) amount of 
material read, etc.” 
Relation between mental age and achievement in school subjects.— 
Van Wagenen (64) compared the school achievement of ror sixth- 
grade pupils with mental ages of eleven years and three months or 
less with the school achievement of 93 pupils of the same grade with 
mental ages of fourteen years and three months or more. The Ter- 
man Group Intelligence Test was used in determining the mental 
ages, and the following tests were used in measuring school achieve- 
ment: an unpublished spelling scale, the Thorndike-McCall Silent 
Reading Scale, the Van Wagenen American history scale, the Posey- 
Van Wagenen Geography Scale, and modified forms of the Woody 
Arithmetic Scale and the Buckingham Scale for Problems in Arith- 
metic. 
The study indicated that the work of the brighter pupils was just 
as good as the work of the duller pupils or even better. In the 
thought phases of geography, however, the quality of the work of the 
brighter pupils was in no instance as good as that of the pupils of 
the lower mental-age group. Van Wagenen believes that other fac- 
tors might account for the poorer quality of the work of the brighter 
pupils in this case. Among the possible factors are the brighter pu- 
pils’ “mental retardation in the grades” and either “instructional 
neglect of the brighter pupils in mixed classes” or “an enriched 
curriculum of simple materials instead of materials sufficiently 
difficult and interesting to challenge their best efforts” (64: 192).

Variability in the reading achievement of pupils of the same mental- 
age level.—In 1923 Torgerson and Shuman gave the Thorndike-Mc- 
Call Silent Reading Scale, Form 1, to 216 pupils of the mental age of 
twelve. The intelligence quotients of the pupils ranged from 72 to 
136. When the pupils were grouped on the basis of their intelligence 
quotients, it was found that the average reading-accomplishment 
quotients of some of the groups having low I.Q.’s were higher than 
those of groups having high I.Q.’s. One explanation offered for this 
inverse relation was inequality of educational opportunities. For ex- 
ample, ‘‘a pupil in the fourth grade with sixth-grade ability whose 
only opportunity is the study of fourth-grade subject matter cannot 
hope to raise his educational age to a sixth-grade level unless he is 
brought in contact with sixth-grade material’’ (61: 134). 
In order to test the validity of this explanation, the authors con- 
sidered the accomplishment quotients of only the pupils with mental 
ages of twelve who were in Grades V A-VIIB, inclusive. This re- 
duced the number of cases to 123. When these pupils were divided 
into groups on the basis of their intelligence quotients, it was found 
that “among pupils of the same mental age, those having the highest 
I.Q. read better than those of a lower I.Q.” (61: 134). The problem 
was studied still further by giving the Stanford Achievement Test 
to 112 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades whose mental ages were 
between eleven years and eleven years and eleven months. When 
these pupils were grouped on the basis of their intelligence quotients, 
the middle group surpassed the lowest group by 2.4 points in average 
accomplishment quotient. On the other hand, the highest group was 
3-3 points below the middle group. The authors were unable to ac- 
count for the deficiency of the superior group but suggested three 
possible explanations: ‘“(1) more remedial work and resulting pres- 
sure with the slow group; (2) greater absence of stimuli for the supe- 
rior pupils to do their best”; and (3) the smaller number of cases 
(19) in the superior group as compared with the number (45) in the 
lowest group (61: 136). 
The general conclusion of the study, as stated by the authors, is 
that, while the data are not conclusive, “they present considerable 
evidence to support the contention that the accomplishment of pu- 
pils of the same mental age who are given the same opportunity for
-P-A-G-E-31
1926] SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS a7, 
learning will, in general, vary in direct ratio with the intelligence 
quotient. The data show further that pupils with high intelligence 
quotients have low accomplishment quotients, if they are required 
to work in grades below their mental level. This suggests the im- 
portance of proper grading and classification” (61: 136). 
Result of using similar methods of teaching pupils of different levels 
of intelligence—Averill and Mueller (2) carried on an experiment to 
determine the relation between size of class and reading efficiency. 
Two sections, one of twenty-six pupils and the other of twelve pu- 
pils, were organized. “The general procedure was to place two pupils 
of approximately equal intelligence scores in the larger group for 
every one with the same score in the smaller group.” The two groups 
were instructed by one teacher, who used the same methods in both 
sections. Forms of the Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading Scale were 
used in September and in the following January to determine the 
progress of each section. The results showed that a large percentage 
of the pupils in the smaller section made substantial gains. The 
study is not conclusive, however, because the same methods were 
used in teaching both classes. It is possible that different methods 
should be used in teaching classes which vary greatly in size. 
An analysis of the progress of the individual pupils in each sec- 
tion revealed very significant facts concerning the value of using the 
same methods of teaching pupils who differ in capacity. The findings 
of the authors are as follows: 
It is a significant revelation of the study that in both classes the majority 
of those pupils who failed to achieve their A.Q. prediction had I.Q.’s ranging 
from 92 to rro and could be classified, therefore, as of average intelligence. In 
the larger class, of those thus failing, 76.9 per cent had I.Q.’s of 98 or higher, 
while only 23.1 per cent had I.Q.’s below 98. In the smaller class, 60 per cent of 
those failing to achieve their A.Q. prediction had I.Q.’s of 2 or higher, while 40 
per cent had I.Q.’s below 86. Equally significant is the fact that the majority 
of those in the larger class who exceeded their A.Q. prediction had I.Q.’s below 
90 (54-89), while 28.6 per cent of those corresponding in the smaller class had 
1.Q.’s below 90 (66-82). In other words, in both classes, notably in the larger 
class, failure to meet A.Q. prediction was found to be associated with high 1.Q. 
[2: 690] 
The explanation suggested by the authors is that “the teacher 
devoted disproportionate energy and attention to urging the duller,
-P-A-G-E-32
28 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [April 
slower pupils forward, while those naturally brighter and keener 
were permitted to progress not only at a much slower rate than they 
were capable of maintaining but at a rate relatively much slower 
than that maintained by the more meagerly endowed children. This 
is in accord with the practice of most teachers of permitting the most 
capable pupils to lag while those who are least capable are urged 
forward at somewhere near their maximum rate” (2: 690). 
Value of independent silent reading versus value of formal intensive 
instruction. —In 1921 Zirbes (73: 4) divided a second-grade class into 
two sections of approximately equal size. ‘The pupils of the one 
section were matched or paired with those of the other section in 
chronological age, Binet mental age, and reading ability as repre- 
sented by a composite score on several informal reading tests, the 
Gray Oral Reading Test, and the Courtis Silent Reading Test.”’ Dur- 
ing a period of six weeks one group received “‘carefully planned for- 
mal and intensive instruction” in reading. ‘Extensive, silent, and in- 
formal reading experience’ was provided for the other section. The 
pupils of the latter section were given the opportunity to choose 
the materials which they read. The teacher also supervised their 
reading each day, giving to each child such help or encouragement 
as was needed. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the 
relative merits of the two types of reading activities “when the time 
and other factors were as nearly constant as possible and when each 
was at its best.” Records were kept of the daily progress of the pu- 
pils. At the end of two months both groups were retested. An analy- 
sis of the descriptive records and a comparison of the test scores re- 
vealed the following facts. 
The average growth in reading ability was almost identical in both groups, 
but the upper part of the group which had extensive individual silent-reading 
experiences showed more improvement or growth than the upper part of the 
group which had formal instruction. The lower ranges of ability in the informal 
extensive group evidenced less growth than that registered by the pupils in the 
lower end of the formal-instruction group. There was indeed a sharp division 
which seemed to indicate that extensive silent reading of new material is neither 
very interesting nor profitable to pupils who read less than sixty words per 
minute orally and who make two or more serious errors per minute or meet 
with as many difficulties in which they require help. 
Conversely, the pupils who read more than sixty words per minute orally 
with infrequent errors and comparative independence seemed to be retarded by
-P-A-G-E-33
1926) SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 29 
instruction and gained more from extensive reading experiences. While inten- 
sive reading experiences, i.e., review or re-reading, were especially valuable in 
the case of children of slow rate and low ability, they were neither as valuable 
nor as interesting to children who had passed a certain minimal ability. When 
children with inadequate ability were merely provided with opportunities to do 
silent reading without appropriate instruction and supervision, they frequently 
acquired bad reading habits and attitudes. In cases of marked reading disability 
pupils resorted to protective camouflage or evasion, or to counterfeit activities 
like memorizing, inventing tales from the pictures in a book, or daydreaming 
while gazing into an open book [73: 5]. 
Relative merits of enrichment of course and rapid advancement in 
the case of bright pupils —Saunders (52) selected the 60 brightest 
pupils of 320 pupils in five neighboring schools at the time of their 
promotion in September, 1920, to the sixth grade of the Binford 
School, Richmond, Virginia. The general mental ability of these six- 
ty pupils was determined through the use of the Chicago Group In- 
telligence Test. The pupils were also tested in October, 1920, and 
in January and May, 1921, with the Trabue Language Completion 
Test, the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test, the Thorndike 
Visual Vocabulary Scale, and comparable forms of standardized tests 
in reasoning in arithmetic and in information in United States his- 
tory and in geography. Other tests and scales were used once or 
twice during the year. 
The pupils were divided into two equal groups on the basis of 
their intelligence scores. “The first group, designated as Group A3, 
was permitted to make as rapid progress as possible in following 
exactly the required course of study. The members of this group did 
the work of three semesters, and twenty of the twenty-two pupils 
remaining in the class in June, 1921, were promoted to the upper 
seventh grade..... The second group, designated as Group A4, 
was not allowed to exceed the limits of the prescribed course of study 
but was given an enriched course in English, arithmetic, history, and 
geography.” 
When the two groups were compared in January and in May, 
1g21, on the basis of the scores made on the Monroe Standardized 
Silent Reading Test, it was found that the enrichment group had 
gained 17 points in rate and 5.5 points in comprehension while the 
rapid-advancement group had remained stationary in rate and had
-P-A-G-E-34
30 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [April 
gained only 1.5 points in comprehension. “While the gain was great- 
er in the enrichment group, the rapid progress group stood higher 
at the beginning and at the end of the semester.” 
Saunders presented the following tentative conclusions for the 
study as a whole. 
Both enrichment of the course and the opportunity to progress more rapidly 
than the normal rate are needed. Each of these special groups gained and each 
lost by the method of treatment. The rapid-advancement group gained a half- 
year in time and in the amount of information assimilated but failed to make 
as great a gain in the power to reason as did the other group. The enrichment 
group made greater gains in the power to reason and in language ability but 
made no gain in time. It seems clearly indicated, therefore, that both the meth- 
ods of treatment used are highly desirable for bright pupils [52: 23]. 
THE MERITS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF TEACHING 
BEGINNING READING 
Relative merits of three methods of teaching beginning reading. — 
Winch (70) reported in detail the results of observations and experi- 
ments made in England between 1905 and 1924 to determine the 
relative merits of different methods of teaching beginning reading. 
In order to secure groups of pupils who were equal in their ability 
to learn to read, Winch organized a series of teaching and testing 
exercises. “The object was to discover whether children of this age 
and ability [between five years and five years and six months] could 
perceive, discriminate, and associate shapes and sounds which were 
new to them and remember them over a period of time.” Through 
the use of these exercises, Winch selected “equal, parallel, and highly 
correlated groups” for each of his experiments. An apparent weak- 
ness of this method of selecting groups is that only a limited number 
of prerequisites to rapid progress in learning to read are considered. 
The first experiment compared the progress of two groups of pu- 
pils (nineteen pupils in each group) who received instruction from 
September 8 to October 21, the one group by a highly phonetic meth- 
od and the other by a look-and-say method. The instruction given 
to each group was exceedingly formal. At the end of the experiment 
four informal tests were given to each pupil. Some of the sentences 
were familiar to the pupils; other sentences were new. Ballard’s 
One-Minute Reading Test was also given. So far as accuracy was
-P-A-G-E-35
1926] SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 3r 
concerned, the results of the tests were distinctly favorable to the 
phonetic group. The look-and-say group, however, read more rapid- 
ly in the informal reading tests than did the phonetic group. It 
should be remembered that no tests of comprehension were given 
and that no study was made of the effect of the particular methods 
on the pupils’ attitude toward reading. 
When the progress of a group taught by a phonetic method was 
compared with the progress of a group taught by an alphabetic meth- 
od, the results were favorable to the former. Similarly, a group 
taught by the Hayes phonoscript method made more rapid progress 
than a group taught “with an ordinary phonetic system.” Since 
phonoscript “involves modifying marks in or on ordinary literal sym- 
bols,” it did not prove as helpful in learning to spell as did the pho- 
netic system, which did not use such marks. The study showed also 
that the children who were taught by the phonoscript method en- 
countered serious loss when required to read from ordinary print. 
This loss was checked by an experiment with another class and found 
to be appreciable. Even after eighteen months, it was still “‘statisti- 
cally significant, though much reduced.” Final tests were given to 
two groups two years after the pupils had been taught to read, the 
one by the phonoscript method and the other by a regular phonetic 
method. Three tests were used, including passages from Alice’s Ad- 
ventures in W onderland, passages from a phonoscript reader, and pas- 
sages from a phonetic reader. The results were favorable to the 
phonoscript group. It should be remembered, however, that the ac- 
complishment of the pupils was determined entirely on the basis of 
the accuracy of their pronunciation. 
Winch interpreted the results of his experiments as completely 
justifying the use of a phonetic method involving phonoscript. Inas- 
much as his tests of accomplishment were limited almost entirely 
to accuracy of pronunciation, his conclusions cannot be accepted as 
final. Studies made in this country show conclusively that different 
methods of teaching beginning reading develop various attitudes and 
habits on the part of pupils. Before the merits of any system.can be 
definitely determined, progress in all the essential reading attitudes 
and habits must be measured.

READING AND VOCABULARY STUDIES IN ARITHMETIC 
Vocabulary frequencies in arithmetic.—In order to study the vo- 
cabulary difficulties of arithmetic textbooks, Turner (62) made a 
record of the frequency of each word used in a series of arithmetic 
texts for Grades III-VI, inclusive. He found a total of 1,286 words 
used in the texts and a range in frequency from 1 to 124 in the third- 
grade textbook and from 1 to 296 in the sixth-grade textbook. Of the 
1,286 words included in the books examined, 658 occurred five times 
or less. Turner then determined the number of words occurring in 
the textbook for each grade not found in the textbook for the imme- 
diately preceding grade, the number not found in the textbook for 
the immediately succeeding grade, and the number not found in the 
textbook for any other grade. The number of words occurring in the 
textbook for a given grade not found in the textbook for any other 
grade ranged from 26 words in the case of Grade IV to 290 words 
in the case of Grade VI. Some of the important conclusions follow: 
“When a new word appeared, it was usually repeated many times 
within two or three pages and then probably never used again. 
. ... Many words were dropped and not used in the next higher 
grade, vs. . Many new words were added with each new book. 
. .. . Many words were found to have a special meaning for arith- 
metic” (62: 294). 
Nature of vocabulary difficulties in arithmetic—Monmouth and 
others (41) took three steps in studying the difficulties presented by 
technical words and phrases in arithmetic problems. They first se- 
cured from twenty-five teachers a total of 1,250 words which, in 
their opinion, caused difficulty. Of these words, 390 had frequencies 
ranging from one to twenty-one. ‘A selected list of these words was 
given to more than eight hundred children, who were asked to give 
their meanings when used in arithmetic problems. The results 
“proved conclusively that a large percentage of the pupils did not 
understand many of the terms used in problems.” The results of this 
type of test should be checked with the results of a similar test which 
presents the words in context. As a second step in the study, a list 
of fifty words “commonly used in arithmetic problems” was checked 
with the Thorndike word list. The results showed that a majority 
fell in “the first five ‘One Thousand’ group, while eleven words were   
     
-P-A-G-E-37
1926] SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 33 
so unusual as not to be included within the Teacher’s Word Book.” 
The third step in the study consisted in having pupils read several 
problems and mark the words which they did not understand. These 
words were explained, and the pupils were requested to restate the 
problems in their own words. “This exercise revealed many words 
and phrases which were a constant source of difficulty to the pupils.” 
The study also supplied evidence of the help derived by the pupils 
when the teacher gives specific attention to vocabulary difficulties. 
Relation of reading to problem-solving.—In a discussion of difficul- 
ties in problem-solving Stevenson (54) pointed out that the correla- 
tion between reading ability and problem-solving was .32 and that 
the correlation between scores on a reading test in arithmetic and 
scores on the Buckingham Scale for Problems in Arithmetic was .78. 
He concluded that “‘the ability to read problems is not greatly dif- 
ferent from the general reading ability” and that ability to compre- 
hend is essential in the solution of problems. 
Vocabulary difficulties in problem-solving—Stevenson (54) also 
cited examples of wrong meanings attached to words used frequently 
in arithmetic. For example, numerous wrong definitions given by 
pupils for such words as “average,” “area,” and “commission” were 
listed. Stevenson questioned the ability of pupils to comprehend 
verbal problems and to solve them correctly without definite knowl- 
edge of the correct meanings of the words included. 
Effect of training in reading on achievement in arithmetic.—Evi- 
dence of the effect of general training in reading on achievement in 
arithmetic tests was secured by Lessenger (33). In September, 1923, 
Form A of the Stanford Achievement Test was given to 111 pupils 
in Radcliffe, Iowa, in Grades III-VIII, inclusive. During the year 
“emphasis was placed upon instruction in reading, but no variation 
from the typical programs for arithmetic or any other school subject 
was permitted.” At the end of the year the tests were repeated. 
“The gains in arithmetic due to the training in reading are large 
enough to be statistically significant, and the conclusion that specific 
training in the reading of the instructions for the solution of examples 
would eliminate almost completely errors of the type under discus- 
sion seems to be incontrovertible.” When the records of sixty-seven 
pupils who were poor readers in September were examined, the im-
-P-A-G-E-38
34 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL 
provement in arithmetic was found to be even more marked than was 
the improvement in the case of the group as a whole. 
Value of selecting and recognizing the processes involved in arith- 
metic problems.—Greene (26) compared the progress of two groups 
of pupils in ability to solve reasoning problems in arithmetic as meas- 
ured by the Monroe Standardized Reasoning Test in Arithmetic. 
Each group received special training for one hundred minutes dis- 
tributed ‘over not more than two weeks.” Sixty-two pupils were 
trained to read the assigned problems for the purpose of “selecting 
and recognizing the process involved in the solution” of each. Thirty 
pupils were trained to “select the correct principle to use in solving 
the problem.” Although the experiment was open to a number of 
possible criticisms, the result indicated clearly that the former meth- 
od was superior.

SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 
(JULY 1, 1924,.TO JUNE 30, 1925). IV 
INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION 
Factors affecting comprehension.—Six studies were reported that 
consider the relation of five specific factors to comprehension, name- 
ly, size of school, a summer’s vacation, vocabulary, form in which 
informational material is presented, and rhetorical quality. 
1, Size of school.—Coxe and Orleans (11) determined the reading 
achievement of thirteen thousand children in New York State 
through the use of the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Tests 
and found that, with the exception of the eighth grade, “the graded 
village schools obtained higher average scores than did the two- and 
three-teacher schools and that these in turn obtained higher scores 
than did the one-teacher schools.’’? When comparisons were made of 
the 1923 and 1924 records of thirty classes, it was found that the 
one-teacher schools had made the largest average gain; the schools 
with four or more teachers had made the second largest average gain; 
and the two- and three-teacher schools, the smallest average gain. 
The unusually large gain made by the one-teacher schools may be 
accounted for, in part at least, by the fact that they averaged lowest 
in 1923 and consequently had the largest opportunity for notable 
gain. 
2. A summer’s vacation.—Morrison (44) gave the Haggerty 
Reading Examination, Sigma I, Tests 1 and 2, to eighty-one pupils 
in Grades I-III, inclusive, on June r5, repeating the tests on Septem- 
ber 16. He also gave the Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading Scale, 
Form 2, to 119 pupils in Grades IV-VIII, inclusive, on the same 
dates. The records for each of the first three grades showed a gain 
amounting to one-third of the normal progress for a year. With re- 
35
-P-A-G-E-40
36 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [May 
gard to Grades IV—VIII, inclusive, “there was no significant change 
in the ability to comprehend the meaning of the printed page, as 
measured by the Thorndike-McCall Silent Reading Scale.” 
3. Vocabulary.—Beall (4) determined the frequency of the words 
in three primary reading tests, namely, the Haggerty Reading Ex- 
amination, Sigma I, Test 1, and the Stanford Achievement Test, 
Primary Examination, Form A, Tests I and II. Vocabulary tests of 
the multiple-response type were then constructed from the words in 
each reading test after the elimination of those which appeared 
among the first thousand words of Thorndike’s word list. The read- 
ing tests and the vocabulary tests were given to 103 third-grade 
pupils, and the correlations between the respective scores were de- 
termined. The correlations between the scores on the Haggerty test, 
the Stanford Test I, and the Stanford Test II, and the scores on the 
corresponding vocabulary tests were .488, .545, and .477, respective- 
ly. These results indicate ‘that the pupil’s knowledge of the vocabu- 
lary used in these tests is a factor that influences his performance 
upon the standardized tests used in this study.” 
As a part of a larger study, Lester (34) found the correlations 
between the results of the Whipple Vocabulary Test given to four 
groups of pupils and the achievement of these pupils in English, 
Latin, French, geometry, and history as determined by their class 
marks. The correlations were positive in every case, varying from 
.2278 to .6427. The mean correlations by subjects follow: English, 
.5812; Latin, .3014; French, .2278; geometry, .3049; and history, 
.6427. “These high correlations of the results of vocabulary tests 
with ability in English and history are in accordance with a priori 
judgment that the student who can read with ease will get the best 
results in subjects in which the ability counts for most.” 
4. Form in which informational material is presented—McKee 
(39) carried on an investigation among 650 elementary-school pupils 
in Grades IV-VIII, inclusive, to determine the relative comprehen- 
sion of information presented in story form and information present- 
ed in cold-fact form. The story material included two selections from 
Chamberlain’s How We Travel, entitled, ‘“Traveling by Train” and 
“How the Mail Is Delivered.” The factual material consisted of the 
content of these stories but with the story element eliminated. The
-P-A-G-E-41
1926) SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 3 
two types of material contained essentially the same vocabulary and 
were presented to the pupils in mimeographed form. The compre- 
hension tests consisted of series of questions which could be answered 
correctly in only one way. Two groups, each made up of three hun- 
dred pupils, were organized on the basis of results secured through 
the use of the Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale, the two groups be- 
ing of equal average reading age. Group A read the cold-fact form 
of the material pertaining to traveling by train, while Group B read 
the story form of the same material. As the pupils found the answers 
to the questions, they wrote them below the mimeographed mate- 
rial. The test was repeated two days later without having the read- 
ing material at hand. The groups were then reversed, and the same 
procedure was followed with the second selection. The results 
showed decided superiority in favor of the group that read the mate- 
rial in factual form. When comparison was made of the accomplish- 
ments of sections that differed in range of reading age, there was 
usually, although not always, superiority on the part of the group 
that read the material in factual form. 
5. Rhetorical quality of selections —Fishback (19) selected for ex- 
perimental use a passage entitled, “Silkworms and Silk,” which 
seemed in his judgment and in the judgment of forty undergraduate 
and graduate students to fulfil all the requirements of well-written 
English. This selection was then modified as follows: synonyms were 
substituted for fifty-two words used in the passage; the selection was 
somewhat disorganized by changing the position of two paragraphs; 
and short sentences were combined into longer sentences. More than 
two hundred fourth- and fifth-grade pupils were asked to read the 
passage, one half of them reading it in the original form and the other 
half reading it in the modified form. Comprehension of the passages 
read was determined by means of a series of fifty-four true-false 
statements. The general reading abilities of the two groups of pupils 
represented were determined through the use of the Monroe Stand- 
ardized Silent Reading Test and found to be approximately equal. 
A comparison of the scores made on the tests showed higher scores 
in the case of the pupils reading the well-written passage. 
Effect of specific methods and training techniques on ability to inter-
-P-A-G-E-42
38 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [May 
pret what is read.—During the year 1924-25 at least four studies were 
reported concerning methods of improving comprehension. 
1. Use of standardized and informal tests—Dransfield (17) em- 
ployed a “technique of teaching through standard and informal test- 
ing.” In the course of eight months nine different forms of the 
Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale and thirty-two informal reading 
tests were used. ‘Initial and final tests were given to ten experimen- 
tal and ten control classes,’ and the progress of each group was de- 
termined. “The experimental classes made much greater progress 
than did the control classes.”” They also made much greater progress 
than they had made in previous years. “This progress greatly ex- 
ceeded the typical progress made in typical schools” and “exceeded 
even more the progress made by pupils of like mental capacity in 
other schools. .... Further, more than usual progress was made in 
such other subjects as we were able to measure with standard tests” 
(27: 744). 
Kimmel (30) gave practice reading tests to a group of high-school 
Freshmen during the opening week of a semester. The results indi- 
cated ‘‘a relatively high rate of reading with a relatively low index 
of assimilation when compared with available data for other classes.” 
As a result of a study of the scores made on the practice tests and as 
a result of supervision of the study habits of the pupils, it was decid- 
ed to emphasize the assimilation of content material rather than to 
increase the speed of reading. Accordingly, the pupils were asked at 
frequent intervals to prepare reproductions of certain passages that 
had been read. “Later the papers were exchanged, and the pupils 
checked one another’s papers as the instructor read the ideas which 
should have been reproduced. These written exercises tended to cen- 
ter the pupils’ attention more directly on their reading efficiency. 
The fact that they were permitted to check one another’s papers ap- 
pealed to members of the class and thus helped to create an interest 
in overcoming individual weaknesses” (30: 48). 
During the course of the semester five forms of the Thorndike- 
McCall Reading Scale were used in checking progress in comprehen- 
sion. The significant fact revealed was a steady increase in the scores 
on the successive forms of the test given. “The average T-score on 
the last form shows an increase of 18.8 points over the average T-
-P-A-G-E-43
1926} SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 39 
score on the first form.”’ The results of both the informal tests and 
the Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale showed consistent improve- 
ment throughout the course in the ability of the pupils to grasp the 
meaning of what they read. 
2. Training in organization, retention, and vocabulary-building.— 
Alderman (1) carried on an experiment among 1,933 pupils in 
Grades IV-VIII, inclusive, to determine the improvement made in 
comprehension as a result of training given for thirty minutes each 
day throughout a semester. Training in organization was given two 
days each week by requiring the pupils to select the important idea 
from each paragraph and to organize the ideas selected around the 
central topic or problem. Training in retention was given two days 
each week by having the pupils “read the selection carefully for the 
purpose of picking out the essential facts.” The pupils were then 
tested by means of a series of questions, the answers to which were 
written. One test was also given each week on the important facts 
read during the week. A wide range of reading matter was used. 
“Great care was taken to master the meaning of all new words which 
the child would have occasion to use in his actual work with books 
of a content nature.” 
The value of the three types of training provided was checked, 
without the use of control groups, against normal progress as indi- 
cated by the norms for the Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale. The 
tests were given in September and February. A comparison of the 
records showed that, “of the 1,933 pupils who took part in the experi- 
ment in reading, 1,409 gained; 122 were no better readers than at 
the beginning of the semester; and 402 actually lost in reading abili- 
ty.” A detailed study of the pupils who lost in reading ability showed 
that the pupils who gained least “were in the upper quarter in read- 
ing ability when the Thorndike-McCall tests were given in Septem- 
ber.” The general conclusion which these facts justify is that sys- 
tematic training in reading of the types used in this experiment, if 
not continued too long, is valuable in the case of the majority of the 
pupils in Grades IV-VIII, inclusive. They suggest, on the other 
hand, that these types of training may be inappropriate or even un- 
desirable for pupils who rank high in reading ability at the beginning 
of a period of training.

3. A variety of methods used in a state-wide campaign.—In Octo- 
ber, 1923, and in May, 1924, the Stanford Achievement Tests were 
given to approximately sixty-five thousand elementary-school pupils 
in Maryland under the direction of the State Department of Educa- 
tion. The scores made by the pupils were very unsatisfactory, as re- 
ported by Simpson and Stern (53). “Less than one-third of the pu- 
pils in the one-teacher schools made scores equal to, or higher than, 
the standard, and only slightly more than one-third of the pupils in 
the two-teacher schools made scores as high as the standard for their 
grade. In the larger schools, Grade IV was the only grade above 
standard. The lowest grades (Grades II and III) had smaller propor- 
tions of pupils above standard than had the other grades in these 
schools” (53: 595). 
The authors report the constructive steps taken in various coun- 
ties and the results achieved during the year. Brief statements refer- 
ring to some of the methods that were adopted follow: (a) A meeting 
of the first-grade teachers in Baltimore County was held early in 
November to study the results of the October tests and to determine 
the causes of poor results. (6) Teachers of all grades throughout the 
state made similar studies to determine how the pupils of the respec- 
tive grades could overcome their difficulties and attain the May 
standards. (c) Lists of difficulties were published and studied in Caro- 
line County. (d) The silent-reading bulletin published by the State 
Department of Education was sent to the teachers of Caroline Coun- 
ty two weeks before a November meeting, for the purpose of securing 
helpful suggestions for use in the discussion at the meeting and for 
use in improving instruction. (e) Teachers in various sections of the 
state agreed upon reading abilities that should be cultivated and 
definite goals that should be accomplished in each grade. (f) Objec- 
tive standards for judging improvement in instruction were supplied 
to the teachers in February by the State Department of Education. 
(g) Demonstration lessons were organized, each of which was fol- 
lowed by a conference. (%) Practical helps were provided by the 
supervisors throughout the year. 
As indicated earlier, tests were given again in May. The results 
showed that ‘‘more than 50 per cent of the pupils in Grades II, IIT, 
IV, and V in the graded schools were above standard and that the 
pupils in Grades VI and VII were not far from the goal. Even the
-P-A-G-E-45

one-teacher and the two-teacher schools, handicapped because of the 
large number of untrained and unskilled teachers, made more than 
normal progress” (53: 595-96). 
Investigations of study procedures in work-type reading.—Two 
studies have been reported which relate more or less specifically to 
study procedures in work-type reading. : 
1. Methods of motivating the study of history.—Gatto (22) carried 
on an experiment among 277 eighth-grade pupils to determine the 
effect of two methods of motivating the reading of history, namely, 
emphasizing the importance of groups and emphasizing the signifi- 
cance of individuals in history. The selection used was an adapted 
passage from Schevill’s Political History of Modern Europe. Compre- 
hension was measured by means of a series of factual questions based 
on the passage read. These questions were given as a pretest to de- 
termine the pupils’ familiarity with the facts contained in the selec- 
tion. Furthermore, the average reading ability of the two groups 
that participated in the experiment was determined through the use 
of the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test. In the interpreta- 
tion of the scores made when the factual questions were presented 
after instruction, allowances were made for the differences revealed 
by the pretest and the reading test. 
A comparison of the comprehension of the two groups showed 
that those who read after the importance of groups in historical de- 
velopment had been discussed did better on the average than did 
those who read after the importance of individuals in history had 
been emphasized. The author warned against final conclusions on 
account of the presence of factors that were not controlled. 
2. Progress of pupils in mastering assigned material in general 
science.—Beauchamp (5) made a study to determine the extent to 
which the progress made by pupils in elementary physical science is 
constant. The material of the course consisted of a series of teaching 
units. Each unit was ‘divided into problems, each problem devel- 
oping some major division of the unit.” 
In order to check the progress of the pupils, a series of perform- 
ance tests was organized which included the following types of ac- 
tivity: ‘“‘(z) finding answers to thought questions based on some 
principle presented in the problem, (2) finding answers to review
-P-A-G-E-46
42 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [May 
questions based on critical points in the problem, (3) making prob- 
lem summaries, (4) making sentence outlines, (5) reconstructing 
drawings, showing different views or reversing the order of opera- 
tion, (6) making drawings from descriptions in text, (7) framing 
questions the answers to which constituted a summary of the main 
points of the problem, and (8) organizing the entire unit” (5: 15-16). 
The experiment was carried on in two freshman classes of the 
University High School, University of Chicago, each of which in- 
cluded twenty-two pupils. On account of absences, final conclusions 
were based on the work of twenty pupils in one class and nineteen in 
the other. “Each pupil was provided with a mimeographed text and 
a list of tests for each unit. In one section, . . . . called Section A, 
the pupils were not allowed to take their texts from the room, while 
the pupils in Section B were not thus restricted.” Similar instruc- 
tions were given to the pupils of both classes concerning the pro- 
cedure which they were to follow in doing their ‘work. As the test 
papers were handed in, three records were kept: ‘“(r) the day on 
which each test was completed, (2) the number of attempts necessary 
to obtain a satisfactory paper, and (3) the number and types of 
errors made on each test.’”’ The study continued for a period of fifty 
school days. 
An analysis of the records justified the following conclusions. 
1. There are a great many factors influencing the rate of progress. 
2. The relative progress of the pupils in a class is not constant. 
3. When the work is done entirely in the classroom, as in the case of Section 
A, the amount of shifting is greater than if outside work is done, as in the case 
of Section B. This may be due to the fact that the pupils who fall behind have 
no opportunity to catch up with the others through additional outside work. 
4. The difference between the pupils within a class, in terms of the number 
of tests satisfactorily completed, increases with the length of time. The differ- 
ences are greater in Section B than in Section A, probably on account of the 
extreme competitive spirit in Section B [53: 30-31]. 
EXTENSIVE READING VERSUS INTENSIVE READING 
Values derived from extensive reading in general science.—Curtis 
(13) carried on a series of investigations to determine the value of 
extensive reading in general science. Brightness quotients and the 
Dvorak General Science Scales were used for the purpose of pairing
-P-A-G-E-47
1926) SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 43 
control and experimental groups. The extensive reading was carried 
on under three conditions: (x) as a regular course outside the regu- 
larly scheduled program of studies, (2) as part of the usual required 
work in general science, and (3) as a privilege in addition to the 
regularly required work in general science. 
The results of the experiment were measured in various ways. A 
form of the Dvorak General Science Scales was used to measure 
general achievement, and a special test was used to determine growth 
in scientific attitudes. In addition, three questionnaires were used 
in checking results. The first was employed to ascertain whether the 
extensive reading resulted in an increase of interest in science and 
in the reading of science magazines. The second aimed to secure 
statements from the pupils of the values which they thought they 
had derived from the experiments. The third secured from the par- 
ents statements of the values derived by the pupils from the as- 
signed work. 
The results of the experiments indicate that “extensive reading 
of scientific literature serves to increase individual achievement in 
general science.” It “stimulates the desire of some pupils to proceed 
further with the study of science in the school,” and it ‘‘contributes 
to the scientific attitudes of the individual but not to the extent 
secured by a small amount of class time devoted specifically to the 
teaching of scientific attitudes.” Curtis’ investigation is open to the 
criticism that much of the data is based on questionnaires which re- 
quired personal opinions in the answers. 
SPEED OF SILENT READING 
High fixation-accommodation rates promote speed of reading.— 
Wager (66) determined the fixation-accommodation rates of a group 
of adults and studied the correlation between these rates and the 
rates of reading of the same subjects. The correlation was high, indi- 
cating that, as the fixation-accommodation rate increases, the speed 
of reading increases, all other things being equal. 
Training in speed of silent reading through the use of two definite 
procedures.—Burton (9) directed a study in the schools of Hamilton 
County, Tennessee, during the school year 1923-24 for the purpose 
of improving ability in silent reading in Grades III-VIII, inclusive.
-P-A-G-E-48
44 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [May 
Early in the school year the pupils were given either the Otis Group 
Intelligence Test or the Illinois General Intelligence Test and both 
the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test and the Thorndike- 
McCall Reading Scale. For a period of eight weeks the teachers 
spent thirty minutes daily in carefully directing the reading activities 
of the pupils. The reading materials used were simple selections from 
a wide variety of sources ranging “from the newspaper to the Bible.” 
The schools were assisted in securing an adequate supply of books 
by exchanges among themselves and through the co-operation of the 
Chattanooga Public Library. 
Two types of training were given. The first was training in rapid 
silent reading, which included the following steps: arousing the in- 
terest and the curiosity of the pupils, discussing the difficult words 
before a selection was read, urging the pupils to increase their speed of 
reading and to compete with theirprevious records, counting the num- 
ber of words read in a given interval, and checking comprehension by 
means of questions. The second type of training consisted of quick- 
perception exercises, which were given for ten minutes daily in the 
lower grades and twice a week in the grades above the fourth. The 
results of the study showed that there was marked improvement in 
practically all the grades in each type of school, namely, one-teacher 
schools, two-teacher schools, and schools with three or more teach- 
ers.   
      
CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING 
Interest in required and elective reading.—In a study among 2,599 
junior and senior high school pupils of Franklin County, Ohio, 
Weiser and Ashbaugh (68) found that pupils usually selected as their 
first choices books which they were not required to read. Further- 
more, the books on the required lists were usually read less frequent- 
ly by the pupils as a group than were many books that were not 
required. 
THE NATURE AND CONTENT OF READING MATERIALS 
Vocabularies of pre-primer, primer, and other first-grade materials. 
—Gates (21), assisted by Hemke and Van Alstyne, made a study of 
the number of different words in pre-primer, primer, and other first- 
grade materials of twenty-one systems of beginning reading. The
-P-A-G-E-49
1926] SUMMARY OF READING INVESTIGATIONS 45 
median number was 250, the range being from “99 or less” to goo. 
As the authors pointed out, ‘there are no experimental data indi- 
cating an optimum number.” Possible criteria for use in selecting 
words for first-grade materials follow: ‘kind and number needed to 
tell the stories, . . . . utility for furthering some type of word mas- 
tery, .... utility for establishing familiarity with words most fre- 
quently found in general reading matter, . . . . utility for meeting 
the demands of attractive books (other than primers) for ‘children 
of about seven years, . . . . utility for immediate practical needs as 
in reading signs, posters, labels, etc., . . . . interest of children in the 
ideas, things, or events represented by the words, . . . . ease of learn- 
ing and later recognition” (21: 587-88). 
Reading interests compared with the content of school readers.—In 
order to determine whether the content of school readers harmonizes 
with the interests of children, Grant and White made two extensive 
studies. In the first study (24) they analyzed the content of fifteen 
primary readers. The methods employed were similar to those used 
by Stone in an earlier study, but books were chosen which are more 
generally used in classrooms today. In the second study (25) six 
hundred first-, second-, and third-grade children in various sections 
of the country were asked to answer the following questions: ‘“(1) 
What story, of all you have read and heard, do you like best? What 
story do you like next or second best?” In each study the percentage 
frequency of each type of reading material was determined. The re- 
sults of the two studies were then compared in tabular and graphical 
form (25). The comparisons revealed marked differences between 
children’s interests and the content of readers. These differences are 
explained in part by the authors in terms of the large emphasis on 
literary material during recent years. Whatever the cause, there is 
need of more detailed and accurate studies of the problems involved. 
Calibrating reading material as to difficulty of comprehension. — 
Kyte (32) reported the results of an investigation to determine the 
appropriateness of reading material for third-grade pupils. The ma- 
terials used were fifty-four poems and prose selections which were 
thought to-be desirable for a third reader. The method adopted in 
determining their appropriateness involved three steps: Each of four 
elementary-school principals and the city superintendent of Berke-
-P-A-G-E-50
46 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL 
ley, California, selected a representative paragraph or unit of each 
of the fifty-four selections and prepared a question for it which would 
test a pupil’s comprehension of the meaning of the passage. The pas- 
sages and the questions were given to the third-grade pupils of four 
schools in Berkeley during four different periods. The test papers 
were carefully scored, and the percentages of correct, wrong, and 
omitted answers were determined for each passage. 
An analysis of the results led to the following conclusions: 40 per 
cent of the material originally chosen for the third reader was too 
difficult; some of the selections were probably too easy for children 
in the second grade, and others were probably too difficult for chil- 
dren in the fourth-grade; the “arrangement of selections according 
to supposed difficulty without being tested would be chaotic as com- 
pared with arrangement after the testing of the material.” These 
findings are very significant. They emphasize the need of the scien- 
tific study of reading materials before they are included in readers, 
but the methods employed by Kyte must be refined before thorough- 
ly reliable results can be secured.

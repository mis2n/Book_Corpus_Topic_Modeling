PREFACE 
For « long time the author has felt the need of a 
book to put in the hands of the rural teacher as a 
‘guide in showing the children the real value of agri- 
cultural work in the laboratory. The true teacher 
feels that all the explanation needed should be given 
and no more. Tt should be given in a plain, clear- 
cut way. The teacher can take this book and use 
it even if she has not had any work on agriculture. 
The equipment is simple, so simple that any country 
school can get it. The things that are used are also 
practical. : 
This book aims to tell of the things that the child 
should know in order to become interested in the 
farm life. The school work is made significant by 
having the children actually doing the things them- 
selves. The farmer demands that his boy should 
know how to do things, and there is no better place 
than the laboratory to do many of the things the 
child needs to be taught. It is to provide for the 
doing of these things that this little book is written. 
The author will be glad to correspond with teach- 
ers concerning any difficulties in the work, and will

    vi PREFACE 
be glad to receive suggestions as to ways in which 
it may be improved. 
The equipment is so simple that it is not necessary 
to describe it. A pair of small spring balances, some 
pans, bottles, boxes for soil are needed. The children 
can get almost everything else except the few chem- 
icals that can be gotten at the drug store immediately 
before they are to be used. : 
_ In some cases not all of these exercises can be done 
by ‘one teacher. The purpose of so many is to give a 
choice to select from so that teachers will have a 
chance to use those suited to their needs and con- 
ditions. :

ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN 
AGRICULTURE 
SOIL 
Exercise I? 
Object. To become familiar with the kinds of soil. 
Method. Use a sample of the four typical kinds of 
soil: clay, sand, loam, and peat. These samples may 
be gathered by the class the day before the exercise 
is to be worked out. Place thé soils side by side in 
Plates or glasses where the children may examine 
them. All the lumps should be broken up until the 
q soil will go through a fine sieve. 
Examine each sample of soil as to fineness and color. 
Rub the particles between the thumb and finger. 
Which kind of soil seems to be the finest? Which 
is the coarsest ? 
Wet a handful of each kind of soil. Mix and squeeze 
each kind in the hand. Which then crumbles and 
qfalls apart easily? Which is the most sticky? 
| Provide four tumblers each half full of water. Put. 
a small quantity of one kind of soil in one glass. Put 
Gihe same quantity of another kind in the next glass.        
    
   
   
    
*Each child should have a notebook and write up each experi- 
“| ment as soon as it is finished.

2 ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 
Put a different kind of soil in each glass. Stir the 
water and the soil in each glass and then notice whidl 
settles first. Shake again and after a minute pou 
off the water from one of the glasses. Does the wate 
poured off look like sand or coarse soil? Can yot 
give any reason for this? — 
What happens to the fine particles of earth in the 
glass when the earth is stirred? 
Write a full description of each soil. 
Exercises II 
Object. To determine the amount of moisture it 
the soil. 
- Method. Get a quart of soil from the plowed 
ground just after a heavy rain. Weigh it and record 
the weight. Then heat it on a hot stove until it i 
dry. Weigh it again afterj heating. Compare t 
weight. The difference in the two weights is 
weight of the water that was in the soil. In this wa 
find the amount of water that is contained in t# 
different soils. Compare these amounts. Expl 
then how some soils can do without water longer t 
others. 
In dry weather get a quart of soil from just under t 
sod and weigh it. Then dry it thoroughly and weigh 
it again. Does it have more water in it in dry weathe 
than the barren soil? What effect do you think # 
extra amount of water would have on the crop?     
    
   
       
-P-A-G-E-14
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 3 
Would a coarse soil, such as sand, hold as much 
water during the dry weather as a fine soil? Do you 
think that a coarse soil covered with some fine material 
will raise a better crop? 
Stirring the soil also helps to hold the moisture. 
Exercise IIT 
Object. To find out how much rainfall the soils 
can take in. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Fre. 1. — Apparatus to test the capacity of soils to take in rainfall. 
Method. Break the bottom off 5 long-necked bot- 
es like those in the illustration Tie a piece of thin

muslin over the mouth of each bottle and arrange 
them in a rack with a glass tumbler under each bottle. 
Number the bottles A, B, C, D, and E. 
Fill the bottles with soil: one with sand, one with 
gravel, etc. Fill to the same height after the soil has 
been lightly pressed by jarring the rack two or three 
times. Arrange to keep the apparatus standing sev- 
eral days. 
Now, with watch in hand, pour water on top of the 
soil, just enough to keep it covered. Pour into one 
glass at a time, and note exactly how long it takes the 
water to begin to drop into the tumbler below. Do 
the same with each bottle. Tabulate and compare 
the results. 
Rule the notebook for tabulated record as follows;

Provide two samples, equal quantities, of the sam 
kind of soil. Put these samples in inverted long} 
necked bottles like those shown in this experiment

ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 5 
What effect has packing the soil on the amount of 
water it retains? 
To find out which soil will hold the greatest quantity 
of water measure the water in each glass after it has 
quit dripping. Be sure that the water is not wasted 
until after it has been measured. Tabulate. , 
Which soil drains most readily? Which do you 
think -stores up the greatest amount of moisture? 
row can this knowledge be made use of in farm prac- 
ce? 
During the time that the water is dripping from the 
bottles, which may be several days, the glasses should 
be covered so as to keep the water from evaporating. 
What effect do you think that the water in the soil 
will have on the crop? Does the farmer want a soil 
that will not hold water? Why? 
Exercise [V 
we To determine the effect of lime on clay 
Method. Secure two long slender bottles. Cover 
the bottom of each of the two bottles one half inch 
thick with the finest clay that can conveniently be 
found. Fill the bottles nearly full of water. To one 
ttle add five or six teaspoonfuls of water to which 
been added enough lime to make a milky liquid.

in the light and watch any changes that may tak 
place. Look at the bottles once each hour during 
the first day, then once each day until the bottle 
are clear. Make a simple tabulation of the observa: 
tions. 
In which bottle did the’ water clear first? How 
long did it take the water to clear in each bottle? 
' What was the difference in the time requircd for the 
water to clear? What effect did the lime have on the 
clay soil? Can you tell why? What reasons can 
you give for putting lime on the soil? What kind of 
soil needs lime? . 
Mix a handful of clay with water and stir until it 
becomes like a thick dough. Let it dry. Mix another 
handful in the same way but add a little lime to it. 
Now crumble both samples between the fingers. Ca 
you see any difference? 
Farmers put lime, a mineral that contains but little 
plant food, on their fields to increase the crop yields. 
Can you tell why? . 
Explanation. Clay soils are made up of very fine 
particles which fit so closely together that air apd 
water will not readily pass through them. It is al- 
most impossible for the tiny roots to grow in such 
soils; if the soil is stirred while it is wet, it becomes 
very hard when dry. Lime causes the very fine par 
ticles to stick together in such a way as to form larget 
particles, too heavy to be held up by the water ; by 
making the soil particles larger the soil becomes mor
-P-A-G-E-18
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 7 
open and easier to work. Then there is room for 
air, water, and plant roots to pass between the par- 
tides and through the soil. It takes two or three 
tons of lime to cover an acre. Many so-called ‘‘ worn- 
out” soils need lime in order to be made more produc- 
tive. 
Lime has much to do with changing the plant food 
that is in the soil into a form so plants can use it. If 
fome green crop like clover is grown and turned 
under to supply humus, and lime is then applied ard 
rowed in, worn-out soils will be much improved. 
Exercise V 
Purpose. To find out how plants get their food 
from the soil. 
Method. Lay some pieces of very. dark blotting 
Paper or black cloth on a plate. On the paper or 
Cloth place some pumpkin or radish seeds; moisten 
the paper and cover the seeds with another blotter 
% piece of cloth; keep the cloth or blotters moist.

Whether the roots are beginning to show. When 
the roots have grown an inch or more remove the 
fever and observe the seeds and the roots carefully.

amine the roots again. 
Are there any root hairs 
on the larger roots? Are 
they just like they were 
when you saw them be- 
fore? Are they all over 
the root or on only a part 
of it? What are the uses 
of these root hairs to the 
plant?

hairs. | 
By means of minute bacteria working in these 
nodules, leguminous plants are able to store nitrogen 
in the soil. 
Exercise VI 
Object. To learn the power of the soil to take up 
moisture from the subsoil. 
Method. Arrange four lamp chimneys as_ the 
bottles were arranged in Exercise III. Tie cheese 
cloth over the lower ends. Fill with one variety of 
soil as many chimneys as there are kinds of soils. 
Pour water into the pan below until it stands about oné 
half inch above the‘lower end of the chimneys. Watch 
the water rise in the chimneys. 
In which soil does the water rise most rapidly? In
-P-A-G-E-20
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 9 
which to the greatest height? Which soil do you 
think draws the greatest amount of water from the 
earth? Which soil will dry out the quickest? Which 
would bring moisture from the greatest depth? 
The power of soils to bring the water from the sub- 
soil is called capillarity. In dry weather the plants 
get their water [rom the soil in this way. 
Does a light soil hold more water than a heavy one? 
Ih order to find out which is the lightest soil, measure 
4 quart can full of sand and one full of clay. Which 
is the heavier? The lighter soil is easier to cultivate. 
‘Exercise VIT 
Object. To show the power of water and frost. 
Method. Fill a glass bottle with water. Cork tight. 
Keep it outdoors over night when the temperature is 
below freezing point. What happened to the bottle? 
Look in the crevice of a rock where the water has 
frozen between the rock. What has happened to the 
Tock? Look at the earth on the side of the road after 
thas been frozen. What is happening to it? 
How does the water help to carry the hills away? 
ill earth that freezes and thaws be carried away 
aster than earth that never freezes? 
Exercise VIII 
Object. To show the bad effect of deep plowing 
® Poor, sandy soils. 
Method. Fill two boxes each eight inches deep
-P-A-G-E-21
10 ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 
nearly full with a poor quality of washed sand. Pu 
a half inch of rich soil on the top of each box. Stir th 
soil in one to the depth of an inch. Stir the othe 
well to the depth of seven inches. Plant one variety 
of small seeds in each box. Watch the growth of th 
plants in each box for several weeks. Which grow 
the faster? 
When the plant food is mostly in the upper two a 
three inches of poor, sandy soil, what is the effect d 
plowing to the depth of seven or eight inches? 
Exercise IX 
Object. To show the effect of puddling on the s0 
Method. Fill half full four tin cans, each holdi 
one quart. Fill bne with clay, one with sand, 4 
with loam, and the other with peat. Add water 
stir until the soil becomes as thin as a paste. 
aside for fifteen minutes and stir again. Set in 
sunlight and let them become thoroughly dry. 
still better way of drying soil is to set it on the sto 
over a slow fire for a half day. 
Examine the samples of dry soil. Which 
could be most easily cultivated after drying? ‘Whi 
was baked? Which kind of soil could be’ work 
soonest without danger of puddling after a raid 
Which could be cultivated first in the spring? 
scribe the appearance of some soil that. you have 
worked too soon after a rain. What effect 4

-P-A-G-E-22
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 11 
Exercise X 
Object. To learn the effect of plowing under manures 
on the moisture in the soil. 
Method. Closc the larger ends of three lamp chim- 
neys with muslin and fill each two thirds full of fine 
dry soil. In one chimney pack one inch of finely 
cut straw, in another one inch of well-rotted manure, 
and in the other one inch of hard clay broken into 
Pieces about the size of a pea. Now fill each chimney 
with fine, dry soil, and set them in a pan containing 
ahalf inch of water. . : : 
Keep a supply of water in the pan. Watch the 
water rise in the chimneys. Does the moisture pass 
through to the top of each in the same time? What 
effect does the straw have on the passage of the water? 
What effect does the manure have? The clay? 
The straw and rotted manure represent the material 
that is plowed under and lies in the bottom of the 
furrow. The clods represent the hard-baked surface 
of earth plowed under. The soil on the top repre- 
sents the furrow that is turned under. / 
Compare this exercise with the actual farm prac- 
tice. In which one of these three ways do you think 
that the crop would suffer least in dry weather? 
Should straw or manure be plowed under in the spring 
orin the fall? When should hard-baked clay be turned 
Under? Why?

Exercise XJ 
Object. To show how roots take in moisture. 
Method. (1) For material to be used in this ex 
ercise secure a wide-mouthed bottle, an egg, a elas 
tube four inches long and about a quarter of an ind 
in diameter, a candle, a piece of wire about five inche 
long. : 
Remove a small part of the shell from the lar 
end of the egg without breaking the skin beneath th 
Shell. This may easily be done by gently tapping th 
shell until it is full of small cracks and then picking 
off. the small pieces. Take the shell from the smal 
end of the egg from a place as large as the diameter 0 
~ the glass tube. 
Cut off a half-inch piece from the lower end d 
the candle. Bore'a hole in the piece of candle the 
size of the glass tube. Warm one end of this piece 4 
candle and stick it on to the small end of the egg 9 
that the hole in the candle comes over the hole in the 
shell. . 
Heat’ the wire, and with it solder the piece of candle 
firmly to the egg, making a water-tight joint. Plac? 
the glass tube in the hole in the piece of candle and 
solder it firmly with the hot wire.

-P-A-G-E-24
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 13 
Run the wire down the tube and break the skin of 
the egg under the end of the tube. Fill the bottle 
with water and place the egg on top of the bottle so 
that the water covers the larger end of the egg. 
In an hour or so the white of 
the egg will be seen rising in the 
glass tube, because the water is | 
making its way by osmosis into 
the egg through the skin. So 
far as can be seen even with a 
Microscope there is no opening 
through the skin. 
In this same way water which 
has the plant food in it enters 
the root hairs of the plants. 
_ @) The second way of show- 
ing how roots take in moisture. 
Remove the shell from the 
large end of the ege without 
breaking the skin. Break a hole 
in the small end of the egg and 
‘mpty the shell. Rinse it out     eneniaelseee == 7A8 
Fic. 3. — To show osmosis. 
With water. Fill the bottle with water colored with a 
dozen drops of strong iodine solution. Fill the egg 
shell partly full of clear water and set it on the bottle 
of colored water. The colored water will pass up into 
the shell and color the clear water in the shell. 
_ 8) The third way to show how the root hairs take 
N moisture. Place a carrot in a wide mouth bottle
-P-A-G-E-25
14 ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 
or glass jar as shown in the illustration. Make a hol 
in the carrot with an auger or bit large enough foi 
the stopper to fit in tightly. 
Make a hole through the 
stopper, or use a rubber stop- 
per with a hole in it large 
enough for the hollow glass 
rod to fit in tightly. Place 
the carrot in the jar and fil 
the jar with water. In a few 
hours the water will pas 
through the carrot and foree 
the water to the top of the 
tube. 
Can this exercise be made 
to teach something about the 
feeding habits of plants? (Re

box plant some corn, peas, and nasturtiums; a few 
other seeds may also be planted in each box. Moisten 
the dirt in each sufficiently for the seeds to germinate 
and grow. 
Place one box in the window and the other in a dark 
place. A dark place can be provided in any room by 
covering the box with a larger box. Observe each 
box daily. 
Is there any difference in the time it takes the plants 
to come up? Measure the growth of the plants at 
intervals of 24 or 36 hours.. Is there any difference 
between those growing in the light and those growing 
in the dark? Is there any difference in color? Do 
the plants in the window grow directly upright or 
lean towards the window or lean away from it? Can 
you tell why the plants in these boxes grow as they do? 
Allow the end of a nasturtium vine to grow through 
a small hole into a tight box. After a few days ex- 
amine the vine. What changes have taken place in 
the part that grew in the dark box? 
Make several small holes in the bottom of the box 
about three eighths of an inch in diameter so that the 
foots can grow through them. Make it dark on one 
side of the box. Do the roots all grow the same way 
after they come through the holes? Do you think 
the roots grow in the ground to be in darkness or to 
get food for their growth? From this exercise, what 
effect do you think the light has upon the growth of 
Toots ?

Exercise XT ; 
Purpose. .To determine whether plants grow .to+ 
wards light or away from the center of the earth. 
Method. Provide a box about ten inches long, sis 
inches wide, and six inches deep. Cut a hole as largg 
as possible in one side of the box and cover it witha 
glass, putting the glass on the inside of the box. 
Fill the box with ordinary dirt. While filling it, 
plant some peas against the glass near the bottom, 
Moisten the dirt enough for the peas to grow. 
Observe the plants carefully. 
After they have grown about an inch tilt the bo 
by raising one end of it as much as possible without 
spilling the dirt. Leave the box in this position until 
the plants have grown another inch. Then place tht 
box in the position it was at first and let the peas gro# 
another inch. 
Show by a drawing the direction in which the pess 
grew. Were the peas growing all the time the short 
est way to the surface? What effect had the tilting 
of the box on the growing plant? ‘From the way

pan, until it seems to be dry, but do not let it burn. 
Weigh it again. Is there any difference in the weights? 
What makes the difference? 
The difference in weight is about the amount of 
water that was in the plant. What per cent of water, 
did the plant contain? — 
Try the same exercise by letting the plant remain 
in the schoolroom for a week. If ordinary scales 
are used, take four plants instead of only one. Does 
the plant continue to get lighter? Why? / 
Make a simple tabulation in the notebook of the 
Weights of the plant from day to day. What does 
this record show? What causes the plant to wilt? 
Exercise XV 
_ Object. To find the amount of mineral matter 
in the plant. 
Method. Take a root of a pigweed and put it in 
an iron dish and heat it for an hour or until the smoke 
Sno longer seen coming from it. What remains? 
The ash that is left contains the mineral matter. 
How much of the plant is ash? Experiment with 
Steen and dry roots to see whether there is any dif- 
ference in the percentage of ash in the plant. Record 
'n the notebook the results of the experiments. 
What per cent of the weight of the plant is ash? 
Do you think that the per cent of ash is the same in 
the green and dry wood? Does the plant need a great 
amount of mineral matter?

Exercise XXXII 
Object. To learn the ways of testing seed corn. 
Method. Take a piece of muslin and mark it off 
into two-inch squares. Number the rows as 1A, 2A, 
1B, 2B, and so on. Number the ears in the same way 
with a small piece of paper and fasten the number in 
the butt of the ear with a pin. 
Take two kernels from the butt, two from the middle, 
and two from near the tip and lay them in each square. 
Do not take all the kernels from the same side of the 
ear. Roll the muslin up in a roll and keep it damp for 
two days. Unwrap it to see how many of the kernels 
have sprouted. The ear should not be planted unless 
all six of the kernels started to grow. This is called

The eyes should not be too deep, as deep eyes may 
cause decay. If there are too many eyes, there is a 
waste in cooking. . The variety should be true to type 
or they will run toward scrubby potatoes. 
Exercise XLIII

solution. 
Place the potatoes in a burlap sack. Fill a bucket 
about two thirds full of water. Put into this water 
about one tenth of a pint of the formalin. Place the 
sack in the solution and leave it there for two hours. 
Potatoes so treated may be planted without fear of 
raising scabby potatoes. These potatoes may be 
planted at home and reported on at the beginning of 
the next school year. The potatoes should not be 
eaten after they have been soaked in the formalin 
solution. :

Exercise XLVIII 
Object. To learn how to whip graft. 
Method. A small root, or twig, or a water sprout 
from the apple tree makes good material for this 
exercise. Cut it as shown in the illustration. Use a 
‘sharp knife to make 
the cut. The cut 
should be at least an 
inch long. The scion

growing layer. Raise the opening at the top with a 
knife and slip the bud into the opening. 
To hold the bud in place wind raffia around it as 
shown in the illustration. Commence to wind at the 
bottom, fastening the end of the raffia as it is being 
wound around the bud by keeping the end under the 
first layer. Draw a slipknot in it to fasten the raffia 
without tying it, so that it will not be necessary to 
untie it as the growth proceeds. After the bud has

grown a foot long cut off the top so that the bud can 
use all the plant food that comes up the stem. 
Budding should be done during the growing season. 
Can you tell why? Why is budding usually done 
near the ground and before the tree is transplanted? 
Exercise L 
Object. To determine how cuttings start to grow. 
Method. Locate a wet place in the ground or pro- 
vide a rather large box of dirt that can constantly be 
supplied with plenty of water. Secure two live willow 
twigs about as big as a lead pencil or a little larger. 
If willow cannot be had, Carolina poplar may be used 
. instead. Place the base end of one of the twigs and 
the top end of the other well down in the wet earth. 
Leave them several days, but observe them occasion- 
ally. After they begin to grow notice them oftener. 
Make notes of the observation and tabulate the re- 
sults in the notebook. 
Is there any difference in the growth that takes 
place? Does either one have both branches and roots 
growing on it? Which one has roots? In what di- 
rection do they grow, upright or drooping? In what 
direction do the branches grow? Are the roots and 
branches at the end or all along the twig? 
Some plants will grow from the leaf. Cover a be- 
gonia leaf, if one can be found, in moist sand and watch 
it for several days, until it starts to grow. 
Plants may also grow from cuttings alone. Cut

Exercise LI . 
Object. To learn how to make spray material. 
Method. This exercise can be done at home and 
the results may later be written in the notebook. 
To make Bordeaux mixture; take two pounds of 
copper sulphate, put it in a sack, and hang it in a bucket 
of warm water over night. Slake four pounds of lime -
-P-A-G-E-69
58 ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 
in enough water to make a paste. Pour these two solu- 
tions together in about twenty-four gallons of water. 
Use in the spray pump before it settles. 
To make lime sulphur spray. Slake ten pounds 
of lime in an iron kettle in as little water as possible. 
Then add enough water to make ten gallons. Heat 
to the boiling point. Put a stick in the water and 
make a mark on it where the water comes. Add 
twenty pounds of sulphur as it boils; keep stirring 
all the time. When the sulphur all goes into solu- 
tion, let the mixture cool. 
Use one gallon of this solution to eight, gallons of 
water when the spray is used before the leaves come 
, out. Use one gallon to thirty of water after the leaves 
come out. The first is for the scales and all other in- 
sects that suck. The second is as strong as it can be 
used without killing the leaves and is also used to 
destroy fungus discases. 
Usually two pounds of arsenate of lead to a barrel 
is used with it to kill the codling moth and the ecater- 
pillars. Mix the arsenate of lead with water enough 
for a paste and pour into the pump. 
A bulletin containing information on the making of spray ma- 
terial may be obtained from the State Agricultural Experiment 
Station or the State Agricultural College. 
Exercise LIT 
Object. To learn how to prevent the codling moth 
-larva from injuring the apples.
-P-A-G-E-70
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 59 
Method. Bring to the class four or five apples that 
have dropped from the trees. Cut the apples into 
halves and see if there are any “ apple worms ” in them. 
See if you can find where the worms came into the apple. 
If they have left the apple, can you tell where they 
went out? 
The apple worm is not a “ worm,” but a little cater- 
pillar, the larva of a small moth. After the caterpillar 
has eaten all it wants 
it leaves the apple and 
goes under a piece of 
bark or other place and 
hides away during the 
winter. When spring 
comes, the caterpillar 
changes to a moth. 
The adult moth lays 
its eggs on the young 
apples or on the leaves. 
The eggs hatch, and 
the very small cater- 
pillars crawl to the 
calyx of the nearest apple and enter it. The end 
of the apple opposite the stem is called the calyx. 
The apple worm is called the codling moth. Just 
as the petals of the apple blossoms begin to fall the 
calyx of the apple is open wide. In a few days the 
calyx closes up. 
When then should spraying for the codling moth be

a disagreeable odor that birds will not bother it. 
Other caterpillars may be studied in this way. 
Exercise LXXIV 
Object.. To learn how to destroy common insects. 
Method. Observe plants that have insects work- 
ing on them. Do the insects appear full grown? 
Larve and adult insects may both be working on the 
plants at the same time. How are the insects injuring 
the plants? Do they eat the leaves or do they injure 
the plant in some other way? Look over a pumpkin 
or melon vine and see whether you can find any insects 
on the ground around the vines or under the leaves. 
Have the insects eaten the leaves? 
Have you observed insects that suck the juices of 
plants and weaken or kill them? Do these insects eat 
the leaves? To kill “ sucking insects” one must put 
something directly on the insects. There are also 
insects that eat the leaves of plants. To kill these 
“chewing insects” a poison can be put on the leaves, 
so that when the insects eat the leaves, they will eat 
the poison also. 
What should one know about insects before he tries 
to kill them?

THE RABBIT 
Exercise LXXVIII 
Object. To find out why the rabbit should not be 
protected. 
Method. There are a few farmers who say that the 
rabbits rarely destroy anything; that they are pretty 
and every one delights to see them playing around the 
farmstead in the evening. They say that rabbits are 
always ready to be chased by a dog, and who does not 
enjoy a rabbit chase? They furnish good sport for 
the hunter, and their fur and meat have some value 
during the winter months. 
Some farmers say that the rabbits eat much grass ; 
others say these rabbits destroy much cabbage; and 
still others say that they destroy many small trees, 
especially in the winter when the snow covers the 
ground. It is for these reasons that they are classed 
as enemies of the farm crops. 
If possible have a live rabbit brought to school.

its back is gray ; its sides 
are spotted with. small 
black spots; and it has 
a yellow breast with a 
black line under the 
yellow throat. 
The meadow lark may 
be known by its sailing 
and by the white feathers 
shown in its tail when it 
flies. Its clear, flutelike 
whistle is heard while it

Exercise LXXXIII - 
Object. To get a clear idea of the size of a piece of 
land. The school plot. 
Method. Measure the length and width of the 
school plot. If possible, make a drawing to a suitable 
scale of the plot. If corn is planted in rows three feet 
eight inches apart, how many rows running lengthwise 
can there be in the school lot? Measure and verify 
the answer. : 
Allow six feet space not to be plowed along the 
fence. .

How many hills of corn could be grown in the school 
ground? Since there are 43,560 square feet in an acre, 
what part of an acre is in the school grounds? 
Exercise LXXXIV 
Object. To learn something of the destruction of 
forests. . 
Method. Take a walk out into a near-by wood- 
land. Look on trees, stumps, and logs for large white 
shelf- or bracket-like growths. These have been called 
“toad stools,” bracket fungus, and shelf fungus. 
Do these bracket fungi grow on dead wood or live 
wood? If any are found on growing trees, do the trees 
look healthy and vigorous or are they decaying? Look 
carefully and see if you can find a wound where the 
fungus grows, if found growing on a live tree. What is 
the color of the fungus on top? Underneath? Cut 
down through the fungus and notice the layers. You 
can tell how old it is from the layers. What do you 
think that the fungus feeds upon? Since this fungus 
destroys many forest trees and even sawed lumber, 
what class of men are likely to be most interested 
in it? 
Forest trees are destroyed by forest fires, insects, 
and fungus growths. The lumber industry is one of 
the important industries where there are forests. The

Object. ‘To learn why there are different kinds of 
farming in different parts of the country. 
Method. In your geography look at the list of 
agricultural products of Texas, Alabama, California, 
New York, Illinois, and Michigan. In what states do 
you find cotton? What kind of climate does it take 
to grow cotton? In which states do you find oranges? 
What kind of climate have those states? Which states 
produce fruit? Why? 
From your map pick out the most mountainous 
states and the levelest ones. Now look at their prod- 
ucts. Are the same products raised in all these states? 
In which states do the products require the most . 
cultivation ? 
Why are milk, strawberries, and hay produced close 
to market? Does it take more work to raise an acre 
of hay or an acre of potatoes? If the soil is suitable 
to raising either hay or potatoes, which will a farmer 
grow when labor is plentiful? Will he follow garden- 
ing if he is not close to a city? 
Can you tell why it would be desirable to fatten 
cattle in Illinois? Which one of the states grows the 
most wheat? Why?

Object. To learn where beef can be produced 
cheaply. 
Method. Since beef can be produced wherever ---~ 
and grass grow, let us see where corn and grass ca 
grown cheaply. The census report, 1910, gives 
following figures :

If it takes ten pounds of hay and ten pou 
to produce one pound of beef, how many 
each will it take to produce 1000 pounc. 
How much will it cost to produce 1000 pou:

-P-A-G-E-116
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN AGRICULTURE 107 
If it costs 75 cents per hundred pounds td market the 
beef grown in Iowa, and 20 cents per hundred pounds 
to market that grown in New York, in which state can 
the farmer make the greater profit growing beef cattle? 
Which do you think would pay the farmer best, to 
market his corn and hay or feed them to cattle and 
market the cattle? What kind of farming would you 
call it when the cattle are sold instead of the grain? 
Exercise LXXXVII 
Object. To determine how many domestic animals 
to keep on a farm. 
Method. What different kinds of animals do you 
see on the farms? Why do some farmers keep cattle 
and others keep sheep? Is the pasture all alike? 
Why do farmers need animals on their farms? 
Every farmer who grows crops has some cheap feed to 
sell or use; he also needs some stable manure for his 
farm. A great many successful farmers keep about 
one cow or one horse for each five acres of crops grown. 
If a farmer grows thirty acres of crops on a fifty-acre 
farm and keeps three horses, how many cows can he 
keep? If a farmer grows ninety-five acres of crops on 
a 175-acre farm and keeps four horses, how many cows 
can he keep? 
On this same farm, suppose the farmer keeps four 
horses and six cows, how many sheep could he keep 
if six sheep eat as much as one cow?

of two common farms located in the’same neighborhood 
in one of the Middle States. 
The first farm contains 60 acres and is valued at 
$12,092. The farmer keeps one hired man almost 
the whole year, eight horses, three cows, and does 
general farming. His receipts for the year were : 
For milk and butter . . $720 Forhay .. $ 75 
Forcalves . . 2. 80 For labor and other 1 re-

His expenses for the year were $1040. How much did 
he receive for his labor and the use of his farm for the 
year? 
The second farm contains 226 acres and is valued at 
$25,750. The farmer keeps two hired men all the 
year, six horses, twenty-eight cows, and does general 
farming. His receipts for the year were:

His expenses for the year were $2650. How much did 
he receive for his labor and the use of his farm for the 
year? 
What is the one: reason why one man made more 
money than the other? Are the farmers with small or 
large farms in your community making the greater 
profits? Any business must be large if labor and 
machinery are used to the best advantage.

  Beginnings in Agriculture 
By ALBERT RUSSELL MANN 
Decorated cloth, illustrated, 12mo, 341 pages, $0.75 
“Beginnings in Agriculture” has been planned in 
accordance with the suggestions made by the Committee 
on Industrial Education in Schools for Rural Communi- 
ties, for the teaching of agriculture in the sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grades. It gives a broad and general view 
of the study of agriculture. The lessons impress the 
child at once with the immediate personal value of the 
study. They are concerned with the Affairs of Agri- 
culture and the fundamental features of agricultural 
study: Soil, Plants, and Animals. 
The subject-matter is so presented that it correlates 
readily with the other subjects in the Course of Study. 
It supplements the work in arithmetic, geography, his- 
tory, and English. It presents the problem of agricul- 
ture in a clear and simple manner, readily understood 
by children. 
The treatment is constructive, the different parts 
closely related; the book is a unit. 
On each lesson there is given a list of problems cover- 
ing a wide range of conditions that bring out strongly 
the local applications.

The EZkements of Agriculture is the work of an experienced 
instructor with the editorial assistance of Professor L. H. Bailey. 
In both subject matter and method of presentation, the author has 
carried out as far as possible the recommendations of the com- 
mittee on methods of teaching agriculture of the Association of 
American Colleges and Experiment Stations. The laboratory and 
supplementary work is clearly outlined, there is an abundance of 
questions for study and review, and—a desideratum too often 
overlooked in agricultural texts — the reading lists are full *° 
clude the most recent publications, a full bibliography bein 
in the Appendix. There are two hundred text illustratic 
fourteen full-page plates. The subject as thus presented does not 
demand any -special preparation on the part of the teacher ; the 
usual knowledge of elementary botany and chemistry, and a fair 
familiarity with farm operations will suffice to conduct the work. 
Tn addition to its use in high school work, the book is suffi- 
ciently exhaustive to be used in normal schools, academies, and 
for brief courses in colleges, as well as for farmers’ reading circles 
and general library use. :

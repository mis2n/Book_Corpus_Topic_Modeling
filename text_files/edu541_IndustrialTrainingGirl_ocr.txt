PREFACE 
In the ideal state of society Labor and Love and Life 
would be regarded as three ways of characterizing the 
same thing; namely, a complete human existence. This 
larger, richer personality is to me an enticing goal of 
training, especially because of my belief that its means 
of attainment exist potentially in the nature of every 
ordinary child. Now, it is the dominant note of this 
little volume that industry —when properly related to 
the growth and the training of the young— is cultural 
and ennobling. Slowly yet unmistakably, from the age- 
old superstitions about her sex, there is emerging a type 
of woman which, as I believe, will be known as distinc- 
tively American—a type which is being created out of 
our plain, substantial, composite stock. And during all 
the years of her development this coming American 
woman will be guided first of all by the secret whisper- 
ings of her own true feminine nature. From the time 
when she first extends her tiny hands to grasp eagerly 
the baby doll, to the day when she bids adieu her first- 
born departing for college—during all these years she 
will continue to attain unto higher perfection and beauty 
of character. 
To play and work and love and serve and worship— 
these are the component parts of all good womanly lives. 
Deny a woman any one of these holy practices and she 
becomes incomplete, servile, and unhappy. This present

volume treats of the industrial training alone, but the 
other forms are implied and have been considered else- 
where. It is the humble wish of the author that many 
parents and other girl trainers may be led by this book 
to see the way whereby they may add genuine charm 
and dignity and spiritual worth to the character of the 
growing girl through a carefully adapted course of indus- 
trial training. 
The text of this volume is constituted of Part One of 
the larger one entitled “Training the Girl,” and that in 
accordance with a preconceived plan.

  THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 
OF THE GIRL 
CHAPTER I 
THE SMALL BEGINNINGS 
Ir, on the day these lines were written, the reader could 
have stepped into the large attic of a certain modest 
suburban home, the attractiveness of the scene witnessed 
there would have doubly repaid the effort expended in 
climbing the two flights of stairs leading thereto. This 
attic room was perhaps 24 x 30 feet in dimensions, and 
all of its commodious space was taken up by a remarkably 
complete equipment for the training of two little girls 
aged respectively four and six years. “How much do you 
want for these girls?” the parents were banteringly asked 
by a caller, before the presence of the room above had been 
made known. “Oh, they are not for sale, they are worth 
* too much,” quickly replied the mother. ‘We are not 
placing any wealth in their hands but we are trying to 
put all the riches possible into their characters.” 
What an object lesson that well-equipped attic room 
would furnish for the parents of America could they see it 
as it was and become acquainted with all its interesting 
details of arrangement! There were displayed in minia- 
ture form practically all the belongings, the furnishings, 
the means of industry, play and the other activities neces- 
sary for a complete and well-balanced life for little girls. 
The father was an ordinary sane and right minded busi- 
ness man, the owner of this unpretentious home and the 
3
-P-A-G-E-18

recipient of what you would call a very ordinary income. 
The mother was a well-poised, yet vivacious young woman 
who seemed to possess every characteristic of wholesome 
motherhood as well as much fondness for the home life 
over which she presided. It was plain to be seen that the 
thought of these two happy parents was very much ab- 
sorbed in the conduct and development of their children. 
A description of this interesting “house of childhood” 
will serve to make clear their remarkable course of home 
training and their complete plan for the bringing up of the 
little daughters. The description follows. 
An Unusvat “Hovuss or CurnpHoop” 
Through wise foresight in planning the house the parents 
of the two little girls referred to above had specified that 
the roof should be high and steep, thus allowing for a 
large amount of open space in the attic room. The two 
gable ends of this upper apartment were practically all 
filled up with the window space, admitting a maximum 
supply of light and air. At one end there was a door 
leading out to a small open balcony with high railing for 
protection. But the arrangements of the room within 
were particularly complete and attractive as they in- 
cluded practically all the materials so dear to the hearts of 
little girls. The thoughtful parents had made use of very 
light lattice strips in framing up partitions which sepa- 
rated the large room into many small compartments. 
This light frame work, which was little more than waist 
high to the girls, was covered with strips of wall paper, 
thus giving much of the appearance of the partitions in 
the ordinary house. 
There were door and window spaces of convenient size 
in this interesting child-house. In the extreme rear there 
was the little room which represented the kitchen in an 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
The Small Beginnings 5 
ordinary home, and in this were many pieces of toy 
furniture—a miniature stove, dishes, cooking utensils, 
and the like, all arranged in first-class order. Next to the 
kitchen was the little dining room with its table with 
dainty cloth, and on that were such furnishings as you 
might expect the little girls mentioned above to provide. 
There were tiny dining-room chairs, some pretty pictures 
on the walls, and other appropriate materials. Adjoining 
the dining room was a living room where sweet-faced little 
dolls served as the occupants. A diminutive couch, rock- 
ing chairs, a toy piano, a few baby books, a small carpet 
on the floor, some Perry pictures which the girls had 
framed, and other appropriate materials too numerous 
to mention—these made up the furnishings of the living 
room. And then there was a bed chamber with two little 
white beds and a dolly peacefully sleeping in each. This 
well-arranged bedroom quite equalled the other apart- 
ments of the child-house in point of attractiveness. Bath 
room and closets had not been overlooked in this complete 
little home and at one side there still remained space for 
what the children called their play-house. For, please 
mark the attitude of mind of the two little women, this 
other was not to them a play-house. It was a home and it 
received the same serious consideration which the model 
homemaker gives to the place in which she reigns. 
Home Inpustry 1s CULTURE 
The well-ordered and complete equipment of the child 
home described above impressed the author with the 
thought of its peculiar meaning and significance. And 
especially the idea that this attractive place was to the 
little girls not a play-house but a home—this impressed 
him above all else associated therewith until there came 
ringing in his mind clear and strong, the suggestion:
-P-A-G-E-20
6 Training the Girl 
Upon this foundation will I erect a superstructure of a 
beautiful ideal character for womanhood! 
It may at first prove well-nigh a shock to the sensi- 
bilities of some of our readers if we propose to place or- 
dinary work and industry as a foundation stone for every 
great life, including a life of well-poised womanhood. 
This we now do. But we feel sure that as the discussions 
develop we shall have an increasing proportion of our 
readers as friends and supporters of our plan. After all, 
perhaps there is no good life save that life which has 
learned mastery over the self and has acquired supremacy 
over something worthy of being done. And so, in con- 
structing a plan for the ideal career of woman, we should 
begin with the child, and by giving the tiny little hands 
some baby task to perform, and we should see that she per- 
formed the appointed duty so successfully and so well as to 
make it bring its certain reward of joy in the mere doing. 
At the same time we should be careful not to lay on the 
delicate little form a single duty that might be regarded by 
the child herself as in any sense burdensome. The childish 
instinct, created and ordained by Mother Nature herself, 
and coming to expression in the life of the little one,— 
this should be our first guide to the selection of the task. 
And the childish spontaneity and enthusiasm, as it rose 
and waned, should assist us in determining the amount of 
the appointed industry and the length of time during which 
the little one should continue in its pursuit. 
There is something very sweet and sacred in the native 
capacity of the unspoiled little girl for love and sympathy. 
Oh, how we wish for more ability to understand this pre- 
cious inheritance, with the thought that it might be de- 
veloped into a rich and forceful influence such as would 
dominate the career to the end of its existence! Yes, we 
should have these fine qualities of love and sympathy 
   
-P-A-G-E-21
The Small Beginnings i 
color every future deed in its performance, but we see no 
other certain avenue of approach to the successful attain- 
ment of these attributes save that of training the young 
life in the performance and the mastery of plain everyday 
work and industry. Be it known, however, that we are 
not thinking merely of the girl who must spend her adult 
life in some industrial pursuit. We are thinking quite as 
earnestly of the little one who may have been born in a 
home of wealth and refinement, and who,—so far as eco- 
nomic reasons are concerned,—will most probably never 
actually need to turn her hand to the performance of a 
single self-supporting task. 
Now, if we take these two extreme cases, namely, the 
little girl whose entire way of life seems to promise to be 
one of heavy work and industry; and the other little girl 
whose promise for the future seems to be that of attaining 
a position of ease and affluence, we shall perhaps be able 
to make our plan of ideal womanly development more 
easily understood. In part it is this: We sincerely desire 
and hope that the girl destined to a life of industry and 
the other one destined to a life of affluence shall always 
know each other through and through; that they shall 
be prepared to dwell in the same community with the 
highest possible degree of mutual sympathy and good 
fellowship. We desire also that the girl of industrial life 
shall be so masterful in her place as to receive a large in- 
crement of joy and satisfaction from her work, and as to be 
not altogether envious of her sister of the so-called upper 
ranks. And we desire that the other one shall have been 
made so intimately acquainted with ordinary girlhood 
work and industry as to be prepared to think lovingly 
and sympathetically of all the women who toil, and as to 
be deeply imbued with the thought of doing her part 
toward the amelioration of their condition.

8 Training the Girl 
Love Witt Leap THe Way 
Wherever love leads along the way labor is transformed 
into a delightful occupation. So, in casting about for a 
tiny industrial duty for the baby girl we should question 
the affectionate yearning of her own little heart. Just at 
the moment of our approaching her, what is she most fond 
of trying to do? Having obtained an answer to this ques- 
tion we should then regard the response as the unfailing 
pulse of nature throbbing in the little life; and we should 
immediately do our part in furnishing the opportunity 
and the equipment necessary for much practice in the 
performance of the chosen task. Such in short seemed to 
be the method of the good mother described above, who 
presided so ably over her entire household and who per- 
fected such a beautiful plan for the development of her 
two little girls. We must go back to her methods and 
follow them in detail supplementing them where neces- 
sary with the helpful methods of other good homemakers. 
Home Minpepness INcuLcATED 
In watching for the mottoes of development which seemed 
to pervade all the efforts of this good house mother in so 
far as they are related to the conduct of her daughters, 
we came upon the suggestion of the apt phrase-“home 
mindedness.” From the very first day and continuously 
throughout the use of her home-training plan there was 
clearly being inculcated into the minds of the little ones 
this most praiseworthy sentiment about the home life. 
Let the reader mark carefully again the fact that these 
two girls were not taught either to say or to believe that 
they were playing while engaged in caring for their minia- 
ture attic home. Every reference to this was in terms 
suggestive of work and industrial occupation. On the

other hand, they were taught to regard the small apart- 
ment called their play room as the place for the play ac- 
tivities. While in that part of the attic home they played 
and romped and threw things about capriciously. Noth- 
ing there was done with necessary seriousness of purpose. 
Blockhouses were built up only to be knocked down. The 
swings, see-saws, and other equipments were for purposes 
of mere sport. Any play activity might be begun and 
then abandoned the next moment. But in the other 
departments, those of the real household, the children 
were taught at all times to assume a different attitude. 
While there, as in their play room, the attitude of spon- 
taneity led the way: but the task once begun must of 
necessity be carried through to its completion. Sometimes 
the eagerness of the children would lead them to wish to 
undertake too large a household duty, but just here the 
splendid forethought and counsel of the mother guided 
the childish effort. So, in case of all chosen tasks—like 
that of making up beds, preparing a meal for the dollies, 
scrubbing out the kitchen, or otherwise putting the house- 
hold in order—the children were always required to carry 
the performance through to its completion. And they were 
even given time after its performance to pause for a mo- 
ment and contemplate with satisfaction the work of their 
hands. 
Tue Tepious Brcinnines 
A little year-old girl sat in her crib with a small fruit 
basket half full of clothes-pins on one side of her and a 
quart milk bottle on the other. The tiny one was slowly 
learning to pick up the clothes-pins, one at a time, and 
drop them into the bottle. How awkward were her little 
soft hands! How prone to carry the clothes-pins to her 
mouth rather than to the bottle! What a waste of baby
-P-A-G-E-26
10 Training the Girl 
energy, if we compare the amount of effort with the results. 
Some of the clothes-pins were dropped on the outside, 
others were thrown through error out upon the floor, and | 
still others fell back into the basket; but the child was 
learning. Slowly and tediously she acquired the neces- 
sary movements and was enabled to do the little task 
which she sought to perform. We observed in case of 
this baby’s effort more than a mere trial and error attend- 
ing the little exercise. We witnessed, for example, the 
interference of habit with the attempt to do a new thing. 
The child had already acquired the habit of putting such 
objects as clothes-pins directly into her mouth. So again 
and again would the little hand go up and bend toward 
the mouth, then outward toward the bottle, instead of 
taking the direct course from the basket. However, prac- 
tice slowly brought its expected improvement, and in 
the course of a half hour or more the movements of the 
little hand and arm were brought more definitely under 
control. 
The mother of this baby girl seemed to understand very 
well indeed her combined relation of mother and teacher. 
She repeatedly assisted the child in economizing the ex- 
penditure of the energy. Several times she directed the 
movement of the little fingers in grasping and holding the 
object. The baby learner seemed to understand and 
appreciate much of the meaning of it all. It was now 
suggested that the mother try teaching the child to insert 
the clothes-pins into the bottle all in one manner; that is, 
with the heads all downward. Perhaps five minutes’ 
time was consumed in this effort before the child seemed 
to catch the meaning of it. And then, with an expression 
of real joy upon her little countenance, she began to take 
the lead in arranging the objects so that they would go 
into the bottle in the desired manner.
-P-A-G-E-27
  
The Small Beginnings 11 
Tue Secret or Success 
Now, in this instance of the child playing with clothes- 
pins we have revealed the secret key which unlocks the 
door leading into the house of knowledge. Two or three 
terms stand out with special prominence in so far as the 
duty of the teacher is concerned: patience and definiteness 
are the rules of training here. Then add to these merely 
the understanding of how the child nature learns through 
native experience, and you have the entire program in 
condensed form: Patience, definiteness and insight—these 
are the three mottoes of instruction. Now, recall the 
fact that at the moment when the little child first 
understood what was desired of her by way of arrang- 
ing the clothes-pins in her little hands so that they 
would go into the be'tle head first,—recall, if you will, 
this joy of achievement, and you have additional insight 
into what it means to be the real teacher of a real learner. 
So, in the task of instructing the little girl in the 
performance of any ordinary task, no matter how small 
that may be, patience, definiteness and methodical ar- 
rangement for repeated trials and errors are necessary— 
all to the end that the child may finally catch the purpose 
intended and perform the act by means of her own self- 
directed effort. This is the ideal mode of procedure and 
in practically all such cases the expression of joy upon 
the radiant face of the little one will amply reward the 
effort in her behalf. She is learning to do by doing; she is 
acquiring a mastery over the movements of her body. 
She is acquiring a deftness in the use of her hands and 
fingers. In short, the little one is learning to do faith- 
fully and well some assigned duty, and in reality is taking 
the first small steps in a possible career of success and 
triumph.
-P-A-G-E-28
  12 Training the Girl 
Wherefore, the mother who comes to you complaining 
of her child, “I haven’t time to bother teaching my little 
girl to help me. She is more trouble than she is worth. 
She gets under my feet and hinders my work,” and so on— 
this mother has failed both to understand her duty to 
her child and to appreciate the method whereby the mas- 
tery of life is attained. Was there really ever a little 
growing girl who was “worth her salt” while learning to 
help about the household? Did it not in every instance 
cost tenfold more of time and patience and energy than 
was paid for by all of the fruits of her little labors? Indeed, 
one of the first essentials for the mother-teacher is that 
of looking for the reward in the slowly emerging character 
of the young learner. The training must be thought of 
as a mode of bringing the inherent qualities out of the 
young life. With all her inability 4 do anything helpful; 
with all her economic uselessness, the little daughter 
may be thought of as a veritable gold-mine of latent 
riches. But the wealth hidden there can be got at with 
assurance only by means of patient 1 toil and labor in lead- 
ing the child through a systematic course of discipline. 
In the chapters to follow, we shall take up one by one 
the small disciplinary home tasks suitable for training 
and developing the growing girl. And we shall attempt 
to be very concrete and definite in the setting forth of a 
method of instruction.

  CHAPTER II 
THE KINDERGARTEN TRAINING 
We are thinking of the time ras the little daughter 
will have become a full grown woman, and wondering 
what to do in order to make her character an ideal one. 
We observe about us so many attractive appearing young 
women whose lives do not bear the test of a full and com- 
plete analysis. Some are mere butterflies, others are 
parasites, still others seem to have a bone of contention 
to pick with society. The last named class is one of the 
largest. One who knows how to make an inquiry about the 
matter and who does so will be surprised at the large 
number of young women there are among us to-day who 
harbor a kind of secret spite at See and at things as 
they are. Something is the tt 
Whatever else may be lacking in the character of any 
member of the classes of young women named above it 
may be said that practically not one of these is engaged 
regularly in doing any work which her instinctive nature 
longs to perform. And how soon all these must perish; 
for the butterfly is always short-lived, the parasite has 
an uncertain and unenviable career, and the spiteful and 
envious creature quickly consumes his own heart. 
A Constructive Pian or DEVELOPMENT 
Why should not the parent have a constructive philos- 
ophy of life to apply from the beginning in the develop- 
ment of the baby girl? Indeed, we contend that he should. 
If the character of the little one is to unfold beautifully 
14,
-P-A-G-E-31
The Kindergarten Training 15 
and to bring perennial joy to its possessor, something 
very definite must be done to make the child ultimately 
a producer. She may be very happy during childhood 
with all play and no work; she may flit about with joy 
during maidenhood, sipping only the sweets, and avoid- 
ing all assigned and irksome duties. But the day will 
certainly come when the full grown young woman will 
begin to measure herself by a standard of intrinsic value. 
And from that time on, her joy and satisfaction in life 
will be dependent upon whether or not she finds herself 
really worthy within. Not mere getting, enjoying and 
consuming the fruits of others’ labor; but giving, pro- 
ducing, and contributing to the well-being of society— 
this is suggestive of the balanced program of training and 
development necessary for rounding out the life of a 
growing child. Teach the little daughter to use her head, 
her heart, and her hands with equal facility; give her little 
problems of her own to think out; give her little occasions 
for pouring out her heart’s love where it is needed and 
appreciated; give her opportunities again and again to 
train her hands to perform the thousand-and-one work-a- 
day tasks that constitute'a part of the life occupations of 
every good woman—give your daughter all these forms 
of discipline, and the day will surely come when she will 
rise up and bless your memory because of her very great 
worth to the world.

Would that every little girl could have the valuable 
benefits of the kindergarten training! If this most helpful 
form of discipline for the little daughter be not available 
in the form of a regular training school, then the substance 
of such instruction must be given in the home. Indeed, 
such home training is well exemplified in the case of the

attic room and its equipment described in chapter one of 
this volume. The kindergarten is a school which com- 
bines the work and play of childhood. Spontaneity char- 
acterizes everything. The little learners in this school of 
life are engaged in doing such baby tasks as will com- 
bine at once the largest amount of childish interest with 
the largest amount of structural training. In the well- 
conducted kindergarten class the children acquire new 
methods of doing things and of gaining a definite control 
over their own movements. 
In order that the ordinary mother may be assisted in 
understanding the meaning of the kindergarten as it 
applies to the development of her baby daughter, let us 
describe some of the valuable lessons that were actually 
given in a kindergarten class of fifteen little boys and 
girls ranging in age from four to six years. 
A Concrete ILLustRATION 
These little learners assembled in the back parlors of 
the Congregational church of Manhattan, Kansas, where 
they came under the able instruction of Miss Anna Fair- 
man, a trained kindergartner. Here were tables, chairs, 
sand-boxes, work tools, and all the other apparatus nec- 
essary for the training. The floor was marked off in 
circles and squares for the practice movements. The 
children were taught to regard the place as their kinder- 
garten home, and to believe that each one was there to 
do his little part in rendering the situation a happy one 
and in making the hour profitable for all. The teacher 
herself was most happy in her work, and this joy was 
contagious among the children. While the class was a 
mixed one of boys and girls, for the sake of directly serving 
our purpose, let us now consider especially the part of the 
daily programs most suitable for the training of the girls.  
-P-A-G-E-33
  The Kindergarten Training 17 
First of all, there were the songs. Children live in a 
world of things and activities, and to the common little 
child practically every perceivable object is both alive and 
sentient. It is not merely a world of make-believe, but 
for the tiny consciousness it is a world of real belief. So 
the best kindergarten songs speak plainly and directly of 
thoughts and deeds. 
“Little Bluebirds, tell us, tell us, 
Do the south winds bring 
Any news of happy springtime, 
Happy, happy spring?” 
Thus through the medium of the songs in which all 
joined, the little ones in Miss Fairman’s class kept up a 
happy communication with the things of nature. The 
robins sang and hurried busily about the place expressing 
their little bits of sentiment as to the building of their 
nests, the care of their eggs, and the love and tender re- 
gard for their young. The violets and morning glories 
came with their peculiar messages of sweetness and light 
and thought of the seed time and harvest. Indeed, to this 
happy and well-taught little class the world was a veritable 
fairy-land and everything in it was alive with interest and 
activity and sentiment for the child mind. 
Yes, you say, but this is a fictitious life, the child can- 
not go prancing through the world of fact as if it were 
only one of fairies and dreams, not known at its actual 
worth and by its real meaning. This life is full of hard 
toils and heavy tribulations which the young must learn 
to meet. Correct, indeed, we answer. In so far as the 
adult is concerned you have spoken the truth. But for 
the child, the natural one who is given even a reasonable 
opportunity to do so, the dream-world interpretation of 
things is the normal course for the time being. Allow the

little one of the kindergarten age to pass happily through 
this fairy-land of his own creation, give him the means, the 
apparatus and the opportunities to deal with objects as 
if they were all animate, as if they all knew and understood 
him, and behaved in thought of him—do this with the 
little child, we urge, and’ he will slowly come out of the 
dream land into the one of adult reality, so-called, by far 
the better prepared to deal with the sterner situations of 
life. We challenge any one who is thoughtful and stu- 
dious with reference to the meanings of childhood, to 
show that it is not both reasonable and helpful to indulge 
the child in his natural, animistic attitude toward things. 
Mucu Work to Prrrorm 
But aside from the songs and other concert movements 
Miss Fairman gave her little ones much of a constructive _ 
nature to perform. The little girls brought their dolls 
with them and were furnished the materials for making 
simple doll clothes. How awkward and unskilled the 
tiny hands were at first! Some mothers would have 
given up in despair and made the doll clothes themselves, 
but that method would not have served the aim of con- 
structiveness as thought of in this little kindergarten 
school. Each girl was to have the enjoyment of her own 
doll rightly adorned with garments, and in addition to this 
joy the further pleasure of having made each little article 
herself. So there were the slow going processes of train- 
ing—of how to thread the needle; how to hold the ma- 
terials in the hands; how to make the stitches; and how to 
_assemble the parts of the little dress. Some of the baby 
movements had to be gone over again and again, but 
slowly the soft little fingers acquired their deftness, and 
as they did so the baby face lighted up more and more 
with an expression of joy and satisfaction, How it would

have brightened the faces of the mothers themselves 
could they have been there and witnessed the progress of 
their baby daughters, as now this one and now that held 
up a little piece of the doll garment to receive a word of 
approval or a suggestion as to the next part of the task! 
Then, there were doll houses, beds, chairs, and other 
equipments to make; and the little girls created all these 
things so willingly with their own baby hands. 
Tue Spirit or Co-oPpERATION 
What a delightful thing it is for the individual of what- 
ever age to realize that he is living and moving in a world 
of real persons; that others, too, have tasks and problems, 
and perplexities; that others need one’s assistance and 
co-operation, while at the same time they are pleased 
to render such things in return! So as will be explained 
presently, the little girls in this well-conducted kinder- 
garten school learned the lessons of co-operation and in- 
terdependence. 
But first let us describe the making of the doll house and 
furnishings. Shoe boxes and ordinary paste board cut 
into strips, some waste pieces of wall paper, paste, brush, 
scissors, and the like, constituted the raw materials. The 
thought of each little girl was upon the work being under- 
taken. Their teacher continued to talk to them about 
what they were planning to do, how each piece was to be 
used, how the doll houses were to be finished, and so on. 
While all worked in accordance with the same plans and 
specifications, each little one was permitted to manifest 
her individuality in the work being done. There was 
some opportunity for the exercise of personal taste in the 
choice of colors and in the matter of assembling the parts 
of the house. Then, there were the tiny bed, the chairs, 
tables and the dining-room equipment. As the work con-
-P-A-G-E-38
  a Training the Girl 
tinued and increased in complexity there was displayed 
more and more the personal taste of each of the little 
workers. Now, let the reader mark well the peculiar value 
of the instruction just sketched. It was indeed play of 
the most enticing sort, but in addition to that every eager 
little mind was acquiring knowledge of a very definite kind 
and every little hand was increasing its degree of facility 
of use. Moreover, and above all things else, each child 
was learning to construct something that prepared for 
and signified the more serious business of the years to 
come. 
Now for the spirit of co-operation. It happened that 
on one occasion a certain little girl member of the group 
was ill and could not be present at the kindergarten school. 
The teacher referred affectionately to the absent one and 
asked the other members what might be done as a show of 
kindliness and remembrance. Various things were quickly 
suggested, and out of it all there was soon evolved the 
purpose to build the doll house with all of its furnishings 
and send these things to the little ailing one. How eagerly 
all hands went to work! A division of labor was arranged. 
Some were cutting out the pieces, others pasting, still 
others assembling the parts, and so on. The instructor 
had noticed from their own house-building what each 
one seemed most apt at doing, so in the division of labor 
she tried to give each little girl that particular part to 
perform. The work was quickly done. “Why!” cried 
one of the twelve who had co-operated in making the doll 
house for the little sick friend, ‘‘We made this house in 
just a little while. It took us about three days to make 
our own houses.” So not only did the little girls learn 
much from this happy experience about the spirit of co- 
operation but they derived therefrom the suggestion as 
to the very large saving of time in the construction of a
-P-A-G-E-39
  
The Kindergarten Training 21 
given piece of work, done in such a way. And in order 
to make the lesson complete in all of its meanings, the 
baby workers were appointed to carry the doll house and 
its equipments to their little sick friend where they might 
have the pleasure of witnessing her joy in its possession. 
Anoruer Important APPOINTMENT 
Children are naturally fond of the plastic art. If there 
be nothing better available they will go directly into the 
mud and work with that, molding it into mud “pies,” 
water dams, and the like. So the kindergarten takes ac- 
count of all this instinctive disposition of the child to 
create out of plastic material its own imagined forms, 
and it furnishes an artist’s clay therefor. Girls as well as 
boys are exceedingly fond of this sort of activity. In 
conducting the work in molding in her kindergarten school, 
Miss Fairman kept in mind the natural animism of child- 
hood. So the forms which her little ones molded out of 
clay were not dead and inert things, but to them they were 
creatures of life and thought and activity. In so far as 
conditions would allow, the models were formed by the 
children in imitation of living patterns. The dog, the 
horse, the cat, and the chicken were observed rather than 
models of these, and thus there was combined with the 
lesson of molding, an additional lesson in close observa- 
tion of the forms of living things. In order to deepen the 
interest and to inculcate wholesome sentiment about 
domestic animals, Miss Fairman always adheres to the 
practice of talking much to the children about the animals 
which they are creating out of clay. When through with 
all this, the children have been made to understand that 
horses can suffer from being overworked, driven too fast, 
not rightly fed and watered, and from being otherwise 
mistreated. So with the other animals—the cow, the cat,
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 Training the Girl 
| 
and the dog—these came in for their share of the thought- 
ful attention and sympathy on the part of the children. 
We must not minimize the value of this lesson about 
the care and sympathy for dumb animals. It is not always 
men but it is sometimes thoughtless and heartless women 
who mistreat these dumb friends and servants of ours. 
But such mistreatment as we have often observed to be 
accorded a dumb creature by some apparently intelligent 
woman—such treatment is not a matter of wantonness or 
intended cruelty. It is most usually an affair of ignorance, 
in case of one whose thought has never been definitely or 
adequately brought to the consideration of the nature and 
the rights of domestic animals. Thus this crude plastic 
art, introduced in time of mere childhood, trains the girl 
to create through the use of her deft little fingers, forms 
that to her are living and sentient. And thus there slowly 
emerges out of this beautiful kindergarten lesson the 
character-forming ideals in respect to the nature of dumb 
animals and their service to mankind. Thus again, there 
accrues to the baby learner a sense of inner worth and 
ability; for with her own hands she is constructing that 
which she in part has created out of the activities of her 
imaginative mind. 
InpuLcIne THE Creative INstINcT 
It will be noticed that Miss Fairman’s work in the 
kindergarten school as described above tended to give 
expression to the creative instinct of the child. The or- 
dinary child has very little inventive ability. There must 
always be suggestion and rough guidance. It is better to 
say that curiosity and childish interest will lead the little 
one to the discovery of new acts and movements than 
to say that the child actually invents them. After the 
interest of the kindergarten girls was aroused in relation
-P-A-G-E-41
The Kindergarten Training 23 
to the work of making doll houses, for example, they were 
encouraged to express their peculiar tastes and individuali- 
ties. Thus the charm and the enticement of the task were 
much increased. Indeed, so great is the interest that the 
little girl of the kindergarten age will often remain at 
her self-chosen piece of work even longer than her baby 
strength and the condition of her health would warrant. 
So we cannot be too insistent that the kindergarten 
girl be given some constructive work to perform, some- 
thing that she loves to do and something that will slowly 
give her a sense of security and responsibility in her light 
endeavors. Miss Fairman’s method of building up this 
creative ability in the little girls of her class is so com- 
mendable as to deserve a further description. Forexample, 
she planned some very interesting raphia work, that is, 
the manufacture of some little rugs for the doll houses. 
For the construction of these rugs it was necessary to 
make looms, and this she arranged to have the children 
do, using the toy carpenter’s tools and the lathe materials. 
Work baskets were likewise planned and constructed. The 
first ones were satisfactory in every way excepting for 
lack of lids to keep out the dust. So these were afterwards 
re-constructed with a cover attached, and with handles 
and other parts suitable for their chosen purpose and 
suggestive of the real work baskets used by women. 
We may note in passing the suggestion that the con- 
structive work of children should not always be com- 
pletely planned, that they should be allowed to do some 
work—like that just described above—which proves on 
trial to be unsatisfactory. The value of that sort of lesson 
lies in the fact that the child gets the benefit of trial and 
error and receives the suggestion that things planned 
do not always work out to a wholly satisfactory conclusion. 
The learner also acquires the lessons of patience so often
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 Training the Girl 
necessary in tearing down and rebuilding a piece of work 
after it has once been begun. 
Tue Duty or tae Moruer 
We have described, at considerable length, the kinder- 
garten work as conducted by Miss Fairman and in doing so 
have been guided by the belief that the ordinary mother 
can conduct much of this work in her own home and in 
behalf of her own little girl. While we recommend and 
strongly urge that the child be sent to a good kindergarten 
school, we find this in the great majority of cases to be 
impracticable; for, unfortunately the kindergarten school 
is not as yet available for the masses of the children of 
the country. 
In closing the chapter we feel inclined to insist again 
that the mother reader do not overlook the point of giving 
her baby daughter the industrial discipline as suggested 
above, and that during the very earliest years. However, 
let us understand once for all, that this discipline is not 
thought of in terms of mere preparation for making a 
living and for earning wages, important as these things 
are. It is thought of and urged here because of its very 
great service in building up a beautiful, aggressive and 
yet well-poised character in the life of the growing girl. 
In short, this industrial discipline is recommended be- 
cause of its worth as an agency in slowly placing in the 
hands of any ordinary girl a mastery over the plain situa- 
tions of life, and ultimately a mastery over her own fate.

  CHAPTER III 
ATTENDING THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
On first thought it might seem to the reader that the 
public school attendance is not rightly considered as a 
part of the industrial training. However, it is our purpose 
here so to regard it. The best definition of work and in- 
dustry makes little or no distinction between using the 
head and using the hands. Its substantial meaning is 
that of the attitude of the individual toward the task 
before him. So we should regard the public school train- 
ing which the growing girl receives as first of all an affair 
of industrial discipline; and we should have her learn to 
regard her school lessons as plain work-a-day tasks which 
call for the best of her painstaking effort and patience. 
Worx DistincuisHED FROM PLAy 
If parents and teachers will all carefully draw a line of 
distinction between the work assignments and the play 
activities of the child, a point of progress in training will 
thereby be gained. Perhaps there was really some justi- 
fication in labelling everything in the kindergarten school 
as play. But if the kindergarten training of the girl— 
now arrived at school age—has been rightly conducted, 
she has been impressed gradually with the idea of that 
necessity which attaches itself to all good work.. At any 
rate the young learner just entering the grades is brought 
into a new relationship to her appointed activities. There 
is now no necessity of trying to make her believe that 
the assigned work is mere play. On the other hand, she 
26
-P-A-G-E-45
  
Attending the Public School 27 
should be impressed with the thought that the lessons 
are prescribed, that certain standards of excellence are 
to be met, and that her promotions are to be earned by 
her own efforis. 
Of course, there is always a possibility of making the 
little school girl feel that she has been driven to her les- 
sons, but such a thing is far from our purpose here. So, 
while imbuing her with the thought that the work is serious 
and something that is carefully prescribed, we should 
also say much to give her self-confidence and good cheer 
in undertaking to bring up her assignments. Upon this 
point it might be well to quote substantially the state- 
ment of a good foster-mother who revealed a commendable 
method of dealing with her eight-year-old adopted child. 
Her statement follows:— 
“My little Edith is eight years old and she is just as 
dear to me as if she were my own flesh and blood. Yes, 
I am teaching her to work as well as to play. We talk 
about her school lessons every day and I try to help her 
to understand various little matters that come up in 
relation to her studies. I try above everything else to 
make her fond of her school and its requirements. I talk 
to her much about the time when she will be a big girl 
and a young woman and tell her how glad she will then 
be that the early lessons were well learned. I remind her 
again and again that her play will be so much happier in 
case she has been faithful in her school work. I tell her 
that it makes it so much easier for her teacher and myself 
and the other school children to like her when she is ready 
and faithful in her lesson getting. Edith has been in 
school one year and is now starting on her second. She 
and I know a great many things in common about her 
class work and we enjoy talking to each other about them. 
It certainly is a pleasure to me to watch that girl grow 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 Training the Girl 
{ 
and it especially encourages me to know that she is fond 
of her school lessons, but I have never tried for a moment 
to make her believe that the school work is play.” 
Beware or Contests 
We, who have studied school matters long and seriously, 
would forewarn parents against encouraging their daugh- 
ters to participate in educational contests against their 
schoolmates. There might possibly be some justification 
in setting up individual contests for prizes in athletics and 
in mere games of sport. But we cannot endorse the 
thought of using such means as a plan of inducing young 
girls to study their lessons. Do you wish to train your 
little daughter to match herself point by point against 
other girls? Do you wish her to look for weaknesses and 
shortcomings in the others? Do you wish her to have 
practice in gossiping meanly about the characters of her 
schoolmates? Then, this personal, school-prize contest— 
this method of matching girl against girl—will engender 
all these mean dispositions. 
Look forward to the time when your daughter will be 
a full grown woman, think of her matured life in terms of 
its love and sympathy and good will for others and you 
will be the more inclined to emphasize during her child- 
hood days in school, those practices which help her to 
find and think about and talk about the very best there 
is in the characters of her schoolmates. It is quite as easy 
to match your little daughter’s best self against her worst 
self; to have her compare her attainments to-day with 
those of yesterday; to help her average up her grades in 
school for one month and determine to outdo her record 
for the next month. Thus your child will learn to despise, 
if you will, not some of her classmates, but rather that 
weaker effort of her own which she feels herself to be

overcoming. In short, you do not wish your daughter to 
struggle for supremacy over the little friends with whom 
she is associated in the class. You rather desire her to 
strive for supremacy over herself; and you add much new 
joy and inspiration to her young life in proportion as you 
assist her in attaining such a position of superiority. 
Tue Reconstructive Mretuop 
The author of this book has in mind all the while the 
thought of a slow-going re-construction of human society. 
It is his most ardent wish that we all might dwell together 
in a closer bond of sympathy and good fellowship, and 
he believes that the public school, assisted by thoughtful 
and conscientious home training, holds the key to the 
door of this larger and closer social unity. So the little 
daughter in school must be repeatedly counseled with 
about the appointed duties and the everyday experiences 
therein. Again and again the little one will run home 
with a quickly-made-up judgment about her schoolmates 
or her teacher: as, “Nellie didn’t recite half as well as I 
did and she got a better grade”; or “Miss Blank (the 
teacher) made me stay in for missing my spelling and she 
let others go who missed as many words as I did.” These 
little tales of disappointment, childish and imperfect 
judgments of what actually happened, are all regular 
occurrences in the ordinary home where there are children 
of school age. Such small matters of school gossip furnish 
the wise and thoughtful parent many an opportunity for 
re-directing the effort of the child toward more desirable 
ends. In such cases the parent is slow to condemn the 
daughter’s supposedly favored classmate and still less 
inclined to speak disparagingly of the teacher. 
We must make our point clear and emphatic here. For 
example, the little daughter comes home with a story of
-P-A-G-E-50
  
30 Training the Girl 
mistreatment in the school. It is well to turn at once to 
a discussion of her own conduct. “It does not matter 
so much what Nellie or any other girl did, my child, but 
what did you do? If Nellie has faults she must correct 
them or at some future time they will seriously hurt her. 
Are you certain you know all about how she did in this 
recitation? Were you watching her all the time? And 
if you were, was that studying your lesson? Did you 
really do your part in preparing for the recitation? Could 
you not easily do better another time? How could you 
study better? And now about Miss Blank, your teacher. 
Do you know all about what she is doing and thinking? 
How do you find time to watch her so much? Perhaps she 
does many things and better things that you do not see, 
while you are studying.” 
So, as described above, the parent will seem to defend 
the little girl’s schoolmates and her teacher and to throw 
the blame for the dissatisfaction partly upon the precious 
daughter herself. The parent who actually understands 
school situations will be very slow indeed to allow his 
child to hear him speak a word of condemnation of the 
teacher. He may think ill of the teacher, questioning 
seriously her methods and ability; but if these matters are 
deserving of discussion such consideration should be taken 
up with the teacher herself, or with the principal or the 
superintendent of the schools. In a great majority of cases 
a father or mother who goes to the school to blame and 
complain of the teacher will go back with the head bowed 
partly in shame and partly in humility. 
ConDEMNING THE TEACHER 
Any parent or patron who feels inclined to condemn 
wholesale the work done in the public schools should visit
-P-A-G-E-51
Attending the Public School 31 
those schools somewhat extensively before deciding to 
give expression to his condemnation; and in about 90% 
of the cases he will leave the words of disapproval unsaid. 
Now, if your little daughter comes home with a story that 
seems to reflect discredit upon the teacher, withhold your 
blame and your ill will for the time and go direct to the 
school for further and definite information. Go less in 
the spirit of criticism and rather more in the attitude of 
one who is trying to learn and to assist, than is usually 
done. Most probably you will be surprised to find in the 
personality of your child’s teacher a devoted and sweet- 
spirited young woman, one who is more or less over- 
weighted with the many perplexities common to the or- 
dinary schoolroom; one who is expending more energy 
in behalf of the well-being of that school than justice to 
herself would demand; and one who is far more desirous 
of having the school deal fairly, justly and sympathetically 
with all the children than you are. Yes, if you want to 
hang your head in shame because of that wicked little 
rebuking note which you hastily wrote the teacher of 
your child, spend a half day visiting the school and ob- 
serving the many trials and perplexities arising there. 
It may be said with certainty that in the great majority of 
instances the fault-finding school parent is largely ig- 
norant of the actual condition of affairs in the school. 
So, in case of a disagreement between the parent and 
the teacher, an honest board of arbitration will usually 
decide in favor of the latter. The fair-minded parent 
himself will be inclined to go to the furthest limit in speak- 
ing approvingly of the teacher in the hearing of the child 
and in attempting to adjust the child’s difficulties in ac-

parent to take every reasonable measure necessary to

make the little daughter thoroughly fond of her teacher 
and happy in the performance of her lesson tasks. 
Masterine THE Lessons 
It may appear singular that we should delay a discussion 
of the lesson-getting tasks so long, but we have been far 
more interested in the school girl’s general behavior, and 
especially in her attitude toward her teacher and school- 
mates. We may feel assured that the matter of preparing 
the lessons will tend to take care of itself, provided the 
little student be fond of her school and enter enthusiastic- 
ally into all of its vitalizing movements. 
Pupils ranging below the seventh and eighth grades 
should be required to do no studying at home. For these 
grades the parents’ duty in respect to the lesson prepara- 
tion will consist largely of informal talks. It will be neces- 
sary in this connection to keep in touch with the general 
progress of each study pursued and to see that the child 
keeps up with the average member of her class. A direct 
question or two put to the pupil herself will be the means 
of discovering her attitude of mind toward any given 
lesson topic. Is she attempting to do the assigned work? 
Is she desirous of keeping up with her mates? Is she 
anxious to please her teacher? An affirmative answer to 
the foregoing questions will most probably satisfy the 
inquiring parent that good progress is being made. 
Throughout all the inquiry, the suggestion and discus- 
sion concerning the assigned schoolroom duties, the home 
trainer should have no thought of placing the daugh- 
ter in an attitude of envy and rivalry toward her school- 
mates. It is a serious mistake for the parent to join the 
child in the school contest, even though the child may seem 
to have an excellent chance to win the prize. Hatred, 
strife, bitterness of feeling, and all other such evils, are
-P-A-G-E-53
ne a et ae 
Attending the Public School 33 
the first fruits of the hand-to-hand fight that goes under 
the name of a prize contest. You do not desire to have 
your little daughter stand above her mates, but rather 
to rank high along with them, and to be strong and noble, 
partly by virtue of the fact that she is working in harmony 
and good fellowship with them. 
How Mucs Home Stupy 
As stated above there should be only irregular home 
study on the part of the seventh-grade school girls. A 
half hour one or two evenings per week spent in bringing 
up some rather unusual task will be the maximum. And 
even in the eighth grade the assignments should be such 
as not to require more than an average of thirty minutes’ 
study during the five school-day evenings at home. If, 
therefore, the instructor of your daughter should impose 
heavy assignments requiring much fatiguing home work, 
radical steps should be taken to inquire into the matter. 
It is worth more to all concerned for the growing girl to 
continue in an attitude of buoyancy and good will toward 
the school than to have her to settle down into a habit of 
hurry and worry in an attempt to become a brilliant 
scholar. For, remember, the pupil is not for the school, 
but the school exists for the sake of the child and his 
character unfoldment. If the teacher seems to be driving 
the young pupils overmuch—if his ambition appears to 
be that of covering so much book work, rather than that 
of developing so much character in the pupil—then, call 
him to task, remonstrating with him first, and afterwards, 
if need be, with the superior officers. 
Waar or tar Curiy’s Heat 
There may be no reasonable doubt of the fact that good 
physical health is the only sound and substantial basis
-P-A-G-E-54
  34 Training the Girl 
for satisfactory school progress. The child which is suf- 
fering from some physical ailment may keep up with his 
classmates, and at times he may even lead them all in the 
matter of reciting and earning grades. But if the child is 
suffering from ill health all this brilliant school work is 
bought at the expense of too much nerve strain; and 
some future time will exact a heavy toll of interest upon 
the debt. It is not a difficult matter for the conscientious 
parent to determine whether or not his little daughter is 
physically sound and well enough to pursue the school 
lessons. For example, What about the child’s eyes? Does 
she see reasonably well and enjoy the benefit of ample 
light while working in her seat? Do her eyes ever pain 
her? Has she ever complained of headache? Does she 
ever remark that the “letters run together” while she is 
reading? If there proves to be even the suggestion of any 
eye defect, consult a specialist and bring about a speedy 
remedy—this is the only reasonable rule. 
Then, How about the child’s hearing, Is it normal? A 
careful test of the hearing ability of all the children in a 
schoolroom will show a wide variation. A slight degree 
of deafness means that a certain percentage of the words 
uttered by others are not heard and therefore not under- 
stood. Let the adult perform the following experiment: 
Pick up a page of typewritten manuscript of, say, 300 
words. Let somebody erase at random one or two words 
out of each sentence and then attempt to get the meaning 
from one reading. This test will indicate in some measure 
the great disadvantage in which the slightly deaf school 
child is placed. But suppose it were not merely one page 
but that all the pages were marked as stated above; then, 
the reading would become so difficult that you would tend 
to lose interest in it. So with the child that ranges below 
normal in his hearing. He tends to fall into the habit of
-P-A-G-E-55
Attending the Public School 35 
not listening, and thus he loses the chief benefits of the 
oral recitations in the school. 
Other possible physical defects of the little daughter 
at school are those which interfere with the respiration 
and thus lower the vitality and mentality. Adenoids are 
first thought of in this connection. If the child breathes 
through the mouth such is a very direct indication of the 
presence of adenoids; and so the case might as well be 
taken at once to a specialist for examination and treat- 
ment. As a rule, the child suffering from adenoids is 
dull and slow to learn. There is apparently for him an 
obstructed flow of the purified blood to the brain centers. 
He seems to be more or less low in vitality, to secure 
imperfect recuperation from his sleep, and frequently to 
show a listlessness in respect to practically all the juve- 
nile activities. The removal of adenoids has improved 
the mentality of many a child twenty-five per cent. or 
more. 
A further warning in respect to the health of the school 
girl is that touching her tendency towards nervousness. 
One cannot be too careful to see that the child has a well- 
regulated life during the school period, which is an excel- 
lent. means of keeping the growing nervous system in 
order. Wholesome food suited to the child’s age; the 
avoidance of many sweetmeats, or irregular meals; a 
regular time for going to bed and rising: a maximum of 
outdoor exercise and invigorating activity—these are 
some of the matters that suggest an evenly balanced 
physical life for the school girl and a reasonable safeguard 
against nervous irritability.

CHAPTER IV 
HOME AND SCHOOL CO-OPERATION 
One of the most cheering signs of the better times to 
come and of the higher level toward which our modern 
society is tending is witnessed in the many co-operative 
activities in which the school and the home are now par- 
ticipating. Indeed, the day is well-nigh at hand when 
it will be considered a mark of low breeding and unworthi- 
ness for the parent having a child in the public school to 
neglect all active participation in the life and progress of 
that school. So, in order that the well-wishing parent 
may if possible have presented to him some specific and 
feasible suggestions for his becoming a vital factor in the 
school progress, we shall now indicate a few lines of home 
and school co-operation. 
Tue Parent-TEAcHER ASSOCIATION 
One of the greatest public-school movements of modern 
times is that which has been organized under some such 
title as the one above. In effect this organization is a 
plan for linking the best thought of the parent with the 
best thought of the teacher in a forward movement in 
behalf of the child in which they are both interested. The 
old-fashioned way was to ignore the school until it got 
into trouble with the child, and then to engage in a more 
or less bitter contention with the teacher and the school 
authorities. In that day a visit to the school by the par- 
ent usually meant the beginning of trouble. But this es- 
tranged and unfamiliar relation between the school and 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
ij T 
38 Training the Girl 
the home is being rapidly transformed into one of co- 
operation and yoke-fellowship. In every part of the na- 
tion, and especially in many of the eastern cities, there 
are now well-organized parent-teacher associations; and 
in some of these places the father or mother of the school 
child is considered an ex-officio member. 
What an opportunity for the parent who loves his own 
child and earnestly and anxiously desires to have that 
child make good progress in the school! If such a father 
or mother will unite with an active parent-teacher associa- 
tion it may be said that he will learn more during the first 
year of active interest in this new movement than the 
child himself will learn in the school. Indeed, to many a 
parent this is the first and greatest opportunity for the 
discovery of what child life really means. 
“Oh,” you say, “I know all about my child! I look 
after her health and her clothing, send her to school on 
time, see that she keeps up with her class, and all that. 
Now, is not that my full part?” No, we answer; it is not. 
You do not know your child through and through until 
you have come into contact with many other children, 
those who have been born and reared under many differ- 
ent circumstances. All this first hand observation of the 
activities of other children will send you back to your own 
child with a new flood of light upon the problems that 
relate to his progress and development. 
Is the work in the home too heavy for you, Good Mother, 
and for that reason can you not afford to go into the 
home-and-school association? Then, we answer again 
that participation in this out-of-home club will lighten 
the burdens of the household, and will give you so much 
new strength and inspiration for the bearing of those 
burdens and for the management of the children about 
your feet, that you will tend to go on your way rejoicing.

Home and School Co-operation 39 
There is danger that even the thoroughly good and well- 
meaning mother may become an irritable slave to the 
routine duties of her household, largely because of the 
fact that she stays too closely at her post. So we recom- 
mend that she become an active member of the local 
parent-teacher association; and if there be no such or- 
ganization, we earnestly urge that she take the initiative 
in the matter of bringing one about. 
How to Orcanize a Scooot anp Home Cius 
Let us keep to our subject and think largely in terms 
of the problems that center in the life of the common 
school girl. Just how may the well-meaning mother pro- 
ceed to bring about the organization of the parent-teacher 
club? Interest, enthusiasm and agitation—a little of 
these put into active use and they begin at once to grow. 
Then more of the same thing and the problem begins to 
take hold of one’s whole being and to pull him along to- 
ward success. Go to the school once or twice per week, 
talk to the teacher sympathetically about the school and 
home relationships. Ask her what you can do, not so much 
in behalf of your own child’s progress, but rather as a 
means of making that child contribute more worthily to 
the success of the entire school. Ask the teacher con- 
cerning her best ideals for bringing home and school lifé 
together. Then go to the neighbors who likewise have 
children in school, and inquire as to their methods of 
dealing with their children’s school affairs. What criti- 
cisms have they upon the teacher’s methods, upon the 
conduct of the general school work, and upon the policies 
of the school authorities? So you go about among all, 
inquiring, suggesting, discussing, until you find a few 
others who are ready to go into your new project. 
The first meeting of your prospective association may 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  40 Training the Girl 
be a very informal affair. It may consist of two or three 
good mothers and the teachers of the building coming 
together for a brief discussion of matters that have grown 
out of the school work of the day. Questions and replies 
here go around spontaneously, and out of this informal 
meeting there will easily come the beginnings of a per- 
manent organization. It may be that you have taken the 
precaution to write for literature on the parent-teacher 
club movement. The National Congress of Mothers, 
Philadelphia, The Public School Association of New York 
City, or the National Institute of Child Life, also at Phila- 
delphia, will give much definite help and information. 
Before joining the new movement of the kind we are 
recommending, the parents naturally wish to have a report 
of the progress already attained elsewhere. It will prove 
a great stimulus to action, if you can report a large 
amount of such activities already under way in other 
places. 
How to Conpuct THE CLuB 
So, we urge again, if you wish to do the very best pos- 
sible in thought of the unfoldment of the latent beauty 
resident in your little daughter now at school, that you 
should participate in this home and school association. 
But although you have presumably been the most active 
in perfecting the new society, it may be well to see that 
others are elected to the honor of holding positions therein. 
As a rule, one of the teachers should be selected as presi- 
dent of the club—probably some young woman who pos- 
sesses tact, enthusiasm and good judgment. 
Now the next important step is that of making out a 
program of topics for the discussions; and in this connec- 
tion the most common fault is that of making the topics 
too broad and general. Avoid in every possible way  
-P-A-G-E-63
  Home and School Co-operation _ AL 
mere theories and generalities. Even enthusiasm will 
die quickly unless it has something definite to do. So in 
making out a list of topics, two matters in particular will 
guide the members of the committee: (1) Select only 
topics that are simple, definite and concrete; (2) In so 
far as it is possible, select speakers who know from actual 
experience something about the topics assigned. The 
sources of information referred to above will be glad to 
furnish outlines, plans, small programs, methods of con- 
ducting the work, and the like. 
Another excellent means of making the program a suc- 
cess will be that of supplying each participant with def- 
inite literary helps or with at least references thereto. 
This last-named service is performed by the well-made 
syllabus. But if such an outline be not available, then 
some member who knows most about the home library 
and its contents may render the service. The National 
Institute of Child Life, of Philadelphia, publishes monthly 
a little pamphlet giving a résumé of the child-welfare ar- 
ticles in the magazines, and this valuable document may 
be had at a very trifling cost. 
The program committee must be cautioned about as- 
suming that the ordinary well-meaning, enthusiastic 
mother naturally knows enough about the topic assigned 
her, to discuss it helpfully. On the other hand it may be 
reasonably assumed that she cannot give a good, stimu- 
lating discussion of her topic without some study and 
reference reading. In the case of one small club of the 
kind here mentioned, a certain mother possesses a large 
number of fresh, new volumes treating the child-welfare 
subjects. This good mother lends out her private library 
books, selecting a suitable one for each topic on the club 
program, and requiring the borrower to return the volume 
promptly.
-P-A-G-E-64
  42 Training the Girl 
Gertine THE Pornt or Vizw 
We are so deeply concerned about this matter of a 
parent-teacher club in connection with every school that 
we shall now go more definitely into the discussion of the 
program topics. Our thought in doing this is not merely 
that of improving the work of the school; it is not merely 
that of assisting the mother in the problem of keeping 
her daughter well up with the progress of the school. 
Our purpose is largely that of the better community life 
which is certain to grow out of all this co-operative ac- 
tivity. The community must be thought of as one and 
not many. Classes, castes, factions, cliques, and the 
like, are all more or less obscured in the wholesome com- 
munity where there is aggressive team work and co- 
operation. Now the school is not for the sake of the dis- 
cipline; it is not for the sake of the lessons, the grades, 
and the promotions; it is not for the sake of the teacher or 
the board of education; it is not even for the sake of the 
individual child. The best justification of the common 
school is this: It makes for a united community; it in- 
culcates sympathy, good will, co-operation, personal self- 
reliance, and loyalty to the best interests of the whole of 
humanity. If we can but draw the central thought of 
the common parent away from the idea that his child is 
to be trained to enter into combat with the world, trained 
to secure the good things of life through shrewd and 
cunning activities intended to wrest such things from 
somebody else—if we can get this erroneous point of view 
out of the mind of the parent and induce him to think of 
his child as in process of unfolding numerous latent possi- 
bilities common to all the children; to think of him as in 
process of learning day by day in school and out, how to 
enter co-operatively into the great life of the community
-P-A-G-E-65
  Home and School Co-operation 43 
and the nation—then, we shall have gained a strong point 
of vantage in behalf of human welfare. And rightly 
thought of and organized, the new parent-teacher move- 
ment will contribute toward this higher and better com- 
munity life. 
Topics FoR THE ProcRAM 
In order to show how the discussions of the parent- 
teacher club might well go on, we shall now name a few 
topics and suggest methods of treating them. 
Home Study. We raised the question above as to how 
much the child should study at home. Your daugh- 
ter is growing larger and stronger each day. She is pass- 
ing up through the grades. The lesson tasks are slowly 
growing heavier and more numerous. How much should 
she study at home? This topic, treated generally, is 
sufficiently important to occupy one entire period of 
the club meeting. What is especially desired is a full 
exchange of ideas among the parents and teachers present, 
and a full statement of the situation in which each one 
works. If it is desired that the topic be subdivided we 
suggest the following for the afternoon program: 
How Much Home Study for Pupils. 
1. Boys, seventh grade and below. 
2. Girls, seventh grade and below. 
8. Girls, eighth grade and above. 
4. Boys, eighth grade and above. 
One parent and one teacher may be assigned to each 
topic, the one to offer a well-prepared ten-minute paper, 
and the other a five-minute discussion of the paper. 
The Schoolground Discipline. While the author con- 
tends that the children at play are quite as much in need 
of a leader and instructor as they are in the class room, 
our present school equipment is not such as to allow fora
-P-A-G-E-66
  44 Training the Girl 
regular, hired school playground leader. Usually the 
teacher’s full strength is required to conduct the classes 
and maintain good order within. Therefore, she can go 
only occasionally upon the schoolground during the play 
period. And yet, much of the most definite and important 
learning of the whole school comes from the playground 
activities. The children are acquiring good or ill practices 
there quite as actively as they are in the class room. 
Under present circumstances, how can this situation be 
reasonably well dealt with? The parent-teacher club may 
well consume another hour in the discussion of this affair. 
The following program is suggested :-— 
Morals on the Playground. 
1. What my boy hears and sees on the playground. 
2. What my girl hears and sees on the playground. 
8. Directing the playground activities of the girl. 
4. Directing the playground activities of the boy. 
One or two parents may discuss each of the first two 
topics and one or two teachers each of the second two. Out 
of it all the teachers should learn, first, what good or evil 
lessons are being derived from the playground activities; 
second, what re-direction may appear to be feasible for the 
same activities. Then, the parents may receive many 
suggestions as to how the home can co-operate in the im- 
provement of the playground morals. 
Home Industry. The problem of requiring the school 
child to help with the home work is always a vital one 
and it is especially an important one for the parents and 
teachers to discuss together. A survey of the situation 
will show that some children are doing heavy hc .ne duties © 
regularly, while others are doing nothing of the kind. 
Reports in the case of two little girls in the same sixth- 
grade class showed that one was devoting an average of 
three hours per day to the house-helping tasks and that

-P-A-G-E-69

the other was not even dressing herself without assistance. 
Yet, both were expected to do the same amount of 
schoolroom work. The free and frank discussions and 
reports of the members of the club cannot help but 
bring out startling revelations of irregularity and un- 
evenness relative to the home industries of the children. 
The following topical outline is suggested to guide the 
discussion :— 
Home Industry for the School Child. 
1. What and how much work my pre-adolescent boy 
does at home. 
2. What and how much work my pre-adolescent girl 
does at home. 
8. What and how much work my adolescent boy does 
at home. 
4, What and how much work my adolescent girl does 
at home. 
This program implies a clear subdivision of the topic and 
that each participant is to discuss a concrete case, naming 
the age and grade of the child and including a definite 
statement as to the kind, nature and amount of the work. 
After this discussion the parents will nearly all naturally 
possess a fuller understanding of the whole problem of 
home industry for the school child, and many will doubt- 
less be ready to make the necessary re-adjustments. The 
mother whose little daughter does absolutely no home 
tasks will be placed in quite as unenviable a light as the 
other one whose child is required to perform an over- 
amount of such work. 
A New Meruop or Grapina 
We are especially desirous of making this volume treat 
of the entire life of girlhood and young womanhood; and
-P-A-G-E-70
  46 Training the Girl 
in thought of this fact we wish to remind the reader of a 
new and very promising condition that is now arising in 
the most progressive public schools. It is this: There is 
now a disposition on the part of the most thoughtful and 
modern school officials to test the pupil in respect to every 
possible type of ability and to give credit for every worthy 
thing the pupil may be able to do. The old school nar- 
rowed the child down to a few book subjects and graded 
him high or low in accordance with his ability to pass in 
those subjects, while it gave little or no heed to ability 
that lay outside of the school course. But the new method 
calls for a much wider schedule of tests, and for a graded 
evaluation of the pupil’s home work as well as that of the 
school work. The girl who makes an average grade of 
95 in her several text-book subjects, and yet who never 
performs a single home duty is too often exalted above her 
true place in the school society. Some other girl who 
happens to make a very low average in her class-room 
subjects, and who at the same time proves to be a splendid 
home helper, is usually rated far too low in the ordinary 
school. In order to put a check upon this false and one- 
sided classification and ranking of pupils there is now an 
interesting and very commendable method of grading 
in home work as well as in school work. 
Let the parent turn over the monthly report card when 
it comes from the teacher, showing the grades made in the 
several subjects, and write on the back the grades for 
the course of home discipline offered below. Of course 
the child will not be doing all these home tasks at one 
time. And then, let there be made an average of the home 
and the school grades. This will probably give a much 
more fair and just rating for the daughter than is set 
forth by the class-room grades when standing alone. If 
one should desire to use figures instead of letters, then

There are two distinctive services to society to be de- 
rived from this new method of grading school pupils on 
their home duties. The first very desirable result is this: 
Common industry will become more and more respectable 
as an occupation; it will become a topic of schoolroom 
gossip; its various detailed aspects will receive thoughtful 
consideration; the teacher will fall into the habit of com- 
mending the various types of home industry; and the chil- 
dren will perform such work with credit. By slow degrees 
the shielded and spoiled and over-rated pupil—who is a 
mere book worm and non-industrial—will be placed in 
an unenviable position before the eyes of all the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-72
  48 Training the Girl 
Thus the epithets, “slow,” “backward,” “dull,” and 
the like may be made to apply to the child who is not 
mastering his home work as well as to the child who is 
not mastering his school work. 
Parents may as well get ready for this new order of 
things. We have long been regarding the schoolroom 
instruction as a matter of course and necessity. Expert 
authorities have prescribed the work there. Now this 
same systematic mode of treatment is about to be applied 
to the home industries suitable for the education and 
training of children. We have long been requiring the 
girl to pass in reading, grammar, arithmetic, history, and 
the other book subjects. We are now about to require 
her to pass in dishwashing, dining-room work, plain sew- 
ing, and baby tending. And when we have carefully as- 
signed this full course of study to all common school girls 
and have required them to make a creditable show- 
ing in all the subjects of the new course—then, we shall 
have performed a distinctive service for society at large. 
Thus the personality of the ordinary young woman of the 
future will have been made rich and deep in sympathy 
and service, full and strong in force and magnanimity, 
serene and poised through the inclusion of the higher 
things of the spirit.

CHAPTER V 
THE HIGH-SCHOOL GIRL 
Tue ideal young girl just entering high school is about 
fourteen years of age. She is sound in her physique, sane 
in her quality of mind, and buoyant in her thought of the 
future. She is radiant through and through and all over 
with a life that is just now in process of unfolding its best 
and most beautiful latent energies. She is at this time 
distinctively social in her thought and disposition. This 
is the period of the young love dreams of the girl, and a 
time when her personality, her point of view, her attitude 
toward life and things should be respected and deferred 
to more than ever before. If we can induce the reader to 
appreciate the great significance of the fact that the 
fourteen-year-old girl is undergoing a rapid transforma- 
tion; that she is stepping into a social world, new, strange 
and very enticing to her; that everything she thinks and 
says and does has some reference to this new-found world 
of society—then we shall all stand together in a position 
of great advantage in our serious attempts to give this 
young high-school girl fair counsel and guidance. 
Tur Dancer or ConFusION 
A freshman high-school girl is in the act of emerging 
from a period of mere giggling girlhood, and there is great 
danger of confusing her girlhood just now dropping away 
and her young womanhood just now emerging. We are 
likely at this time to require her to continue in the routine 
duties that fit her common-school age and to add to these 
50
-P-A-G-E-75
The High-School Girl 51 
the new requirements suited to the high-school age. Asa 
result of it all, not a little confusion and unfairness may 
obtain. Over-work and over-speeding too often mark this 
first period of young womanhood in the case of the high- 
school girl. 
Dr. Wm. P. Northrup of New York University, is 
quoted at length by the Literary Digest (Volume 32, 
Number 11), upon this subject of over-working school 
girls. He asserts that in one month the New York clinics 
for diseases of children and for the diseases of the nervous 
system “received a crop of worn-out school-girl neuras- 
thenics,” and by way of example on this subject he de- 
scribes a typical case of the ambitious student who is so 
often the victim of the strenuous school life:— 
“She hurries home from school, is never late, takes a 
few minutes of outdoor play because some one else has 
prescribed it, runs home, curls up, and studies hard till 
the evening meal. This meal she engulfs in the shortest 
possible time, slips off her chair, and is at her book again. 
She is the conscientious pupil, and studies until some one 
insists on her going to bed. ... This audience can 
easily imagine several physiological functions impaired 
by worry and haste, and some daily needs possibly post- 
poned till Saturday and Sunday. They will wonder where 
the dweller in crowded districts may, in such strenuous 
life, snatch a few hours of tranquil, daily recreation in out- 
door sunlight. They may wonder how the nerves in this 
strenuous existence are to be daily completely nourished 
and rested. Alas! such nerves are neither rested nor 
nourished, and they fall daily further into arrears. They 
may drag on till early spring accounting. In March is 
the Feast of St. Vitus. 
“Tt is well to reflect on the critical physiological changes 
which our little student between eight and thirteen years
-P-A-G-E-76
  52 Training the Girl 
of age is undergoing. She is manufacturing rapidly new 
cells; she is building great additions in bone, muscle, and 
glands; she is developing, training and disciplining her 
cerebrospinal and sympathetic systems; she is changing 
her milk teeth for tearers and grinders, preparing for 
heartier food. The adolescent girl is further developing 
a new function; is passing from infant life to maturity; is 
experiencing a change of such critical magnitude that all 
nature appeals to the generous impulses of human pro- 
tectors to lighten her burdens, to safeguard the best in- 
terests of the budding woman and future mother.” 
Is Tais Descrirtion Trun? 
In the article cited above, Dr. Northrup has described 
so ably and fittingly the neurasthenic high-school girl 
that we feel justified in continuing the quotation at greater 
length. He says:— 
“Do not put the subject away with the thought that the 
story of the overworked and under-nourished growing girl 
belongs only to a big city, to the tenements, and to the 
ignorant. Would it were limited to the last named; for 
they are most teachable and quick to reform. If you look 
to your choicest families you will often find them getting 
up late, that breakfast is late, that the father rubs his 
swollen eyes and scolds between his morning paper and his 
coffee because of this disagreeable rush and haste. His last 
night’s nerves are disturbed by his child’s early morning 
start. You will agree with me that in many of your most 
intelligent families the child’s life and duties are not the 
first consideration of the mother or father. The girl be- 
gins her first strenuous life in unsympathetic surroundings, 
gets up a high degree of momentum in the inertia. Only 
in Wall Street will nerves again be found so thoroughly
-P-A-G-E-77
The High-School Girl 53 
a-tingle. If this be the case with our best families, how 
much more is it true of the crowded tenements?” 
Waar is THE RemMEeDy? 
Finally, after a further description of how the over- 
strenuous school-girl brings on her alarming case of ner- 
vous excitement, Dr. Northrup suggests a number of very 
sensible remedies in the following paragraphs:— 
“Not one physician here present but can easily recall 
cases in which the girl, after six hours of school, practices 
one or two hours on the piano, goes to dancing-school 
twice a week, has some added lesson at intervals. On 
Saturdays there are children’s parties, matinees, and 
often children’s excursions for concerted studies of this 
or that. All these are well enough, but they leave the 
girl scarcely any time for relaxation and outdoor loitering 
or light exercise. From the first days of the term she has 
insufficient sleep, becomes deeper and deeper in debt to 
it, as a consequence of becoming more and more nervous, 
more intense, irritable, impatient. . . . 
“The subject of school hygiene is large, and I have pur- 
posely refrained from attacking it as a whole. Much is 
being thought out in the line of ventilation, air space for 
each pupil, and the like. My special interest is that of 
providing roof-gardens, where the children can play 
games in an upper air comparatively free from dust, from 
dangers of collision and accident of the street, and from 
the contact of vicious and unclean passers; or worse, those 
who do not pass—loafers. 
“The subject of dividing the time, so that the youngest 
children shall have short consecutive hours and frequent 
intervals of air and exercise needs consideration. This is 
now under collective investigation. In large cities where 
_ there is choice of two evils it is often better to corral the  
-P-A-G-E-78
  54 Training the Girl 
small children frequently and briefly than to leave them 
to roll in tenement halls or play under feet in crowded 
and squalid thoroughfares. . . 
“Tn many families there is a habit of sitting up late. . . . 
Children either sit up with the adults; or, if they go to 
bed, their early sleep is disturbed because of bright lights, 
noise and confusion. The family physician, in fathoming 
the causes of failing health, may well inquire among the 
details of daily life for explanation. . . . Further causes 
of worry to the child are the indiscreet conversations of 
the parents. At breakfast the disgruntled father utters a 
chance remark that the family is rapidly nearing the 
poorhouse, that all is lost. Having uttered it, he goes out 
into the open air, humming ‘Annie Rooney,’ and quite 
forgets what he has said. Not so his little girl. The un- 
meaning remark sinks into her mind, she broods over it, 
her breakfast does not digest, she furtively weeps, and at 
night sobs herself to sleep. This needless apprehension 
arises from a thoughtless remark which adults would en- 
tirely understand.” 
Cxorce or A Hicu-Scnoot Course 
The last few years have witnessed marked changes and 
differentiations in the high-school course of study. At 
the beginning of the twentieth century there was as a rule 
only one secondary course of study available for young 
people, and that consisted of a traditional arrangement of 
Latin, mathematics, literature, and a smattering of ab- 
stract science. But the new high school is succeeding 
more and more each year in making itself what it pre- 
tends to be, namely, an institution for the whole people. 
Instead of one course as formerly there are now many 
courses, each one arranged to suit the needs of some class 
of society. 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
The High-School Girl 55 
In consideration of what has just been stated the parent 
cannot reasonably be satisfied with having merely sent 
his daughter to be enrolled in the high school. He must 
help her decide what course to pursue, and in doing this 
he must consult first her individual taste and disposition, 
and second, her probable destiny as a full grown woman. 
No matter how attractive the place, how able the instruc- 
tor, and how well-equipped the school, the young woman 
will not make satisfactory advancement in her classes 
unless she be allowed to pursue some course that appeals 
enticingly to her inherent interests and desires. 
Wuat or Domestic MINDEDNEsS? 
It is probably a very serious error to assume that every 
healthy minded young woman is instinctively desirous of 
taking up a course leading toward domestic life. Although 
probably the great majority of them incline more or less 
strongly and even fondly toward some phase of the home- 
making occupation, it has been proved beyond a doubt 
that a considerable number are not instinctively so domes- 
tic minded. In his survey of the question of a prospective 
vocation for young women, the author has had occasion 
to question in a systematic way several hundred girls. 
A small number of these, perhaps five per cent, have given 
assurance that their inherent tastes never have been of a 
domestic type; and yet these girls have always been 
sound and well physically and mentally. A typical case 
of the type of young woman here under consideration was 
that of a twenty-year-old college sophomore girl who 
thus far had resisted all the persuasive efforts of her par- 
ents and friends to incline her training course toward one 
of domesticity. At least, at that stage of her develop- 
ment she was still firmly set in her purpose to work out a 
non-domestic, independent career. Very probably to 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  56 Training the Girl 
force such a girl to take up the home life would be little 
short of calamitous; and also very probably the carrying 
out of her native bent and determination was the only 
certain means of making her life a happy and successful 
one. 
Tue Course iv Housesoip Science anp Art 
Notwithstanding what we have stated immediately 
above, every normal girl should most probably have an 
opportunity to perfect herself in household science and 
art. A wide and careful observation of growing girls of 
all ages brings conclusive evidence that the great ma- 
jority of them begin in early childhood to show an in- 
herent interest in the affairs of the household. If turned 
loose and allowed to follow their own inclinations, their 
play and make-believe activities nearly always confirm 
this statement. 
But when confronted with the taking up of a high-school 
course in domestic science, the young girl may show an 
adverse disposition which has its history, not in her in- 
herent nature but in the fact that she has been more or 
less spoiled. If at fourteen years of age the girl has thus 
far never been trained in the simplest household tasks; 
if she has always been surrounded by servants and others 
who have been ever ready to baby her and satisfy her 
whims; if she has been taught to believe that household 
industry is degrading and beneath one of her station— 
in case of one or all of these acquired dispositions, the 
school girl may assume a very firm adverse attitude to- 
ward the course in home economy. 
Now, if the parent of such a girl as that described im- 
mediately above feels satisfied that his daughter will find 
her best life interest through the stimulating influence 
of a course in household economy, he may find it both

The High-School Girl 57 
advisable and practicable to take the girl to a school 
where this particular kind of training is emphasized above 
all others and where to pursue such a course will be the 
popular thing to do. Many a young girl has had her 
entire life transformed through such a change of place as 
the one here recommended. In the new and well-selected 
school of domestic training the adolescent girl really dis- 
covers another self than that upon which her attention 
has been fixed, and she soon makes out a new and enticing 
ideal for her future life. 
Common-Srensz INstrucTION 
It is an easy matter to assemble a group of “high 
minded” and ambitious high-school girls in a class to be 
instructed in fudge making and presiding at a pink tea. 
Moreover, these forms of instruction may be exceedingly 
important, but they are unquestionably the finishing 
rather than the beginning part in a course of domestic 
economy. But we take it that the serious-minded parent 
of the adolescent girl is anxious to have the daughter 
learn first of all the plain, simple household duties. Plain 
cooking, plain sewing, plain serving, and plain everyday 
living—these ordinary matters very probably constitute a 
fundamental part of the acceptable high-school course for 
nearly all young girls. And once the ordinary girl has 
had her life well defined and grounded in the principles 
of these common things she has certainly made all the 
necessary beginnings of a beautiful and happy career. 
Yes, there is ample room for music and poetry and 
flowers and fudge parties and pink teas for the girl who 
has been trained and grounded in plain, ordinary domes- 
ticity. And what is better, after such a fundamental 
course in household economy there accrues to the girl 
having mastered the course such a sense of inner worth,
-P-A-G-E-84
    
58 Training the Girl 
such a feeling of poise and self-supremacy, such a direct 
means of detecting and knowing and recognizing the true 
worth of character in others, that her entire future gives 
promise of becoming one of great joy and satisfaction. 
Tue Vocation Not OvERLOOKED 
We shall not overlook the very important matter of 
directing the growing girl toward the best available life 
occupation. An entire division of this volume is to be 
devoted to that particular matter. Neither have we over- 
looked those other important affairs that grow out of the 
instinctive disposition for play and sociability. These, 
too, will have ample space for treatment. For the present, 
however, our interest is centered upon two aspects of the 
high-school girl’s training: first, the directing of her ex- 
periences along lines suggested by her instinctive desires 
and dispositions; and second, the discussion of those 
problems which arise in practically all the high schools 
and vex and perplex both parents and teachers. 
We can scarcely over-emphasize the distinctive point 
of view and method of this volume. It is this: To find 
what is inherent in the young girl’s nature at every single 
stage of her development and to direct her training along 
the ways suggested by this instinctive type of prompting. 
The author’s faith in the ordinary girl—and that means 
practically all of the girls—is very deep and abiding. 
But it is his understanding that this faith in the inherent 
sublimity of the life of the common girl can be actualized 
only through the application of sane and well thought-out 
courses of training to every stage of her growth. Play, 
industry, sociability, vocational adjustment, service of 
one’s fellows and of the Supreme Being—these are the 
great ideals of training for any common life; and they are
-P-A-G-E-85
The High-School Girl 59 
great because of the significant fact that they are expres- 
sions of the inherent nature of the human individual. So, 
if the reader will bear with us to a greater length, we shall 
now go back to a further consideration of our chapter 
topic. 
Tue Hicu Scuoou may not Fit . 
A careful inquiry into the whole situation may satisfy 
the parent that it is inadvisable to send the daughter to 
the local high school or to any other institution of its 
class. But such a decision is most certainly a serious one 
and perhaps it should not be made until after expert 
advice has been consulted. The parent who is seriously 
in doubt as to the best thing to do next in the training 
of his adolescent daughter might receive very valuable 
counsel if he should write a brief sketch of the case and 
present this outline to such a high authority as Dr. G. 
Stanley Hall, and ask for expert opinion. Many high- 
school girls dislike some part of the prescribed course of 
study, while not a few of them resent certain text-book 
subjects to the point of quitting the institution as an 
alternative for pursuing such courses. Therefore, it is 
imperative that the parent and teacher co-operate in 
bringing about a pleasing adjustment of the girl to her 
high-school course. Her instincts and desires are now so 
strong as not safely to permit of any violence being done 
them through the medium of an artificial and enforced 
course of learning. If there be in the curriculum many 
subjects that are extremely distasteful to the adolescent 
girl, probably it will be advisable to have her withdraw 
from the institution and pursue a short course in some 
vocational-training school elsewhere. The vocational 
school for girls will be described in a chapter to fol- 
low.

  60 Training the Girl 
Democracy In THE Hicu Scnoou 
As stated above, the adolescent period of the girl is 
distinctively one of social awakening. It is what the 
author has called the first “‘who’s who”’ period of social 
development. The inner, secret mind activities of the 
girl are now predominantly social. This inherent ten- 
dency toward sociability has its correlate in a number 
of most significant organic changes. The girl is enter- 
ing the bright bloom of womanhood. The sex organs 
are assuming their full mature forms. The strong, fresh 
current of new blood is coursing through the organism; 
strong psychic feelings now pervade the entire being; 
many of the thought processes are now such as make all 
things new. These are all parts of those great living proc- 
esses which constitute a most interesting epoch in the 
miracle of life. Verily, the world might worship here at 
this great shrine of the adolescent awakening; for all of 
its song and its poetry, all of its sorrow and its tragedy, 
all of its beauty and its sublimity are traceable either 
directly or indirectly to this one mighty divine source! 
So let us go reverently as we proceed to give the adolescent 
girl counsel and direction for passing through this exhila- 
rating course of mystery and divinity. Let us go to her 
rather as a learner and interpreter, than as one who would 
drive and compel her. Appreciating then as we do the 
point of view and the instinctive nature of the adolescent 
girl; knowing as we certainly must that her native and un- 
spoiled tendency is to meet all on a common level of socia- 
bility, let us see what might be done to preserve this 
beautiful spirit of democracy during her high-school 
career. And as we approach our new task let us expect 
to find at first not a little that is crude and unrefined 
in the natural conduct of the young girl.
-P-A-G-E-87
  The High-School Girl 61 
Tue Spirit or Democracy 
In the last paragraph above, use was made of the word 
“unspoiled.”” Those who have studied human life at its 
fountain source are inclined more and more to the belief 
that children are thoroughly democratic in their first 
social tendencies. They are instinctively fond of play- 
mates but naturally give little or no heed to the social 
rank of the other children. The little daughter of the 
ruler of the empire or of the money king will play fondly 
and innocently with the children of the slums and alleys 
until the distinctions of dress and manners have been 
pointed out to her. One by one the flaws and imper- 
fections in the character and adornment of her playmates 
may be made known by the parents and at length she 
will have acquired a body of social sentiment making her 
conscious of her particular rank. Social distinctions are 
acquired more readily by some than by others but prob- 
ably all have to be taught how to make them. 
Now, it is not the purpose of the author to urge that 
there is naturally only one social rank. It is not his pur- 
pose to recommend that the parents try to make the grow- 
ing daughter continue to be a free and open associate of 
all ranks and classes of society. Social sympathy and 
genuine good will to all is rather the goal of our instruc- 
tion here. So, if the high-school girl has thus far been 
allowed to meet and greet all classes freely; if she has been 
taught to be courteous and kind to all; if she has been 
trained and disciplined through the performance of the 
ordinary household industry best suited to each year of 
her age thus far; if she has been taught to understand and 
to appreciate the full advantage of a genuine character, 
she will now be inclined toward democratic conduct in 
the high school.
-P-A-G-E-88
  62 Training the Girl 
So the beginnings of a substantial democratic character 
have in reality already been made before the high-school 
period is reached, and the process of training from that 
period on consists chiefly in giving the right sort of home 
counsel. The home problem here is largely one of inter- 
pretation. The daughter comes home with gossip about 
her school. She naturally has much more to say about 
the social conduct in the school than she has about the 
lesson topics. The parents’ chief part in the conversation 
is that of reminding the daughter—in indirect ways, of 
course—of the very great value of a genuine character 
within. For, after all, it is not so much the matter of 
what other girls say and do as it is a question of what. 
our own daughter is in point of personal worth. 
Tue Discrerine In One Home 
In the restrictive part of a city of about 250,000 people 
there stands a beautiful residence which must have cost 
$40,000 or more. The place covers half a city block 
and has all the ideal attractive appointments; as, shaded 
lawn, flower gardens, servants, automobiles, expensive 
inside furnishings, and the like. The occupants of this 
home consisted recently of the parents and three daughters, 
two of the latter in high school and an older one at college. 
The eldest child, a son, was married and gone. In spite 
of every suggestion of wealth and refinement, the father 
and mother of this family had somehow succeeded in 
inculcating a very rare spirit of democracy among their 
children. The mother’s account of the affair is substan- 
tially as follows:— 
“Yes, we have always believed in democracy. Mr. B— 
and I were both born and reared in very modest families, 
and we were taught from the beginning to earn our way
-P-A-G-E-89
The High-School Girl 63 
through hard work. These early-day lessons have perhaps 
helped us very much in the training of our own children. 
We have always required our children to do an honest 
amount of work. Our boy, during his growing years, 
raised a garden and took care of a horse and a cow. We 
taught him to buy and sell and how to save a part of his 
money and how to invest a part in his own affairs. He is 
now succeeding very well in business. 
“The girls have been trained in practically the same 
way as the boy. They have had instruction in every part 
of the home work, from plain kitchen scrubbing to fancy 
dining-room serving. Any one of the three can prepare a 
first-class meal and serve it to any kind of company. 
Our girls have never been over-dressed. We have always 
believed extravagant dressing to be wasteful as well as 
ruinous to character. We do not allow the girls to think 
of wearing anything other than plain and simple garments 
at school, the expense of which could be met by any par- 
ents who can afford to send their daughters to high school 
at all. 
“The girls have never given us much trouble about 
their social affairs at the high school. We desire to have 
them mingle with all of their classmates on equal terms, 
and to make their social distinction not on the basis of 
wealth and clothes, but merely on a basis of personal worth 
of character. One of the chums of our youngest girl is 
the daughter of a hardware clerk who lives in a four- 
room rented cottage. The next older daughter has close 
friendships with a number of girls of about the same 
financial rating. It has always been my personal opinion 
that over-dressing and too much home leisure are the chief 
causes of the foolish aristocracy that so often breaks out 
in the high school. But our girls have suffered from none 
of these faults.”
-P-A-G-E-90

  Tue Hieu-Scuoon Sucrer Society 
The secret organization has become such a perplexing 
problem of the high school as to assume the dimension of 
a nation-wide issue. Just now, while we write, this very 
matter is seriously disturbing the peace of a middle-western 
city. A rule of the school board forbids membership in 
any secret society on the part of the high-school pupils. 
A large number of the boys and girls of the school have 
just been found guilty of violating the rule and have been 
expelled. The affair is getting into the courts. Large 
sums are being asked as damages for defamation of charac- 
ter. And so the merry war goes on in this city, very much 
as has been the case in other cities and towns. 
Something is radically wrong here. There must be some 
understandable cause for the bitter contention that has 
been growing out of this high-school secret society in all 
parts of the country. Many of the states have passed 
legislative acts forbidding such societies. A very large 
number of the boards of education of the cities have placed 
heavy restrictions and penalties upon the same type of 
organization. Again and again the matter has been car- 
ried into the courts; and in every case known to the author 
of this volume the decision has been rendered in favor of 
the school authorities, and against the contention of the 
high-school pupils. Worst of all, the good name and the 
efficiency of the high school have been very much jeop- 
ardized. 
Keep tue Davcuter Out or Ir 
The large amount of recent inquiry and discussion re- 
garding the matter of the high-school secret society brings 
overwhelming evidence in favor of keeping the daughter 
out of such an organization. There doubtless are some few
-P-A-G-E-91
  The High-School Girl 65 
advantages to be derived from the membership; but all 
things considered, the disadvantages are unquestionably 
much greater. 
A careful examination of the personnel of the most ac- 
tive leaders in the high-school secret society reveals an 
interesting situation. These leaders are very often con- 
stituted of the boys and girls who have had much leisure 
and home spoiling, who have received too much and given 
too little. They are often those youths who have not been 
taught to soil their hands in plain work and industry, 
and who have been made to believe that they are being 
trained away from earnest toil and service toward places 
of ease and supremacy. Too often they have been imbued 
with the thought that there are comparatively few attrac- 
tive people in the world and that these belong to a special 
class; that this class has a kind of inherent right to be at 
the top and to rule and to walk over the rights and feelings 
of the common people. False notions concerning not only 
industry, but also wealth, clothes, and society lie at the 
bottom of this unending contention over the high-school 
secret society. 
The parents may easily train their daughter to experi- 
ence kindly feelings and sympathy for all classes in the 
high school. The girl may have her chums and her select 
groups for this and that affair, and yet, meet all who are 
worthy of such treatment on terms of a common level of 
good will and cordiality. Thus she will learn to believe 
that the best things in life should be and rightfully are 
common property; that there is nothing so especially 
good and rare that needs to be taken secretly into the pos- 
session of a few where it may be kept away out of the 
reach of the many. No, let us believe once for all that if 
the secret-society problem in the American high school is 
ever to be solved permanently the parents, and not the
-P-A-G-E-92
  66 Training the Girl 
teachers and the board of education, will solve it. The 
inculcation of the spirit of work and industry and of 
the spirit of plain, wholesome democracy, and all this in 
the school of home training—such will prove to be the 
method of success; and great, indeed, will be the final gain 
for common humanity. 
Tue Hicu-Scnoor Girw’s CLoTuEs 
Being as they are in the first exuberant social period of 
life, high-school girls are naturally very sensitive as to the 
kind and quality of their personal adornment. Not a 
little will be written upon the question of the girl’s wearing 
apparel in a chapter to follow. Suffice it to say here that 
the rule of training outlined in the quotation from the 
mother mentioned above may be regarded as the only 
sound and commendable one.

  CHAPTER VI 
SENDING THE DAUGHTER TO COLLEGE 
  Wira an overflowing pewmre f physical strength, 
with a radiant hope set high on the ideals of the future, 
with a secret sense of the charms peculiar to the first full 
bloom of womanhood, the typical freshman college girl 
ranks in a class by herself. Moreover, we might as well 
admit that the college girl is here to stay and that her 
tribe is likely to go on steadily increasing. Statistics 
widely gathered indicate that college attendance is not 
necessarily destructive to her health, that such experience, 
while it tends to defer the day of her marriage and to 
reduce the number of her offsprin, , greatly increases her 
opportunities for marrying well. Her means of inde- 
pendent self-support, though at best very much limited, 
are also much enhanced through higher education. 
Cuoosine THE Rieut Institution 
Of the many present-day forms of higher institutions of 
learning which admit women to their halls, the so-called 
co-educational school is apparently destined to assume 
the leading place. And well it may; for the scriptural 
saying that it is not good for man to be alone applies with 
equal significance to young women at college. That is 
to say, our modern society is inclining more and more to 
a general and free association of the sexes. The lower 
grades of the public schools are now thoroughly committed 
to the practice of educating the boys and girls in the same 
class room. Likewise, the standard high schools of the 
68 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  Sending the Daughter to College 69 
country receive the two sexes on equal terms, but segre- 
gate them in a number of the classes, giving each division 
the forms of instruction peculiar to its needs. While a 
few of the great colleges of the country—Harvard being a 
notable example—are still closed to women, the great 
majority of these institutions now provide a curriculum 
admitting of a three-fold arrangement as follows: (1) A 
large number of general and cultural courses open alike to 
both sexes and under the same instruction; (2) technical 
and special courses intended to prepare men for their ap- 
pointed vocations; (3) special and separate courses suited 
to the needs and natures of women. In an institution of 
this sort the sexes usually mingle on free and open terms 
of sociability and friendship. Now, this last stated fact 
counts for very much in the life of the man or woman 
to be, as we shall try to indicate. 
There are a few parents who so misjudge their children 
as to believe that an exclusive school for young women, 
in some isolated, out of the way place, will cause their 
daughter to forget her passionate fondness for the society 
of young men and to settle down as a sober-minded work- 
a-day member of the social community. But in the opin- 
ion of the author this plan is a very poor one to follow. 
A reconstructed and safe-guarded society at the co- 
educational school is better for bringing out a rightly 
balanced personality than is the exclusive institution. So 
we believe, and the discussion to follow will give sugges- 
tions for the social direction of the college girl. 
Setectine THE CoursE or Stupy 
As was recommended for the high-school girl, so is it 
now urged in behalf of the college girl, that she be given 
every reasonable opportunity to pursue a course in the 
household sciences and arts. In a graduating class at the
-P-A-G-E-96
  70 Training the Girl 
Kansas State Agricultural College in which there were 
seventy-five women, seventy finished the course in domes- 
tic science and art, and five the course in general science. 
This is a ratio of one to fourteen, and it is probably a fair 
index of the ratio that exists in other institutions. A 
somewhat careful inquiry into the motives and purposes 
of the girls who pursue the general science course has con- 
vinced the author that these girls are not at all eager for 
the household and home-life occupations. They are as a 
rule more or less interested in a career that makes for 
higher scholarship and independent self-support. But 
these are only exceptions to a general rule among college 
women, which shows an instinctive interest in the home 
life. It is a significant fact that the modern course in home 
economics is preparing so many young women for scien- 
tific home management, and the parent who gives his 
daughter the advantage of such a course should learn to 
think of her, not as one destined to take up the old- 
fashioned household drudgery, but rather as one pre- 
paring for a place of mastery and supremacy over these 
things. 
Presumably the freshman girl has not yet experienced 
the awakening of many of her best latent dispositions. 
She is in every sense a girl, but is by no means a complete 
woman. While it is advisable to have her take the train- 
ing in domestic science and art, this work should not 
constitute all of the course. Many of the institutions 
offer a so-called short course in domestic economy, but 
this is intended primarily for mature women, who are 
either occupying home positions or who are about to do 
so. The ideal course in homemaking, so far as the girl of 
freshman age is concerned, is a course which includes many 
collateral subjects. Advanced history, civics, economics, 
literature, language, psychology, sociology, music, physical

Sending the Daughter to College We 
training—these subjects are all properly related to the 
ideal college course for young women. 
If your daughter does not seem ready or willing to pur- 
sue the course in homemaking, then make careful inquiry 
as to her leading aptitude and interest. She may have a 
very strong predilection for music, painting, journalism, 
mathematics, physical science, or teaching. It will prove 
futile to try to make her what she does not instinctively 
desire to become. Rather seek to bring out and develop 
to a higher degree her best inherent abilities. Therefore, 
choose the course to fit your daughter’s nature, but do 
not turn her undirected into a large institution and expect 
her naturally to find. her way successfully through the 
most appropriate course of training. 
Ture Dancer Periop at CoLLEGE 
After admitting that we are gradually finding the mod- 
ern college course a better way to the solution of women’s, 
as well as men’s problems, it is none the less true that 
this way is still attended by many dangers to the character 
of the student. So it might be well to point out some of 
the possible errors into which the college girl is prone to 
fall and, if possible, to suggest a way of escape therefrom. 
A few young women are still in the silly age when they 
first arrive at the college doors. Indeed, it is almost 
startling to observe the large number of college girls who 
are still in their middle teens and not yet through with 
their period of giggling young girlhood—too much unde- 
veloped to judge safely as to what were good to do in 
respect to their mental, moral, and physical well-being. 
And then, one wonders if each of these girls has a mother, 
or at least some capable person who is exerting a subtle, 
wholesome influence on her life. 
Girls mature earlier than boys. The young woman of -
-P-A-G-E-100
72 Training the Girl 
eighteen is relatively as well developed mentally and 
physically as the young man of twenty-one. And then 
since women’s opportunities for obtaining suitable life 
work are much more limited both in extent and time than 
are man’s, there is apparent necessity for some haste in 
putting the young woman through her course of college 
training. Seventeen or eighteen is probably the ideal age 
for the girl to enter the freshman college class, as this will 
bring her out at about the age of twenty-one or twenty- 
two. 
A Cuanee in Artitupe or Minp 
It is exceedingly important that especially the last 
year of the young woman’s life in college should be one of 
much thought in regard to her future place in society. 
Indeed, if she continues to be a mere girl during the last 
course of training she will likely leave the college walls 
without having properly assimilated the knowledge ob- 
tained. Not infrequently girls who receive their college 
degrees at the age of nineteen or twenty have the peculiar 
experience of awakening a year or two latter to the thought 
of what it was all about. “I wish I could take my college 
course again,” said one. “If I could go back for a year 
or two you would see me doing differently,” said another. 
The foregoing remarks are typical of thousands who were 
graduated before they became real women, and before 
their thoughts became instinctively directed toward the 
larger problems of womanhood. ‘‘Home-mindedness” is 
the significant term that suggests itself here. The young 
woman who partly forgets the mere fun and frolic of the 
college society, who reflects deeply and secretly upon her 
place in life, and who is concerned about what she is to 
be and to do to prove worthy of that place—this girl, 
it may be said, is in the right attitude of mind to obtain the
-P-A-G-E-101
  
Sending the Daughter to College 73 
greatest assistance from her senior year in the institution. 
Home-mindedness is therefore the watchword for the 
senior girl. We commend this ideal to all parents who 
are earnestly engaging in the attempt to assist their daugh- 
ter to make the college life count for most as a prepara- 
tion for her own future. 
Prayine Farr with THE FresHMan GIRL 
One of the dangers that beset the more or less giddy 
young freshman girl is this: She is naturally inclined to 
take up with almost any well-dressed young man who 
will indicate a desire to know her. Her whole being is 
so aflame with the onward rush of physical life that the 
regular work of the class room may not appear to her as a 
matter of serious consequence. Love is her greatest 
reality. The society of young men—not necessarily very 
choice ones—is her greatest delight. And at this time, 
if ever in her life, she needs a ruler, a kind and sympathetic, 
but firm and unyielding personality to direct her footsteps 
aright. 
How many good and efficient home mothers fail in their 
efforts at long-distance government of their daughters at 
college! So if the absent girl in such a case be young and 
immature, we can think of nothing better than that the 
parent arrange for a confidential correspondence with 
some one of wholesome authority and influence, who 
knows personally of the daughter’s going and coming 
while in college. Indeed it may be said that every young 
girl living away from home is in need of a foster-mother. 
It is hoped that the day is not far distant when college 
authorities will see fit to select officially a “‘Mother,” in 
the person of some well-trained, sweet-spirited woman to 
whom the girls may go with their problems and perplexi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  
74 Training the Girl 
ties and receive that particular advice and encouragement 
which any case may require. Such a woman should be 
an ex-teacher and a mother of children of her own. 
Probably the chief difficulty in selecting the “college 
mother” for your absent daughter is that of finding a 
woman who possesses the peculiar marks of fitness. For 
the younger and more frivolous your daughter may be, 
the greater the need of an associate who is prepared to 
give sympathetic counsel and advice rather than one 
who is ready to force her decisions upon the conduct of 
the young girl. In suggesting this woman adviser for the 
girl we would not forget the very important principle 
stated in the beginning of this volume and adhered to, 
we hope, thus far—the principle that the inner prompting 
of the young girl’s nature is to be the guide and inspiration 
for her development. Hence, the suitable foster-mother 
will hang every desire, new motive and incentive some- 
where upon the instinctive cravings of the girl student 
under her protective care. This good adviser will not con- 
demn or blame or otherwise attempt to force her per- 
sonality directly in the way of the college girl’s instinctive 
purpose. Rather she will use mild persuasion and point 
the way out to something better and higher than the object 
pursued by her youthful companion. For example, the 
college girl is often inclined to be out too much at night 
and to go into associations that are not highly creditable. 
The wrong method of dealing with such a case would be 
to condemn the course openly and to write an alarming 
letter to the girl’s parents. A better way would be to 
reveal to the erring one a detailed outline of the social 
course pursued by the best girls in the college. Show how 
these ideal young women attempt to follow a systematic 
plan, how they remain at their rooms during the majority 
of the evenings for study and work, how they are over- 
   
-P-A-G-E-103
  Sending the Daughter to College 75 
guarded in respect to the choice of their social companions, 
and the like. 
The next step in a better course of procedure for the 
weak-willed college girl toward a more elevating and 
stable plane of conduct would be to assist her in finding 
congenial company at the better places in society. It 
often matters much as to how the young student gets 
started in his social experiences. A well-thought-out plan 
for bringing such a student into social groups that are 
directed by the church and the young people’s Christian 
organizations is a most commendable affair. 
Tue Cottece Home ror GiRLs 
A suitable place for the daughter at college is a matter 
of extreme importance. The dormitory system for girls 
seems to be coming more than ever into use of late, and 
it may be regarded with much favor. The fact that the 
youthful freshman girl rooms with “one of the best families 
in town” is no guarantee that this good home environment 
restrains her properly. It has been shown beyond a doubt 
that these “best families” usually hesitate to exercise 
any moral supervision over the girl roomer so long as her 
conduct does not reflect much public discredit upon their 
house. 
The desirability of a girl’s dormitory depends upon its 
management—whether it be for mere revenue or for the 
well-being of the whole girl. A small, sanitary dormitory, 
in charge of a competent, motherly matron, and regulated 
by the strict enforcement of a set of reasonable rules, is 
certainly a favorable situation for the frivolous sort of 
young college girl. Unfortunately the parent cannot be 
fully assured from the catalogue description of the dormi- 
tory and its management whether or not the place is 
altogether a desirable one as a college home for the daugh-
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 Training the Girt 
ter. As a means of emphasizing what was said above— 
about giving the girl a very careful beginning in her college 
career—it is here recommended that one of the parents 
accompany the daughter to the school and assist in secur- 
ing board and lodgings under the most desirable conditions 
possible. It is a beautiful thing to witness, that of an 
innocent and somewhat unpretentious seventeen-year-old 
freshman girl appearing about the campus for the first 
few days with her mother as an attendant. Only mothers 
can know the anxiety of a mother’s heart at this time, 
and those who have witnessed the spoiling of a promising 
young girlhood through careless college treatment can 
realize the full measure of responsibility that rests upon 
all concerned in such a case. So it is well, indeed, for the 
mother to go to the college with her daughter and live 
there with her during the first week. Such a thing seals 
the bond of intimacy between the two, and furnishes a 
common basis for much of the written correspondence to 
follow. 
Tue Lerrers rrom Home 
Probably there is no more beautiful and touching trans- 
action between two members of any family than occurs 
in case of the correspondence between the daughter at 
college and the parents at home. More frequently the 
home correspondent is the mother, but there is no just 
reason why the father, too, should not participate in 
this stimulating love-letter affair. ‘“‘Yes, we miss our 
girl very much, especially evenings, the time when she 
is always at her brightest and best among the family 
at home. But you should read some of the beautiful let- 
ters we receive from her. We know that something un- 
usual has happened if there fails to come in the Monday 
evening mail a letter from Elsie. Really, we did not know 
   
-P-A-G-E-105
  
Sending the Daughter to College 77 
how to appreciate her until she went away to college.” 
Such a testimonial as that quoted above speaks volumes 
in its ultimate meaning, for it serves as an assurance that 
the daughter is safe at college and that her progress there 
is such as to please and inspire all those remaining at home. 
On the other hand, it may be said that there is something 
seriously at fault in case the daughter does not send home 
often and regularly through the mails, a message of love and 
good cheer. And in case of a permanent correspondence 
in the course of which love and sympathy and open frank- 
ness prevail on the part of both parent and daughter, 
there is no serious necessity of a well-guarded college home 
for the girl. The commendable purposes of the student are 
too well set to require any direction or restraint other 
than that incident to respectable surroundings. 
Tue Cottece Sorority 
The results of a number of inquiries indicate that the 
sorority house is a safer place for the freshman girl than 
the fraternity house is for the freshman boy, although 
both are inadvisable until one has made a worthy record 
in studentship and morals. Perhaps the worst that can 
be charged against the college sorority is its tendency to 
exclusiveness and to build up a caste system and to impose 
financial and social strains upon its members. 
The sentiment of this volume is intended to be distinctly 
democratic. Although it must be admitted that every 
girl will naturally have her little group of confidential 
friends and companions, there is no very just reason why 
these should go aside and shut themselves in and bind 
one another into a group with pledges of secrecy. Indeed, 
goodness and beauty lose their very essence if we try to 
take them for our own selfish purposes and seclude them 
from the eyes of the others. Is it not true in a sense that  
-P-A-G-E-106
    78 Training the Girl 
the good things, this highly prized stock of secret pledges 
and purposes which supposedly binds the members of the 
sorority together—is it not true that these precious things 
would grow even more precious were they extended openly 
as a gracious gift to all who might wish them? Our chief 
objection to the sorority is that it is both ungenerous and 
undemocratic. It does not intend to offend the sensi- 
bilities of the girls who are not included within its little 
coterie, but as a matter of actual practice it does this very 
thing in a thousand-and-one instances during the course 
of the.college year. 
No, the foregoing statement is not intended as a word 
of condemnation for the sorority, but it is admittedly 
intended as a word of admonition to the parent. Keep 
your daughter out of the sorority, if you can. Make her 
democratic and generous-hearted, responding kindly and 
affectionately in thought of all whom she may meet on 
the campus or off of it. Say to her that you mean to have. 
her become a beautiful companion and social servant of 
all the divisions and classes of society, rather than of any 
one of these. 
Heauru-Imparrinc TRAINING AND EXERCISE 
Considering the outside duties that claim the girl’s 
time, the college career as a whole imposes many strains 
upon her health. While statisticians have figured it out 
that a young woman in college is as healthy in the average 
case as her non-attending sister—and she is probably 
much more so at the time of beginning her course—her 
health is often impaired during the four-year period of 
academic work. Hence the necessity of extreme caution 
in reference to overburdening the young woman student. 
It is not to be disputed that some of the most earnest 
and worthy college girls need protection against self-
-P-A-G-E-107
  Sending the Daughter to College 79 
imposed over-strains. They try to carry too heavy an 
assignment, and also to perform too many extra duties. 
In the first place, the class work assigned is such as to 
occupy about all the waking hours of the day, if done 
well. Then, on top of this are piled the dance or party 
once a week, the literary society, the athletic work, the 
Young Women’s Christian Association meeting and com- 
mittee work, attendance upon the lecture course, and a 
hundred and one smaller duties pertaining to the care of 
the person and the clothes. 
Under the stress of all the foregoing rush and hurry 
something must naturally break, and the physical health 
is not unusually the victim. From all outward appear- 
ances, the mid-week party, especially the dancing party, 
is hard on college girls. As a result of the tax on the 
physical strength, many young women are compelled to 
stay away from classes the day following. On the second 
day they return pale and wan and absent-minded. Col- 
lege authorities should insist that these parties be con- 
fined to the end of the week, so that time may be allowed 
for recovery. But it is not so much any certain one of the 
matters named as it is the sum of them that breaks down 
the physique and brings on mental distraction. Worst of 
all, many good girls are utterly unable to protect them- 
selves against the strain of the multitude of demands 
upon their time. So, it is unquestionably the duty of the 
college authorities and the parents to see that proper 
restraints and regulations are operative in the matter. 
SwatL THz Youna Woman Earn Her Way 
For thirteen years past the author has been observing 
closely the efforts of a considerable number of young 
women college students who earn their way wholly or in 
part while pursuing the course. As a rule, the attempt of
-P-A-G-E-108
  80 Training the Girl 
the young woman wholly to pay her own way through 
college is a more or less hazardous affair. Some few ac- 
complish this undertaking and come out stronger and 
more triumphant because of the rigorous discipline con- 
nected therewith, but in regard to the majority a report so 
favorable cannot be given. Unfortunately in many of 
the instances of young women working their way the 
parents are amply able to pay all the college expense but 
are not considerate enough to do so. Ignorance, penuri- 
ousness, and a false opinion as to what the college training 
of a young woman really means, may be attributed as 
causes of the parental mistreatment here. 
Let not our position be misunderstood regarding the 
matter of the college girl earning her way. It is this: If 
the father is amply able to supply the necessary means 
for his daughter’s college training and neglects to do so, 
some one should have the courage to take him to task 
about the matter. An interesting and blame-worthy case 
illustrative of the point here is that of a dry-goods mer- 
chant, worth perhaps a hundred thousand dollars and 
prosperous to the point of being entirely free from in- 
debtedness. The family of which he was head was rearing 
four daughters. The father contended that a daughter 
should earn her own way after reaching the high school 
age. He himself had done so from boyhood. He required 
his daughters to earn enough for their spending money 
and some extra clothing while in the high school and an- 
nounced the policy of requiring them to make their own 
way through college, if they wished to attend. These 
girls proved to be most courageous. The eldest struggled 
through her four-year course in five years, but she come 
out broken in health from the over-strain of doing a double 
combined duty of college work and housework. She was 
also much broken in spirit because of the fact that she 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  
Sending the Daughter to College 81 
was forced again and again to slip back and to be gradu- 
ated a year behind her own classmates. The second 
daughter tried the unsupported college career for one year 
and gave it up, being forced to take a rather menial posi- 
tion for self-support. This was really a pitiable and ag- 
gravating case and the more so because of the father’s 
condition and attitude as stated above. 
It is often justifiable to arrange matters so that the 
young woman may earn a part of her college expense 
money. She may help in some good home as a means of 
paying for her board and lodging. But as a rule this 
arrangement should be regarded as the upper limit for 
self-support of the college young woman. The home help- 
ing contract should include a statement as to the amount 
and time of the service. 
One of the most serious consequences of this program of 
entire self-support on the part of the college girl is this: 
She is denied nearly all of the privileges of the college so- 
ciety; she loses touch with the young men and young 
women of her class, and tends to fall into the habit of 
being sensitive about her appearance and manners in 
public. Worse than all the foregoing, she is likely to lose 
what is perhaps the most valuable opportunity of all— 
that of coming into close acquaintanceship with some good, 
sensible college man, who in due time may ask her to walk 
the way of life at his side. No, if it can at all be avoided, 
do not permit the young daughter to attempt to earn all 
the money necessary for supporting her during her four 
years’ stay at the institution.

Industrial Training of the Boy 
Decorated cloth, 12mo, illustrated, 50 cents net; postage extra 
There is no more important phase of boy training than that 
which is the subject of this book. Professor McKeever has ably 
demonstrated his ability to get the point of view of both the 
adult and of the child. His sympathy and understanding of the 
boy and his mature appreciation of those things which make for 
the well-rounded life peculiarly fit him for the task which he has 
essayed in the present volume. The Pre-School Development, 
The Public School and Adjustment, Vacation Employment, Se- 
rious Industrial Employment, and Sending the Youth to College 
are the main heads into which the concise but wholly adequate 
discussion is divided. 
“Parents will find here many excellent suggestions for the ap- 
portionment of the work and play of children of all ages and for 
the kinds of work to be used for the individual training of boys 
of different temperaments.” — Congregationalist. 
“On every page the author proves himself master of his sub- 
ject.” — Watchman-Examiner. 
“It discusses frankly, courageously, and wisely the whole sub- 
ject of efficiency in fitting boys for efficiency in the life they may 
lead if at their best.” —/ournal of Education, Boston. 
“A timely and thoroughly pedagogical and scientific work. 
- Sound wisdom, born of ripe and serious ret «is

“Tt will help you to work out a great many things and prob- 
lems that you now find yourself up against in regard to your 
boys.” — Ohio Farmer.

Comments on ‘‘ Farm Boys and Girls’’ 
“From the point of view of life, it is the most notable and useful contribu- 
tion ever made to agricultural literature.” —- DE WITT C, WING, Associate 
Editor Zhe Breeder's Gazette, Chicago. 
“ Professor McKeever in this volume produced a book which is an honor 
to himself and his college. The simplicity of the language almost blinds 
the reader to the immense amount of research necessary to the production 
of the book.” — Christian Work. 
“Professor McKeever’s ‘Farm Boys and Girls’ isa delightful as well as a 
scientific study of that always absorbing subject, the young person. It has 
appeared at the psychological moment and is a monument worthy of per- 
petuating his name if he had done nothing else. It is a practical book and 
we most earnestly recommend it to every farm father and mother, every 
rural preacher and country school teacher.” — Kinsley (Kansas) Graphic. 
“ There are 10,000,000 boys and girls enrolled in the rural schools of this 
country, and here is one of the finest books that could be placed in the 
hands of the parents and friends of these children. In this work, Professor 
McKeever is doing something of the highest value. He is an able running 
mate of President Butterfield. To such men this land is greatly indebted 
for their wholesome and inspiring work for the betterment of rural condi- 
tions.” — New England Journal of Education. 
“This book is worthy of a place alongside the family Bible in every farm 
home. It is dedicated to the service of ten million boys and girls who are 
enrolled in the rural schools of America. It should be read by every one 
of them, and it should be read and re-read by the parent of every child.” 
— Kansas Farmer, 
“The book should be read by all those who are interested in social and 
economic questions.” — Guardian, Manchester, England. 
“ Professor McKeever's book is a serious study of the problem of boys and 
girls in the country, and how it may be solved, It is really a Manual of Prin- 
ciples and Methods for Improving the Conditions of Life in Farming Com- 
munities. If adopted, country life would be made larger, fuller, happier, 
and more blessed.” — Living Church, Milwaukee, Wis.

some, practical, and inspiring treatise, touching every phase of the 
growing girl’s life. From beginning to end it is rich in methods, de- 
vices, materials, and suggestions such as can be used by any parent or 
teacher. The author’s varied experience as student and teacher of psy- 
chology, as public lecturer and writer in the entire field of childhood, 
and as an enthusiastic believer in the latest possibilities of the common 
child, are all clearly reflected in the work. Among the heads in the 
table of contents are the following: The Kindergarten Training, At- 
tending the Public School, Home and School Coéperation, The High-

Play, The School Girl’s Vacation, The Psychology of a Girl’s Clothing,

“A book of wide scope, offering advice designed to meet every 
phase ofa girl’s varied temperamental tendencies from childhood to 
womanhood. The author’s ideas are well founded, while the methods 
he offers are based on sound psychology, rather than beautiful but 
vague and indefinite theories.’ — Zhe Continent.

growing girl’s life. From beginning to end the book is rich in meth- 
ods, devices, materials, and suggestions such as can be used by any

Comments on.“ Training the Boy ” 
“There is scarcely a phase of boy life which is overlooked, and those who are 
responsible for boys will find suggestion, information, and guidance which 
will be valuable.” — Boston Watchman. 
“This is a large, attractive volume, which goes thoroughly into the question 
of training boys, the best way to do it, the best results to be had in such train- 
ing, and how to get these results. The work as a whole is admirable, sym- 
pathetic, and so thorough that there ought not to be any doubtas to its value 
and the excellence of its results when its inculcations are fairly carried out.” 
—Salt Lake City Tribune. 
“It has been said that Professor McKeever knows more about American 
boys than any other ‘boy fancier’ in the country. Certainly he demon- 
strates, at least, that he belongs in the class of those who have much definite 
and widely gleaned information about the rearing of boys. His new book 
is crammed with information about boys and pictures of them at their work 
and play.” — Columbus (OHIO) Journal. 
“«Tyaining the Boy’ is a book for all parents, It may be described as an 
expert attempt to apply to the problem of making boys into worthy citizens, 
the general principles of the famous Montessori method. It is not a fine- 
spun tissue of theory, but a practical discussion based upon common sense 
and wide experience.” — Minneapolis (MINN.) Journal. 
“The training of the boy from early babyhood through marriage and father- 
hood is exhaustively treated by Mr. McKeever in this book, Strong com- 
mon sense and sympathetic interest with the small boy are marked charac- 
teristics.” — New York City Club- Woman. 
“Fathers and mothers will find this work of great value in the training of 
their sons, for from start to finish the book is entirely unprejudiced, broad, 
sane, and suggestive. It is practically a compendium on the needs of the 
growing boy, from infancy to manhood.” — New Orleans Picayune. 
“ This is a crowded book, analyzing the boy and his needs, and what ought 
to be done for him, marvelously well. To review this book would be simply 
to write it over. I prefer simply to say to my readers: Here is a volume of 
wit and wisdom and timeliness.” — Chicago Unity. 
“A splendid, wholesome book which should be in the hands of every parent, 
It deals in an intelligent, vigorous way with that topic of vital social interest, 
the conservation of manhood.” — Cleveland Plain Dealer.

PREFACE 
There is a definite and growing need for instruction in art in 
the schools, due to the fact that many of the principles 
employed in art are almost universal in their application. In 
most of the common necessities of life art plays an important 
part; it is used in the selection and wearing of clothing, in the 
furnishing of homes, and in the practical work of the trades and 
professions. Aside, however, from the utilization of art 
products in ordinary, everyday needs and the employment of 
art principles in the construction of any worthwhile industrial 
product, there remains also to be considered the cultural or 
recreational value of art. This is evinced in the appreciation 
and enjoyment of all fine and beautiful man-made things. 
The present volume contains a fund of information on the 
subject matter and method used in art education. It has 
been written for the teacher and for the teacher in training. 
Inasmuch as departmentalized art instruction is generally 
delayed until the secondary school period, the book should be 
equally useful to the elementary school teacher of all subjects 
and to the special art teacher, supervisor or director. For the 
trained teacher the book will serve the purpose of a guide and 
reference work, while for the prospective teacher it will serve as 
a basic text in normal school or college.

  ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING 
OF ART 
CHAPTER I 
THE ART EDUCATION WE NEED 
* Modern industry is interested in art primarily from the 
commercial side. It seeks to obtain skilled designers, crafts- 
men and machine operators who can produce salable products. 
The manufacturer hesitates to put out forthe market a product 
that he thinks may not appeal to the average buyer. He fears 
lest he may over-reach the public taste. Although he ‘may 
employ a trained designer and trained craftsmen, he all too 
frequently declines to place on the market the most beautiful 
patterns that his designer produces. It is too often the 
manufacturer’s opinion that the products which are best 
esthetically will not be appreciated and purchased by the 
public at large. He fails to recognize that public taste is 
often superior to industrial taste, a condition which is destined 
to continue so long as ‘“‘industrial art’’ remains “‘in the clutches 
of the machine.” 
Long ago there was a time when fine art and industrial art 
were regarded as synonymous, Then all craftsmen were 
considered as artists and all artists were real craftsmen. Fhe- 
painter-was-a-cabinet.maker,-a-metal-worker; and-an-arehiteet 
alLat-thesame-+time,- It has been only in modern times that we 
have taken the artist’s paintings from the walls, placed them on 
easels, and regarded them as works of fine art.# Apparently 
the machine has been to blame for this change in the point of 
view, for it came between the artist and his art. Its first artis- 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-8

tic efforts were failures, for men had not learned its limitations 
nor had they realized its potentialities. 
We have at last come to realize that the machine is a true 
friend of art and that its very limitations may indeed consti- 
tute its saving grace. The tendency of the medieval crafts- 
man was to over-decorate, a crime of which the machine is of 
itself incapable. Under the dominating influence of the 
machine, the emphasis in art has most appropriately shifted 
back again from decoration to structure, from the ornamenta- 
tion of an object of utility to the entire creation of the object 
itself. 
If art is ever to assume the place in industry it once occupied, 
either the machine must be so improved as to meet the require- 
ments of the best design, or else the designer must learn the 
possibilities and limitations of the machine in order that he 
may adjust his design to the conditions without sacrificing any 
of its inherent beauty. 
It is most important that the modern designer of industrial 
products should possess a background of historic art informa- 
tion in order that he may work intelligently, adopting the best 
practice of all time, profiting by the errors and utilizing the cor- 
rect forms in new ways when occasion demands. It is only by 
this means that he can acquire a broad view of the best prac- 
tice. There is a tendency on the part of the skilled technician 
who is uninformed on the broader aspects of his art to make 
use of ancient forms directly rather than to see beyond them to 
their source in realism. The most interesting and the most 
beautiful designs of former times were inspired by nature. 
The modern designer who would contribute most to the art of 
his own country and time must in like manner return to 
nature for his direct inspiration for new forms. 
The excellent collections available in our modern art 
museums constitute an ever-increasing source for suggestive 
historic material which is of inestimable help to the designer in 
pointing out the paths that may safely be followed and those 
that should be avoided. These: historic examples should, 
therefore, be studied exhaustively and systematically. Unless 
the student approaches them with a definite purpose in mind,

other than a desire to copy or to modify, we may never hope to 
develop here in America an individual art that will be in any 
way an improvement over the art. of other nations. 
It is not enough that the prospective designer should be 
acquainted with design in the abstract. He must visualize his 
design in the two or in the three dimensions. He must feel 
his materials. He must realize their limitations and their 
possibilities. Proportion, structure, contour, and surface must 
be considered simultaneously with color and the arrangement 
of parts. 
» Education should seek ever to propagate and to perfect a 
superior type of art, should teach the public to appreciate it 
and to demand it and should train designers and craftsmen to 
achieve superior results. This training will involve the com- 
bined efforts of all types of schools. To this end, the ele- 
mentary school must contribute its foundation in drawing, 
construction, and appreciation; the intermediate or junior 
high school, its appreciation and semi-specialized information 
and skill; the senior high school, its deeper appreciation and 
more fully specialized information and skill; the evening school, 
its practical instruction for the workers employed during the 
day. The recent report of the Industrial Art Survey! indi- 
cates the need for day schools of industrial arts in which there 
is offered highly specialized instruction for the preparation of 
prospective designers and craft workers. In all types of 
schools much emphasis will need to be placed on materials and 
their transformation into finished products. 
Back of the entire system of art education there must be set 
up a thoroughly effective program of teacher training capable 
of supplying directors, supervisors, and special teachers for 
all of the types of schools enumerated above. Courses in 
drawing and handwork in the state normal schools will need to 
be re-organized to meet the new demand for instruction in the 
elementary grades; the two-year teacher training courses in

National Society for Vocational Education and The University of the 
State of New York in 1921-1922. The report entitled Art in Industry 
by C. R. Richards is distributed by the Macmillan Company, New York. 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
    12 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
our special art schools will need to be modified to meet the new 
requirement for supervisors in the elementary and secondary 
grades; the college degree courses in art education will need to 
be changed to include an emphasis of the industrial arts; the 
graduate courses will need to be permeated by the spirit of 
scientific art research. Special classes will have to be estab- 
lished for the training of teachers of vocational industrial and 
commercial art. Scholarships must be founded to enable the 
talented pupils from our secondary schools to pursue advanced 
work either in the special professional schools or in the colleges 
and universities. 
The importance of the work of the elementary school in the 
general scheme of art education is often underestimated. If 
the secondary schools are to function as they should, it is essen- 
tial that a thorough foundation be laid in the elementary 
grades. More industrial emphasis should be placed upon 
much of the instruction offered. A subject designed to meet 
the industrial needs of the esthetic side has already earned a 
place on many elementary school programs. This subject 
attempts to combine drawing and construction and then to 
motivate both by a subject matter relating to industry, for it 
must be remembered that art quality will never sell a product 
if the consumer is to remain ignorant of what constitutes the 
art quality in the products of industry. The standard of our 
“democratic American art” must be raised, that the man of 
moderate income may find pleasure and satisfaction in form, 
color, and line, as these are made use of in products of reason- 
able price. The elementary school subject of industrial arts 
treats of the transformation of the various common industrial 
raw materials into finished products. Try as we may to 
provide one subject in the elementary school course that will 
entirely take care of art instruction, we shall not succeed; 
to be taught effectively art must be included in all subjects— 
in language and in geography as well as in the subject of indus- 
trial arts. There must be created within the school an art 
atmosphere. 
Formerly there was much discussion about the value of 
nature drawing, object drawing, illustration, and construction

THE PLACE OF ART IN THE 
CURRICULUM 
  In the diagram the Arabic numerals refer to grades and the Roman numerals 
to content interests. The elementary school is general in its aims; the junior 
high school, exploratory and tending toward specialization, except for pupils 
electing the general course; the senior high school, special, except for pupils 
electing the general course. The heavy vertical line extending from the base 
to the center of the large square represents the common fund of information 
of the elementary curriculum. Specialization begins in grade 7 for groupsI, 
II, IV, V, and VI. Most of the art instruction in the]elementary school is 
included in the subject of industrial arts. It is continued in the junior high 
school as the subject of art, required of all. In the senior high school art is 
an elective subject except for pupils specializing in art (group IV) for whom 
it is required.
-P-A-G-E-12
  14 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
in the elementary school course, much as if these activities 
were ends in themselves. To-day all elementary handwork is 
considered as a means to anend. Drawing and manual train- 
ing have in our day had a rebirth in the subject of industrial 
arts which contains much of educational worth that was not 
present either in drawing or in manual training heretofore. 
There will of course still be nature drawing in the schools, 
but it will have a purpose; there will still be object drawing, but 
it will be made significant; there will also be illustration 
but the illustration will be filled with meaning and with pur- 
pose; there will still be construction, more of it than ever 
before. All this activity, however, will be carried on with a 
consciousness upon the pupil’s part of its pragmatic value and 
of its place in the great world outside the schoolroom’s walls. 
There will be more art, because art will come as the reward of 
spontaneous self-expression in a field sufficiently limited to 
make effective expression possible. 
In the intermediate or junior high school pupils should be 
given an opportunity to elect subjects best suited to their 
capacities. There is, nevertheless, a place for a generally 
required subject called art on the common program, art as 
a cultural subject to be included in the regular course with. 
English, history, science, mathematics, music, and physical 
recreation. 
Art as a general subject in the junior high school should have 
as its aim the dual purpose of acquainting the pupils with the 
masterpieces of the arts of all peoples and periods, and of 
furnishing a background of information and _ experience 
sufficiently practical to be of real value in educational and 
vocational adjustment. Instruction should be concrete, 
historic examples studied for the sake of comparison with 
modern works to the end that the esthetic principles governing 
the production of both may be discovered and application made 
of these continually in the carrying out of new products. The 
pupils will need to be taught that art value is in no way affected 
by rarity, period, age or source; that art value is determined 
esthetically, and that, in the eyes of esthetics, the art of ancient
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE ART OF EDUCATION WE NEED 15 
Greece, medieval France, and modern America is one and the 
same. 
As regards vocational and educational guidance, art must be 
studied not only as it relates to painting and sculpture, but 
especially as it is made use of in advertising, costume, jewelry, 
printing and publishing, furniture, wall paper, textiles, 
architecture, and the decoration of interiors, in order that the 
pupils may become acquainted with the opportunities for 
profitable and pleasurable employment that are offered in the 
so-called “art industries.” 
The general art course in junior high schools should represent 
the entire art field. It should aim to furnish a foundation in 
content and skill upon which the senior high school can build 
most effectively. The course should be based on specific art 
subject matter involving representation or perspective draw- 
ing, design including color, and some mechanical drawing and 
craft work. Pupils on completing such a course should be 
qualified to enter the advanced courses for which provision is 
made in the senior high school. 
Much valuable instruction in vocational art is already being 
offered in many of our cities in the form of advanced elective 
high school courses. Such an elective system admits of 
specialization to a considerable extent. The instruction 
offered is intensely practical, and the instructors are for the 
most part experienced commercial designers and craft workers. 
The time is not far distant when sequential required courses 
for senior high school pupils specializing in art will be the rule 
rather than the exception in the majority of our large cities. 
A six-hour school day in which half of the time is given to 
so-called “practical work” and the other half to general and 
related subjects, should place this art instruction on a sound 
vocational basis when judged by the accepted legal standards. 
General instruction in art is for the many, while special art 
training is for the few. A proper balance must be maintained 
between general art education on the one hand and special or 
vocational art training on the other. The universities must 
continue their researches into art theory andart history. Color 
must be measured scientifically, form represented with absolute

careful accuracy. Books setting forth the results of these 
“higher” investigations will need to be written in non- 
technical language that all can understand. @ oo Questions for Study and Review

CHAPTER II 
EDUCATIONAL VALUES IN THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
All art is both fine and industrial, or it is not art at all; it is 
made up of two parts, one of which we usually term fine and 
the other of which we usually term industrial. All art is both 
mental and physical, intellectual and material, spiritual and 
scientific, be it painting, architecture, sculpture, manufacture, 
music, or literature. This unity in art itself should demon- 
strate the practicability of union in all art instruction in the 
schools. 
In a recent issue of the New York Times, Frank P. Graves, 
Commissioner of Education in the state of New York, empha- 
sized the proposition that education should make provision 
for systematic study and experience in the arts. He said as 
follows: ‘‘What the schools should teach depends on the aim 
or purpose of the school. If the school is ‘primarily an intel- 
lectual agency’ it will fail to meet social needs. It must 
include not only the so-called cultural studies, but also some 
acquaintance with the fundamental arts and activities of the 
social group. Unless through these we are able to transmit 
worthy ideals and attitudes to the next generation, the school 
fails of its function. It is the most fundamental social 
institution in a democracy.”? 
All adequate plans for the industrial arts include elements 
from the fields of manual training and fine arts, so-called, and 
they aim to provide for the public elementary and secondary 
schools instructional content and experience which shall be of 
maximum educational worth. ‘Educational value,” writes 
Frederick G. Bonser, in his Fundamental Values in Industrial 
Education, ‘‘is value in controlling conduct. Anything which 
helps to shape one’s habits of thinking, one’s standards of 
ma Frank P. Graves in The New York Times for March 18, 1923. 
17
-P-A-G-E-16
  18 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
appreciating or one’s bases of choice has educational value in 
a degree measured by its influence for good in one or more of 
these directions.”! The strength of the New York State plan 
for industrial arts education consists largely in its adherence 
to the doctrine that all work in drawing and construction must 
contribute to the pupil’s personal and social efficiency at the 
time when the instruction is given. 
Since the teaching of industrial arts in the schools cannot 
cover effectively the fields of industry and art but must concen- 
trate on problems of immediate value to the pupils, it follows 
that such teaching must function largely through the projects 
that the pupils undertake. An industrial arts project consists 
of a complete series of lessons which has taken into account 
the necessary thought content, drawing, construction, and 
art to the end that the general development of the pupil is 
assured. Handwork should be the result of a definite purpose 
calling for it. Selection of problems and of activities should 
always be made on the basis of the general educational values 
as opposed to the restricted training values. 
The project method of instruction should be accepted by 
teachers as the inevitable method to be followed in the teaching 
of industrial arts, for it is concerned with reasoning and other 
thought processes which in themselves guarantee educational 
value. A proper use of the project method of instruction pre- 
supposes adequate training on the teacher’s part, and it 
includes such things as problems, investigations, assignments, 
reference reading, lesson plans, and textbooks. If other sub- 
jects are worthy of systematic organization and of sustained 
intellectual effort on the teacher’s and the pupils’ part, the 
subject of industrial arts is also worthy of them. 
Some of the ultimate, general objectives to be realized 
through the teaching of industrial arts are health, efficient 
home membership, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and 
ethical character. Some of the immediate, special objectives 
appropriate for the six elementary school grades, include 
appreciation of art; industrial intelligence, through understand-

College, Columbia University.
-P-A-G-E-17
SOME EDUCATIONAL VALUES 19 
ing the things of the environment which have resulted from 
man’s transformation of the raw materials about him into 
finished products to meet the need for food, clothing, shelter, 
records, utensils, tools and machines, light, heat, and power;! 
taste, through the making of choices of materials and products 
of art and industry, with reference to justified ideals.2 The 
subject of industrial arts sometimes furnishes motivation for 
the entire elementary school course of study. 
Several factors have contributed to the present interest in 
the elementary school subject of industrial arts, among which 
are the needs of all boys and girls for some knowledge of indus- 
trial life and of art principles that will function in the choosing 
and appreciation of industrial and art products. Other factors 
contributing to this interest are the utter absence of handwork, 
other than drawing and applied design, from many school 
courses, the lack of thought-provoking instruction, the formal 
character of the presentation of instruction, and its isolation 
from the experiences of life outside of school. Interest on the 
part of teachers has manifested itself largely in a demand for 
information such as detailed outlines of instruction, books, 
and other reference material. Mention should also be made 
of the ever-increasing number of instructors in attendance, 
especially during the summer months and at other times, in 
extension courses at those teachers’ colleges and normal 
schools that give most attention to the industrial arts. 
The ideal elementary school course of study is, perhaps, 
one in which the entire curriculum is administered on a plan 
of perfect correlation of the various subjects. In such a course 
the inspiration for industrial handwork is adequately furnished 
by the other subjects. The mission of industrial arts in such a 
scheme would be primarily the providing of illustrative and 
creative handwork. There is no race, no political division, 
no literature, no history, no science which is not intimately 
associated with the topics included in the industrial arts

  20 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
course. This means that in the elementary grades, at least, 
industrial arts as a subject is at the disposal of all 
other subjects. 
Greater educational returns have, therefore, been realized 
where elementary industrial arts has been taught as a general 
subject by the regular grade teacher and where special super- 
vision, if employed at all, has been constructive, suggestive, 
cooperative in the broadest sense, and enlightened by educa- 
tional method. Under such administration industrial arts has 
never failed to become an integral and important part of the 
elementary curriculum. Marked progress has been made 
both in content and in method in the schools where teachers 
have been least hampered by tradition and have in consequence 
made considerable use of the project method of instruction. 
Objectives appropriate to the seventh, eight and ninth, 
or junior high school grades, include those enumerated for the 
elementary school. In the junior high school skill becomes 
an important objective, although it is not stressed as one of 
the major aims. 
Industrial arts as a junior high school subject for boys may 
be considered as manual training made broadly educational. 
Dealing as it does with the transformation of raw materials 
into finished products, it not only necessitates planning, draw- 
ing, and constructing, but it involves a sufficient amount of 
related information to make all of the activities engaged in 
significant to the pupil. It is apparent to all who have given 
the matter serious thought that in the so-called practical work 
of the junior high school period special emphasis should be 
laid on educational and vocational guidance. Instruction on 
the other hand should acquaint the pupils with the advantages 
and disadvantages offered in the various industrial 
occupations. 
Among the industrial groups which are perhaps best adapted 
to instruction, may be mentioned the metal trades, the building 
trades, the electrical trades, and the printing trades. In one 
type of special vocational schools, the general industrial school, 
these groups are presented so as to enable the pupils to acquire 
a sufficient amount of usable experience and skill to make their
-P-A-G-E-19
  SOME EDUCATIONAL VALUES 21 
immediate entry into industry possible. In another type, the 
unit trade school, the pupils are prepared to enter a specific 
trade. 
From the facts already given it will be seen that education in 
industrial arts in the common school is quite different from 
trade training in a vocational school. In junior high school 
industrial arts, instruction is best organized about certain 
specified types of work rather than about groups of trades. 
The following list of topics is indicative of the scope of the 
field: printing, wood-working, painting and decorating, con- 
crete work, brick and tile work, drafting, arts and crafts, 
electrical work, textiles and clothing work. 
Junior high schools in the larger cities may well provide for 
at least five types of work. The following distribution of 
these over the three years of the junior high school period is 
offered as suggestive; Grade VII, composite shopwork, includ- 
ing a variety of activities; Grade VIII, printing and wood- 
working or electrical work; Grade IX, metal working and 
concrete construction. Village schools, with a single shop, 
may confine their pupils to a maximum of three types of work, 
one type for each of the three years of the course. 
The work of the senior high school is prevocational in 
character and is preparatory to specialization in technical 
school and college. The special educational objectives appro- 
priate for senior high school courses include all of those 
enumerated for the junior high school. In New York State 
provision is made for offering, in the larger centers of 
population, and in the traditional four year high school, wnzt 
technical courses which are decidedly vocational in aim. Such 
courses are not considered as coming within the range of the 
industrial arts field. 
In addition to the general work in art common to all 
secondary schools, often required in the junior high school, 
and elective in the senior high school years, specific instruction 
in art should be given continuously in connection with all types 
of industrial arts work. There is an art side to each of the 
industrial arts, for, in the last analysis, art may be said to be 
realized in any worth while productive job done well. The
-P-A-G-E-20
  22 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
subject of industrial arts may be considered as consisting of 
three parts—art, science, and economics; a combination in 
which “‘the greatest of these” is art. 
In this connection art should be regarded as involving self- 
expression which may prove to be self-realization for some of 
the pupils; it may be made to open up unexplored channels for 
the free exercise of the creative impulse; it also necessitates 
activity and continual practice in which are employed the 
principles underlying proportion, construction, color, appreci- 
ation, and taste. 
Science consists in knowing how; without it art could not 
flourish. It has to do with the explanation of the natural laws 
of physics and chemistry. It is also concerned with methods 
of work and with the technical principles of mechanics and 
esthetics which enable one to make correct choices of 
products. 
Yet art and science are of little value in this big educational 
problem if their significance is not to be transmitted to the 
pupil. Economics as a phase of industrial arts provides a 
rational or significant basis. It acquaints the pupil with the 
“what it is all about” phase. It justifies the art and the 
science by calling attention to their importance in a work-a- 
day world; it acquaints the pupils with facts of social import, 
and it ties up the instruction with related geography, mathe- 
matics, history, and literature. Ulimately the whole field of 
vocational possibilities and opportunities is opened up to the 
pupils.

  CHAPTER III 
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROGRAM 
A considerable body of subject matter relating to the 
industrial arts, has been crystallized into a school subject 
which has been defined by Professor Bonser of Teachers Col- 
lege as “‘the distilled experience of man in his resolution of 
natural materials to his needs for creature comfort, to the end 
that he may more richly live his spiritual life.”! This defini- 
tion provides for instruction in the arts motivated largely by 
industrial and social interests. Industrial arts is a cultural 
subject with emphasis placed quite largely upon the art ele- 
ment in industrial operations and industrial products. 
The instructional topic is generally chosen from the 
industries most useful to man, the products of which might be 
arranged in groups classified under the following heads: (1) 
food, (2) clothing, (3) shelter, (4) records, (5) utensils, (6) tools 
and machines, (7) light, heat and power. 
The topic of food includes the transformation of cereals, 
fruits, vegetables, milk, meats, eggs and fish; clothing, the 
transformation of wool, cotton, linen, silk and leather; shelter, 
the transformation of wood, stone, metals, clay, and cement 
to meet man’s needs for homes and public buildings (this 
topic relates to architecture); records,? the transformation of 
wood, leather, metal, textile materials, and pigments to meet 
man’s needs for books, printed products, painting and sculp- 
ture; utensils, the transformation of metals and of non-metallic 
earth material, used for the most part for domestic purposes; 
tools and machines, the production of implements used in 
1 Frederick G. Bonser, in “Some Fundamental Values in Industrial 
Education.” 
2 This topic includes all products in which the art element is isolated; 
ie., those whose function is purely esthetic, as, for instance, painting 
and sculpture.

manual labor, and the more complicated mechanical devices 
called machines; light, heat and power, the transformation of 
natural materials and natural forces for the production of these 
commodities. 
The raw materials made use of by the industries suggested 
in the preceding paragraph may be classified as animal, 
vegetable, metal, non-metallic earth material, and natural 
forces. ‘ 
The industrial topic once chosen, the class is put to work 
investigating and collecting information from all possible 
sources. Much of the material will be obtained through actual 
contact with those who are engaged in the industry or who 
handle its product. Many facts may be gleaned from supple- 
mentary readers and reference books. The topic to be 
considered will depend upon the information available and 
the ability of the class. The following suggestions will be help- 
ful to the teacher who desires to secure rather complete infor- 
mation on the topic chosen:! (1) the value of the industry to 
man; how we are affected by it; (2) the evolution of the indus- 
try, its story, its heroes of invention (history); (3) character- 
, istics of the product; what constitutes excellence; (4) materials 
employed; where they come from (geography); (5) processes 
involved; (6) tools used; (7) healthfulness (hygiene); (8) hours 
and wages; (9) the training of the workers; (10) the part played 
in the industry by the various school subjects; (11) the part 
played by drawing and design; (12) references to the industry 
found in literature; (13) the industry as depicted in painting 
and sculpture. 
Art instruction is amply provided for, yet art will not be 
considered as it has sometimes been in the past, an end in 
itself. The subject of industrial arts provides systematic 
instruction in art, including color, form and arrangement as 
such, together with the principles of art as these are involved 
in each industrial topic chosen. Masterpieces in painting 
and sculpture considered as records made by man at various

for each topic but in order that choice may be made from the topics 
enumerated.

times and under varying conditions, will therefore be treated 
from the esthetic side. 
The handwork recommended is based upon the subject 
matter studied and is of two kinds: (1) drawing, including color, 
representation and design, (2) construction, including the prep- 
aration and combination or assembling of materials. It 
must be remembered, however, that all school-made products 
are to be considered as means of expressing ideas and feelings 
obtained from a study of the activities and not merely as pieces 
of handwork to accompany the various studies. 
Certain points of, emphasis in art education are today 
accepted by most teachers as reasonable and vital. These 
may be summarized as follows:! 
Coor 
(Reflected Light) 
1. Typical hues identified and their names learned in order: red, yellow, 
green, blue, purple. 
2. Intermediate hues identified and their names included in the list of 
color names: red, yellow-red (orange), yellow, green-yellow, green, 
blue-green, blue, purple-blue, purple, red-purple (related colors). 
3. Values of color (light and dark). 
4. Chromas of color (weak and strong). 
5 Complementary colors (producing gray) as red and blue-green, yellow 
and purple-blue, green and red-purple, blue and yellow-red, purple 
and green-yellow. 
6. Balance of color (attractions.) 
Form 
(Line and Mass) 
1. Imaginative drawing (free expression of ideas suggested by the 
imagination). 
2. Illustrative drawing (stories and facts illustrated; somewhat directed). 
3. The silhouette (height and width). 
4. Third dimensions (height, width, thickness). 
5. Foreshortening (apparent narrowing from front to back). 
6. Convergence (apparent coming together or receding parallel lines). 
1The figure in each case refers to the corresponding grade number; 
that is, 1 to grade 1, 2 to grade 2, ete. Instruction is considered under 
the headings: Color, Form, Arrangement, Lettering, Construction and 
Appreciation. These points of emphasis are adapted from Art Education 
by Henry Turner Bailey. Sce Bibliography at the close of Chapter IV.

  28 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
The points of emphasis are above applied to art instruction 
as used of in connection with all school subjects. Supervisors 
and teachers of elementary industrial arts would do well to 
commit to memory the outline in an abbreviated form as 
follows: 
Cotor Form ARRANGEMENT 
1 Typical Imaginative Order 
2 Intermediate Illustrative Rhythm 
3 Values Silhouette Balance 
4 Chromas Third dimension Space 
5 Complements Foreshortening Variety 
6 Balance Convergence Adaptation 
Lerrerine ConstRucTION APPRECIATION 
1 Cut One inch Acquaintance 
2 Drawn One-half inch Familiarity 
3 Independent One-fourth inch Identification 
4 Bold type One-eighth inch Interpretation 
5 Lower case Views Choice 
6 Ink Working Significance 
Although these points of emphasis are for use in all subjects 
where art is involved, they have a particular significance in 
industrial arts in which subject each is used especially in its 
relation to the choice of industrial products, their arrangement 
and appreciation. 
Grade teachers should at least familiarize themselves with 
the points of emphasis for their respective grades. A first 
grade teacher should know the six key words (Typical, Imagi- 
native, Order, Cut, One inch, Acquaintance) and their signifi- 
cance for her grade; a second grade teacher should know the 
six key words (Intermediate, Illustrative, Rhythm, Drawn, 
One-half inch, Familiarity) and their significance for her grade. 
Progressive teachers will supply themselves with facts 
concerning related subject matter, materials, processes and 
possibilities of correlation; they must possess above all the abil- 
ity to form judgments as to the relative importance of teaching 
materials in order that they may be able to select the educative 
elements and to disregard those of little importance, Thus 
they will place before their pupils a properly balanced subject 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROGRAM 29 
contributing to the effectiveness of all other subjects of the 
curriculum. 
The work will be best administered where a period is devoted 
to the subject daily. In some schools, however, this may be 
temporarily impossible for various reasons, the most important 
of which are: (1) lack of provision for the subject in the pre- 
scribed course of study and (2) lack of time. It must be 
remembered that in some of our small country schools a single 
teacher is still put in charge of six and sometimes eight grades. 
Instruction in industrial arts should give pupils a sufficient 
knowledge of things industrial to enable them to discriminate 
between the various works of artist and artisan and to appre- 
ciate and enjoy their masterpieces. Such an ability will be 
brought about: 
1. By investigating the environment in which such products are made. 
2. By making drawings to illustrate forms, facts and operations. This 
will clarify ideas. 
3. By manipulating the materials from which the articles are made. 
This includes structural design. 
When creative activities involving the manipulation of 
materials, whether concerned with representation, design or 
construction, are undertaken, they may serve the purpose of 
clarifying or of emphasizing ideas based on the content. In 
real life it is seldom possible to separate planning from making; 
both are involved in a completed product. Thus in the sub- 
ject of industrial arts, drawing and construction unite with 
industry study to make a single educational unit. 
Pupils should investigate and manipulate as great a variety 
of materials as possible. There is no reason why clay, portland 
cement, plaster of Paris, wood, glass and metals should not 
each perform a prominent part in the school course. Paper 
and textiles have been employed almost exclusively heretofore 
in some elementary schools. Yet it must be remembered that 
the thought content involved in work of this kind is perhaps 
the most important consideration. Manual exercise must be 
made valuable by being made significant.

AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROGRAM 31 
The matter of organization and presentation of this content 
is worth thoughtful study, for the life interests of the child 
must constitute an important consideration both in the organ- 
izing and in the presenting of all subject matter. The child is 
not interested in an industrial process because it illustrates a 
point in question. He is interested in it because it enables 
him to make something for which he has an immediate use. 
Edwin L. Taylor of the Plattsburgh State Normal School has 
said that ‘‘unless the activities arising out of the educative 
content of industrial arts provide the means whereby the 
child’s creative impulses may be satisfied, no matter how 
perfectly they may clarify and illustrate industrial processes, 
they will only inform—they cannot educate.” 
There are activities sometimes undertaken in courses in 
“public school art” which can hardly be justified when meas- 
ured by the broader educational standards, while there are 
other activities which might well be replaced by those of 
greater worth. The question should not be, Is this work worth 
while? It should be rather, Is it the most worth while? 
Reference is made specifically to the painting of landscapes 
and to the drawing of flowers where the end has been execu- 
tion pure and simple and the work done merely for the sake of 
the acquisition of skill, for the finished product, or for the 
remote general aim of developing the esthetic emotions. 
Under certain conditions there might be no activity more 
educative than the painting of a landscape or the drawing of a 
flower. A pupil may well draw a flower as a part of the nature 
study lesson (this is nature study),' or a map or a landscape as 
a part of the instruction in geography. 
_The-suecess of the work will depend in a large measure upon 
thé” carrying out of instruction based upon well-established 
eory. The following principles are offered with the confi- 
dence that they meet the requirements of good practice. They 
will be found helpful in planning a course of study.” 
1 The time for drawing in connection with nature study or geography 
or language should be taken from the nature study, geography, or 
language period.

1912, at Teachers College, Columbia University. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  32 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
1. The course is the same for all pupils regardless of race, sex, social 
standing, or future occupation. 
2. Its aim is the development of social intelligence and appreciation 
through understanding the things of the environment which have 
resulted from man’s transformation of the raw materials about him into 
finished products. 
3. The primary object of the course is not the cultivation of technical 
skill, although some degree of efficiency will result from a proper grada- 
tion of the work and from careful teaching processes. 
4, The topics around which the course is organized are: how the 
race feeds itself; how the race clothes itself; how the race houses itself; 
how the race provides utensils; how the race puts itself on record; how 
the race provides tools and machines; how the race produces light, heat 
and power. 
5. Some of the more important materials of the course are animal 
materials as raw foods, fibers, cloth, paper, leather; vegetable materials 
as raw foods, fibers, cloth, paper, wood; metals as lead, iron, aluminum, 
silver, gold, brass; nonmetallic earth materials as salt, sand, clay, coal, 
oils; natural forces as wind and moving water. 
6. The handwork is for illustrative and creative purposes, giving 
insight through participation and power through construction. 
7. Subject matter includes in addition to the art phase as such the 
story of the growth of the race in transforming raw materials, from 
primitive to modern methods; the simpler principles involved in tool 
processes and the influence of the industries on the life of the people, 
with constant connection with related literature, history, geography, 
arithmetic, and nature study. 
8. If the school program is properly adjusted, such a course will 
greatly vitalize the other subjects of the curriculum, in many cases saving 
much time through correlation. 
9. The course is cultural, having an intimate relation with the life 
experience of the race as shown in its art expression in pottery, textiles, 
basketry, metal and woodworking, and as reflected in its painting and 
sculpture. 
10. The course may utilize all the materials formerly made use of in 
the subjects of drawing, manual training, sewing, and construction work 
still found in some elementary school programs. Drawing, sewing, and 
shopwork may be appropriate distinct subjects for grades above the 
sixth, but it would appear that the one subject of industrial arts makes for, 
greater efficiency in the elementary school.        
     
    
    
  Under the topic of records, the unit Books and Printed 
Products might be considered in a school where no provision| 
is made for industrial arts as a subject. In this instance 
the purpose must be accomplished through making this stud,
-P-A-G-E-31
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROGRAM 33 
a part of most school subjects. The following studies, then, 
would take care of various portions of subject matter as speci- 
fied in this outline. The handwork should be done in the time 
allotted to the subjects themselves and during study periods. 
Reading.—The story of the evolution of records is presented. 
(If reading books containing this story are not at hand the 
teacher may write the story in brief form on the blackboard in 
order that the children may have practice in reading script as 
well as printed matter.) The children read material brought 
to class, the contributions consisting of newspaper clippings, 
magazine articles, etc., relating to books and printed products. 
Language.—The teacher reads or tells the story of Gutenberg 
and his printing press.!_ The story will furnish inspiration for 
discussions relating to movable type, picture reproduction, 
bookbinding, etc. Compositions describing a visit to a 
nearby print shop are written. Letters are sent to publishing 
houses asking for examples of color printing, etc. A small 
book is made by the children. It contains a written story on 
the subject of books and printed products. It is illustrated 
by means of pictures clipped from magazines and newspapers 
and by drawings made by the children. The designing of a 
cover for this book will furnish an opportunity for expression 
in applied design. 
Spelling.—A list of new and difficult words is made. The 
words are chosen from stories read, and relate to the industries 
which have to do with books and printed products. Some of 
the words are collected at the print shop visited. It is 
suggested that the pupils make dictionaries in which the new 
words are arranged alphabetically. Words are added as the 
work progresses. 
Arithmetic.—An investigation of value as applied to paper 
and books. A comparison of the value of the raw material 
with that of the {finished product. Problems in arithmetic 
based upon this idea. Quantities of material needed in the 
making of books of various sizes. Units of measure employed 
by the printer and the stationer, and application of these facts 
1See ‘Historic Inventions” by R. S. Holland. This book is listed 
in Chapter IV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
34 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
to problems in arithmetic. The cost of manufacturing, 
including wages, with problems based upon the same. 
History.—How were records kept at the period in history 
which is being studied? A comparison of the ways of keeping 
records during the various important historical periods with 
which we are familiar. Consider (1) formal documents (books, 
etc.), (2) informal writing (correspondence, etc.). The 
children make illustrative drawings relating to the evolution 
of records. 
Geography.—The sources of materials used in papermaking 
and in bookmaking are investigated. (The names of these 
materials will first be listed; they will furnish some of the words 
used in spelling.) The significance of the materials in the coun- 
try or grand division of which the class is making a special study 
is discussed. The following questions arise: How are these 
materials transported? What are the popular trade routes? 
What cities are noted for papermaking and for printing and 
publishing? What is the part played by wood pulp in paper- 
making? What trees are made use of? An excursion to a 
park or woodland is arranged. 
Work in connection with other industries would be 
conducted in like manner. The difficulty of related subject 
matter and of the activities would be conditioned by the 
ability of the children, and a suitable adjustment would have to 
be made to fit each case. The general method suggested 
should be found applicable to all grades. 
A recent investigation of art courses in sixteen eastern cities 
made by J. Winthrop Andrews of Yonkers, New York, placed 
the time allotment as follows: In the elementary grades, 135 
minutes a week for art or industrial arts; in grades 7 and 8, 
90 minutes for art only, additional time being given for indus- 
trial arts for boys and home economics for girls. 
Just how much of the time allotted to industrial arts as a 
subject should be spent on the content side and how much 
should be given to actual drawing and construction is a debat- 
able question. We feel safe in recommending that not more 
than one-fourth of the total time allowed should be devoted 
to the content side, the remaining three-fourths being allotted 
to manipulation, including both drawing and construction.

-P-A-G-E-34
       CHAPTER IV 
  THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 
As a school subject industrial arts has three functions to 
perform. First, it should serve the purpose of appreciation 
by furnishing a foundation of general information which has 
the object of providing pupils with sufficient industrial educa- 
tion and art instruction to meet their needs as children. 
Second, it should lead up to more advanced differentiated 
courses in the secondary school. Third, it should also serve 
the purpose of a unifying agent in the curriculum by furnish- 
ing a motive for much of the other school work which in turn 
it will clarify and reinforce through activities which make use 
of drawing and construction. 
The grade teacher should not feel compelled to use only the 
industrial arts period for drawing nor should she use that time 
for drawing and handwork alone. The period spent in draw- 
ing plants and animals as nature study may in reality prove 
to be the best sort of drawing lesson. In brief, drawing should 
be made of practical use throughout the child’s life that it may 
assert it educational worth as a common means of expression, 
just as writing and conversing are means of expression. Draw- 
ing and construction should be utilized constantly as helps in 
the other studies; design should mean orderly arrangement and 
neatness in written work;! various forms of constructive 
1 The art principles inculcated in industrial arts should be reflected and 
emphasized throughout the school course. Design implies orderly 
arrangement not only in pictures, in decorations and in manufactured 
products, but in printing and even in the placing of written matter upon 
a sheet of paper. Most people would be very much upset if they had to 
read a printed page in which there was but a single margin and that at 
the left. And yet this arrangement in writing is the one which many of 
36
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 37 
activities may be used to vitalize arithmetic; nature drawing 
to aid nature study, and illustrative and map drawing to help 
geography. In other words, drawing and construction should 
be made of real service in the school life of the child. 
When developing a course of study in industrial arts it is 
advisable (1) to select the industrial topic, (2) to select the 
thought content, and (3) to provide for practice based upon the 
content. The course should be made out grade by grade and 
month by month in advance, the outline subject to change and 
improvement, all of the accepted points of emphasis being 
involved. (See page 28.) 
The work described in this chapter should be adaptable to 
school conditions everywhere. In communities where little 
freedom is allowed, the regular course can at least utilize the 
materials of industry and its practical activities. Where 
  
us adults were taught to observe in school and in which some of us still 
persist. 
The saving in paper to be realized by using a single margin at the left 
is negligible when this margin is divided, half of it being used at the left 
edge and half at the right edge of the paper. What might appear to be 
a saving of paper is really no saving at all. 
The following suggestions governing the preparation of written work 
will be helpful to the teacher who desires specific directions: 
1. Unruled paper will be preferred. Paper having horizontal rulings 
may be used if desired. 
2. Papers should not be folded. 
3. Both sides of the sheet should be used. 
4. No paper having vertical rulings should be used. 
5. When one side of the paper has been filled, the sheet is turned by 
being revolved about its left hand edge as an axis. 
6. The placing of titles should follow the commercial practice. The 
entire title should be centered on the page from left to right, the main 
title appearing highest, followed by the name of the author, placed just 
below this, followed by other subordinate data placed still lower, all 
centered on the page from left to right. 
a Equal margins should be observed at the left and right edges of the 
sheet. 
8. If the pages are to be bound, allowance should be made for binding. 
9. Loose papers should be numbered near the upper edge in the center 
of the sheet from left to right. Commercial practice should be followed 
in the numbering of bound pages.  
-P-A-G-E-36
  38 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
considerable freedom obtains, the teacher will be able to 
employ the following or a similar constructive plan. 
1, The drawing period should become a combined industry-drawing- 
construction-appreciation period. 
2. Drawing and art work, including representation, color, design, 
lettering, construction and appreciation, would become a part of all 
school subjects as occasion demands. 
8. Construction or the combining or assembling of materials would 
become a part of all school subjects as occasion arises. 
4, The industrial arts period would be given over (a) to content and 
(b) to manipulation for the sake of making clear the content, the manipu- 
lation to take the form of representation, design, color, lettering, and 
construction or the combination of materials. 
5. The industries to be taken up would be listed. 
6. From this list the industrial topic to be studied first would be 
chosen. 
7. Instruction relating to this industry would be provided. 
8. Instruction relating to the second industry to be studied would be 
considered, and so on. 
It is suggested that for the sake of an effective organization 
all six grades may at the outset pursue the study of the same 
industry at the same time. One workable program provides 
for a consideration of the seven industrial groups specified 
as topics for study for certain weeks or months which are 
designated in advance.! 
It would be undesirable and at the same time impossible to 
print in detail a course of study which would be equally adapt- 
able to all communities. We can but suggest an outline from 
which we hope all teachers may at least get help and inspira- 
tion. It must be remembered that a course of study should 
in no sense be a limiting factor. It should contain a specific 
statement of policies and methods and it should suggest typical 
experiences within the field. 
1 This calendar program is suggested for the benefit of those schools 
only where industrial arts must be handled as a subject somewhat set 
apart. No use should be made of such a program at the expense of 
correlation or of the project method of instruction.

PROCEDURE 
Teacher.—What are we planning to do with our bulbs? 
Pupil.—Give them to our mothers. 
Teacher.—Mother likes best the things that you make for 
her. What can we make for her in which to hold the bulbs? 
Pupil—We want to make a bowl in which the bulbs will 
grow. 
Teacher.—Have you ever made any dishes for your play- 
houses? 
Pupil.—We have made them of mud. 
Teacher.—How long did your dishes last? 
Pupil.—Not very long. They crumbled after they had 
dried. 
Teacher—Many years ago people tried to make dishes of 
mud. The American Indians were very successful and I will 
tell you of the process by which they still make their dishes. 
Clay was found to be the right kind of soil from which to make 
dishes because it held together so well and didn’t crumble as 
your dishes did. The Indians soon discovered that some kinds 
of clay were better than others and they often walked long 
distances to get the best. 
The dry clay was ground to powder, water was added and 
the mixture was then pugged or kneaded as your mother kneads 
bread dough until it no longer sticks to her hands.

THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 49 
First, the bottom of the dish was shaped. Then coils of 
clay were rolled just long enough to reach around this bottom. 
The first coil was joined to the bottom of the dish with the 
fingers. The other coils were added until they looked as if 
they were made of a single piece of clay. Sometimes a gourd 
shell was used in shaping and smoothing the clay. The dish 
was then placed in the sun to dry. The next day it was 
decorated. The decoration was often painted on the ware 
but sometimes it was scratched in with a sharp point. After 
the dish was decorated it was polished. It was then placed in 
an oven and baked. The heat was carefully regulated while 
the dish was baking so that it would not be broken. 
You can see that it would take a long time to make dishes 
enough for family use. The dishes which we see on our tables 
to-day are made in factories. The processes are much thesame 
as those used by the Indians except that most of them are done 
by machinery. 
If a dish of circular form was desired, it used to be formed on 
a potter’s wheel. The potter shaped the dish with his skillful 
fingers. The modern potter uses a jigger, which is a potter’s 
wheel with attachments for forming the dishes entirely by 
machine, The dishes pass from the jigger to the lathe where 
they are turned until they are smooth. 
If dishes with very thin walls are desired, a mixture of clay 
and water called slip is poured into a plaster of Paris mold. 
The plaster of Paris absorbs the water, and causes a thin layer 
of clay to be left all around on the inside of the mold. When 
this clay is partially dry the mold is removed. When it is 
completely dry the bowl is finished by hand. 
After the dishes have been smoothed and decorated they are 
baked or fired in a large oven called a kiln. Chinaware is 
fired twice. Between the first and the second firing the dishes 
are glazed. The glazing gives a smooth, shiny appearance 
and makes the ware more beautiful and serviceable. 
Teacher.—Which process do you think we had better 
undertake? 
Pupil.—We shall have to make our dishes by hand.

50 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Teacher-—We can cut paper silhouettes of the bowls that we 
wish to make and these will guide us in shaping our bowls. 
How shall we plan the decorations? 
Pupil.—We can draw them on our silhouettes. 
Teacher.—That would be an excellent way. I will show 
you some Indian patterns that may suggest designs for our 
bowls. We have also a few pieces of decorated Indian pottery 
and some baskets. 
Most chinaware to-day is decorated by means of decalco- 
mania transfers. The pattern made by the designer is printed 
on paper and then this paper is pressed on the surface of the 
ware. When the paper is washed off the colored pattern 
remains on the dish. Then the dish is glazed. Sometimes 
the ware is decorated after the second firing, over the glaze. 
The glazed pieces are fired a third time to set the color. 
Note: It is now possible for teachers in the elementary 
grades to undertake a study of pottery as a class project in 
grade 4, 5or 6or in grades 4, 5 and 6 combined for the industrial 
arts period. The pupils can make dishes or vases with the 
assurance that their work will be preserved by firing. A kiln 
is unnecessary if proper clay isused. Teachers are encouraged 
to try local clay which can often be procured by pupils in the 
neighborhood of their homes. The Potter’s Clay now 
furnished in small quantities by the Dobson-Evans Company, 
Columbus, Ohio, has been tested and found satisfactory in 
every way. The following method is used in firing the dishes 
in a range or other stove. For directions for making the 
dishes see Winslow’s Elementary Industrial Arts, pp. 123 to 
138 inclusive. 
Directions ror Firine Porrery 
1. Place the vase in a “tin” can (pressed can without solder). This 
will serve as a miniature kiln. 
2. Fill can half full of fine dry sand to prevent the vase from heating 
and cooling too quickly. 
3. Place vase in the sand in can and put cover on can.

at least two hours. 
9. Open check drafts gradually to reduce fire gradually. 
10. When the fire has gone almost out remove the can and place it in 
the oven. This will allow it to cool gradually. The fire may now be 
replenished. 
11. Remove can from oven to back of stove where it will continue to 
cool slowly. 
12. Remove cover from can. 
13. Remove dish from can. 
The gradual heating and cooling of the clay vase is most important. 
Avoid drafts. 
Vases may be decorated if desired. Decorations can be worked out in 
colored crayon on plain or squared paper. 
Finished dishes may be used as ‘‘models”’ for representative drawing. 
Although this project is best suited to the upper elementary grades it 
may also be used with profit in grades 7, 8 and 9 if design is properly 
emphasized.

PRocEDURE 
Teacher.—What were you asked to bring to class today? 
Pupil.—A sharp nail and a stone. 
Teacher—You may scratch your initials on the stone. 
Will it rub off with your hand? 
Pupil.—Yes unless we use something very hard and sharp. 
Teacher.—This is one way people used to keep records in 
olden times. Here are some pictures of early historical 
events which were recorded on stone. (Pass pictures for 
children to see.) 
Teacher——How many have heard of the obelisk in Central 
Park, New York City? 
Pupil—wWe read about it in Geography class. 
Teacher.—See how much additional material you can find 
about the obelisk and we will write a story about it for 
Language work tomorrow. 
Teacher.—You may place your stones in a pile on the floor. 
This is another method ancients followed for recording events. 
You will find several places in Bible history where a pile of 
stones was used to commemorate an event which happened at 
that time. Do you recall such an event? 
Pupil.—Yes, Jacob placed a pile of stones where he had a 
vision. 
Teacher.—These heaps of stones were called covenants or 
cairns. They were used before the obelisks. Our earliest 
records were called memory tablets, that is, one person would 
relate to another person whatever happened. This was most 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  54 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
unsatisfactory because the people were not accurate and some- 
times forgot. In Asia people knotted cords to help them 
remember, and in Australia they notched sticks. 
Teacher.—Do you know how the Indians recorded what 
happened? 
Pupil—They wove historical events in their bead and 
basket work. 
Teacher.—Yes, and they painted crude pictures on animal 
skins and also scratched them on stone. The Egyptians wrote 
on papyrus, a plant which grew along the Nile River. There 
are still three other methods of preserving records long ago. 
You may look in Elementary Industrial Arts! and learn the 
three remaining ways in which records were kept. You will 
find the volume on my desk and also a copy in the 
library. 
Pass a piece of paper 3” X 12’ to each member of the class. 
Teacher.—Place the paper on your desk with the long edge 
toward you. Fold the short edges together, crease. Continue 
folding the short edges together until you have made three 
folds. Lay the paper open on your desk once more and follow- 
ing the creases make your paper resemble a fan. This is the 
way the pages of a book werefirstfolded. Later they were laced 
at the back and today leaves arearranged to form books. You 
may tell me tomorrow what is meant by a book of one 
signature, also a book of many signatures. 
Pupil.—Where can we find this information? 
Teacher.—In the book on Industrial Arts. 
Pupil—May we make a book? 
Teacher.—Yes, that is just what we are going todo. What 
materials will you need? 
Pupil.—Scissors, paste or glue, paper for leaves, cover paper 
or linen, stiff cardboard. 
Teacher.—How do you think the leaves are held together in 
your book? 
Pupil.—It looks like cloth.

PROCEDURE 
Teacher.—Since we have these beautiful pictures and the 
lovely stories that we have written about our little Japanese 
friends, what should we do to keep the pictures and stories? 
Pupil.—We ought to put them in our book. 
Teacher.—If we put them in our books, when we hold up 
our books to read, what will become of our pictures and 
stories? 
Pupil.—They will fall on the floor and get dirty. 
Teacher—What would be the best thing to have to put 
these pictures in? 
Pupil.—The nicest thing would be a book with leaves, so 
that we could paste the clippings in it. 
Teacher.—Which shall we do, make a book for our very own 
or ask our parents to buy us one to use for this? 
Pupil.—I think it would be much nicer to make one for our 
very own. 
Teacher—Good, but what kind of a book shall we make to 
be the home of these little Japanese folks? 
Pupil.—A Japanese book would be just the thing if we knew 
how to make one, 
Teacher.—That would be just the kind for our purpose, so 
let us learn to make one. What shall we need to have? 
Pupil—cCovers and leaves. 
Teacher.—What kinds of material shall we want? 
Pupil—We shall want pasteboard or something stiff for 
the covers and common paper for the leaves. 
Teacher.—All right, suppose we begin and get our leaves 
ready. What shall we have to do to our paper? 
Pupil.—We shall have to make the leaves all of the same 
size, because the leaves of our books must all be just alike. 
Teacher.—The leaves of the Japanese book are a little differ- 
ent from the leaves of our school books, but of course they 
should be since little Nan Wu is much different in appearance 
from any of our little girls. We will fold one inch over on one 
long edge of each sheet; then fold the opposite edge to the 
folded edge. All the leaves must be folded in this way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  58 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Pupil.—But that will make a double page. 
Teacher.—That is just as it should be. The Japanese 
made their pages double. Then they punched holes in them, 
through which they laced them together with cords. 
Pupil.—How shall we make covers for our books? 
Teacher.—We shall cut two pieces of strawboard just the 
right size, place them a little space apart and paste a 
piece of cloth over both pieces. This will make the hinge. 
The back cover is made in the same way. 
Pupil.—That cover isn’t very attractive. I should like to 
use some colored cover paper. 
Teacher—You may have it. Pick out a color which you 
are sure will be suitable; then cut it so that it extends 14 inch 
beyond the strawboard cover. We shall have to mitre the 
corners so the cover paper will fit neatly. Then paste this 
paper over the strawboard. Is the cover finished now? 
Pupil.—No, I think it ought to have another piece of cover 
paper on the inside so that it will look finished. 
Teacher—Then we will take another piece of paper and cut 
it in two for the lining of both covers. Let us leave a space 
where the cloth shows so that the hinge will work freely. 
Pupil.—Now how can we make holes in all these sheets and 
this cover? 
Teacher.—We will use the punch. All our pages and both 
covers must be marked where the holes are to be punched. 
Then by using the punch in this way we can make holes in 
all the pages and in the covers in the right places. 
Pupil.—Now our books are ready to be laced. 
Teacher.—We will lace them as the illustration shows us. 
Mary and I will lace Mary’s. You can all see how we 
start, then you can each go on with yourown. We will tie the 
lace near this hole and pull the knot into the book, out of 
sight. 
Pupil—Why does my book open up instead of staying 
closed as my Reader does? 
Teacher.—It must be pressed. We will put the books in 
the press so they will stay closed. Does your book look like 
the picture of the Japanese book, which we saw?
-P-A-G-E-57
  
THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 59 
Pupil.—It’s just the same, only of course it’s the real thing, 
so it is much better than the picture. Our pictures and 
stories will fit in here all right and we’ve found out how to make 
a Japanese book. 
AN INDUSTRIAL ARTS TOPIC WHICH INSPIRED HANDWORK 
IN CONNECTION WITH FOOD STUDY IN GRADE 2! 
Bread.—The story of modern bread-making will be 
developed through assignments, the children making inquiry 
at home and elsewhere. The teacher will make free use of 
books in the Home Economics Department and in the library. 
The story can be illustrated by the making of imaginative 
drawings and by modeling in clay. The threshing of wheat by 
rubbing heads of wheat in the hands; the grinding of the kernels 
by means of stones or a mortar and pestle; the use of flour 
thus made in the making of cakes which are baked during 
recess period on the school stove, or, better, in the school yard 
where stones may be heated, greased and used for utensils in 
the baking process. 
Bread-making always interests the small child. The story 
written in the range of his understanding would run something 
like this: 
Bread is one of the foods we have on the table every day and 
for every meal. Some of it is made by the mothers at home 
but much of it comes from the bakery. Bread is made from 
flour, water, yeast and a little salt and sugar. These things 
are mixed together to make a dough. Yeast is used to make 
the dough rise so it will be soft and light. Salt and sugar 
flavor the bread and give it a better taste. If the ordinary 
yeast cake is used the bread is started at night. The yeast 
cake is broken up and put into warm water. Then some 
flour and water are mixed, and the yeast and water are stirred 
into this. The mixture is covered and put in a warm place 
for the night. In the morning more flour and water are mixed, 
the yeast that was made the night before is stirred into it and 
the salt and sugar are added. 
1 This material was prepared in cooperation with Lucy H. Meacham 
of the State Normal College of Northwestern Ohio.  
-P-A-G-E-58
  60 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
The mixture is now left for a while in order that it may 
become light. It is the yeast that makes the dough light. 
After the dough has risen it is mixed some more and then left 
to rise again. The mixing is called kneading. After the 
dough has been kneaded the second time it is molded into 
loaves and put into pans. The pans are greased before the 
dough is put into them in order that it may not stick. It is 
left to rise a short time in the pans. If the tops of the loaves 
are greased this will keep the crust from cracking when the 
bread is baking. The pans containing the dough are put into 
a hot oven. If the loaves are small they will bake in half an 
hour. When the bread is done it should be taken from the 
pans at once. If properly baked it should have a thin light- 
brown crust. It should be soft and light. 
There are many kinds of bread. The names of some of 
them are Boston brown, corn, graham, honey, rye, salt-rising, 
unleavened and Vienna. 
Bread has more flour than other things in it. Flour is 
usually made from wheat. How wheat grows and how it is 
changed into white flour is as wonderful as a fairy tale. 
Each little grain of wheat grows into a great stalk. In the 
fall the farmer puts his wheat kernels into a machine called a 
drill. The drill drops the wheat on the ground and covers it 
up with the warm earth. The seeds sleep in the ground for a 
few days, then the rain and sun come and they wake up and 
grow. When the wheat first starts to grow the field looks 
like a green meadow. 
After a while the wheat plants stop growing and go to sleep 
under a warm white blanket of snow. Here they sleep all 
through the cold winter weather. When spring comes and the 
warm rain falls once more and the sun shines the wheat starts 
growing again. It grows and grows until the stalk is about 3 
feet high. The warm summer sun turns the plants from green 
to yellow and the grain ripens. The farmer now drives into 
the field with a big machine called a harvester. This machine 
cuts the grain and ties it into bundles. 
The bundles are put into shocks which are left standing in 
the field. When the grain is quite dry the farmer hauls it to
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 61 
the barn. About three weeks later a big threshing machine 
comes to the barn and the bundles of wheat are again put into 
a machine which separates the straw from the kernels. The 
straw is blown into a stack in the barnyard and the kernels 
come out of the separator in a steady stream. They 
are caught in sacks and are emptied into a bin. 
People did not always have threshing machines to do this 
work so quickly. Long ago when they wanted to separate the 
grain from the straw they spread the wheat out on the ground 
or on the barn floor and had oxen or horses tramp over it. 
Then they brushed the straw away and gathered up the grain. 
Later the flail came into use. The flail was made of two 
pieces of wood hinged together by means of a strap. The 
farmer used the flail as a sort of club with which he beat the 
grain in order to separate the kernels from the straw. 
After the threshing is finished the farmer takes his wheat to 
the mill. At the mill, steel rollers take the brown coats off and 
grind the kernels into flour. The flour is sifted a number of 
times to separate the fine powder from the rough brown 
coverings. It comes out soft and white, and is at once put 
into the sacks. 
Flour was not always made as it is today. Long ago people 
had no mills to grind it. They used to put kernels of wheat in 
the bowl formed by wearing a hollow in a large stone. Then 
with a smooth stone they pounded and ground the wheat as 
fine as they could.!' This way of making flour took so long 
that people at last began to think of quicker ways. Then 
mills were built to grind the wheat. A large wheel turned by 
running water made the wheels of the mill go round. (Ruis- 
dael’s The Mill suggested for picture study.) 
Today flour is made at the mill in a still better and a quicker 
way, for the wheels are turned by steam power or by electricity 
and nearly all the work of making flour from wheat is done by 
machinery. The bread is also mixed and prepared by 
machines.

  62 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
USES MADE OF THE CLOTHING TOPIC IN GRADE 2 
Fibers.—The pupils are taught to recognize wool, cotton and 
silk. They are also taught the uses to which each fiber is put. 
The making of a collection of small pieces of wool, cotton and 
silk. These are cut into uniform shapes and sizes and are 
mounted on a class chart. Three large mounts should be 
provided, one for each of the materials (22 X 28 inches is a 
convenient size). The samples should be arranged in an 
orderly manner, each chart being arranged systematically 
according to color; that is, all blues together, all greens 
together, all reds together, etc. If striped or figured materials 
are included they should if possible be arranged according to 
the prevaiiing hues. The textile fabrics can be used in making 
a doll’s dress from colored cloth. If cloth cannot be obtained 
paper dolls may be dressed with colored papers. 
A study of clothing should accompany the elementary 
analysis of materials. Such a study would take up in a simple 
way the evolution of clothing, adaptability of certain materials 
to the different seasons of the year, etc. Other projects in 
textiles adapted to the ability of the children should be 
arranged by the teacher. There should be provided lessons 
in drawing, color, design and the care and conservation of 
clothing. 
USES MADE OF THE SHELTER TOPIC IN GRADE 2 
Temporary Dwellings—The wigwam or long house of the 
American Indian. The igloo of the Eskimo. Comparisons 
made between their homes and our own. Reconstruction of 
an Indian or Eskimo home on the sand table. Imaginative 
drawings to illustrate the modern American home and the 
home of the Eskimo. (Materials used in building houses: 
wood, brick, stone. A study of the various rooms, including 
their functions. Cleanliness in the home. The homes of 
other lands studied.) 
The Building of a Wooden Playhouse.—Discussion of wooden 
houses and their advantages and disadvantages over buildings 
built of brick. Children in the second grade may profitably
-P-A-G-E-61
THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 63 
be given instruction in the housing problem. They may 
investigate the work of the carpenter, visiting the men at 
work on buildings in process of construction in the neigh- 
borhood of the school. Later each child should be asked 
to make a drawing to show how he would like his house 
to appear when finished. The best of these drawings may be 
used later by the children as guides, when they build their 
house. 
After the materials needed for the building are supplied, 
the children cut the boards into proper lengths, choose nails 
suitable for fastening the parts together, and go to work 
building the house.t’ Not a nail is driven by the instructor 
nor are the children told where to place the nails. In the 
strictest sense the work is individual and original. The 
house is not built in a day; it usually requires some weeks of 
persistent effort, when 30 minutes each day are devoted to the 
actual work and its related subject matter. After the house 
has been inclosed it is painted with real house paint and the 
rooms decorated with furnishings made by the children. 
The workmanship upon buildings of this kind is crude enough; 
joints do not fit as we might wish they would. Yet when 
judged by the child’s standards the house will be complete and 
beautiful; he will have approached if not quite attained his 
ideal. The fine thing about a problem of this kind is that the 
children gain so much in the ability to express their own ideas 
through action. They also learn valuable facts relating to 
house building and house furnishing. 
The expense involved is slight compared with the educational 
returns. 
1 Wooden packing boxes will serve well the purpose of benches. 
Carriage maker’s clamps may be substituted for vises. After'a few ham- 
mers, back saws, try-squares, and soap boxes, have been supplied, the 
equipment is complete. Wood is procured from the lumber yard in 
strips one inch wide; the material used for the clapboards is one-fourth of 
an inch in thickness, that used for the house frame is seven-eighths of 
an inch thick. Shingles are easily procured from the lumber dealer and 
a few pounds of nails varying in length from three-fourths of an inch 
to two inches may be obtained at the hardware store. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  64 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
USE MADE OF RECORDS TOPIC IN GRADE 1 
Making a Folder for A. B. C——The children are encouraged 
to make a collection of pieces of paper, cloth, wood, etc., 
upon which letters and designs have been printed. Their 
attention is called to the printed pages of their reading books 
and of magazines and newspapers. The concept of printing is 
formed. They are directed in the cutting of letters, the best 
of which are placed in a folder. The folder may consist of a 
piece of paper long enough to contain all the letters of the 
alphabet, one letter on a page. The strip of paper is folded 
several times. If the multifolded paper is used, it may be 
pointed out by the teacher that writings were preserved in 
this way prior to the time when books were first made. 
If preferred, the folder may be used for reproductions of 
masterpieces in painting. A decoration may be made for the 
cover of the folder. It should involve a simple border pattern 
involving the repetition of a single appropriate unit. The 
children may also make calendars by folding. Black, white or 
gray combined with red or yellow-red (orange) should be 
effective colors to use on white or manila paper. The proper 
care of books is emphasized. 
USE MADE OF UTENSILS TOPIC IN GRADE 2 
Pottery—Utensils of clay are made for the playhouse 
(crocks, bowls, wash basins, bath tubs, etc.) or for other 
purposes. No particular method should be dictated by the 
teacher; the children will prefer to make the articles by pinch- 
ing the clay according to their own ideas into appropriate 
shapes. Such questions as this should be asked: Why did 
people learn to make dishes? Make a list of the various 
common articles of pottery. Give a use to each. 
USE MADE OF TOOLS AND MACHINES TOPIC IN GRADE 1 
Typical Tools.—A consideration of primitive agricultural 
implements: the plow, harrow, hoe and rake. 
It should be suggested to the children that as they play out 
of doors they should experiment with such natural objects as
-P-A-G-E-63
THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 65 
are found in the fields and woods; sharp stones, round stones, 
shells, thongs and fibers, splinters of wood, bone and twigs. 
These will be found to possess the requirements for simple 
manual operations and should help the children to an appre- 
ciation of modern tools. If children use crude tools before 
using the finished tools of to-day, they will comprehend more 
readily the value of man’s contribution to civilization. Tllus- 
trative drawings and cuttings based on the above may be made 
in school. 
USE MADE OF THE LIGHT, HEAT AND POWER TOPIC IN 
GRADE 2 
The Air.—How air in motion may be made use of to run 
pumps and other machines and to propel boats and balloons. 
The making of little pin wheels by the children to illustrate 
the turning of a wheel by the wind. Drawing of windmill, 
sailboat and kite. 3 
THE INTERPRETATION AND APPRECIATION OF PICTURES 
“T watch for the sunbeam, which filters through the 
poplars and comes in at my window. It brings to me 
even now the good smell of the leaves and the cry of the 
insects. And I can still draw from it knowledge and 
delight.” 
Rousseau. 
A good picture has a refining influence which increases in 
proportion to the intelligence with which it is studied. Picture 
study should never be a formal perfunctory process. Unless 
the teacher knows and loves pictures, he will accomplish little. 
If the teacher does know and love pictures, his love will be 
contagious and the pupils will be uplifted. A real love of 
pictures is a very different thing from a knowledge of catalog 
information. Unless the study takes hold of the heart it will 
be of slight value. One fine picture known and loved is worth 
more than pages of the catalog type of information. Many 
good books of reference are to be had from which the teacher 
may gain suggestions; in any case he should make use of the 
best books at hand. He should keep close to the lives of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
  66 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
children. He should study the picture rather than the life of 
the artist, though this is often a helpful sidelight. He should 
not pick a picture to pieces. The children should be led to 
study it as a whole and to catch the artist’s message, then they 
should try to find out how the artist has told his story.! 
Before beginning a somewhat technical discussion of picture 
appreciation it will be helpful to point out a few elementary 
facts of psychology, since the interpretation of pictures involves 
a great amount of mental imagery. There are two kinds of 
images. These are known as percept and concept. A percept 
is the kind of image that the mind records of an object or a 
group of objects as the objects appear or exist in perception. 
A concept is the kind of image that the mind records of an 
object or objects not as the objects appear or exist in 
perception but as they are conceived to be. Percepts deal 
with actualities; concepts, with ideas, fancies and meanings. 
It will be apparent that picture interpretation and ultimate 
appreciation will deal both with percepts and with concepts 
but especially with concept imagery. 
The three pure thought processes, memory, imagination 
and reasoning are all involved in picture interpretation. The 
thought processes differ from perception with regard to the 
time and place to which the event is referred. In perception 
the event is actually presented to the senses at the moment; 
in the three thought processes it is regarded as past or future, 
or as having real existence in some distant place. The 
important characteristics of the thought processes are: (1) the 
results of reasoning are new and accepted as true; (2) results 
of memory are true, but not new; and (3) the results of 
imagination are new, but not true. 
The difference between the word as a bare image and as 
representative of objects has been illustrated by James by 
asking one to stare at a word on the printed page for a few 
minutes as just a word. After one has looked at the word in 
this way for a short time, the meanings seem to drop away 
and the word image alone remains. The difference between|

this and the word as ordinarily used is very striking, how strik- 
ing one can discover only by trying the experiment. It might 
also be stated with equal emphasis that the difference between 
the picture as a bare image and as representative of the objects 
depicted is illustrated by asking one to stare at a picture on the 
printed page for a few minutes as just a picture. Afterone has 
looked at the picture in this way for a short time just as truly 
will the meanings seem to drop away and the picture image 
alone remain. In general, then, the image of the object that 
is actually perceived (percept) is relatively a matter of indiffer- 
ence in the subject of interpretation. What is essential are the 
associations that the image calls up. Everything serves to 
emphasize that the associations arising from the object that is 
not actually perceived (concept) are most important. 
In the interpretation and appreciation of pictures much 
depends on one’s ability to recall past experiences. The laws 
of recall are primarily the laws of association, for most learning 
consists in bringing new material into contact with old 
knowledge. If everything that is learned must be learned in 
connection with something else, it follows that anything that is 
recalled must be recalled because of association with former 
knowledge. This can be brought about only through the 
presence of some clue, some idea that has been associated with 
the new material, that is essential at the moment. One can- 
not recall an idea without the associated idea or sensation. 
It is impossible to recall the fact in any other way than through 
appropriate suggestion. This suggestion may be furnished 
by the former idea or it may come through sensation.? 
The surest way of recalling ideas is undoubtedly through 
sensation. The method of picture interpretation, which for 
want of a better name we call sense-appreciation, consists in 
studying a picture by reading its story or meaning. This can 
be done systematically through memory, imagination, and 
reason. Sight percepts stimulate the memory and imagination 
in the field of the other senses also—hearing, taste, smell and 
touch. A church steeple suggests the sound of a bell; sugar 
suggests sweetness; flowers suggest fragrance; the bark of a

  68 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
tree suggests roughness; and any or all of these percepts or 
memories or imaginings may suggest a larger emotional or 
intellectual experience of greater or less significance. The 
interpretation of all pictures depends, of course, on one’s 
experience. The person who has never seen a medieval castle, 
for example, cannot fully appreciate a picture of one unless 
through reading or conversation or both he may have gained 
an adequate conception of a castle by comparing its forms with 
those with which he is already familiar. There are pictures 
the fullest understanding of which requires information other 
than that which we are able, with our limited experience, 
independently to read into them. 
When we have studied a picture in terms of the five senses 
(with the assistance of memory and imagination), we may be 
sure that we have read its story as completely and have inter- 
preted it as skillfully as possible. If we consider a picture, 
consciously dwelling upon each of the senses in turn, we may 
be reasonably sure that, when we have finished with the five 
senses, we have concluded the story. Not until then have we 
a right to consider the technical side. What is Millet’s 
Angelus without the sound of the bell, or a Corot landscape 
without the perfume of the flowers and the music made by 
the rustling leaves? Why must we always read the stories 
even of the simplest pictures as they have been written for us 
by others, when we might interpret them as well or better for 
ourselves? It is a poor picture that will not tell its own story. 
It may be objected that not all the senses are brought into 
play in the interpretation of all pictures. The objection is 
good. Portrait pictures involve seeing primarily; landscapes 
involve hearing and smelling also, and not seldom all of the 
other senses. Few good pictures will involve tasting to any 
great extent. Murillo’s Boys Hating Melons and Bouguereau’s 
Girl Eating Porridge are good examples of pictures in which the 
sense of taste is a prominent consideration. 
A sympathetic attitude is the prerequisite of appreciation. 
Knowledge will be of two kinds: (1) that having to do with 
interpretation and (2) that having to do with technique. The 
appeal will be made directly through the sense of sight, and
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 69 
the strength of it will depend largely upon the extent to which 
the visual perception calls up images in the fields of the other 
senses. For example, things seen may suggest geographical 
location, nationality, land formation, or a particular period in 
history. In the field of hearing, they may suggest natural 
sounds, such as sounds of the elements (wind and rain); 
sounds of animals, such as a bird’s song, a dog’s bark, or hoof 
beats; sounds of the human voice, as in singing or speaking or 
crying; or mechanical sounds, such as those of musical 
instruments, bells, whistles, or machinery in operation. In 
the realm of smell, they may suggest odors which will indi- 
cate environment, season of the year, or time of the day. 
In the sphere of touch, they may suggest texture, solidity, 
temperature, humidity, as applied to objects and the atmos- 
phere; muscular activity and movement involving effort, 
fatigue, and rest. In the field of taste, they may suggest foods 
or medicines. 
Moreover, associations with former experiences may be 
called up by each sense in turn. In fact, we can interpret 
only in so far as we have learned through past experiences. 
Specific past experiences will come back to us, thereby 
rendering our interpretation more interesting and personal. 
Let us now investigate the picture’s claim to art, the tech- 
nical side, by considering line and color, including dark and 
light, and applying the principles of rhythm and balance. 
After having pursued the study to this point we should be 
thoroughly familiar with the subject. We should now be 
prepared to evaluate it with a view to accepting or rejecting it 
from the esthetic standpoint. Is the picture a masterpiece, a 
real work of art? The following and similar questions should 
help in determining this: Is the subject a picture primarily, 
or is it a story? Does it explain itself sufficiently, i.e., would 
it justify itself without a name? Itisa great conception? Is 
it simple? Has it a familiar subject? Would its appeal be 
universal? Was it painted for all time? 
I have before me, as I write, a small reproduction of Inness’s 
Peace and Plenty. I can foresee that within these few square 
inches lie hidden from some eyes many thoughts which might 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  70 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
take form in the mind could they be called systematically into 
consciousness. 
I no sooner picked up the picture than I was transported to 
the country, from my little room with its ice-covered panes to 
the harvest fields in sunny August, to fields of freedom and of 
plenty. Sheaves of grain lie at my feet while but a rod away a 
couple of harvesters are engaged in conversation. They are 
taking time to rest for a moment from their strenuous labors in 
the sun. Other workers just beyond are cutting the grain. 
Farther away I can see a wagon heavily laden and ready to be 
drawn away. Beyond isa stream winding off into the distance. 
But near the center of the picture, a little toward the left, isa 
group of elms which dominates the whole. The first of the 
trees stands alone, a commanding figure almost perfect in its 
symmetry. It is the favorite tree of my childhood. How I 
long to be among its branches with the breeze upon my face. 
As I look off across the landscape I become conscious of the 
magnitude of God’s great out-of-doors. All is peaceful and 
still. But when I listen carefully in imagination I can hear 
gentle music. A little bird way up in yonder elm is singing a 
delicious melody. He pauses, as I do, to listen. The “gid- 
dap” and ‘‘whoa” and the creaking of the wagon beneath its 
heavy load are all rendered harmonious by distance, while 
the voices of the workers come to me in the intervals between 
the bird’s songs. The occasional click of the stone upon the 
scythe forms a pleasant accent. I close my eyes in order 
to catch every sound. Oh, the faint, sweet odor of that new 
cut grain! Iam going to guess the time of day. Four o’clock. 
I open my eyes to verify my decision by consulting the shadows 
cast by the elms at the edge of the fields. How cool those 
shadows are! They have such a power over me, I am certain 
that eventually I shall yield to their call and after cooling off in 
their scattered light, take a dip in the stream. 
The feeling of freedom which such a scene inspires is better 
experienced than described. One is at once content to be 
nature’s child; his cares and responsibilities vanish. There 
has settled over the world a mantle of perfect peace and 
quiet. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 71 
I shall not attempt to analyze the picture from the technical 
side. Suffice it to say that it meets the requirements of art. 
The distribution of dark and light is excellent; we have in it an 
example of finely balanced attractions in which large, simple 
masses are properly disposed one toward another. If any 
changes in the disposition of these masses were to be made, our 
feeling of rest, of satisfaction, of peace, would be destroyed, the 
unity of the whole would be lost. We find balanced areas as 
well as balanced values and balanced interests. As the repro- 
duction is in neutral values, we can enter upon no further 
consideration of color. 
Inness recites in Peace and Plenty the familiar story of the 
harvest; his painting is nevertheless in itself a thing of ever- 
lasting beauty, its beauty depending, for the most part, upon 
fine choices of line and of dark and light and upon simplicity of 
treatment. The picture will always appeal tomen everywhere, 
particularly to Americans. 
I have come to understand this picture by reading direct the 
message which it has for me. It may mean something differ- 
ent to you, but let your interpretation be genuine and I have 
no doubt that it will ring true. As for myself, I have decided 
that the landscape is a masterpiece in painting. I would like to 
have a good reproduction of it on the walls of my home because 
I am convinced that it should appeal to all who love nature, 
and nature is of course universal in her appeal.

  72 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Pupil.—Because it seems so quiet. The French peasant is 
going toward the village so his work must be done. 
Teacher.—Where is the peasant going? 
Pupil.—He is going home. 
Teacher.—Where is his home? 
Pupil.—In the little white house in the distance. 
Teacher—What is he carrying? 
Pupil.—He has a scythe on his back. 
Teacher.—How does he feel? 
Pupil.—He is tired from his day’s work. He walks as if he 
was tired. 
Teacher-—Of whom is he thinking ? 
Pupil.—He is thinking of his wife and children and of his 
good warm supper. 
Teacher.—What are they doing to prepare for his coming? 
Pupil.—His wife is getting supper. The oldest girl is setting 
the table. The little children are running to the road to see if 
their father iscoming. One stands on the gate and waits. 
Teacher—As he thinks of all this how does it make 
him feel? 
Pupil.—He feels happy and content. 
Teacher.—Where does the sun seem to be setting? 
Pupil.—aAt the end of the road. 
Teacher.—Why do you think so? 
Pupil.—Because of the light that shines on the road. 
Teacher—What do you think the peasant can see as he 
walks home? 
Pupil.—He sees the beautiful colors in the sky caused by the 
setting sun. He sees the brook and the willow trees. He sees 
the village. 
Teacher.—What does he hear? 
Pupil—He hears the last call of the birds before they go to 
sleep in their nests. He hears the squirrels chatter, the frogs 
croaking, the murmuring of the brook, the wind as it passes 
through the willows, and the bells in the village. 
Teacher.—What does he feel? 
Pupil.—He feels the cool air blow across his face. 
Teacher.—Do you think that he can smell anything?
-P-A-G-E-71
THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY 73 
Pupil.—Yes, he smells the grain in the fields and the fresh 
green leaves on the willow trees. 
Teacher. —Is his walk a pleasant one? 
Pupil.—Yes. 
Teacher.—This picture is called The End of Day. It was 
painted by Emile Adan who was born in Paris in 1839. Adan’s 
pictures are famous on account of the charm of color that he 
gavethem. His best pictures are simple subjects.

CHAPTER V 
A SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAM 
In the intermediate or junior high school! art and industrial 
arts are taught as separate subjects in both of which the 
significance of art in commerce and industry is stressed, the 
conditions under which the designer or artisan works investi- 
gated and the materials and processes studied with a view to 
establishing criteria for the making of intelligent choices of 
mediums and of raw materials and of finished products. The 
economic side of instruction is given considerable emphasis: 
attention is called continually to the inducements offered in 
the various art industries, for instance, salary or income 
attractions, opportunities for leisure, the training necessary 
for entrance and the possibilities afforded for advancement. 
Instruction should aim especially to establish in pupils desir- 
able attitudes toward their work and toward life, correct 
standards of appreciation and sound bases for choice. 
Systematic instruction in drawing is fundamental in all 
types of general art education since drawing constitutes a 
graphic language in most of the trades and industries. If 
properly taught, therefore, drawing should help one to 
appreciate the world’s masterpieces of art and industry. 
In the junior high school art is usually a required subject 
for both boys and girls on all programs. In addition, some 
industrial arts work is required for all the boys in the seventh 
grade and some household arts work is required for all the girls. 
Mechanical drawing forms an important adjunct to most of 
the industrial arts courses for boys. Instruction in this sub- 
1 Many of the secondary schools are not yet organized on a junior and 
senior high school basis. In the present discussion grades 7, 8 and 9 are 
referred to as the junior high school and grades 10, 11 and 12 as the 
senior high school, regardless of organization. Whatever the organiza- 
tion and grouping of grades the fundamental purposes of instruction 
are obviously the same, 
79
-P-A-G-E-78
  80 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
ject is included in the general art course and usually in connec- 
tion with the home planning and household decoration work 
of the home economics course. Mechanical drawing is also 
taught as a subject by itself, for drafting constitutes an 
important industrial art. 
All junior high school programs should make provision for 
systematic instruction in drawing, involving the principles of 
design and color, the freehand and mechanical representation 
of form, and lettering. Although the instruction is usually 
motivated largely by industrial and commercial interests, 
other important topics such as architecture, sculpture and 
painting, should also be included. In such a scheme nature 
must continue to be regarded as constituting the supreme 
source of inspiration. The industrial topic would include 
textiles, costumes, jewelry, silverware, furniture, lighting 
fixtures ornamental builders’ hardware, wall paper, ceramics, 
printing, and machinery; the commercial motive, the adver- 
tising and marketing of industrial products, written and 
typed work, lettering and illustrations, 
To appreciate an art adequately the pupil should become 
acquainted with its source and evolution, and with its masters, 
both past and present. He should also understand its signif- 
icance in our present civilization. He should be able to 
analyze its product by means of the senses, and to differentiate 
between good and bad materials and products, distinguishing 
between the poorer and the finer grades and qualities and 
making correct choices. He should be acquainted with 
the processes involved and the tools and machines used in 
making them adaptable to their use. Ultimately he should 
apply this knowledge not only in the selection of products but 
also in their combination or arrangement. 
The topic once chosen, design, representation, and lettering 
are each made to contribute a certain amount of practice for 
clarifying and emphasizing ideas and principles. Formal 
instruction should be discarded except where it is absolutely 
required to develop new skill necessary in creative expression; 
for self-expression on the pupils’ part should be the teacher’s 
ever-present aim.
-P-A-G-E-79
  A SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAM 81 
A working knowledge of design is most essential in such a 
program for art education. The pupil will need to know the 
meaning of rhythm and balance and of the harmony resulting 
from them, for he cannot express himself artistically without 
applying these principles of rhythm and balance in his work. 
He will need to know the difference between the pictorial and 
decorative. He will need to regard historic ornament as 
suggesting ways of working rather than as a source of motifs, 
that the play impulse may find tangible expression in the 
enrichment of contours and surfaces. To all of this, color will 
be made to contribute its fund of hue, value and chroma. 
In representation the illustrative will need to be combined 
with the decorative, and perspective drawing made to con- 
tribute valuable experience in the disposition of line and mass 
and of light, shade, shadow and reflection. The perspective of 
space will also be involved in the representation of beautiful 
forms, both natural and manufactured, and in interior and 
exterior views. Technical rendering in pencil, charcoal, 
crayon, pen and ink, water colors and oil paints will also have 
an important place. Many problems will arise requiring 
careful lettering in capitals and in both the Roman and the 
Gothic form. Working drawings which will require accurate 
and artistic rendering will often need to be made. In this 
connection, a necessity will be felt for a fundamental 
knowledge of the principles underlying drafting—the alphabet 
of lines, dimensioning, the theory of orthographic projection 
and the preference of the third angle. Specialization in these 
principles must be carefully avoided, for the work of the 
junior high school period must be kept general. Although 
some mechanical drawing is included in the course as a phase 
of the art content most junior high schools should be encour- 
aged to offer in addition courses in drafting as such, but 
related, as far as practicable, to the various shop and home- 
making courses. 
When drafting is taught as a junior high school subject 
the vocational aspect will need to be stressed. This would 
require an investigation of the part which drafting plays in 
the productive industries and in the trades and professions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  82 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
The pupil should know the significance of drafting in manu- 
facturing and he should know something of its use by the 
carpenter, mason, sheet-metal worker, plumber, electrician 
and machinist. He should also realize the value of a knowl- 
edge of drafting to the engineer, the architect and the land- 
scape architect. He should inquire into the conditions 
under which draftsmen work and regarding the opportunities 
afforded them for leisure, study and advancement. Special 
junior high school courses in mechanical drawing should in 
short lay a firm foundation in mechanical rendering aiming to 
give facility in the use of instruments and an understanding of 
dimensioning, drawing to scale, sections, auxiliary views, screw 
threads, and bills of material. Instruction in the development 
of surfaces should also be included as well as some of the other 
types of drawing peculiar to the vocations mentioned. 
Pupils upon completing the junior high school curriculum 
are admitted to the more highly specialized art instruction 
offered in the senior high school. Courses with a vocational 
trend are at present being offered in many of our high schools as 
advanced electives. The elective system makes it possible for 
senior high school pupils to specialize to a considerable extent 
in art. The instruction is intensely practical and in most 
instances is given by teachers who are themselves designers or 
craft workers. 
All senior high school art courses should prepare directly for 
entrance to professional art schools and to art courses in the 
colleges. Sometimes they should prepare also for entrance to 
industry. General courses in art in the senior high school 
grades usually emphasize the household field, while the courses 
preparing for entrance to the art industries point directly 
toward specific vocations in the commercial or industrial fields. 
If a special diploma course in art is not provided, the elective 
system makes possible at least some specialization in the art 
field. The number of elective courses is increasing rapidly. 
In 1922-23 there were 153 high schools and academies in the 
State of New York offering 38 advanced art courses as 
indicated on following page:

A flexible senior high school program should make provision 
in its elective system for anumber of semi-specialized courses in 
drafting, among which might appropriately be included a course
-P-A-G-E-82
  84 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
or courses in shop sketching, engineering drawing, cams and 
gears, electrical drafting, sheet-metal drafting, and architec- 
tural drafting. Some of these courses might even be extended 
over a two or even a three year period. Considerable practice 
in lettering should be given in connection with all of the 
courses. 
There are at present available in New York State two course 
sequences in art planned for grades 9, 10, 11 and 12, one lead- 
ing to an Art Diploma and the other to a Diploma in Technical 
Subjects, Industrial Art. The first of these sequences is cul- 
tural in aim although it affords some opportunity for special- 
ization; its graduates are admitted to most special schools 
of art without examination. The second sequence is decidedly 
vocational in aim. The two sequences are outlined below.

43 40     The high school art courses in the City of New York are 
planned to meet two needs. The first is the need felt by most 
of the pupils who have little talent but who can be educated in 
taste. The second and smaller group is made up of those 
pupils who possess considerable talent and consequently can be 
trained in technique. The work offered to most pupils, there- 
fore, is elementary and is designed to raise their standards of 
taste. Although few pupils are gifted with natural talent it is 
maintained that these few should be gradually trans- 
formed into skilled artisans and artists. The aim of the art 
department in senior high school is to provide means for  
-P-A-G-E-84
  86 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
capturing the talented pupils and for placing them in classes 
where they can be especially trained.! 
The Washington Irving High School for girls in New York 
City now offers in connection with its elective system a post- 
graduate course in art for pupils who are high school graduates 
and who desire to specialize in art related to commerce and the 
industries. The course is two years in length and covers the 
same two years of work as the course for the regular art students. 
It permits the post-graduate student to specialize in drawing 
alone if she so desires, thereby shortening the required work to 
one year. The subjects stressed are commercial design and 
costume illustration. 
Questions for Study and Review 
1. Why are art and industrial arts taught as separate subjects in the 
junior high school years? 
2. Why is instruction in drawing important in most types of art courses? 
3. How may the aim of general art appreciation be realized through the 
teaching of freehand drawing? Mechanical drawing? 
4. How would you provide for vocational guidance in art in the junior 
high school course? 
5. What is the chief purposes of the art department in the senior high 
school? 
6. Why is an elective system in senior high schools which makes possible 
a free choice of subjects desirable from the standpoint of art training? 
7. What special art courses would one expect to find in senior high school 
departments of the following cities: Grand Rapids, Michigan? 
Providence, Rhode Island? Philadelphia, Pennsylvania? 
8. What emphasis should be placed on lettering in a special course in 
commercial art? 
1In 1922-1923 there were enrolled in these courses over 2000 high 
school pupils.

       CHAPTER VI 
THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 
The main objectives of education set up by the Commission 
on the Reorganization of Secondary Education of the 
National Education Association are: health, command of the 
fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, 
citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character.!_ Let 
us consider art in terms of the contribution that this subject 
makes to the realization of these objectives. What have phys- 
ical and mental work to do with health? Do beautiful 
surroundings contribute to this end? Has color any effect 
upon health? What are the fundamental processes? May 
drawing be regarded as one of these? May we consider any 
of the constructive processes involved in drawing as funda- 
mental? What is the significance of design in home furnish- 
ing? Does a knowledge of art principles contribute to one’s 
efficiency as a member of the household? Does artistic taste 
contribute to this objective? To what extent should 
vocational needs be met by instruction in art? How can such 
instruction be made to promote citizenship? How can a 
knowledge of art enable one to employ his leisure to the 
best advantage and what bearing has this on the topic of 
ethical character? Does an analogy exist between “the 
beautiful” and “‘the good?” 
“From whichever side education be defined,”’ says Dewey, 
“whether from that of the community carrying it on or that 
of the individual educated, it will be found to involve three 
factors, which may be distinguished but not separated. These 
are (a) the specific institutions which are differentiated for 
the special work of education, (b) the subject matter and (c)

  88 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
the typical methods of discipline and instruction employed to 
realize the ends in view.”’! 
The junior high school is coming to be one of the most 
important of the specific institutions charged with an educa- 
tional function. It has been defined in the International 
Dictionary as a school organization intermediate between the 
grammar school and the high school, formed by a union of 
the upper grades of the grammar school usually with one, 
and occasionally with two grades of the high school, making 
a separate group and aiming to provide for individual differ- 
ences among students and also to facilitate transfer from the 
grammar school to the high school, especially by allowing a 
limited amount of election of studies by employing 
departmental teachers. 
Three types of curriculums are at the present time offered 
in junior high schools scattered over the United States. These 
are (1) the constants-with-variables type, (2) the single curric- 
ulum type and (3) the multiple curriculum type. Of the 
three, the constants-with-variables type of curriculum is the 
most satisfactory since it makes provision for the widest range 
of choice of subjects and courses and contributes most to the 
vocational and educational guidance aims that are important 
at this period in the pupil’s development. In the junior 
high school the project method should be made use of in all 
studies, and promotion should be by subject. 
In the previous chapter a program in art for junior and senior 
high schools was outlined. It will be our province in this chap- 
ter to enlarge upon this outline, calling attention to the various 
phases of subject matter to be included and suggesting ways of 
developing detailed courses of instruction. 
At the outset we shall accept nature as the most important 
source of inspiration because it will be recognized that nature 
is the source of all life and of all things that are produced solely 
by natural causes. Consequently the dependence of art on 
nature for all material things and even for the governing 
principles of design is complete. Some of the evidence of the 
1 Dewey, John (edited by Monroe, Paul): “A Cyclopedia of Educa- 
tion.” The Macmillan Co., New York, 1911.
-P-A-G-E-87
THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 89 
eternal workings of nature are the diurnal changes from dawn 
to morning, noon, afternoon, twilight, evening and night; the 
climatic changes from torrid to temperate and frigid; the 
weather changes from warm to cold and from humid to arid, 
from clear to cloudy and stormy. Space is defined in terms of 
zenith, middle-distance and horizon. Nature is also inti- 
mately associated with religion. Nature is the guide to 
craftsmanship and dictates fitness to purpose; it suggests 
design motifs, color and pattern in its sun, moon, stars, moun- 
tains and valleys, in its oceans, lakes, trees, flowers, foliage, 
insects, birds and animals and people. Nature was the source 
of most historic ornament. The highest interpretation and 
expression of ideas and ideals derived from nature have pro- 
duced the best art of most peoples and periods in history. 
The motivation and background for the general course in 
art in junior high schools may well be chosen from the fields 
of painting, sculpture, architecture, industry and commerce. 
A brief analysis of each of these topics follows. 
Painting.—The most elementary form of representation is 
linear drawing. Next in difficulty comes representation in 
black and white and in values of gray. Painting consists in 
representation by means of pigments, generally applied with a 
brush. The materials and methods of painting have varied 
with peoples and periods. An historical survey of the field of 
painting includes a consideration of the following nationalities 
or schools, preferably in the order in which the names are 
given: Egyptian, Chaldaeo-Assyrian, Greek, Etruscan and 
Roman, Italian, French, Spanish, Flemish, Dutch, German, 
British and American.! The past in painting should be 
studied with a view to making present art clear, particularly 
the art of America. 
Sculpture is the art of modeling, carving or casting material 
artistically into statues or decorative ornament. An historical 
survey of the art of sculpture includes the following: 
Prehistoric, Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Hittite, 
Phoenician and Cypriote, Greek, Italic and Etruscan, Roman,

Early Christian and Byzantine, Mediaeval (in Italy, France 
and Germany), Renaissance (in Italy, France and Germany), 
Modern (in Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Russia, 
France and England), and America.!' The past is studied for 
the sake of making clear the qualities that the historic schools 
have contributed to modern sculpture. Attention should be 
directed especially to the results of these historic influences on 
the sculpture of America. 
Architecture has to do with the construction of buildings. 
The manner of building, throughout the ages, has been char- 
acterized by certain styles of construction and ornamentation, 
chief among which are the Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Early 
Christian, Saracenic, Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance. 
Each of these styles has contributed to modern architecture 
certain forms of construction and decorative patterns which 
furnish inspiration for building. The distinguishing features 
of the historic styles may be stated briefly as follows: Egyptian 
—majesty, solidity, colossal size; Greek—simplicity, sym- 
metry and grace, monumental repose, column and lintel con- 
struction, in dressed marble; Roman—civic building, utility 
and imposing appearance, arched construction, combining the 
Greek orders; Early Christian—in the east, large interiors with 
the dome, for public worship and, in the west, adaptation of 
the Roman Basilica; Saracenic—first use of the pointed arch, 
elaborate decoration in color; Romanesque—massive, develop- 
ment of stone vaults, round arched openings, small windows, 
somber dignity; Gothic—strain brought upon isolated points 
and balanced, walls less important than windows, ribbed 
vaulting, pointed arches, vertical lines, vastness, complexity, 
mystery; Renaissance—revival and adaptation of classic 
Roman types.” In all types of architecture fitness to purpose 
is the governing principle. At the present time steel and rein-

forced concrete construction are important. In America 
civic and domestic architecture are both worthy of careful 
study and analysis. The subject of architecture is here inter- 
preted to include interior decoration. 
Industry implies purposeful human effort. It includes the 
transformation of natural forces and natural materials into 
mechanical energy or finished products, either by tool or by 
machine. Some of the industries in which the element of art 
is most significant are: ceramics, including pottery which 
embraces art ware, dinner and hotel ware, terra cotta and brick 
and tile; costumes, including dresses, suits and cloaks, waists, 
negligees, and children’s dresses; furniture, including the 
special forms for various purposes and rooms; lighting fixtures 
for streets, public buildings and homes; machinery and tools; 
printing, including books, magazines and newspapers; textiles, 
including woven and printed patterns, tie dying and batik; 
and wall paper. The evoluton of the art industries 
should be studied especially as they have been developed 
in America. 
Commerce is concerned with trade and especially with the 
buying and selling of commodities. Commercial art comprises 
the designing of various advertising forms for newspapers, 
magazines, bill boards, circulars, leaflets, announcements, car 
cards, and other posters. Commercial art includes therefore 
the planning of advertising publications or the arrangement of 
typed material and illustrations on the page, the arrangement 
of the pages with reference to one another and the choice of 
paper stock and inks as well as the designing of trade marks and 
letter heads, commercial illustration, artistic sign painting and 
scene painting. 
As an aid to teachers in planning their courses a summary 
outline is given on pages 92 and 93. The outline is not 
exhaustive; it defines to some extent the scope of the 
field. Each topic may be elaborated and developed more 
fully, and some topics not included in the lists may be 
added.

With sufficient motivation and background furnished from 
the fields of painting, sculpture, architecture, industry or com- 
merce, the teacher should be able to secure maximum 
educational value in his instruction provided that the technical 
information relating to artistic expression and appreciation is 
properly organized and used. This technical information nat- 
urally groups itself under the following six topics: color, freehand 
representation of form, design, lettering, mechanical rep- 
resentation of form, and appreciation. Some of the con- 
tent included under these topics is indicated in the outline

11. Vocational opportunities 
The preceding technical information outline will constitute 
a fund of source material from which all junior high school 
art teachers should be able to get help and suggestions. This 
outline together with that dealing with motivation (see page 
92), will constitute the teacher’s general educational plan 
for grades 7, 8 and 9. How the work should be distributed 
and assigned by years will not be discussed in detail here. 
Suffice it to say that this will have to be determined almost 
entirely by the needs of the boys and girls and by their 
psychological ability to profit by the instruction. The simpler 
phases of subject matter would necessarily come in seventh 
grade; the more complex, in eighth grade; and the most 
difficult, in ninth grade. 
In developing lesson programs and lesson plans based on the 
outlines given it will be necessary for the teacher, first, to select 
the motive; second, to assemble the technical information, and 
third, to organize all into a logical and psychological unit of 
instruction. 
Lesson program making should precede the writing of 
individual lesson plans. From such programs the making of 
daily plans will be a relatively simple task. There follows a 
series of six lesson programs based on the outlines of motiva- 
tion. One lesson plan accompanies each program. These 
outlines were prepared by Gertrude A. Roe of the New 
Rochelle, New York, Public Schools, in connection with the 
teacher-training work at Potsdam State Normal School.!

I. Kinds of Painting 
1. Pastel is a variety of painting in dry chalk. This is commonly 
designated as pastel rather than painting. 
2. Fresco is painted decoration done on wet plaster, the pigment 
colors being mixed with water and powdered lime. Most of 
the wall painting of ancient Egypt and of Europe down to the 
sixteenth century was done on this foundation. Such painting 
on stone and wood was generally protected by a varnish or 
glaze. The color was sometimes “burned” into the surface 
by means of hot wax. 
3. Tempera is painted decoration in which the pigments are mixed 
with an emulsion of egg yoke, white of egg or liquid glue and 
vinegar. This method was used extensively in the later middle 
ages and is still employed in scene painting and wall 
decorations. 
4, Oil painting with canvas as the surface material, came into use 
almost to the exclusion of every other form. Water color 
painting refers to any process in which the colors are mixed 
with water. 
II. Development of Painting 
The noblest works of art are those in which reality is reinforced by 
rhythm of line, purity of color and balance of parts, in which the 
complete work constitutes, as in poetry or other work of art, a 
harmonious whole, interesting in content and in manner of 
execution. Most paintings contain both the descriptive and the 
pictorial element, but one or the other usually predominates; 
thus all painting is divided into two groups, illustration and 
decoration. In illustration the emphasis is directed toward telling 
a story; in decoration the primary purpose is to treat a surface 
in such a way as to delight the eye.?

ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
1. Prehistoric paintings have been discovered in many of the caves 
of Perigord and the Pyrenees (France). Certain animal forms 
drawn by these ancient people will bear comparison with the 
fine animal studies of modern artists. The artist represented 
the animals in lively and picturesque attitudes. 
The first painting done was on the walls of sepulchres and com- 
memorated the deeds of the deceased. Symbolic illustration 
also appeared on the walls of public buildings, a single tree repre- 
senting a forest, the human figure being drawn with the body 
facing the spectator with the eyes to the front while the face, 
legs and feet were in profile. These same peculiarities appeared 
for thousands of years, and artists for a long time failed to 
make the slightest effort to give a more realistic imitation of 
nature. If the form was sufficiently life-like to be recognized 
it was thought to be adequate. Painting was then merely 
coloring without gradation of values. 
2. Assyria-Babylonia 
The painting of these countries resembles that of Egypt, although 
it shows great advance in the representation of form. Great 
skill was shown in drawing, and the subjects were mythological 
and temporary. The representation of animals (horses, dogs, 
and lions) constitutes the finest expression of Assyrian art. 
Cruelty and pain are often depicted. 
3. Mycenaea 
Heinrich Schliemann, a German archaeologist, brought to light 
relics of the art of the islands and coast of the Aegian Sea. 
Mural paintings amazing in variety and freedom of style 
ornamented the walls of palaces. Figures, hunting scenes, 
landscapes, painted pottery decorated with plant and animal 
forms were some of the subjects. An excellent example of 
Minoan painting is found in fresco depicting a scene at a circus. 
There is a copy of this painting in the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art. 
4, Greece 
In designs for the handicrafts, pottery, utensils, coins and 
jewelry, is to be found the key to the progress and development 
of Gréek art. Only a few of the paintings of the early Greek 
painters have been preserved. Parrhasius, Apelles, Zeuxis 
and Polygnotus are among those whose names have come 
down tous. The best example of painting which has survived 
is the nuptial scene known as the Aldobrandini Wedding, in 
the Vatican at Rome. Painting was employed extensively in 
the decoration of public buildings. Nearly all statuary was 
painted, and the sculptured details on the marble buildings 
were colored.   1 Reinach, Apollo.

  THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 
5. Etruria 
The Etruscans were strongly influenced by the Greeks but they 
did not have the same love of life as did the Greeks. In their 
art there is originality, vigor, violence and bitterness. The 
frescos of the tombs of the Etrurians tell stories of sacrifices 
and killings. However, a decorative genius is revealed in 
these terrible scenes. Etruria was the intermediate step in the 
progress of art from East to West. 
6. Rome 
Roman painting shows the influence of Greek and Etruscan art, 
but from the middle of the first century of our own era an 
original style developed. This style was impressionistic and 
free in execution, not unlike the modern impressionistic paint- 
ing. Mural decorations at Pompeii, executed in this style, 
have not been surpassed in our own times.! A fine example 
of Roman painting is Zros with a Ladder. It is still preserved 
in Rome. 
7. Early Christian 
The early Christian paintings are of little esthetic interest. 
They show heaviness, crowded compositions and incorrect 
drawing. The art of the early Christians found a perfect 
medium in mosaic, cubes of colored marble and glass set in 
cement plaster. The rigid, unpliable nature of this medium 
allowed but slight opportunity for the expression of the 
artist’s individuality. Beautifully colored mosaics may be 
seen in Rome and Ravenna and in the Church of St. Sophia 
at Constantinople. 
8. Early Italian 
This includes the Gothic period, 1250 to 1400, when the chief 
medium of the artist was stained glass. The Gothic churches 
had no large surfaces for painted decoration. Windows also 
became the chief outlet for the talent of the figure painter. 
The chief characteristic of these windows is beauty of color, 
the subject matter chosen from human experience being 
expressed with dignity and simplicity. The great development 
in painting took place in Italy, and the revival of art in the 
thirteenth century is due to Duccio, Cimabue and Giotto. 
Fresco painting became the typical process of Gothic and early 
Renaissance Italy, just as mosaic was typical of the Byzantine 
style, stained glass of the pictorial art of the thirteenth century 
French, and oil painting of modern times.? In the works of 
the early masters fine design in a picture was the first consid- 
eration, representation being subordinate to the principles of 
composition. There were two chief schools of painting, the

      ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Sienese School founded by Duccio and the Florentine School 
founded by Cimabue, the master of Giotto. The paintings of 
Simone Martini, Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti are second 
only to those of Giotto. 
9. Early Renaissance in Italy (the period of preparation) 
In the idealistic painting of the early artists “the work is not to 
be criticised because it does not give correct reproduction of 
nature or of man.” ‘The point to be decided is whether it 
expresses the artist’s meaning. The Florentine sculptor 
Donatello was the first to abandon the ideals of the fourteenth 
century and to lead the way to the great naturalistic line of 
Renaissance painters. 
The works of Fra Angelico may be classed with early Italian paint- 
ing while Masaccio combined the fine qualities of the style of 
Giotto with his own appreciation of natural forms and real 
effects of space. Perspective, anatomy, character, expression 
and landscape displaced the decorative beauty and tranquility 
of the fourteenth century. The development of painting 
in this period may be studied in the works of Masaccio, Sassetta, 
Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, Gozzoli, Botticelli, Filippino 
Lippi, Ghirlandajo, Mantegna, Perugino, Signorelli, Piero det 
Franceschi, the Bellini and Carpaccio. These artists were 
from the schools of Florence, Sienna, Umbria, Padua and 
Venice. 
10. High Renaissance painting in Italy (the period of achievement) 
All the intellectual curiosity of the Renaissance, its dreams 
of glory and of infinite progress, its enthusiasm for science and 
for beauty were combined in Leonardo da Vinci. He was the 
most poetical of painters and the most scientific—the summing 
up of the endeavors of generations. The method of earlier 
art was the filling in of more or less flat color between outlines. 
After Leonardo the use of graded values has been practiced, 
chiaroscuro (as the painting of light and dark is called) with 
the outline showing only where colors or light and dark 
contrast. 
Michelangelo, the most individual and independent artist of all 
history, appears as an insolated figure. He was a sculptor 
primarily and his paintings have the quality of sculpture, in 
which landscape, perspective and atmosphere play no part. 
He created a race of mighty giants which decorated the 
ceiling and wall of the Sistine Chapel. 
Raphael “the divine painter” is the third great artist of this 
period. He was influenced by the works of Perugino, Pin- 
turicchio, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Fra Bartolommeo 
and others. However, his own individuality was too powerful 
to allow him to become distracted by conflicting influences.
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 103 
Raphael was a good illustrator. His type of virgin has won 
all hearts. He was a marvellous creator of images but in 
some instances he was a mediocre colorist.1 
In order to appreciate this period of painting one must study 
carefully the lives and works of Luini,-Bartolommeo, Andrea 
del Sarto, Correggio and others. 
11. High Renaissance painting in Venice 
The Venetians loved pleasure, fine clothes, courtly assemblages 
and stately pageants. These tendencies are reflected in 
Venetian painting; it is gay, luminous, full of the joy of life; it 
loves to depict magnificent processions or social gatherings. 
The painters were not concerned with actualities, they wished 
to paint beautiful bodies and gorgeous costumes, to suggest 
the idea of free and joyous life against a luminous background 
of landscape.? ‘The finest painters of this period are Giorgione, 
Titian and Tintoretto, also Vecchio, Veronese, Lotto, Piombo 
and Tiepolo. 
12. Flemish painting 
The Italian styles transplanted to the other nations of Europe 
flourished vigorously. Thestyle of the greatest Flemish painter, 
Rubens, was also formed in Italy. To appreciate Rubens it is 
often necessary to disregard the personality of his figures and 
to look at them as instruments for the expression of abstract 
qualities of materials and emotional life. His skill in composi- 
tion, his mastery of drawing and his magical color, at once 
rich and cool, have exerted a powerful influence on other 
artists.? 
Van Dyck, Ruben’s pupil, was also greatly attracted by Venetian 
art. His best work was done in portraits. 
Hubert van Eyck, Jan van Eyck, Roger van der Weyden, and 
Hans Memling are other famous Flemish artists of this period. 
13. Dutch painting 
In contrast to Italian religious painters the Dutch portrayed 
themselves and their own lives, sometimes with supreme art, 
sometimes with mere fidelity to fact.¢ 
Frans Hals worked by values. His pictures exhibit a beautiful 
rendering of the details of costume. He also revealed the 
beauty in the things of every day life.

  ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Rembrandt has been called the master of masters. He repre- 
sented the Christ and his Mother, and his followers as everyday 
folk, at the same time seeking to express the inward significance 
of the sacred theme. He was a master of line and color includ- 
ing dark and light. His etchings are as famous as his paintings. 
He is the greatest of the portrait painters. 
Teniers the younger, Pieter de Hoogh, Vermeer of Delft, Hobbema, 
and Ruysdael, are some of the greatest artists of the Dutch 
school. The last two are landscape painters who exercised 
great influence in modern landscape painting. 
Spanish painting 
The great period of Spanish painting was the seventeenth 
century. There were three groups of painters, one at Valencia, 
one at Seville and one at Madrid. Each group contained one 
or more artists of superior distinction. 
Velasquez was the master of the Spanish school. His motto 
was “truth, not painting.” He aimed to unify the impression 
the eye receives by a relation of values. His pictures are 
permeated by a light which unifies the whole. In the nine- 
teenth century his work inspired the impressionists. As a 
result of his duties at the court of the king he became one of 
the greatest portrait painters. 
Ribera, Zurbaran, Murillo, El Greco, Goya, Fortuny and Sorolla 
are artists of the Spanish school. 
German painting 
Chief among the artists of the German school are Durer, Alt- 
dorfer, Cranach and Holbein. Of these Holbein is the best 
known. His portraits are pleasing in subject, correct in 
dark and light, and interesting in the study of detail. 
French painting 
French painting also shows the influence of the Italian Renais- 
sance, but the French gave more importance to landscape 
than did the Italians. Poussin’s renderings of scriptural 
subjects are among the finest illustrations of the Bible. Claude 
Lorrain made landscapes the important motive of his pictures 
and he has expressed as no one else has ever done the serenity 
and inspiration of extended views (space, sky, water and 
light). Watteau was the inaugurator of a dainty and charming 
art depicting pensive people in enchanted gardens. Chardin 
was an excellent painter, akin to Dutch naturalists though more 
refined than they. 
David and Ingres are painters of the classical revival (1748-1867), 
Gericault and Delacroix, painters of the romantic school (1791— 
1803). Delacroix took the subject of his most famous pictures 
from Dante, Shakespeare, Byron, the Crusades, and the
-P-A-G-E-103
THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 105 
French Revolution. He painted with energy of life and 
expression. He had a fine sense of color, and prepared the way 
for modern impressionism.! 
Rousseau, Daubigny, Corot and Millet were French painters 
of the Barbizon School. They constituted a group of artists 
who worked at Barbizon, in the forest of Fontainebleau. 
They were founders of the naturalistic movement which 
exemplified a compromise between the Romantic School and 
the Realistic School. 
Realism was inevitable and its creed was pronounced by Courbet 
(in 1850); ‘Nothing at all should be invented, only things 
actually seen should be pictured.” Courbet influenced the 
evolution of painting in the last half of the 19th century. 
Manet carried on the principles of Courbet, adding a true effect 
of color and light, and freedom of subject matter.2 The 
culmination of the movement took place in the work of the 
impressionists, Pissarro, Degas, Manet, Renoir and Puvis de 
Chavannes. 
Impressionism is quite largely the study of light, for it represents 
things as they appear, which has to do with color which is 
reflected light. All objects are visible because of light and 
shadow. 
Manet was influenced by the works of Turner, and Pissarro, 
and the art of the Japanese. His style, selection of subject 
and composition may be compared with the work of Hokusai 
and Hiroshige. He experienced and expressed nature’s ecstacy. 
The decorative paintings of Puvis de Chavannes are truly decora- 
ative, and express fitness to purpose. 
17. English painting 
English paintings before the 18th century were the works of 
foreign artists such as Holbein and Van Dyck. Reynolds and 
Gainsborough were true English artists who attained great 
manipulative skill but they were occupied less with truth than 
with grace. Constable and Turner infused a new enthusiasm 
into English painting. 
18. American painting 
Copley, West, Stuart and Trumbull were the outstanding artists 
of Colonial America. Durand and Cole helped to found the 
Hudson River School of landscapists. They were enthusiastic 
about American scenery and types. This movement was not 
strong enough to withstand the competition of European art, 
and soon American painting verged rapidly toward cosmopol- 
itanism. Whistler and Sargent are the last great painters of 
1 Reinach, Apollo.

this period. Our strongest nature painters are perhaps 
Homer and Inness who produced pictures that were American 
in point of view and of a technical excellence comparable to 
European work. The names of Martin, Cassatt, Alexander, 
Hunt, La Farge, Low, Chase, Hassam, Vedder, Blashfield, 
Ranger, Dougherty, Brush, Thayer, Lie and Wiles are important 
in the annals of modern American Art.

Interpretation: 
Taste is personal. Consequently each individual should interpret 
all works for himself, basing his opinions on feelings gained from 
as intimate a knowledge as possible of the lives and emotions of the 
peoples whose work is under observation. Sense interpretation is 
of importance here. So also is an applied knowledge of the princi- 
ples of rhythm and balance. 
Application: 
Kinds of sculpture: The various kinds of sculpture as to subject and 
form are all present in the art of ancient Egypt. The characteristics 
of each is adequately illustrated in the works of Egyptian sculpture. 
Development of man as revealed in sculpture 
Art history is in its essentials the history of man, for no one can write 
the story of art in more than a superficial way without following the 
relation of each school to the ideas of its period and its people.? 
Works of sculpture, past and present, should be approached from three 
sides, the social, the psychological and the esthetic. Information

on the social side, or that. which deals with the relation of indi- 
viduals working together, can be gleaned from general histories deal- 
ing with the periods involved, or from contemporary social writings. 
The psychological side, which has to do with the mind of man, is 
intimately associated with opinions and beliefs and the observance 
of customs and ceremonies for the most part religious in character. 
Information on the psychological side can be obtained from religious 
books and the encyclopedias. The esthetic side, or that dealing 
with beauty and taste, is inadequately treated in most histories and 
criticisms. On the esthetic side will be found the open road for the 
problem method in teaching art for appreciation. Full apprecia- 
tion, however, will require that considerable emphasis be placed on 
the social and psychological sides. 
Fitness to purpose (harmony) 
Embodiment of the idea is illustrated in all great works of sculpture. 
The expression of an idea was back of the crudest representation of 
animal forms carved from reindeer horn by primitive man. Emo- 
tion charged thought was also back of the Assyrian bas-reliefs which 
depicted the king in battle. Harmony results when the idea is 
expressed appropriately. This requires suitable materials and 
suitable handling. 
Expression of attitude and emotion is one of the chief functions of 
sculpture. The intensity of the expression is often an important 
factor in determining quality and excellence in a work. Chief among 
the emotions expressed in sculpture are joy, grief, fear, hate, love, 
awe and reverence. 
With reference to their surroundings works of sculpture should be so 
placed that they are in harmony with their environment. 
As a supplement to architecture works of sculpture should be in 
harmony with the architectural work which they adorn. They 
should form an integral part of the work.

Art IN SCULPTURE 
Lesson Plan 
General.—To appreciate art in sculpture 
ProsieM j Special.—To investigate sculpture as a means 
of expressing emotion. 
Supsecr.—Study examples of animal sculpture in which the 
emotional element is dominant. 
Meruop.—Explanation. Exercise. Application in art 
teaching. 
The first animal carvings of the reindeer hunters express genuine 
emotion. The Egyptian sculptors expressed in their work a sincere 
love for nature’s creatures and joy in caring for them. In the 
sculpture of ancient Assyria, on the other hand, cruelty and pain 
were forcefully expressed. In like manner we find that all races 
and most schools down to the present time, have expressed emotion 
in their sculpture. 
We shall find that the higher animals are capable of showing emotion 
not only in their actions but even in their physical characteristics 
and the attitudes that they assume. Among dogs we shall find 
that the airedale is often disconsolate and even dignified; the 
bulldog, sluggish and pugnacious; the police dog, treacherous and 
vicious; the collie, affectionate and alert; the spaniel, pensive and 
faithful; the greyhound, confident and impatient, and the terrier 
playful, solicitous of attention and hilariously friendly. 
We can imagine the solitary figure of an airedale stretched out on the 
ground with a ball between his teeth; a bulldog standing guard over 
a child’s toy; a police dog gnawing at a bone; a collie welcoming the 
return of her master; a spaniel “speaking” for a morsel of food; a 
greyhound surveying a fence preparatory to a leap; a terrier barking 
to get attention.

  112 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Exercise 
Make a collection of pictures of dogs. 
Model in clay (in the round) the figure of a dog in a characteristic pose 
expressive of emotion. 
Application in Teaching 
The principles of rhythm of movement and perfect balance are illus- 
trated nowhere better than in animals in action. Here we find the 
natural organism ideally adapted to its environment and its func- 
tions. All parts work together to produce harmony. 
In the modeling of an animal form these principles are ever before the 
worker. His aim will be to catch the natural rhythm and balance 
expressed in the living form and to translate them by applying them 
in his work with clay. 
ArT IN ARCHITECTURE 
Lesson Program 
General.—To appreciate art in architecture. 
ProsiemM j Special—To investigate architecture from the 
standpoint of its evolution: 
Supsect.—Definition. Development of architecture and 
architecture ornament. The structural emphasis. Fit- 
ness to purpose in architecture. 
Meruop.—Lecture. Explanation. Demonstration. Dis- 
cussion. Exercise. Criticism. 
I. Architecture is the science and art of building. 
II. Development of architecture and architectural ornament. 
1. Dolmens and menhirs mark the beginning of architecture, but 
of architecture scarcely worthy of the name, for decoration 
plays hardly any part in it, and the elements of construction 
can claim no excellence other than that of a massive solidity. 
It was the Roman conquest which gave the Gauls the principles 
and the first models of architecture.t We can best study the 
development of architecture by considering it under the differ- 
ent nations and periods in which it has made distinct 
advancement. 
2. Egypt 
The Egyptians believed that the body must be preserved after 
death for the soul to dwell in; hence they built their tombs for 
eternity, and gave little attention to their houses, which they 
18. Reinach, Apollo.
-P-A-G-E-111
   THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 113 
considered but temporary abodes. This fact accounts for the 
distinguishing features of Egyptian architecture, i.e., majesty 
and solidity, durability, and colossal size. We find examples 
of these characteristics in the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx 
(one of the finest examples of principality and subordination), 
the statues of Rameses II, temples at Karnak, Luxor and 
Abydos, avenues of Sphinxes (example of rhythmic 
arrangement). 
After monumental architecture, the greatest gift of the Egyptians 
to art was their system of decoration. The structural forms 
employed by the Egyptians were few and simple consisting of 
large round columns with carvings from their two favorite 
plants, the lotus and the papyrus. The roofs of the temples 
consisted chiefly of flat stones supported on pillars. The 
construction of the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid indi- 
cates that the Egyptians knew the principle of the arch, 
although they did not apply this principle in the construction 
of their temples. The walls of the structure were much 
thicker at the base than at the top, and the temples were 
entered through massive gateways or pylons, whose ruins 
are still the wonder of the world.” 
3. Assyria and Babylonia 
The architecture of Assyria and Babylonia is also of great 
antiquity, though the building materials of sundried and burnt 
brick were not so enduring as the granite and limestone of 
Egypt. The temples of Babylon were in the shape of a pyra- 
mid with steps surmounted by a chapel containing the image 
of the god. The most interesting feature of Assyrian archi- 
tecture is the importance given to the vault. Assyrian art 
greatly influenced Persia and Asia Minor. 
4, Greece 
In simplicity and beauty of design the ancient Greeks excel all 
other peoples, ancient or modern. The Greeks developed 
three orders of architecture, the Doric (solidity), the Ionic 
(elegance), and the Corinthian (luxury). They employed 
their skill in the construction of temples and of public buildings, 
never in the construction of private dwellings. Their art 
reached its highest degree of skill in the time of Praxiteles, 
when the Parthenon and other buildings were constructed on 
the Acropolis. 
The Parthenon is perhaps the most beautifully proportioned 
building in the world. In constructing it the great blocks of 
marble were adjusted without the use of cement.

  ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Sculpture was the most logical form of decoration for exterior 
and interior spaces. The cella walls (around the god) the 
pediment, the frieze, and the metopes of Greek temples were 
made exquisite with relief decorations of gods, men and horses, 
all teeming with the spirit of life. 
Abstract motives were also used in the ornamentation of Greek 
architecture, such as the Greek fret and the egg and dart 
motive. 
5. Rome 
Among the Greeks the outward form revealed the internal 
structure of the building. Their architectural decorations 
served to show off to better advantage the strength of that 
which they concealed. The Romans on the other hand 
took the prominent features of their construction, the arch 
and the vault, from the Etruscans, and adding to them the 
Greek column and entablature, produced a system of architec- 
ture that, in spite of all its magnificance, never became an 
organic whole. Practical good sense and executive ability 
are everywhere shown in the construction of their buildings, 
but as a rule we have to look for these merits under a mass of 
magnificent but sometimes inappropriate decoration.! 
The Romans added two orders, the Tuscan and the Composite. 
They also used glazed tile for the decoration of interiors. 
The Pantheon and Colosseum are examples of Roman archi- 
tecture. The Basilica (hall of justice) also belongs to Roman 
architecture. 
6, Byzantine or Early Christian 
Byzantine architecture was developed under the influence of the 
eastern church but it was formulated by the Roman emperor 
Justinian. Byzantine art was an art of mingled influences, 
developed out of Roman traditions, modified by Greek taste, 
and liberally tinctured with oriental elements. Its period of 
finest inspiration was the sixth century, after which it became 
formalized, disappearing after the conquest of Constantinople 
by the Turks (1453). 
The dome became the leading feature of Byzantine architecture 
of which the church of Santa Sophia is one of the finest exam- 
ples. The walls were inlaid with mosaics on a gold ground. 
The exterior was left unornamented. 
Byzantine architecture may be studied in Rome, Ravenna and 
Constantinople. It is characterized by the absence of the 
human figure in sculptural ornament, purely geometrical and 
conventional figures, colored glass, beautiful mosaics, gilding, 
profusion of color, and luxury.

7. Romanesque 
When Rome was conquered by the Goths, the great works of 
art and architecture were destroyed, and a new style of archi- 
tecture known as the Romanesque arose. All western Europe 
was endeavoring to solve one problem, the conversion of the 
three-aisled Roman basilica into a vaulted structure. This 
problem is the key to the world of medieval architecture in 
western Europe, the Romanesque styles being the first 
stages, and the magnificent cathedrals of the thirteenth and 
fourteenth centuries, the achievement. The Romanesque 
is essentially a form of religious architecture, and represents 
the Gallic and the German developments of the basilica. 
The characteristics of Romanesque architecture are as follows: 
round headed arches, vaulted roof, one or more towers, thick 
solid walls, few windows. The Cathedral and Leaning Tower 
of Pisa are splendid examples of the Romanesque style of 
architecture. 
The bas-relief ornamented the typana of porches, and figures 
of men and of animals ornamented the capitals of columns and 
friezes, but these figures were lacking in reality. 
8. Saracenic 
The wandering tribes of Saracens, welded together by the 
Mohammedan religion, carried their faith by the might of the 
sword from the Atlantic ocean to the Ganges. Since images 
were forbidden by the Koran their artistic genius found vent 
in architecture. The style of architecture was more or less 
modified by the character of the buildings already existing in 
the various countries which they conquered. The decoration 
of Mohammedan architecture is very beautiful. Conven- 
tional plants and animals, intricate geometric figures, and 
texts from the Koran were interwoven in an exquisite surface 
ornamentation of gold and gorgeous colours, which is known 
as arabesque. The Alhambra at Granada is an example of 
this architecture. The Taj-Mahal, near Agra, India, is some- 
times considered the most beautiful building in the world. 
9. Gothic 
The Gothic style began in France in the twelfth century, and 
rapidly extended to other countries. The builders of the great 
cathedrals represented the highest religious, intellectual and 
artistic genius of the times in which they lived. The Gothic 
cathedrals were an expression of the nations’ love of liberty. 
In their upward soaring and spreading vistas they symbolized 
the aspirations, adventure and dauntless energy of the north- 
ern and western races. The chief characteristics are the spire, 
1 Caffin—History of Art.
-P-A-G-E-114
  116 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
the painted windows, stained glass, rose window, great height 
of the nave and beautiful adaptation of nature forms in the 
decoration of the capitals of columns. The Gothic sculptures 
are sometimes almost as fine as those of the perfect Greek 
period. The cathedral of Amiens is sometimes called “the 
Parthenon of Gothic architecture.” 
10. Renaissance 
Renaissance architecture was not so much the creation of a new 
style as the modification and blending of old styles. For the 
first time since the fall of the Empire civil architecture became 
more important than religious architecture. The new type of 
art found expression in the Florentine palace, a massive struc- 
ture built around a court with a columned portico. These are 
a few of the characteristics of this style of architecture: more 
solid surfaces, fewer openings than the Gothic, square cupola, 
and the double colonnade (later Renaissance). The Ducal 
Palace at Venice is a fine example of Renaissance architecture. 
11. Modern 
From the development of the Renaissance to the French Revolu- 
tion various styles of architecture prevailed throughout Europe, 
receiving slight modification from time to time. Immediately 
after the French Revolution there was a period in which prac- 
tically no attention was given to the artistic element in archi- 
tecture. Since the time of Napoleon various combinations of 
old styles have been used. The Gothic arch and the spire 
are common to churches that were erected previous to 1890° 
Since then the general tendency has been toward the low 
dome, and the tower without a spire. Much greater atten- 
tion has been given to the utility of public buildings and to 
domestic architecture. 
Steel construction and reinforced concrete construction have 
made the possibilities of science and art limitless. The sky- 
scraper in the form of the Woolworth Building in New York is 
an example of skill and beauty in modern architecture. 
The following evolutionary sequence may be helpful in studying 
the development of American architecture—the log cabin, the 
early colonial house, Puritan and Virginian houses, the Queen 
Ann or cottage house, the bungalow, the modern colonial 
house, adaptations of the Italian, French, and English domestic 
architecture, the apartment house, office buildings, public 
buildings. 
Some of our noted American architects are McKim, Mead and 
White; Daniel Burnham and Richard Morris Hunt. 
Fitness to Purpose 
The carved decorations of the best Greek architecture served to show 
off to better advantage the strength of that which they ornamented
-P-A-G-E-115
  
THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 117 
while the Roman architectural decorations were often inappropriate 
to the structural design of the buildings. Fitness to purpose is the 
governing principle of all good architecture. The modern buildings 
must be adapted to meet present needs.

It is possible to bring the pupils into touch with the finest examples 
of architecture with the aid of photographs and slides loaned by the 
state educational departments and museums. 
Study local buildings, domestic architecture, fitness to purpose, 
structural emphasis, relation of building to environment, relation 
of exterior to interior of buildings. 
Work out models in clay or plasticene. Makesmall models with plaster. 
Plan charts showing the development of architecture. Emphasize 
modern buildings.

  118 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
The location of your school will suggest the greatest need for the 
pupils. For example, if you are teaching in a rural section, arouse the 
interest of the children so that they will want to improve the appear- 
ance of the school building. 
House plans, plans in relation to shrubbery, garden, garage, etc. Older 
pupils can make elevations of houses and other public buildings. 
Materials: illustrations, slides, clippings, paper, ruler, pencil, brush, 
ink, modeling clay, water, color crayon and others.

Explanation.—If commercial art is concerned with the designing of a vast 
number of advertising forms, advertising publications, and commer- 
cial illustrations, it is worthy of a prominent place in the school art 
program. Before planning posters, book covers, book plates and other 
products, it is necessary that we have a working knowledge of commer- 
cial lettering. The following summary of the origin of the alphabet 
will motivate interest: 
. Egyptian hieroglyphics 
. Egyptian hieratic characters 
. Phoenician alphabet 
. Greek alphabet of sixteen letters 
. Old Italian alphabet 
. Latin alphabet of twenty-one letters 
7. Later Roman alphabet. 
The French, English and other European alphabets were derived from 
the Greek and were influenced later by the Latin and siill later 
by the Roman alphabets.! 
I. Evolution of the styles of lettering 
1. The Roman letter was evolved from the Greek. The Roman 
scribes gave it its typical design, in the narrow and wide strokes, 
and settled the direction of its accents; the Roman builders gave 
it its serifs and a more severe architectural form; the Renaissance 
1 Refer to Encyclopedia, Alphabet. 
OaPwne 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
    120 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
craftsmen gave it delicacy of drawing and freedom of application, 
and from them it came into the craft of printing.? 
2. The Gothic letter 
In printing, a square Roman letter with strokes of equal width 
is called Gothic. Gothic letters afford a greater variety than 
other styles, chiefly because they were never fully developed. 
The plainer forms of round Gothic letters may be executed easily 
with a wide stub or quill pen. The older styles of Gothic letter- 
ing show narrow and wide strokes, while the modern variations 
are often made with uniform width with or without a suggestion 
of a serif. These two styles are sometimes called accented and 
unaccented alphabets. 
Il. Practical application. 
In any piece of lettering, the object to be achieved is the presentation 
of a given inscription in the most suitable and beautiful manner. 
If the lettering is the vital part of the design everything else should 
be subordinated to it. 
Ezxercise.—Many lessons may be worked up from this program. 
Application in art teaching 
Plan designs for book covers, title pages, book plates, letter heads, 
monograms, signs, posters, page arrangements, greeting cards and 
other things. 
Emphasize orderly arrangement of arithmetic, language and all other 
school written papers. 
Materials 
Choose materials best suited to the problem as a whole: pencil, ruler, 
pen, ink, brush and water color. Linoleum blocks or wood blocks 
may be used effectively for school printing. 
Examples of fine lettering and printing illustrating the development 
of the art will give a clearer understanding of typical alphabets, and 
they will also serve as an inspiration for the students. The lettering, 
writing and printing of the Japanese, Chinese, and Egyptians are 
splendid illustrations of beautiful space filling. The hand lettered 
and illuminated books of the monks, and the early hand blocked 
books should be an incentive to the students. Illustrations of these 
can be found in some of the books included in the bibliography.

Explanation. 
Mr. Bailey has said, “The purpose of art education is the development 
of appreciation for the beautiful and of power to produce beautiful 
things. Such taste and skill will not appear when the teacher 
stamps her foot. They are fruits. They must be grown. The 
seeds that will produce them are in the heart of every normal child.” 
Why are we teaching art? Can we rightfully separate art from any 
system of general education? Are we convinced that as art teachers 
we have a tremendous work in the education of all people 
for appreciation? Would it not be possible to launch a campaign 
of education in this direction? The poster may be used to propa- 
gate art. 
In planning a poster we should keep in mind two things: (1) the selling 
idea, (2) how this idea is embodied. 
The selling idea might be expressed in this way: 
Artistic surroundings make us happy 
A work of art is always a good job 
Art leads to better homes 
Art is fitness to purpose 
Art principles are nature’s laws 
Art makes life beautiful 
Art is for all 
Better art—better living 
Work well done is art 
Make art a part of all’ work 
All art is one 
Art is both fine and industrial 
Art is for all school subjects. 
The idea may be embodied in various ways. Attention can be called 
to the importance of a knowledge of art in the appreciation of nature, 
in printing, in sculpture and in architecture. Attention can also

  122 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
be called to the place which art occupies in commerce and in indus- 
try. This will furnish inspiration for the design, the formation of 
which will be governed by the art elements of design, color, lettering, 
and the principles of rhythm and balance. 
Ezercise.—Lay out a poster. 
1, Plan margin. 
2. Determine areas for the illustration and the lettering. 
3. Fill in the lettered areas with a dark gray value, using charcoal. 
4, Emphasize the silhouette, or the representation of objects without 
regard to the third dimension. Good shapes constitute a basis 
for design. 
5. Cut paper silhouettes. (A soft pencil or brush and ink may be 
substituted for charcoal.) 
. Suggestions under practical application, the lesson program on Art 
in Commerce will be helpful. (See page 119.) 
7. Complete the poster, using as a medium, colored paper, transparent 
water color or opaque color. Effective posters may be worked 
out in three neutral values; white, gray and black. Linoleum 
printed posters are effective. 
Applications in art teaching 
Representative drawings will furnish reference material for poster 
design. 
Base the color study on hue, value, chroma, and color combinations. 
Beautiful combinations may be found in nature, paintings, Japanese 
prints, textiles, and pottery. 
In planning a design for a poster, it is wise to lead up to the problem 
in a simple way. 
For example: 
(1) Give the pupils a lay-out of a poster and ask them to 
plan the lettering and coloring. 
(2) Give them a layout of the poster and lettering, and ask 
them to plan the illustrations. Pictures cut from 
magazines may be moved around on the background for 
practice in arrangement. a 
Materials 
Illustrative material. White paper, soft pencil, charcoal or brushes 
and ink. Scissors and colored paper. Tempera color. Linoleum 
and small knife or carving tools.

I. Essentials of design 
Origin of design 
An appreciation of the work of the past enriches our background of 
experience. It is worth while to be able to trace the sequence of 
historic ornament, but it is of greater value to learn something 
of the principles involved in the production of the work of the past; 
what design meant to the people; what sort of life and thought it 
expressed; the conditions and environments which controlled the 
development of art forms and the influence of expansion resulting 
in conquest and commerce on land and sea. 
The following summary of the growth and development of design 
will furnish an outline for research. 
1. Representation is prehistoric, the earliest form of art belongs to 
the old Stone Age. Examples—implements and tools of the 
Stone and Bronze ages; paintings of the cave men. Design 
is the art of civilization. 
2. The beginnings of design may be studied from the relics of van- 
ished races found buried in the earth. The North American 
and South American Indians contributed greatly to civilization. 
Study their habitations, appearance, environment, homes, 
basket weaving, pottery, the craft of the loom, and metal work. 
These forms are characteristic of Indian designs; geometric 
motives symbolic in meaning, such as the cross, diamonds and 
rectangles arranged in steps and zig-zags. Four motifs con- 
tinually occur in Peruvian decorations, the figure, the bird, 
the fish and the puma.
-P-A-G-E-122
  124 ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
3. The architecture and handicraft of the Egyptians influenced 
their system of decoration. The palm, lotus and papyrus are 
characteristic nature forms found in the design of the Egyptians. 
The vulture with out-stretched wings, the scarab (sacred 
beetle), and the drawings of animals and birds may be studied 
in the decoration of buildings, pottery, metal products, jewelry 
and furniture. The swastika is found both in the art of the 
Egyptians and in modern art. 
II. Governing esthetic elements! 
Rhythm is movement. 
1. Simple repetition 1111 in the beating of a drum 
2. Alternation 1’ 1’ 1’ 1’ in marching 
3. Graduated measures in the fingers on the hand 
4, Graduated values in the sky at dawn and sunset 
5. Growth in all plant and animal forms 
Balance brings repose and equilibrium through the opposition of 
attractions, and makes,each element in a composition keep its 
proper place. 
1. With symmetry, illustrated in the pan scale 
2. Without symmetry illustrated in the steelyard 
3. Of colors—larger areas of neutral color balanced by smaller areas 
of bright color, in a Japanese print 
Harmony is the result of adapting the parts of an object or design to 
the accomplishment of purpose (it involves rhythm and balance). 
1. Similarity, something in common. (Hand woven rugs are 
harmonious with early American furniture.) 
2. In proportion. (The parts of a chair should be designed, each as 
a properly proportioned unit in itself. The chair should also 
be properly proportioned as a whole). 
3. Of related parts. (The back of the chair should harmonize in 
design with the legs of the chair. Each part should be in 
proper relation to the other parts and to the whole). 
4. Of related objects. (The furniture in the room should harm- 
onize in line, a Sheraton sideboard with Sheraton dining chairs. 
Chairs should be comfortable, tables of the proper height). 
5. Of colors, (gray-blue cretonne with small areas of bright 
yellow-red). 
III. Constructive design including decorative design. 
1. Decoration should not obscure the material. 
2. The principal of growth. In planning a design from a flower 
suggest leaves, stems and blossoms and the growth of the plant. 
Horizontal and vertical subdivision. 
Appendages—as metal handles on a heavy chest, spout and handle 
on a tea-pot. These appendages should be harmonious with the 
larger mass.

Surface enrichment, as patterns to enhance the beauty of surface. In 
working out a wood block design a bold pattern is more suitable for 
coarse material 
Color—in blocking this design for a textile the pattern should be 
harmonious in color with the background, and should be printed so 
that the texture and weave of the material are not concealed. 
Expression 
Inspiration. 
From nature—adapt the nature form to meet conditions, or modify 
the parts in view of their function and use. An animal form may 
be adapted to wood block design if it meets the conditions imposed 
by the process of printing. The proper use of historic ornament 
and of other reference material.

Explanation 
In the development of textile fabrics we may trace the continuity of 
tradition and style, the intermingling of races and customs, and 
the religious ideas from which ornament as symbolism is for the most 
part derived. 
All fabrics wrought on the loom are called textiles. The field of tex- 
tiles is broadly divided into three classes, (1) plain fabrics in which 
the warp and weft alternate regularly; (2) those in which a pattern is 
produced by the warp and weft intermingling in different proportions 
or colors; (3) those fabrics in which the plain textile is enriched with 
the needle or by printing. 
It would be interesting to trace the development of each of these 
three classes. The following outline will be helpful in the study of 
printed textiles. 
1. Printing can be traced in the ancient civilizations of China, 
Persia and Borneo, Java and India. Ancient block printing on 
tappa cloth has been discovered in the Philippine Islands. 
2. Printing on textiles became a developed industry in parts of Europe 
toward the end of the twelfth century. The monks of the Rhein- 
ish monasteries fostered this artistic craft in Europe. It was 
practiced quite extensively until the fourteenth century when 
it fell into neglect through a freer use of tapestry and embroidered 
materials. It was revived in the seventeenth century, due to the 
influence of importing into Europe from India quantities of 
printed and painted calicoes. Craftsmen from Germany took 
part in initiating the manufacture of printed cloths into France, 
Holland, England and Switzerland. The first textile printing 
works in Great Britain are said to have been established by a 
Frenchman toward the end of the seventh century on the banks 
of the Thames near Richmond. Toward the end of the eight- 
eenth century the invention of roller printing from metal plates 
brought about a revolution.

3. 
  ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING OF ART 
Engraved or plate printing was invented by Bill in 1770 and 
resulted in the use of an engraved color plate. Parkinsonevolved 
a method for keeping the plate in register so that one color 
could be easily printed upon another, and with slight improve- 
ments this is the method by which fabrics of cotton, wool, 
linen or silk are printed today. 
There are three principal methods of printing which have indirectly 
1. 
2. 
3. grown out of ancient processes. 
Direct printing is produced by blocks or by cylinders on which the 
parts of the pattern that are not to print are cut away. 
Resist printing had its beginning in Java as batik. The early batik 
makers drew or painted their patterns in thick starch paste on 
white cotton cloth and then dyed the uncovered portions of the 
pattern by dipping the waxed cloth again and again into vats of 
vegetable dye. (One authority believes that the original wax 
dropping technique was introduced into Java from Persia or 
Egypt during prehistoric times.) The modern worker uses wax 
instead of paste. The wax resists the dye leaving the pattern 
light against a dark ground. 
Tie-dying is also a resist dying process in which the textile material 
is tied with string or tape to form a pattern. The knots resist 
penetration of the dye. 
Discharge printing, in which the fabric is dyed and so printed after- 
wards that the color of the design is removed, such as flannel with 
polka dot pattern. 
Exercise 
Plan a wood block design to be printed on cloth which may be used in 
making a bag, a mat or a table cover. 
Before planning a design for a wood block it is necessary to consider 
these points: 
. Purpose of design. 
. Suitable material to be used for the block and for the fabric. 1 
2. 
3. Medium to be used in planning the design. 
4, . Character of the design in relation to purpose and materials. 
Inspiration, historic sources. 
5. Repetition of the design unit to form a pattern. 
6. Rhythm and balance resulting in harmony. Texture and color. 
7. Method of printing. 
Application in art teaching 
Drawing of nature forms, will serve as inspiration for design. 
Plan a stencil design for a table runner or a pillow. 
Plan a batik design for a mat, table cover, bag. 
Wood bloek design for end papers for books, greeting cards, or a textile 
to be used for a table mat, table cover, bag. (Linoleum may be 
substituted for wood.)

THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
Art courses in the senior high school are planned to meet the 
distinct and differentiated needs of the pupils who possess 
marked inclination toward art and who have been selected 
from the try-out general course of the junior high school years: 
At this time it is the aim of the art department to provide 
means for capturing these talented pupils and for placing them 
in classes where they may be especially trained.! 
Senior high schools should offer courses in design planned 
to meet special needs, courses in commercial design, craft 
design, textile design, costume design. There should some- 
times be given courses in color as such, but more frequently 
there should be courses in home planning, interior decoration 
and illustration (including costume illustration) involving 
concrete instruction in the use of color as a means to an end. 
The advertising field will suggest a number of units planned to 
meet the peculiar needs of pupils who expect to enter the 
commercial art field. Chief among the large number of 
courses in advertising should be mentioned those in pen and 
ink rendering for newspaper work, in wash drawing for cir- 
culars and in poster and commercial lettering. The archi-

tectural field suggests special courses in the drawing of plans 
and elevations and in detail rendering and in specifications. 
A number of courses in appreciation and history of art should 
also be offered. The senior high school should make available, 
at least in large centers of population, some special advanced 
courses in anatomy and drawing from the figure, planned 
primarily for the most promising pupils who can profit by the 
instruction offered. 
It would be quite impossible to include in a book on the 
teaching of art a large number of senior high school courses in 
art. The course outlines printed below indicate the range of 
material that has been included under three unit courses by 
three successful teachers of art. It is hoped that these out- 
lines will be helpful to teachers in working out programs and 
plans in other fields to meet the needs of their pupils. 
SUGGESTED OUTLINE FOR COURSE IN ART APPRECIATION 
The following has been recommended, but not adopted, as 
a required course in tenth grade of the senior high schools of 
Denver, Colorado. It is included here with the hope that it 
may be tried out in a sufficient number of classes to deter- 
mine its worth. It is a course in appreciation, not perform- 
ance; but some performance is necessary to appreciation. 
The individual teacher will decide the nature and amount of 
instruction that is necessary for each class. This outline was 
contributed by Marie L. Woodson, director of art education, 
and the senior high school teachers of Denver, Colorado. 
Specific Aims: 
I. To teach appreciation of art through the understanding of art 
principles in their application to affairs of the community, the 
home and the individual. 
II. To cultivate taste through the study of works of art of many kinds. 
III. To teach the artist’s way of working and respect for the artist’s 
work through some creative effort on the part of each pupil. 
IV. To stimulate the desire to belong to the class of citizens who demand 
art qualities in all products. 
V. To teach the unifying effect of art that brings into kinship all ages 
and all races. 
VI. To provide for the worthy use of leisure by stimulating “the love 
of art that brings real happiness and inspiration to the heart of 
man.”

COMMERCIAL DESIGN COURSE? 
Time: 20 weeks; 5 45-minute periods a week 
A. Aims of Course 
To create a greater interest in good advertising, and a greater appre- 
ciation of design as applied to this branch of commercial art: 
simple direct handling with good drawing as opposed to fanciful 
effects or detailed handling. 
To teach that strength of design is fitness to purpose, and to appeal 
to the people for whom the advertisement is intended, as: strong 
drawing and lettering for objects of strength, refined drawing and 
lettering for objects of daintiness.

FIGURE DRAWING COURSE 
Time: 40 weeks, 4 45-minute periods a week 
This course is open to all senior high school pupils who are interested 
in sketching from the figure. It is not necessary that they study 
any other type of art work in order to take this course. Pupils who 
are taking commercial design and charcoal drawing are urged to 
enter this class. 
The class meets regularly on Fridays for four periods and continues 
throughout the year. Students and their friends act as models. 
A variety of costumes is possible owing to the many school activities 
requiring different costumes. 
The mediums of the course are charcoal, pencil, red chalk and pastel. 
Pupils try them all and use those they can handle best. Charcoal 
is usually the most popular medium. Sketches are made on white 
and tinted drawing paper and cover paper. The best drawings are 
fixed. All work is kept for the year in order that the instructor 
may estimate the progress made. 
I. Studies in proportion 
(a) Instructions before the pose 
1. An illustrated talk on the proportion of the whole figure 
Photographs, drawings, and charts used 
2. Sketches made before the class to show proportion 
(b) Time spent 
This depends entirely on the ability of the pupil. Some have 
had experience in drawing from the figure and others are 
just beginning. Roughly estimated, it probably will take 
5 or 6 weeks for the beginner to learn how to block in a 
sketch.
-P-A-G-E-135
  
THE SECONDARY COURSE OF STUDY 137 
The length of poses will be from 10 to 30 minutes 
(c) Suggested note book work to be done outside of class 
1. Copies from charts showing proportions of the whole figure. 
Bement’s Figure Construction, Vanderpoel’s Human 
Figure and Hatton’s Figure Drawing are available in 
school for this purpose. Public Library books can also 
be used. 
(d) Results 
Accented outline sketches in pencil or charcoal with special 
emphasis on proportion. Details may be drawn if the pupil 
has ability. 
II. Studies in action 
(a) Instructions before the pose 
1. Illustrated talk on action. Photographs, drawings, charts, 
etc. 
2. Skeleton sketches made on the board to show action, 
foreshortening, etc. 
(b) Time spent. Two or three days and outside work 
1. Five and ten minute sketches 
2. The number of weeks to spend on this depends on the ability 
of the pupils 
(c) Suggested note book work 
1. Copies from charts and drawings and photographs 
2. Sketches made at home 
3. Memory sketches 
(d) Results 
Accented outline sketches in charcoal or pencil to show action 
III. Studies in value

1. An illustrated talk on values as applied to color of clothes, 
shadows, etc. 
2. Sketches made to show how these may be laid on in char- 
coal, red chalk or pencil 
(b) Time spent 
Practically all the year, after pupils have learned how to place 
a drawing on the sheet and know something of proportion 
and action. 
(c) Suggested note book work 
1. Copies from charts, drawings and photographs 
2. Outside sketching 
(d) Results 
1. Sketches with suggested values 
2. Sketches in full values.

the head, neck, ete. 
2. Action sketches showing perspective of head—profile, 
three quarter view, full face, etc. 
3. Construction and perspective of nose, eye and mouth, ete. 
The pupils will draw from charts first and then from the posed 
model 
(b) Time spent 
It is hard to say just how much time to give to this, probably 
at least a month on purely structure study and more or 
less throughout the term after that. After the first year’s 
experience it will be easier to judge just how much time to 
allow. 
(c) Suggested note book work. 
Same as class work 
(d) Results 
Outline studies of head structure 
Outline studies of head action 
Detailed studies of the features 
Copies from charts 
VI. Studies of hands and feet

1. Illustrated talk on the structure of hands and feet 
Perspective and action 
2. Drawings of shoes—perspective and values 
3. Studies in suggestion 
(b) Time spent 
Two or three days and outside work 
(c) Suggested note book work 
1. Copies from drawings, photographs and charts. 
2. Sketches from hands and feet. 
(d) Results 
1. Outline drawings 
2. Action sketches—hands holding objects or showing move- 
ment. Action of feet when walking, etc. 
3. Drawings in value 
VII. Drawings of the whole figure showing features, hands, and feet. 
An attempt is made at securing a likeness of the model.

  VIII. Studies in expression 
Pupils may not have reached an ability to represent facial expres- 
sion but charts showing facial expression will be prepared by the 
teacher. These may be copied by the pupils if time permits. 
IX. Composition 
This depends on the ability of the pupil—those more advanced may 
be able to suggest appropriate backgrounds. Individual 
instruction will be given to those who are ready for it.

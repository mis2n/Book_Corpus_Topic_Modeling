  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Department or THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, 
Washington, October 15, 19165. 
Sm: I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript for 
Volume I of the report of the Commissioner of Education for the 
fiscal year ended June 30,1915. It has been found wholly impossible 
to complete the preparation of the material for Volume IT by October 
15, 1915, the time when, according to law (38 Stat. L., 886), it shall 
be submitted for publication. 
Inasmuch as it will never be possible to have the material of Volume 
II of this report ready for the printer before December 31, nor to pre- 
pare the material for Volume I with the necessary care and fullness 
of information much before that time, I respectfully recommend that 
the act referred to be so amended as to extend to that date the time 
within which the manuscript of this report may be transmitted to 
the Public Printer for publication. I also recommend that Congress 
be asked to pass a special act authorizing the printing of Volume IT 
of the present report at such time as it can be prepared, not later than | 
February 15, 1916. 
The following statement will, I believe, show the need for this 
extension of time: 
For Volume II of this report original statistical information must 
be gathered from and with the cooperation of more than 20,000 dif- 
ferent agencies. The information includes comprehensive statistical 
accounts of more than 300,000 schools of all grades and kinds, public 
and private, rural and urban, in all parts of the United States and 
jts possessions, with an enrollment of more than 22,000,000 children 
and youth and an annual income and expenditure of more than 
three-quarters of a billion of dollars. State and city systems of schools 
are reported by State and city officials in totals and not by individual 
schools, as are also systems of denominational and parochial schools. 
High schools, normal schools, colleges and universities, professional 
and technical schools, and many other institutions are reported sep- 
arately by their respective officers. No officer, either of an individual 
school or of a school system, can furnish the information required by 
this office until the data necessary for the complete report of that 
school or system have been received, tabulated, and totaled. Officers 
xtr 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
  XIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
of many schools and colleges do not try to make up their reports 
until after the close of the summer vacation. The work of compiling 
statistics for systems of schools can not be begun until after reports 
from the constituent parts of the system have been received. Too 
often is it the case that the clerical force in the office of the superin- 
tendent of schools or of the board of education is not sufficient to 
enable the office to do its statistical work promptly. Education offices 
are almost always more deficient in clerical help than other public 
offices. In some cases the fiscal year ends with the middle or last of 
July or August, instead of with the last of June. This, of course, 
necessitates a corresponding delay in beginning the compilation of 
statistics. This bureau must depend for its information wholly upon 
the good will of officers of school systems and individual schools and 
other institutions and agencies of education. There is, I believe, 
nowhere any National or State law or any city ordinance or charter 
provision requiring any person to respond to the request of this bu- 
reau for information. The bureau has no money with which to pay 
for the labor required in putting the information for which it asks 
into the required form, which, because of lack of uniformity in 
methods of bookkeeping and accounting, is very often not the form 
required for the use of the State, city, or institution reporting. It 
has no statistical agent who can be sent to procure information when 
it is delayed or withheld. No penalty can be imposed either for delay 
or failure. I believe no similar task is required of any other bureau, 
department, or agent of the Federal Government. The delay of even 
“a small per cent of the 20,000 unpaid voluntary correspondents of 
the bureau in filling out and returning the blanks and schedules on 
which the information is gathered for Volume IT of this report 
causes a corresponding delay in the completion of this work by the 
statistical division of the bureau. After the blanks on which the ma- 
terial for this volume have been returned to this office they must be 
inspected, compared, corrected, compiled, and interpreted. Many of 
them must be returned for the insertion of items omitted or for the 
correction of items that have evidently been misunderstood or re- 
ported inaccurately. Much of the matter in Volume I of the report 
can not be completed until summaries of statistics for Volume II 
have been made. I feel sure that a careful consideration of these facts 
will convince Congress of the advisability of the amendment and of 
the special act recommended. I believe the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion has never been able to submit his report in form ready for the 
printer earlier than December 31, nor has it, I believe, ever been ready 
by this time except when special assistance was given this office by 
a detail of clerks from other bureaus of the Department of the 
Interior.

COMMISSIONER'S INTRODUCTION. XV 
For many years the report of the Commissioner of Education has 
been submitted in two parts and published in two volumes.. For the 
last three years the first volume of the report has included a more 
or less comprehensive interpretative survey of the progress of edu- 
cation in all its phases, both in this country and abroad. The dis- 
connected general studies which made up the body of this volume of 
the report in earlier years have been omitted, and the results of similar 
studies are now published separately as numbers of the bulletin of 
the bureau, about 50 a year, each number for distribution among 
such teachers and school officers as are especially interested in the 
subject treated. The purpose has been to bring together in the chap- 
ters of this first volume such an account of the growth of institutions 
of learning and of school systems, of the working of all the more 
important agencies of education, and of the development of educa- 
tional ideals and the progress of educational thought as will enable 
the reader to gain a knowledge of all that has been most worth while 
in the educational life of the world within the year for which the 
report is made, and to understand something, at least, of the trend 
of educational theory and practice. The difficulty of doing this thor- 
oughly and well is fully understood, but it is believed that the ideal 
is approached each year more nearly than the year before. The im- 
portance of having this done well will be more fully appreciated when 
it is remembered that this is the only attempt at such an annual survey 
of educational progress made anywhere in the world. No other Gov- 
ernment and no private agency publishes any similar volume. This 
is the one authoritative document, in so far as it is authoritative, on 
this subject for students of education in this and all other countries. 
Therefore, the greater the importance of its being well done. The 
second volume is a statistical report for the last preceding fiscal year 
of enrollment and attendance of pupils, of teachers, of salaries, of 
incomes and expenditures, of values of school properties, including 
buildings and equipment, and other items of interest about schools 
and other agencies of education in the United States and its pos- 
sessions. This is the only place in which such facts in regard to 
education are collected. It is, therefore, the source from which infor- 
mation is drawn for all other publications in which any such statistics 
are included, and upon which many thousands of executive officers 
and students of education in this country rely for all the data for 
their comparative studies. To the extent that the statistics in this 
volume are incomplete or inaccurate must all the studies based on 
them be defective. The importance of this is enhanced by the fact 
that a large part of the educational legislation of the country, and 
especially of legislation in regard to tax levies and appropriations 
for education, is based on or affected by deductions drawn from such
-P-A-G-E-16

studies. Policies of administration are frequently determined in the 
same way. 
While this report should be made as soon as possible after the close 
of the year for which it is made, it is still more important that sufli- 
cient time should be allowed that it may be as full and reliable as 
possible. 
A study of the chapters of the portion of the report submitted 
herewith and of certain other chapters which were not ready in time 
to be included in this report shows that within the year there has 
been in this country an increase in tendency toward democracy in 
education, toward giving to every child of whatever condition a full 
and equal opportunity with all other children for that degree and 
kind of education, that quantity and quality of education, which will 
develop in the fullest measure its manhood or womanhood, its human 
qualities, prepare it for the duties and responsibilities of democratic 
citizenship, for participation in civic and social life, and for making 
an honest living, contributing its part to the commonwealth, and 
serving humanity by some useful occupation, followed intelligently 
and skillfully with good will and strong purpose. In a larger de- 
gree than ever before are we beginning to understand that, next to the 
right to live, this is the most important right of every child. If 
democracy has any valuable and ultimate meaning it is equality of 
opportunity. But there can be no equality of opportunity without 
equality of opportunity in education. If to any child this is denied 
and it is permitted to grow to manhood or womanhood without that 
education which prepares it for good living, for the duties and respon- 
sibilities of citizenship, and for making an honest living by some 
intelligent, useful occupation, then there is nothing which individual 
or society can do, nothing which man or God can do, to make good 
the loss. More than ever before are we beginning to understand that 
material progress, social purity, civic righteousness, political stability 
and strength, and the possibilities of culture and the attainment of 
higher ideals, all depend on the right education of all the people. If 
any man or woman follows his or her trade or profession with less 
intelligence and skill than he or she might, the total amount of wealth 
produced is less than it might be. If any lack knowledge of 
fundamental principles of government and institutional life neces- 
sary for intelligent citizenship in our democracy, the civic and politi- 
cal life of city, State, and Nation is affected thereby. If the health, 
the culture, or the moral education of any has been neglected, all 
society and each of its members must suffer as a result. If any, 
ihrough wrong education or the inculcation of false ideals, work at 
occupations for which they are not fitted or in which they may not 
serve themselves and society as well as they might in other ways, their 
own lives and the lives of us all are less full and satisfactory than 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XVII 
they might otherwise be. We are all bound up in the sheaf of life 
together, and our interests from the lowest to the highest and from 
the highest to the lowest are inextricably interwoven. Therefore the 
liberal use of public funds for the support of schools and other 
agencies of education is more and more clearly recognized as good 
business, and careful thinking and planning for the fullest and’ best 
education of all the children of all the people as the highest duty of 
citizenship. 
The growth of this tendency toward equality of education within 
the year is shown by the larger interests in the care of the life and 
health of young children and a better type of home education; in the 
reviving of interest in the kindergarten, especially for children for 
whom good home education is lacking; in increased appropriations 
for longer terms and better salaries for teachers, particularly in rural 
communities where school terms have been short and salaries of 
teachers have been small; in the enactment of school attendance laws 
in some of the States which have not until now had such laws; in 
the adoption of the larger unit of administration of rural schools in 
several States; in the raising of standards of required preparation 
for teachers in some States and in the extension of the means of pre- 
paring teachers in normal schools, in departments of education in 
colleges, and especially in teacher-training classes in high schools; 
in the increased attendance in high schools; and in the differentia- 
tion of work and the adjustment of courses of study in schools of all 
grades to meet the needs of children of varying ability and the voca- 
tional life of the communities. Some progress has been made within 
the year in the reorganization of the 12 years of elementary and high 
schools on the basis of two equal periods of 6 years each. There isa 
better understanding of what college standards should be, and col- 
leges are trying more and more to adjust themselves to these stand- 
ards. This is made easier by the constant improvement of the public 
and private high schools and especially of the public high schools. 
The elevation of the standards of professional schools is due largely 
to the demand for higher standards in professional life. This has 
been accelerated by several surveys of professional schools made by 
some of the great educational foundations. The demand for intelli- 
gent and comprehensive surveys of the equipment, administration, 
and work of individual colleges and schools and of State, county, and 
city systems of schools continues. The purpose of these surveys is not 
to find fault, but to make an intelligent accounting of the schools and 
their results to the people who support them and are served by them, 
and if possible to discover means of improving them and making 
them render a fuller measure of service. Within the year several very 
valuable surveys of this kind have been made, and more are now 
12084°—xp 1915—vor 1—11
-P-A-G-E-18
  XVIII EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
under way. The reports of these surveys already constitute a unique 
and valuable body of educational literature. The extension of our 
foreign commerce and particularly our closer commercial relations 
with Central and South American countries has brought a revival of 
interest in commercial education and in the study of the Spanish lan- 
guage. The great war in Europe and the events connected therewith 
have called attention to the need of preparation for defense against 
possible hostile invasion and created a new interest in military edu- 
cation. 
This war has affected materially the schools in the countries di- 
rectly engaged in it and in a smaller degree the schools of other 
European countries. The attendance at universities, colleges, and 
technical schools has been much smaller than in former years. Funds 
formerly available for education are now turned in other directions. 
Yet it is encouraging to note that in some of the countries at least 
the appropriations for public education are little, if any, less than for 
the years immediately preceding the beginning of the war. This 
shows the value which these countries attach to public education as 
an element of national strength. 
Within the year the work of this bureau has increased largely. 
Three new divisions have been added and some others strengthened. 
Because of the general interest in the organization of the bureau and 
the work which it understakes to do, I am including in this introduc- 
tion the paragraphs from the annual statement of the Commissioner 
of Education to the Secretary of the Interior which relate especially 
to this subject. The work of the bureau as a whole and of the 
several divisions for the year is set forth in detail in the body of 
the statement referred to, which can be had upon application to the 
bureau. 
FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION OF THE BUREAU. 
The bureau has no administrative functions except those connected with 
the expenditure of the funds appropriated by the Federal Government for the 
maintenance of colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts in the several States 
and in Hawaii and Porto Rico, and those connected with the education, support, 
and medical relief of natives of Alaska. To the extent that funds appropriated 
for its use will permit, it performs higher and more important functions than 
could be performed by any administrative Federal education office. Definitely 
it attempts to do the following things: 
(1) To serve as a clearing house for accurate and comprehensive informa- 
tion in respect to all educational agencies and all forms of education in the 
United States and all foreign countries, and to disseminate this information 
among school officers, teachers, students of education, and all others directly 
interested in any form of educational activity. To this end it publishes an 
annual report in two volumes, the first containing an interpretative survey of 
the progress of education within the year in the United States and all other 
countries, the second containing statistics of education in the United States ; 
studies specific problems of education, school legislation, State and city school 
systems, colleges and universities, libraries, and all other agencies of education  
-P-A-G-E-19
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. xIx 
in the United States and elsewhere, and publishes the results in printed bul- 
letins, multigraphed letters, and letters to school journals and the public press; 
carries on an extensive correspondence with school officers, teachers, and others, 
and sends its experts to speak at meetings of National, State and local associa- 
tions. 
(2) 'To serve as a clearing house for the best opinions on school organiza- 
tion and administration, courses of study, methods of teaching, and many 
other matters connected with popular education. For each of these subjects 
there are a few men and women in the United States and elsewhere whose 
cpinions, because of their greater knowledge of the subject, are most valuable. 
This bureau tries to find for each subject who these persons are and to make 
lists of expert advisers whom it may consult and to whom it may refer others. 
It also undertakes, after correspondence and personal conference with these 
experts, to formulate the consensus of expert opinion. In carrying on this 
part of its work the bureau’s experts attend and participate in congresses and 
conferences of educators. The commissioner also calls special conferences at 
the office of the bureau in Washington and elsewhere. Last year he called nine 
of these conferences—eight national and one sectional. 
(8) To advise legislatures, school officers, teachers, and others engaged in 
promoting and directing education. Its experts, upon request, address legisla- 
tures, meet with legislative committees and commissions, with State, county, 
and city school boards, with boards of trustees and faculties of normal schools, 
colleges, and universities, with library commissions, and with other similar 
bodies. It makes or directs surveys of State, county, and city school systems, 
and of individual schools or groups of schools, and reports its findings, together 
with constructive suggestions, to the proper officials. Within the year it has 
been engaged in nine such surveys, most of which are not yet completed, and 
has promised to make other similar surveys within the present fiscal year. In 
response to thousands of letters asking advice on specific subjects, the bureau 
makes hundreds of studies in its library and elsewhere and gives the results of 
these studies in individual and circular letters. 
(4) To promote on its own initiative and to assist education officers and the 
people of the several States and local communities in promoting what it believes 
. to be necessary and desirable tendencies in education and in the organization 
of educational agencies, to the end that there may be full and equal opportunity 
of education for all. Within the year definite work has been done for the 
lengthening of school terms in rural communities; for the better preparation 
of teachers for rural schools; for more adequate salaries for teachers in schools 
of all kinds and grades; for better attendance laws in some States and for the 
better enforcement of attendance laws in all States; for readjusting courses of 
study in rural schools; for working out a better method of teaching children to 
read than is now in common use and in promulgating this method; in. working 
out plans for teaching English in rural schools; in promoting education in agri- 
culture, trades, and industries, and for home making; in the establishment of 
kindergartens; in the consolidation of rural schools and in making homes for 
teachers and school farms parts of the equipment of rural schools; in making 
sentiment for the promotion of teachers in graded schools from grade to grade 
with the children, so as to make possible a larger degree of continuity in the 
school work of the children; in the promotion of school and home gardening in 
cities, towns, suburban communities, and manufacturing villages; toward reor- 
ganization of the 12 years of elementary and secondary schooling into 6 years 
of elementary and 6 years of high school—the so-called six-and-six plan—instead 
of the present plan of 8 years of elementary school and 4 years of high school; 
.toward more flexible courses in the high schools and their more perfect adaptation  
-P-A-G-E-20
      xx EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
to all classes of children; toward helping parents in the early education of their 
children in the home and in bringing the school and the home closer together ; in 
encouraging boys and girls to continue their education through systematic read- 
ing after leaving school; toward the establishment of county libraries, the open- 
ing of city libraries to country people, and the establishment of school libraries; 
for better schoolhouses and the care of the health of school children. This work 
is done through printed bulletins, multigraphed and press letters, correspondence, 
consultation with teachers and education officers, and addresses at meetings of 
associations, commercial bodies, and women’s clubs, and mass meetings of 
citizens. 
(5) To determine standards of measurement in education and to conduct and 
direct experiments in education, to the end that we may finally have a larger 
body of definite scientific knowledge about education and educational processes 
and methods. In the first of these the bureau had the assistance during the year 
of a group of 15 special collaborators working under the direction of Dr. George © 
D. Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia University. In the second it has been 
able to do very little, and it can not do much until there are special appropri- 
ations for experiments in education under scientific control. 
The bureau is now organized under the following divisions: Office of the chief 
clerk, the Alaska division, mails and files, library, statistical, editorial, higher 
education, school administration, industrial education and education for home 
making, agricultural education, rural schools, civic education, education of 
immigrants, education of negroes, school and home gardening, kindergarten, 
school sanitation and hygiene, and home education. The division of industrial 
education and education for home making, with three specialists; the division 
of school and home gardening, with two specialists and one assistant specialist ; 
and the division of agricultural education, with one specialist, have been created 
within the year. The division of rural schools has lost one specialist and has 
gained two assistant specialists. The division of school administration has 
increased by the addition of one specialist. These additions and some others 
were made possible by an additional appropriation amounting to $30,600, which 
became available at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
The Alaska division has offices in Washington, Seattle, and Nome. The kin- 
dergarten division has offices in Washington and New York. The home education ‘ 
division has offices in Washington and Philadelphia. The division of school — 
sanitation and hygiene has offices in Washington and Nashville, Tenn. All other 
divisions have offices only: in Washington. There are substations under desig- 
nated directors at Columbia University, University of Chicago, George Peabody 
College for Teachers, and Leland Stanford Junior University. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

The legislatures of 43 States were in session in 1915—all except 
those of Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and Virginia, 
which meet in even-numbered years. While a large mass of educa- 
tional legislation was enacted, the year was not especially conspicu- 
ous for departures from the usual course. The year was, however, 
notable for numerous constructive measures. Some of the more 
important subjects with which lawmakers concerned themselves were 
administrative control, health provisions, high schools, teacher train- 
ing, higher education, public-school support, compulsory attendance, 
the school term, libraries, and the curriculum in general. Legisla- 
tion only less vital to the public-school system was enacted on such 
subjects as child labor, social centers, mothers’ pensions, playgrounds, 
and the like. “Movements” for the consolidation of rural schools, 
vocational training, kindergartens, free textbocks, and the retire- 
ment of superannuated teachers went on apace. No entire new school 
code was enacted. 
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL. 
Changes in administrative control were made chiefly in connection 
with State boards of education and county boards or officers. In 
State school administration the trend is toward centralizing control 
in a board or body of persons exercising large powers and wide dis- 
cretion. It is also worthy of notice that ex officio boards are giving 
place to a different type: The older State board, composed of gov- 
ernor, superintendent of public instruction, and attorney general, 
  
1 Based on volumes of official session laws from 26 States; on summaries or other 
information from the remaining 17.

  2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
for example, is disappearing, and a body composed of appointive or 
elective members without regard to the holding of other State offices 
or educational positions is growing in popularity with legislators. 
Laws making more or less important changes affecting State 
boards were enacted in six States. The Vermont act of 1915 in- 
creased the powers and duties of the State board of education. As 
was formerly the case, the board is entirely appointive, the governor 
being authorized to designate its members. The board is to appoint 
a commissioner of education, approve the appointment of as many 
State supervisors as it may deem necessary, appoint superintendents 
of towns forming unions for the purpose of supervision, and have 
general control of the public-school system, including the certifica- 
tion of teachers and the adoption of a course of study. The commis- 
sioner of education, who may be appointed for an indefinite period, 
displaces the “superintendent of education,” who was formerly ap- 
pointed by the State board for a term of three years. 
Under the 1915 act of Tennessee the governor and superintendent 
of public instruction were dropped from the membership of the State 
board of education and all members were made appointive. The 
old law provided for a membership of eight, composed of the gov- 
ernor and superintendent, ex officio, and six members appointed by 
the governor. The new law provides for the appointment of nine 
members for terms of six years. Terms are made to overlap, three 
members being appointed every two years. The constitution recog- 
nizes three “grand divisions” of the State—East Tennessee, Middle 
Tennessee, and West Tennessee; three members of the board of 
education must now be chosen from each of these grand divisions. 
Members serve without pay, but are allowed necessary expenses when 
attending meetings or otherwise discharging their official duties. 
In addition to other powers conferred by law, the board is directed 
to appoint a superintendent of public instruction to assume the 
duties of the office at the expiration of the term of the present in- 
cumbent. His salary and tenure are to be fixed by the board. 
The State board of education created by the Legislature of Wis- 
consin consists of the governor, secretary of State, superintendent 
of public instruction, one member appointed by the regents of the 
university, and one appointed by the regents of the State normal 
schools. To this board is given the exclusive management of all 
financial affairs of the educational activities of the State. 
North Dakota’s act of 1915 created a board of regents of State 
educational institutions. It is composed of five members appointed 
by the governor with the consent of the senate. The term of mem- 
bers is to be six years, and the compensation $7 per day each, includ- 
ing traveling expenses. This board succeeds to all the powers and
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 3 
duties of the normal school board and the boards of trustees of other 
State educational institutions. 
In Utah the State board of education, which formerly consisted 
of the State superintendent, the presidents of the university and the 
agricultural college and two appointive members, was increased to 
nine in number; there are six appointive members under the new 
act. The terms of members of the New Mexico board were increased 
and their per diem was raised from $2.50 to $5 each. 
THE COUNTY UNIT. 
The system of public school administration and support in most 
States is imperfect, and is often unjust to some communities. This 
statement is probably more true of support than of administration. 
For example: In 1913-14 two contiguous districts in Pennsylvania 
levied for school purposes 5 mills and 12 mills, respectively. In 
North Carolina a special tax district in a rural community was 
formed a few years ago in such a way that one of its boundaries ran 
parallel with and included a railroad for about 3 miles, thus taking 
away from the district on the other side of the railroad the possi- 
bility of taxing any part of the only corporation in either of the 
two communities. One of the less wealthy counties in Alabama 
derives about 65 per cent of its revenues from corporations, and as 
a matter of course these corporations are not evenly distributed 
throughout the county. If public schools in that county were sup- 
ported chiefly by district taxation it is clear that the schools of some 
districts would fare much better than those of others. To correct 
the conditions which these examples illustrate, and which are by no 
means confined to the States mentioned, many experts advocate a 
unit of administration and support larger than the school district. 
They argue that a larger unit, as for example the county, will effect 
a more nearly equal distribution of both the burdens and the oppor- 
tunities of public education. Hence the “county unit” was proposed 
for about 10 States at recent sessions of their legislatures, and the 
proposal met with favor in several cases. 
‘What appears to be the most sweeping law of this character enacted 
in 1915 was that of Alabama. In that State the county board of edu- 
cation was formerly composed of the county superintendent, ex officio, 
and four members elected by the chairmen ‘of the several district. 
boards. Its powers were limited to the general supervision of public 
schools outside of independent districts and to service in an advisory 
capacity to the county superintendent, but it was authorized to over- 
rule the actions of district boards. The act of 1915 created a board 
of five members to be elected by the qualified electors of the county. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  A EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The chief powers conferred upon this board are (1) to elect a county 
superintendent of education and fix his salary; (2) to elect a county 
treasurer of public-school funds; (3) to fill vacancies in its own mem- 
bership for unexpired terms; (4) to select assistant superintendents, 
supervisors, and necessary office force; (5) to select teachers upon 
nomination of the county superintendent and fix their salaries; (6) 
to erect, repair, and furnish schoolhouses, and determine all incidental 
expenses; (7) to fix the boundaries of school districts and locate 
schools; (8) to consolidate schools and provide for the transportation 
of pupils; (9) to arrange for the transfer of pupils when advisable; 
(10) to control public school funds; (11) to appoint in each district 
one or more, but not exceeding three, persons whose duty shall be to 
care for school property, look after the general interests of the school, 
and report to the county superintendent; (12) to enforce the compul- 
sory-attendance law. From the duties enumerated here it will be seen 
that the county board as created by the legislature of 1915. will have 
full control of the public schools; the district board as it formerly 
existed is practically eliminated. Its authority over school property, 
the selection of a teacher and the conduct of the business of the dis- 
trict generally is taken away and centralized in the county board. In- 
corporated cities and towns are exempt from the provisions of the 
act, but another enactment providing for the administration of schools 
in municipalities of from 2,000 to 6,000 population places towns of 
less than 2,000 under the control of county boards of education. 
The Texas act of 1915 makes fewer radical changes than the Ala- 
bama law. Under an act of 1911 a board of county school trustees 
had to do mainly with high schools and graded schools in rural com- 
munities. The immediate control of these schools, however, remained 
vested in the district trustees. The county trustees were authorized 
to classify high and elementary schools and to arrange school dis- 
tricts, the chief purpose of the law being to provide high-school facil- 
ities, at least through the tenth grade, for rural communities. The 
act of 1915 extends the control of the board to the “public free 
schools” of the county, but independent districts having 150 or more 
children of school age are not affected. The law is one of that kind 
which is susceptible to more than one construction, but it is fairly 
clear that district boards will remain intact and that a measure of 
control of the common, schools and the selection of the teaching staff 
for such schools will still be in the hands of the district board. The 
consolidation of two or more districts may be effected by petition of 
a majority of the qualified voters in each district concerned in the 
transaction. The county board acting in conjunction with the county 
superintendent is to apportion school funds, except to independent 
districts having a school population of 150 or more.

  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 5 
The “county-unit” system of administration for rural communi- 
ties has strong points in its favor, but one who studies the subject 
should differentiate public school support from public school con- 
trol. The cases already alluded to in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, 
and Alabama, which might be multiplied many times if all American 
systems of school support were subjected to close scrutiny, show the 
need of a more equitable distribution of the burden of support, but, 
from the standpoint of administration, they do not prove that the 
local district should be practically abolished. Some of the arguments 
against the complete submergence of the district are (1) that it 
breaks up the proper balance which should obtain among the civil 
units composing the State, namely, the State, the county, and the 
local district; (2) that it results from the confusion of public school 
support with public school control; (8) that it will tend to stifle local 
initiative and enterprise; (4) that in a larger unit opportunity is 
offered for rivalry among constituent communities and for favoritism 
to those communities in which members of the governing board are 
most interested; (5) that the interest and influence of dozens of men 
and women in each county, who might under the district system be 
vitally connected with the public schools as school-board members, 
are lost or dissipated by reason of the cutting off of such persons 
from direct connection With the schools. It would seem that any plan 
contemplating a larger unit than the district should be so devised as 
to leave to the district a mea’sure of local autonomy. The control of 
the school plant and authority to employ a more efficient teaching 
force or to extend the term beyond that provided by State and county 
funds could be vested in the district, and at the same time a good 
county system could be maintained. 
Other States which enacted laws affecting county organization 
generally adopted some modified form of the “county unit” or 
revised their statutes in minor particulars. Utah, however, extended 
the provisions of its law creating county school districts to all coun- 
ties and made the act mandatory, except that in counties having 
5,000 school population or more, which were already divided into 
two or more high-school districts, these high-school districts were 
constituted county school districts. Formerly any county having 
a school populaticn of 2,000 or more was authorized to form a 
“county school ‘district of the first class.” 
Under the 1915 act of Nebraska any county of less than 7,000 
population was authorized to organize a county school district; the 
adoption of the provisions of the act was left to local option. Ten- 
nessee extended to county boards of education and to county high- 
school boards the right of eminent domain fcr the purpose of acquir- 
ing land for school sites. In North Carolina the compensation per 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
diem of members of the county board was increased from $2 to $3 
each. 
Three States—Ohio, Wisconsin, and Oregon—receded somewhat 
from positions formerly taken with respect to county administration 
or supervision. The 1915 act of Ohio amended the code sections 
which created the county board of education by giving the qualified 
electors a voice in the formation of districts and the location of 
schools. Under the older law the county board was authorized, 
with the mutual consent of district boards interested, to transfer the 
whole or a part of a district not exempt from the provisions of the act 
to another such district. Now such a transfer can be made only after 
due notice is given, and can not be made at all if a majority of the 
qualified electors of the district file a written remonstrance. In 
arranging schools in districts subject to the provisions of the act, 
the county board may likewise be stopped by written remonstrance 
of a majority of the electors. 
Chapter 751 of the Wisconsin acts of 1918 created a county board 
of education of five members to be elected by the qualified voters and 
conferred upon it power to appoint one or more assistant county 
superintendents, a clerk, and a board of examiners for common- 
school diplomas; to form, alter, or consolidate school districts; and 
to fix the salaries of the county superintendent, assistant, and clerk. 
Chapter 531 of the acts of 1915 repealed this enactment and pro- 
vided for each “county superintendent district” a committee on 
common schools to consist of three persons chosen by the county 
board of supervisors. This committee is authorized to hear and de- 
termine appeals from the action of town boards, village boards of 
trustees, or city councils in the matter of creating, dissolving, or con- 
solidating school districts, but no consolidation may be effected if a 
majority of those voting at an election oppose it. The committee is 
directed to appoint, on nomination of the county superintendent, at 
least one supervising teacher to assist the superintendent in the super- 
vision of schools. In a county superintendent district having more 
than 125 schools the committee may appoint an additional supervis- 
ing teacher. The county superintendent is authorized to employ 
examiners for common-school diplomas. Neither the act of 1913 nor 
that of 1915 applied to cities having independent systems of schools. 
By an act of the Oregon Legislature of 1911 (ch. 79) there was 
created in every county having more than 60 schools a “county edu- 
cational board,” whose duty it was to divide the county into super- 
visory districts comprising not fewer than 20 nor more than 60 
school districts each and to employ a supervisor for each district so 
formed, except for one which was to be under the county superin- 
tendent. School. districts which provided for supervision within 
themselves were exempted. The act of 1915 amends this law by
-P-A-G-E-27
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, ie 
directing the county educational board, on petition of a majority of 
the district directors of any county, to dismiss supervisors employed 
by them. The county superintendent is directed thereafter to dis- 
solve the educational board. 
CODE COMMISSIONS. 
The recognition of the need of occasionally codifying all general 
State laws and bringing them together in a form having legislative 
sanction is universal, but the prevalent method of making codes and 
then adding numerous amendments at each session of the legislature 
through a period of years is hardly satisfactory for the purposes of 
the school administrator. Pamphlet “school laws,” published by 
State superintendents, who, of course, have no authority to amend 
them, are often found to contain inconsistencies and sometimes con- 
tradictions. The urgent need of enacting in most States complete 
“school codes” as single statutes is increasingly apparent, for where 
a single statute is made to cover the whole field of public education 
and is enacted with due deliberation it can be made comprehensive, 
clear-cut, and free from inconsistencies. From time to time one State 
or another has created a school-code commission and has directed it 
to make a survey of educational conditions and report to the gov- 
ernor or to the next legislature. The case of Pennsylvania’s commis- 
sion and resultant school code of 1911 is now well known. In 1913 
three States created commissions to investigate school conditions 
and report their findings. In 1915 three others followed their 
example. 
The State of Washington has an excellent school system and a 
commendable body of school laws, but it appears not yet satisfied 
with its achievements. The legislature of 1915 created a commis- 
sion to make an educational survey of the State and to report, with 
recommendations, on or before April 30, 1916. Higher institutions, 
as well as all public-school activities, are to come within the scope 
of the investigation. The commission is composed of six members— 
three from the State senate and three from the house of representa- 
tives, who are named in the act. 
The commission provided for in the Utah act differs from the 
Washington commission in that it is to be composed of the State 
superintendent of public instruction, the attorney general, and three 
members appointed by the governor. This commission is to investi- 
gate educational conditions and to report, with recommendations, 
including an educational bill, on or before September 1, 1916. The 
Wyoming act provides for a code commission to be composed of the 
State superintendent and four other members appointed by the gov- 
ernor. It is directed to report a school code to the governor and the 
next session of the legislature.

  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
TAXATION, 
Two distinct tendencies are noticeable in the 1915 enactments re- 
garding taxation for school purposes: (1) An increase of the maxi- 
mum number of mills on the dollar that may be levied, and (2) an 
inclination to make the larger units, State and county, bear more 
of the burden. Minnesota increased from 9 to 104 mills the total levy 
that may be made for schools in cities of 50,000 population or more. 
In cities of 20,000 to 50,000 the maximum was raised from 11 to 13 
mills; it was raised from 9 to 15 mills in cities of 10,000 to 20,000. 
West Virginia increased the maximum rates of district school levies 
for building and general maintenance funds from 124 cents and 
25 cents on the $100 to 15 and 30 cents respectively. In Iowa the 
largest amount that might be levied in consolidated districts under 
the old law was $32 per child of school age. The 1915 act increased 
this amount to $50 per child. Where an approved high-school course 
is maintained, $60 may now be levied. <A school district in Kansas 
was formerly permitted to levy as much as 33 mills; now, 44 mills 
may be levied, and a city of the third class maintaining an accredited 
high school may levy 6. North Dakota also raised its maximum rates 
of district taxes. South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Nevada, and 
Oregon made less noteworthy changes in their tax laws. In some of 
these States, as Idaho and Utah, reductions of maximum rates were 
made, but the new schedules would appear to be sufficient to produce 
ample funds. 
Four States—Alabama, Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota— 
enacted laws looking toward the raising of more school funds by 
counties. In the opinion of many school men this indicates a whole- 
some tendency. As has already been indicated in this chapter, there 
are valid arguments for a plan under which more school revenue 
may be derived from State and county sources. Such a plan would 
distribute more equitably the burdens of public school support; it 
is at least as much the business of the State and the county as it is 
of the district to provide public education. But they are not, as such, 
contributing equal parts with the district. Of the $507,227,455 re- 
ceived for public school purposes in the school year 1912-13, only 
$78,375,830, or 15.5 per cent, was received from State tax and appro- 
priations. If the States, as such, had contributed twice as much, 
their contributions would have been more in proportion to their 
responsibility. 
The amendment to the constitution which was proposed by the 
recent session of the Alabama Legislature looks toward an equal dis- 
tribution of school burdens among the three civil units—State, 
county, and district. This amendment, if ratified by the voters of the 
State, will authorize a county school tax of not exceeding 30 cents
-P-A-G-E-29
  - 
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 9 
on the $100 in addition to that now permitted. A district tax of 
not exceeding 30 cents on the $100 is also provided for, but no dis- 
trict may levy a tax until the county tax reaches 30 cents. A State 
tax of 30 cents and a county rate of 10 cents are now provided. It 
will be seen that when a county once votes the full 30 cents allowed 
under the amendment, any district therein may thereafter vote 30 
cents and may thus have available a 90-cent school revenue—one- 
third from the State, one-third from the county, and one-third from 
within its own limits. 
The Legislature of Texas also proposed a constitutional amend- 
ment. This proposal includes a new county tax of not exceeding 
50 cents on the $100, which may be voted by the qualified electors. 
The maximum district tax is increased from 50 cents to $1 on the 
$100. The State tax of not exceeding 20 cents remains the same. 
There appeared to be no necessity for raising this rate, since the 
income from permanent school funds and school lands amounts to 
approximately $2,500,000 a year and is constantly increasing. 
In New Mexico the old law provided for a maximum county tax 
of 3 mills on the dollar and a district tax of not exceeding 15 mills. 
The 1915 act provides for a county tax of not exceeding 18 mills for 
all schools, municipal and rural. This act also directs that the State 
current school fund be apportioned to counties on the basis of the 
school census. Formerly one-half of this fund was set aside to aid 
weak districts. 
The North Dakota act of 1915 provided for a county tax of 1 mill 
on the dollar. If voted by a majority of those voting at an election, 
the county commissioners will be required to levy the 1-mill tax. 
CONSOLIDATION OF DISTRICTS, 
The consolidation of rural districts for the purpose of providing 
graded or semigraded schools received attention from a number of 
legislatures in 1915. Some of the more important enactments were 
those of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, West Virginia, Rhode Island, 
Delaware, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Nevada. This subject has already 
been mentioned in this chapter under the head of the “ county unit.” 
The Minnesota act reduces from 12 to 10 the minimum number of 
sections of land which may compose a consolidated district if it 
contains an incorporated village and has property valuation of be- 
tween $200,000 and $1,000,000. The majority of the votes cast in 
the proposed district determines the matter of consolidation, but a 
rural district may be annexed to an incorporated village containing 
a State high, graded, or semigraded school by a majority vote of 
the district and the approval of the village board. Consolidated 
districts are classified as class A when they maintain school at least 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  = 
10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
eight months, with four or more departments. Class B must main- 
tain two or more departments. An approved consolidated school 
must have an industrial department, library, and suitable equip- 
ment. The State superintendent of education is authorized to pre- 
scribe the qualifications of the principal and assistants. State aid is 
provided as follows: Class A districts, $500; class B, $250; an amount 
necessary to pay for the transportation of pupils. The State may 
also aid in erecting a building, but amount allowed can not exceed 
$2,000, or 25 per cent of the cost. 
The Ohio consolidation act of 1915 is probably unique. It author- 
izes districts furnishing free transportation to public-school pupils 
to provide “ depots” from which to gather children and take them to 
school. ‘The depots are required to be so constructed as to be com- 
fortable, and they must not be more than 1} miles from the home of 
any child for whom transportation is provided. 
The new Rhode Island act empowers the town school committee, 
with the approval of the State commissioner of public schools, to 
unite any school with another. The older act authorized the union 
with another school of any school not having an average “number 
belonging” of 12. The committee, which was formerly permitted, 
is now required, to provide transportation for pupils “ who reside so 
far from from any public school as to make their regular attendance 
impracticable.” 
In Delaware the powers of the county school committee relative 
to the alteration of school districts were by the act of 1915 trans- 
ferred to the State board of education. 
Chapter 371 of the Wisconsin acts adds a new section to the code 
and repeals or amends other sections. It provides that if two or 
more districts are consolidated by vote of the qualified electors and 
an approved school building is provided, State aid in erecting such 
building may be granted to the extent of $1,000. It also provides 
that the electors in consolidated rural districts must arrange for the 
transportation of all children residing more than 2 miles from the 
schoolhouse. 
In West Virginia school boards were given larger powers in con- 
solidating schools, building graded schools, and transporting pupils. 
The Legislature of Idaho provided that, on petition of a majority 
of the heads of families residing in a school district, the county com- 
missioners must call an election to determine the question of annex- 
ing the district to an independent district. A majority vote in each 
district concerned is necessary to effect the annexation. The act of 
Oklahoma permits independent districts having an area, population, 
and assessed valuation equal to that required of consolidated dis- 
tricts to provide transportation of pupils. The same act also permits 
the transportation of all pupils under 10 years of age in consolidated
-P-A-G-E-31
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 11 
districts. The new Nevada law authorizes the county commissioners 
to consolidate districts on petition of a majority of the voters in each 
district affected. Another act of that State authorizes the formation 
of not exceeding six districts into an “industrial school union” for 
the purpose of providing manual training and the domestic arts. 
Towa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, 
and a few other States enacted more or less important laws relating 
to the consolidation of districts. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
So many laws of 1915 had to do with secondary education that only 
a few of the more important enactments can be mentioned here. 
A Kansas act provides that the legal electors in territory compris- 
ing not less than 16 square miles may form a rural high-school dis- 
trict. An incorporated city or town may under this act be included 
in the district by a majority vote of both the rural community and 
the city or town. The older act did not apply to counties having a 
population of less than 10,000. Another act of this State authorizes 
the establishment of county high schools in counties having 2,000 
population or more; the older law required 6,000 or more. Nebraska 
provided for the consolidation, or union, of districts for high-school 
purposes and increased by $15,000 annually the appropriation for 
agriculture in secondary schools. In counties of Montana which do 
not maintain county high schools, a tax of 3 mills may, under the 
1915 law, be levied for the maintenance of accredited district schools 
of secondary grade, and all eligible pupils of the county may attend. 
Similarly a tax of 10 cents on the $100 was provided for in Nevada, 
and counties having county high schools were authorized to estab- 
lish branches of such schools. A 1915 act of California equalizes 
high-school taxation by making all property in a county in which a 
high school is established contribute a reasonable share of support; 
the act reduces the tax in high-school districts and raises it in terri- 
tory outside of such districts, where only tax to pay tuition has 
hitherto been levied. The Wyoming Legislature authorized an addi- 
tional tax of 2 mills for secondary school purposes in districts main- 
taining a four-year course. In North Carolina the minimum amount 
of State aid was reduced from $250 to $200 for each approved rural 
high school, and the maximum amount was increased from $500 to 
$600. Since State aid in that State is conditioned on the amount 
raised by the local community, this act will have the effect of encour- 
aging the establishment of more high schools. 
Another form of legislation in 1915 was the provision in some 
States for the payment of tuition fees of high-school pupils not re- 
siding in high-school districts or in counties maintaining high schools.  
-P-A-G-E-32
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
The Oregon act provides for a county tax to pay such fees. In IIli- 
nois the county superintendent is now directed to set aside the 
amount necessary for this purpose before distributing the State fund 
to the districts of his county. The 1915 act of Idaho provides that 
any district not maintaining a full four-year course shall pay the 
tuition of a resident pupil who has completed the course given in the 
district and who desires to attend high school elsewhere. The Legis- 
lature of West Virginia enacted a similar law. In Kansas provision 
was made for submitting to the qualified electors the question of 
levying a county tax for paying high-school tuition fees. 
The junior high-school movement received notable impetus in 
1915. In California “intermediate schools,” more generally known 
in other parts of the country as junior high schools, were legalized. 
Small communities and union high-school districts may now estab- 
lish such schools. Elementary school districts are authorized to pay 
the tuition fees of resident seventh and eighth grade pupils who at- 
tend intermediate schools in other districts. The Oklahoma act pro- 
vides for the formation of union graded districts for the purpose of 
maintaining schools offering grades above the sixth and grants State 
aid for building purposes. The Michigan act defines a high school as 
a graded school of 12 grades with at least three teachers devoting 
their entire time to grades above the sixth. The older law required 
at least two teachers for grades above the eighth. A graded school 
district having one teacher for the eighth, ninth, and tenth grades is 
not now required to pay high-school tuition fees elsewhere for high- 
school work of the ninth and tenth grades. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
The year 1915 was a notable year for the cause of compulsory school 
attendance. Four States—South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, and 
Texas—which did not have laws on the subject, enacted laws at the 
last sessions of their legislatures. This new extension of the com- 
pulsory attendance area carries required attendance at school into 
the section where it has hitherto met the most stubborn resistance; 
the area now practically includes the entire United States, Georgia * 
and Mississippi alone remaining without laws on the subject. 
The 1915 act of South Carolina is a local option law. Upon peti- 
tion of a majority of the qualified electors of a district or “aggrega- 
tion of districts,” the county board of education is required to declare 
the law in effect in such district or districts, or, on petition of one- 
fourth of the electors, an election must be held to determine the mat- 
ter. All children between the ages of 8 and 14 who are physically 
able and who reside within 24 miles of school are required to attend 
  
1The legislature of Georgia convened in extra session in Nov., 1915, but at the time 
this chapter was written no attendance law had been enacted.
-P-A-G-E-33
    
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 13 
for the full term, or at least for four months. Children between the 
ages of 14 and 16 are required to attend unless lawfully employed or 
if they can not read and write simple English sentences. 
The act of Florida, like that of South Carolina, is put into effect 
in a county or district by vote of the people. When the provisions 
of the act are adopted by vote of the qualified electors of a county 
or district, children between 8 and 14 residing therein are required 
to attend school at least 80 days, but a three-fifths’ vote of the electors 
is necessary to adopt the provisions of the act. In both South Caro- 
lina and Florida attendance at approved private or parochial schools 
is accepted. Other exemptions usually found in attendance laws are 
made. 
The new acts of Alabama and Texas are mandatory for counties 
and districts and are State wide in their application. Supt. W. F. 
Feagin, of Alabama, thus summarizes the act of that State: 
This bill, which does not become effective until October 1, 1917, provides for 
compulsory education of a mild type. The attendance period is 80 days in 
length, though the county board of education has the authority to decrease it 
to 60 days for any particular school. The compulsory period begins at the 
opening of the school in the fall, unless the county board of education decides 
upon some other date, and the compulsory ages are from 8 to 15 years, inclusive. 
Certain children are excepted, namely, those who have finished the seven ele- 
mentary grades; those living 24 miles or more from the nearest school, unless 
transportation is provided; those physically or mentally incapacitated; those 
unable to attend school on account of poverty; those attending private and 
parochial schools. Attendance officers are provided to investigate cases of non- | 
attendance referred to them by the teachers, or by the superintendent, or by 
the board. Chitdren who become habitual truants may be committed to State 
institutions for juvenile offenders, and parents and other parties violating this 
law may be fined or imprisoned. 
In Texas children between 8 and 14 years old will be required to 
attend 60 days in 1916-17, 80 days in 1917-18, and 100 days in each 
year thereafter. Exemptions are, (1) children attending private 
schools or receiving approved private instruction; (2) those procur- 
ing physicians’ certificates to the effect that their attendance at 
school is inadvisable; (3) deaf, blind, and feeble-minded children 
when adequate provision is not made for their education by the dis- 
trict; (4) those living 24 miles or more from school, unless transpor- 
tation is provided; (5) those whose services are needed for the sup- 
port of the family, if they are over 12 years of age and have com- 
pleted the work of the fourth grade. 
More or less important changes were made in the laws of several 
States already having attendance requirements. California provided 
for assistant attendance officers to be employed on the basis of the 
number of pupils in average attendance. Massachusetts now requires 
the superintendent or other person in charge of a public or private  
-P-A-G-E-34
  14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
school to issue “tranfer cards” for pupils changing their residence. 
Connecticut provided for additional attendance officers. In North 
Carolina the duty of taking the school census was transferred from 
the attendance officer to the school committee. Another act of that 
State’s legislature authorized the county board of education, or the 
school board in any city or town of over 2,000 population, to extend 
the compulsory attendance period from the age of 12 years to the 
age of 13 or 14 years. South Dakota raised the maximum age from 
14 to 16 years. In that State after the first 6 grades are completed 
the school board may reduce the time required to 16 continuous 
weeks until the 8 grades are completed or until the age of 16 is 
reached. 
Wisconsin now requires minors between 14 and 16 who are work- 
ing under a permit to attend an industrial continuation or commer- 
cial day school not less than 5 hours per week for 8 months or 
4 hours for 10 months. Those between 16 and 17 are required to 
attend not less than 5 hours’ for 6 months or 4 hours for 10 months. 
Pennsylvania enacted a similar law. There, in order to be law- 
fully employed, minors between 14 and 16, except those employed 
on the farm or in domestic service, must attend a school approved 
by the State superintendent of public instruction for not less than 
8 hours each week, but this provision is inoperative where no ap- 
proved school is maintained. 
HEALTH PROVISIONS. 
For two decades the health of the school child has received an in- 
creasingly large amount of attention. At the time the legislatures 
of 1915 met, the medical inspection of public-school pupils was 
required, at least in certain districts, in 9 States; it was specifically 
permitted by law in 18 States, while in several others it was prac- 
ticed under general authorizations of the law. At: the same time 
complete legal regulation of schoolhouse construction was found in 
10 States; moderate or partial regulation was found in 23; in several 
others some degree of regulation was provided for. 
The Connecticut act of 1915 amends chapter 207 of the Public 
Acts of 1907 by making the medical inspection of public-school 
pupils mandatory in cities and towns of over 10,000 inhabitants. It 
was formerly permissive in all districts. The school board is charged 
with the employment of one or more school physicians, except that 
in municipalities where the board of health is maintaining “ medical 
inspection substantially as provided for in this act, the board of 
health shall appoint and assign such physicians.” No physical 
examination may be made of any female child except by a woman 
physician, or, after notice to parent or guardian, by a male in the 
presence of parent or guardian or a female nurse.  
-P-A-G-E-35
    EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, - 15 
A Florida act provided for medical inspection under the super- 
vision of the State board of health. This act does not apply to cities 
of over 5,000 inhabitants where inspection has already been estab- 
lished by the city board of health and is continued in accordance with 
the rules prescribed by the State board. County physicians are 
made school inspectors, and where there is no such physician, the 
county commissioners are directed to appoint a school physician. 
Not more than 2,500 children shall be assigned to any one inspector. 
The 1915 act of Kansas permits provision for free dental inspec- 
tion in all cities of 40,000 population or more. 
In North Dakota a school board is now required to employ a 
medical inspector when petitioned by a majority of the persons hay- 
ing children attending the schools of the district. The older act only 
permitted the employment of an inspector. .The new Wyoming law 
makes it the duty of teachers, under rules and regulations prescribed 
by the superintendent of public instruction, to examine each pupil 
for defects of eyes, ears, nose, and throat without coming into 
physical contact with the child. The act applies to teachers in in- 
corporated cities and towns. ; 
Acts amending laws providing for vaccination were passed in a 
few States. In Rhode Island a child may now be exempt from 
vaccination on furnishing a certificate from a reputable. practicing 
physician. New York amended its law by making vaccination com- 
pulsory for admission to schools only in cities of the first and second 
class. Whenever smallpox exists in any other school district or in 
the vicinity, the State commissioner of health is directed to notify 
the school authorities, and it is made their duty to exclude from the 
schools every child not producing a vaccination certificate from a 
duly certified physician. 
Several legislatures concerned themselves with schoolhouse con- 
struction and sanitation. A New Hampshire act directs the State 
board of health, on complaint of any responsible person, to inspect 
any schoolhouse or building used for school purposes. The board 
of health may either order improvements or condemn any insani- 
tary building. Delaware now appropriates $1,750 annually for the 
improvement of schoolhouses for colored people. An act of the 
Michigan Legislature requires plans for all new buildings or addi- 
tions costing more than $300 to be submitted to the State superin- 
tendent for his approval. He is also authorized to condemn or order 
closed any unsafe or insanitary building. West Virginia created a 
State board of health and authorized it to “make rules and regula- 
tions regulating the ventilation, warming, natural lighting, and 
excreta disposal in public halls, churches, schoolhouses, and public 
institutions.” An act of Illinois directed the superintendent of 
public instruction to prepare, with the advice of the State board  
-P-A-G-E-36
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of health, State architect, and State fire marshal, school building 
specifications, giving minimum requirements for heating, lighting, 
seating, ventilation, water supply, toilets, and safety against fire. 
The county superintendent is directed to inspect buildings and en- 
force compliance with the specifications prescribed by the State 
superintendent. The distributive school fund may be withheld from 
any district not complying with the State regulations. The Utah 
act provided for the appointment of a State architect to inspect plans 
and visit and inspect buildings in course of construction when the 
cost of the building or addition is $1,000 or more. 
THE SCHOOL TERM. 
Laws increasing the minimum school term were enacted in four 
States. In order to share in the distribution of the State school 
fund, towns in Maine must now maintain their schools at least 30 
weeks. The shortest term formerly allowed was 26 weeks. The 
new act of Illinois raises from six to seven months the term required 
of districts of less than 1,000 population. Idaho now requires dis- 
tricts, other than independent districts, which have fewer than 75 
children of school age, to maintain a seven-months’ term. New 
Mexico increased the minimum from five to seven months in rural 
districts and provided that municipal and four-room graded schools 
shall run nine months. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The movement in recent years for the improvement of rural schools 
is affecting materially the training of teachers; it is giving impetus 
to the demand for better teachers in rural communities. This de- 
mand is being met by the extension of State normal-school work and 
the development of normal training in high schools. Prior to Janu- 
ary 1, 1915, 14 States had provided for teacher training as a part of 
their systems of secondary education. Two additional States made 
similar provisions in 1915, and extensions were made in some other 
cases. 
West Virginia was one of the two States referred to above. The 
State board of education was directed to prescribe the course of study 
and rules for the government of teacher-training departments in 
schools of secondary grade. As many as 10 high schools maintaining 
these departments may each receive a special subsidy of $400 a year, 
but this subsidy may not be granted to any high school located in a 
county in which there is a State normal school or other State school 
offering similar courses of study for training teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 17 
The Florida act of 1915 directed the State board of education to 
establish a training class in one high school in each county, but this 
class must have at least 10 students in it. The State board is di- 
rected to apportion $500 to each class, if the county board appro- 
priates $500 to a teacher to devote his entire time to the department. 
A State appropriation of $25,000 was made to carry out the provi- 
sions of the act. Kansas increased its appropriation for normal 
training in high schools from $50,000 to $75,000 annually. 
In Missouri provision was -made for granting State aid to train- 
ing schools for elementary teachers in cities of 75,000 population or 
more. These schools are required to offer two years of professional 
training above a four-year high-school course, and must have the ap- 
proval of the State superintendent of public schools. Upon gradu- 
ation, students are entitled to a certificate of qualification to teach for 
three years in any elementary school of the State, and 16 months of 
successful experience while holding this certificate entitles the holder 
to a professional certificate for life. 
Nebraska provided for special courses in State normal schools for 
training rural school teachers. This act enlarges the course to in- 
clude social phases of rural life. The course covers common-school 
subjects, rural sociology, the management and organization of rural 
schools and rural community life, sanitary science, manual training, 
household economy, agriculture, and vocal music. 
New Mexico adopted a novel method of training teachers for rural 
schools. The 1915 law provides that the State superintendent shall 
appoint, annually, 50 student-teachers to study one year each in ap- 
proved normal schools which prepare teachers for rural communities. 
Applicants must be holders of third-grade certificates and must have 
taught at least two months; they must be able to speak and write 
both English and Spanish. An annual appropriation of $15,000 is 
made to carry out the provisions of the act. A normal school receiy- 
ing students under the act is allowed $300 for each student-teacher 
to pay necessary expenses. : 
Several other normal-school laws of more or less importance were 
enacted. In California the functions of the joint board of normal- 
school trustees were transferred to the State board of education. 
Pennsylvania continued its policy of acquiring title to subsidized 
private normal schools by appropriating $100,000 for the purchase of 
such schools. Texas took the initial steps toward the founding of 
three new schools for training teachers, and Ohio provided for a 
commission to establish one new school. Several States, as New 
Jersey, Florida, and South Dakota, amended their laws relating to 
summer schools.

TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
The certification of teachers is a subject to which legislatures de- 
vote no small amount of their attention. About one-third of the 
States which held sessions of their legislative bodies in 1915 enacted 
laws relating to the qualifications of persons desiring to teach. Lack 
of space here precludes mention of more than the main provisions 
of these laws. : 
The State of Alabama, which had not previously authorized the 
acceptance of diplomas from approved higher institutions and of 
credentials from other States, authorized the State board of exam- 
iners to accept these evidences of qualification. California trans- 
ferred to the State board of education the matter of certificating 
teachers of special subjects, and authorized the State board to pre- 
scribe regulations governing the issuance of such certificates by 
county boards. The Legislatures of Florida and Oklahoma passed 
bills similar to that of Alabama regarding the acceptance of diplomas 
from higher institutions offering accredited professional courses. 
Idaho provided for the certification of high-school teachers; at least 
two years of study above a four-year high-school course are now re- 
quired of applicants to teach secondary subjects. An act of the 
Illinois General Assembly relates to the renewal certificates and 
authorizes the holder of a high-school certificate to teach also in the 
seventh and eighth grades. Kansas amended its law in various par- 
ticulars, the main provisions. looking toward the requirement that 
elementary teachers be at least graduates of four-year high schools 
and that high-school teachers be college graduates. The act of Maine 
gives the State superintendent discretion in determining what is 
equivalent to a standard secondary school course in accrediting the 
credentials of teachers. 
A new requirement was added to the qualifications prescribed in 
Michigan. Hereafter no certificate may be granted in that State 
to any person over 21 years old who is not a citizen of the United 
States. The 1915 acts of Michigan also provide for the issuance of 
certificates to teachers of special subjects and require professional 
training of applicants who have not had experience in teaching. 
Missouri and New Mexico amended their certificate laws in less 
important particulars. The main provisions of North Carolina’s new 
law on the subject relate to the renewal of certificates and accrediting 
academies and professional work in approved higher institutions. 
The act of Washington authorizes the State board of education to 
prepare a list of accredited colleges and normal schools, both within 
and outside the State, to whose graduates certificates might be issued 
without examination except in the State Manual. West Virginia 
revised its law generally and provided for seven different grades, or 
classes, of certificates.

  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. : 19 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES. 
The amount of compensation which a teacher may receive is gen- 
erally left for local school authorities to fix by contract, but some 
States fix by law the minimum. salary that may be paid. In 1914 
there were 13 such States. No law of very great importance was 
enacted on the subject in 1915, but several noteworthy enactments 
were put upon the statute books. 
The act of Wisconsin provides that any rural school teacher who 
is retained in the same school after the first year shall receive from 
State funds $2 per month in addition to the salary paid by the 
district; if retained after the second year, $4 per month; if retained 
after the third year, $8 per month for that and each succeeding year. 
Successful rural school teachers who are graduates of a rural-school 
course of normal training equivalent to two years above the high 
school are entitled to State aid of $10 per month for the first year 
and to $15 per month for each succeeding year in which the school 
is successfully taught. 
In Ohio a teacher must have had at least one year of professional 
_ training in order to be entitled to the benefit of the law prescribing 
a minimum salary of $45 per month. Under the old law the amount 
of professional training required was only six weeks. The 1915 act 
of Oregon requires school boards to pay women teachers equal sal- 
aries with men’s where the same or like service is rendered, but con- 
sideration may be given to successful experience. Utah, under its 
act of 1915, requires a district to levy a tax of 10 mills on the dollar 
before it may receive State aid to maintain its school 28 weeks and 
pay its teacher $525 per annum. Under the older law 5 mills was 
the requirement. The single general educational bill which became 
a law at the regular session of the Georgia Legislature of 1915 
related to teachers’ salaries. It provides for the prompt payment of 
salaries as they become due. 
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS, 
Though slow to adopt a general policy of civil pensions, the 
United States is now practically committed to a program of aid for 
superannuated teachers. In 1914 there were 14 States which had 
teachers’ pension laws applying to their entire areas, and 12 others 
had enacted statutes which applied to certain cities or school dis- 
tricts. The legislatures of 1915 added to this list 3 States which 
had previously had no enactments on the subject, and made State- 
wide the application of the laws of 4 others. The 3 additions to the 
list were New Hampshire, Montana, and Nevada. The 4 States 
which extended the application of their laws were Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, and Minnesota. Less important amendments were made 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
    20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to the plans in operation in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsyl- 
vania, and North Dakota. The similarity of pension laws renders 
jt unnecessary to attempt here an extended description of each act 
of 1915. The main principle running through all acts of this kind 
is that aged or incapacitated teachers who have taught a reasonable 
length of time may be retired on an annuity which is paid from a 
fund created by their own contributions, appropriations of public 
moneys, or both. A noticeable feature of teachers’ pension laws is 
the tendency toward the increase of contributions from public 
moneys to retirement funds. The Illinois law enacted in 1915 will 
suffice to show the trend in pension enactments. 
In Illinois the State board of trustees of the retirement fund con- 
sists of the superintendent of public instruction, the State treasurer, 
and three members elected by the contributing teachers. The State 
treasurer is ex officio treasurer of the fund. Teachers already em- 
ployed may or may not elect before September 1, 1920, to become 
members of the association. Those entering the service for the first 
time are deemed to accept the terms of the act. Members are divided 
into three classes: (1) Those having taught 10 years or less; (2) 
those having taught 10 to 15 years; (3) over 15 years. Assessments . 
upon salaries are as follows: First class, $1 per month for first five 
months each year; second class, $2 per month for first five months 
each year; third class, $6 per month for first five months through a 
period of 10 years in this class. It is provided that assessments shall 
be withheld from salaries by the governing boards of school districts. 
An amount sufficient to meet all demands is appropriated from the 
common-school fund. This amount, until otherwise provided by 
Jaw, must be equal to a tax of one-tenth of 1 mill on all taxable prop- 
erty of the State, except property in districts to which the act does 
not apply. Gifts and bequests may be accepted. Before being re- 
tired a teacher must have contributed the full amount of $400 or 
make up the deficiency. After 15 years of service, a teacher may be 
retired for disability, but the full $400 must have been contributed or 
the deficiency made up. Each teacher retiring is entitled to $16 an- 
nually for each year taught, but not to exceed $400. No person under 
50 years of age may be retired, except for disability. Any teacher 
ceasing to teach before becoming a member of the third class is en- 
titled to the return of one-half of the amount contributed by him or 
her. The word “teacher” is defined in the act to include a teacher, 
teacher-secretary, principal, supervising principal, supervisor, as- 
sistant superintendent, or superintendent. Cities of over 65,000 popu- 
lation which have retirement systems of their own are exempt from 
the provisions of the act.

  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 21 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The Legislature of North Dakota enacted what were probably 
the most notable acts of 1915 relating to higher education. In that 
State important changes were made in both the support and the 
control of higher institutions. Chapter 148 of the act of 1913, 
which provided a tax of 14 mills on the dollar for the support of 
State educational institutions, was repealed; and, in lieu of this 
tax, provision was made for a levy sufficient to raise the lump sum 
of $347,880 annually. A stipulated part of this sum is to be ap- 
portioned to each institution. Another act of that State created a 
board of regents to have control of State educational institutions. 
This board is appointed by the governor with the consent of the 
Senate. The term of members will be six years; two or one as the 
case requires will retire every two years. The compensation of each 
member is fixed at $7 per day and traveling expenses. The regents 
succeed to the powers and duties of the normal school board and the 
boards of trustees of other institutions. The act applies to State 
institutions of higher grade. 
The last Legislature of Texas proposed an amendment to the con- 
stitution which, if ratified, will separate the State university and 
the agricultural and mechanical college. Under the present consti- 
tution the agricultural and mechanical college is a branch of the 
university. 
The 1915 act of Massachusetts established a department of uni- 
versity extension, to be under the control of the State board of edu- 
cation. The State board is directed to appoint a head of this de- 
partment and the necessary assistants. The department is author- 
ized to cooperate with existing institutions of learning in the estab- 
lishment and conduct of extension and correspondence courses. 
Agents, lecturers, and instructors may be employed. An annual 
appropriation of $25,000 is made for the support of the work. 
In Nevada the various public-service departments of the university 
were consolidated and became the “ public-service division.” The 
legislature of that State also authorized the establishment of emeritus 
professorships, and created at Tonopah, under the control of the 
regents of the university, a State school of mines. A 1915 act of 
Wisconsin defines the several departments of the university, as, for 
example, the “college of letters,” etc. The Tennessee Polytechnic 
Institute was established at Cookeville in that State, but the proviso 
was added that the town must contribute as much as $75,000 in cash 
or the equivalent. Colorado provided for the levy of an addi- 
tional tax of five and one-half hundredths of 1 mill on the dollar 
for the support of the State university.
-P-A-G-E-42
22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
LIBRARIES, 
The trend of legislation on this subject in 1915 was generally 
toward the extension of library facilities. The legislatures of sev- 
eral States enacted laws of this character. In Maine a State appro- 
priation of $1,000 was made for traveling collections of books for 
circulation among high schools in cities and towns having no public 
libraries. Connecticut increased from $3,200 to $4,000 the amount 
which the State public library committee may expend. A West 
Virginia act, known as the “library law,” authorizes any city, town, 
or school district to hold an election to decide for or against the es- 
tablishment of a public library or reading room. The Legislature 
of Texas provided for the establishment at county seats of county 
libraries with circulating departments and authorized a tax of not 
exceeding 6 mills to support them, but a two-thirds vote of the 
qualified electors of any county is necessary to make the provisions 
of this act applicable to the county. Arizona provided for a State 
library with a law and legislative reference bureau. Under a 1915 
act of California, not exceeding 80 cents for each pupil in attend- 
ance in a city or city-and-county school system shall be set aside as a 
library fund. The same State extended the privileges of county 
libraries to the high schools of the county by providing for branches. 
In Washington the common council in an incorporated town may 
now establish a library. Wyoming raised from one-fourth mill to 
one-half mill the maximum county library tax.t 
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The movement for giving, in the public-school system, a place for 
training workers in the industries was not neglected by the legisla- 
tures of 1915. 
In Connecticut the State board of education was authorized to 
establish public day, continuation, part-time, and evening industrial 
schools in addition to those already established. Under this act no 
child under 14 years of age may be admitted except in vacation time. 
The State board is also authorized to arrange with manufacturing 
and mechanical establishments to permit pupils to practice their 
prospective trades, arts, or crafts. Any school district may now 
establish an industrial school by vote of the people. The State board 
is charged with the duty of approving schools for the purpose of 
granting State aid. 
Massachusetts provided for the establishment of an independent 
industrial school in Hampshire County, and authorized any city or 
town to organize day and evening classes in household and other   
1See also Ch, XXI, Library Activities.
-P-A-G-E-43
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 
practical arts for women. Formerly only evening classes of this 
character were authorized. 
Pennsylvania, which already had an industrial-education law, 
created a bureau of vocational training in the State department of 
education. An annual appropriation of $325,000 was made for voca- 
tional training. 
The Minnesota act provided that any approved high school, graded 
school, or consolidated rural school may be designated by the State 
board of education to give instruction in industrial subjects, such_as 
agriculture, home economics, manual training, and commercial pur- 
suits. For the purpose of giving industrial training, a school district 
may become “ associated ” with a high, graded, or consolidated rural 
school by vote of the qualified electors of the district and the ap- 
proval of the board of the school with which association is sought. 
State aid is provided. Nebraska also made provision for industrial 
training and granted State aid. 
A Wisconsin act defined an “apprentice? as a minor under 16 
years of age who enters the employ of another and receives for his 
services, in whole or in part, instruction in any trade, craft, or busi- 
ness. Another act of the same State permits an employed person 
over 14 years old to attend an industrial school in the district where 
employed and requires the district of his residence to pay his tuition 
fees. California authorized districts which maintain schools for 
eight months or more to establish vocation schools. The Oregon 
Legislature repealed the act of 1913 which permitted districts having 
a population of 20,000 or more to establish and maintain trade 
schools for girls. 
Florida authorized county boards of education and trustees of 
special tax districts to establish departments of home economics in 
their schools. 
‘As regards agriculture, the enactments of 1915 extended agricul- 
tural instruction in the public schools, established a few additional 
schools of agriculture, and accepted the provisions of the “Smith- 
Lever Act.” The acts of a few States may be mentioned here. That 
of Rhode Island provided for the division of the State into three 
agricultural districts in which may be organized farm bureaus for 
the purpose of cooperating with the United States Department of 
Agriculture and the State in extension work. Ohio placed agri- 
cultural instruction in county districts, under the supervision of the 
county superintendent. The older law providing for the division 
of the State into four agricultural districts and for the appointment 
of four State supervisors of agricultural instruction was repealed. 
Towa authorized cities of 20,000 population or more to acquire land 
outside of the city limits for a school garden and farm. Arkansas “

the biennium the liberal appropriation of $47,260 for agri- 
and home-economics extension work in cooperation with the 
Feav._. Government. 
KINDERGARTENS. 
Decided impetus has been given to the kindergarten propaganda 
in recent years. The establishment and maintenance of kinder- 
gartens is now either required by law under certain conditions, spe- 
cifically permitted by law, or permitted under general authorizations 
in all States except one. Several States passed acts in 1915 affecting 
this form of school activity. 
The act of California authorized a district board, after maintain- 
ing kindergartens for one year, to establish others, and provided that 
a district tax of not exceeding 10 cents on the $100 may be levied for 
support. Connecticut raised to 4 years the minimum age of children 
that may attend; it was formerly 8 years. In Illinois the board of 
directors of a district having less than 1,000 population is no longer 
required to secure authority by vote of the people to establish kinder- 
gartens. Nevada authorized the school trustees of any district to 
establish kindergartens, on petition of the parents or guardians of 
25 children between the ages of 4 and 6 years, and provided for a 
district tax of not exceeding 25 cents on the $100. North Carolina 
provided for a district tax of not exceeding 15 cents on the $100, if 
voted by the people, but this act appears to be inoperative by reason 
of not having been read three times on three different days in each 
branch of the legislature. The North Dakota law, which was for- 
merly permissive, is now mandatory in districts where a majority 
of the legal voters petition for the establishment of a kindergarten; 
in cities of over 5,000 population only one-fifth of the legal voters is 
sufficient. ‘ 
TEXTBOOKS. 
No very conspicuous progress was made in school-book legislation 
in 1915. Texas provided for free textbooks and Oregon repealed its 
act of 1913. The new act of Texas provides that, on petition of 10 
per cent of the qualified tax-paying voters of a district, an election 
shall be held to determine the question of levying a special tax for 
the purpose of furnishing free textbooks to all pupils of school age. 
The 1915 act of Oregon repealed a law similar to that enacted by 
Texas. 
Uniform textbooks is a subject which constantly receives attention 
from legislators. The North Dakota act of 1915 provides for uni- 
formity within districts. Adoptions are to be made by district 
boards from lists approved by the State superintendent. Books must 
be sold to pupils at not exceeding 15 per cent above the net price. It 
   
-P-A-G-E-45
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 25 
is also provided that when a family removes from a district not fur- 
nishing free textbooks, the school board may purchase books belong- 
ing to the children of such family. The board is authorized to fur- 
nish free textbooks and is required to furnish them free when di- 
rected by vote of the qualified electors. The Kansas act authorizes 
the State school book commission to adopt textbooks for high schools. 
The Texas act of 1915 is unique. It provides that all books adopted 
by the State textbook board shall be “ printed, bound, completed, and 
finished within the State of Texas.” This act, however, will not be 
operative where publishers present satisfactory proof that they can 
contract for editions at a substantially lower price outside of the 
State. 
THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN. 
The 1915.act of Maine followed the usual provisions of the more 
progressive type of child-labor legislation. Its main provision is 
that no child under 14 years of age may be employed in a manufac- 
turing or mechanical establishment, nor in any service for hire while 
the public schools are in session. Employment of minors between 14 
and 16 years old is restricted to those to whom employment certifi- 
cates are issued by the school superintendent. This certificate must 
show that the child is over 14 years old and that he or she can read 
and write simple English sentences and do arithmetical problems 
through division. <A health certificate may also be required by the 
superintendent or the factory inspector. Permits to work in vacation 
time may be issued upon the same conditions as employment certifi- 
cates, but no educational qualification is required for this permit. 
New Hampshire also provided for the issuance of permits to work 
in vacation time. An act of the legislature of Rhode Island regu- 
lated the employment of minors in street occupations. Connecticut 
raised from 12 to 16 the age at which children may be employed for 
exhibition purposes. 
The Legislature of Pennsylvania enacted a rigid child-labor law. 
The main propositions are: No child under 14 years of age shall be 
employed in any establishment or occupation, except on the farm or in 
domestic service. Minors between 14 and 16 who are employed must 
attend not less than eight hours each week a school approved by the 
State superintendent of public instruction; but this provision is not 
effective where no such school is maintained. Minors between 14 and 
16 shall not be employed more than 9 hours a day, or 51 hours in a 
week, hours in school included. No minor under 16 may be employed 
in a dangerous occupation; no person under 18 may be employed in 
the more hazardous occupations or in any position injurious to health 
or morals; no person under 21 years old shall be employed where 
intoxicating liquors are sold. The industrial board of the depart-  
-P-A-G-E-46
  26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
ment of labor and industries is authorized to determine what con- 
stitute dangerous or injurious occupations. The school record re- 
quired for the employment certificates of minors over 14 years old 
must show that the minor has completed work equivalent to the first 
six grades. A physician’s certificate showing physical fitness is re- 
quired for children employed between the ages of 14 and 16. The 
school record is not required for permits to work in vacation time. 
The person issuing an employment certificate must send it to the 
prospective employer of the minor, and the employer must ac- 
knowledge receipt. The State board of education when notified by 
the State superintendent that this act is not enforced in any school 
district is directed to appoint an attendance officer for such district. 
The compensation of this officer is to be deducted from the State 
funds to be apportioned to the district. Upon notice to an employer 
that a minor is not lawfully employed, the employer is required to 
furnish proof of lawful employment or dismiss the minor from his 
service. This provision, it will be seen, puts the burden of proof on 
the employer. 
The Michigan act added “office or restaurant” to occupations in 
which boys under 18 and females may not be employed longer than 
an average of 9 hours a day or 54 hours a week. That State now pro- 
hibits the employment of a child under 15 in any factory, workshop, 
store, laundry, office, hotel, mine, bowling alley, billiard room or pool 
room conducted for profit. Formerly the age limit fixed in this 
provision was 14 years. The schooling certificate issued to any minor 
between 15 and 16 years of age must show that the work of the sixth 
grade has been completed. The older law required only the work of 
the fourth grade. Texas regulated the employment of women and 
girls. Utah now prohibits the employment of children under 14 in 
places where tobacco is sold. 
The Legislature of Wyoming, which had hitherto provided meager 
regulation of child labor, extended the provisions of its law on the 
subject. Now no minor under 18 years old shall be employed where 
intoxicating liquors are sold or otherwise handled, and no child under 
14 may deliver messages to such a place. No child under 16 shall be 
employed in an occupation which is injurious to health or morals. 
No child under 14 shall be employed in a mine or other hazardous 
occupation, nor shall any such child work at any gainful occupation, 
except on a farm or in domestic service, for more than 9 hours a day 
or 56 hours a week.

  CHAPTER IT. 
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 
By James H. Van Sickie, 
Superintendent of Schools, Springfield, Mass. 
ConTENTS.—The Gary duplicate plan in New York City—Readjustments in grades above 
the sixth—Standards of achievement—vVocational education—Atypical children— 
Health of school children—Schools as social centers. 
Among the enterprises in large school systems that have received 
recent emphasis in the public press and to some extent in reports of 
superintendents the so-called Gary duplicate plan easily holds first 
place. The ever-increasing school enrollment, with its accompanying 
demand for more buildings and the higher ideal of what constitutes 
a suitable school building, has greatly increased expenditures for 
school purposes. When a scheme is proposed by which existing 
buildings may accommodate two sets of pupils, it is no wonder that 
wide interest is aroused. Any plan that will lessen the expense of 
housing school children makes a strong appeal to boards of estimate, 
school boards, and the press. School boards are not willing, how- 
ever, to be hurried into adopting, for exclusive use in a situation 
quite different from that in which it originated, a plan so radically 
different from the customary one without carefully testing its 
applicability. 
THE GARY DUPLICATE PLAN IN NEW YORK CITY. 
The most notable instance of public interest in the Gary plan is 
found in New York City, where it is hailed by its advocates as a 
complete and satisfactory solution of the part-time problem which 
the city has been unsuccessfully grappling with for many years. Ac- 
cordingly, Supt. Wirt, of Gary, Ind., was engaged under a part-time 
contract at a liberal salary to direct the installation of his plan in 
several New York schools in congested sections of the city. Now, 
after less than a year of trial, those who control the finances urge the 
adoption of the plan for the whole city. Of the 12 or 14 schools in 
which the Gary idea is being tried, only 2 are working it out in any 
complete way—No. 45 in the Bronx and No. 89 in Brooklyn. In 
27
-P-A-G-E-48
  28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
these two schools facilities are yet lacking for an absolutely fair trial, 
In the other schools a modification of the Gary plan, limited to the 
upper grades, is in operation. 
Obviously the plan has not yet had time or opportunity to demon- 
strate its applicability to the New York situation. The board of 
superintendents and the school board are opposed to sweeping action 
at this time. They regard the duplicate plan as yet on trial and 
believe immediate action would be ill advised. 
It is not generally claimed for the duplicate plan that it is less 
expensive than the customary plan, except in the matter of build- 
ings. This, however, is a large item, and if proof is forthcoming 
that the plan is at least equal in educational value to the single-class 
plan its wide extension may be expected. It is advocated largely, 
but not exclusively, on the ground of lower cost. There are those, 
however, whose approval is based upon the claim that by means of 
a longer school day it affords to the children wider opportunities for 
work, study, and play; that it distributes the burden of teaching 
more evenly over the entire teaching staff; and that it affords pre- 
vocational training to all children in all of the grades instead of 
confining such work to a small group of children in the seventh and 
eighth grades. 
The Gary system has commended itself to students of education 
for various reasons. It promises: 
1. An enriched school life for every pupil. 
2. A coordination of all existing child-welfare agencies and a fuller utiliza- 
tion of all facilities in present public and private recreational and educa- 
tional institutions. 
. A solution of the part-time problem. 
. A double school plan by which each school seat serves two children. 
. A wider use of the school plant. 
» An increase in the school day through a coordination of work, study, and 
play activities. 
7. A program that would inyest the child’s nonacademic time to greater 
profit and pleasure. 
8. A socialized education in harmony with progressive thought of the day.

On the other hand, those who oppose the immediate and wholesale 
adoption of the duplicate plan for the elimination of part-time ex- 
press doubt as to certain novel features of school administration 
which it embodies, such as departmental teaching for all children 
from the first year through the eighth, instruction of groups of 
children by pupils instead of teachers, the grouping together of 
younger and older pupils for auditorium, laboratory, and workshop 
exercises, the substitution of an auditorium period for classroom in- 
struction, the omission of formal physical training, supervised play 
with only four teachers for 12 classes, the deferring of scholastic 
work for first-year children until late in the afternoon. They urge
-P-A-G-E-49
  EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 29 
that sufficient time has not elapsed to test the worth of the schemes 
and that prudence should suggest awaiting the outcome of experi- 
ments in the schools already selected before committing the entire 
city to the new plan. 
With regard to the extensive departmental teaching to which 
objection is urged, Mr. Wirt replies that it is not essential to the 
plan. It is part of the experiment in School No. 45, but not in No. 
89. He points out that the time for auditorium work is secured, not 
by taking time from regular instruction, but by lengthening the 
school day. Mr. Wirt’s reply to the criticism that the plan does not 
provide suflicient supervision for the playground is that there is 
nothing in his plan to prevent the use of more teachers on the play- 
ground if it is so desired, but that four specially trained teachers are, 
in his opinion, sufficient to care for 12 classes during this period. 
Play is itself educational, he believes, when it is given under condi- 
tions that develop initiative and responsibility and create natural 
situations in which under wise supervision older children can exer- 
cise their instictive desire for leadership. Too much supervision of 
play by teachers would tend to limit the possibilities for the de- 
velopment of such qualities through carrying over to the playground 
the rigidity of the classroom. 
A further criticism is that outside instruction in the home or in 
the church is permitted, but that no means is provided for seeing that 
such instruction is the equivalent of regular schooling. 
To this criticism the reply is made that it would be very unfor- 
tunate if the school undertook to insure that such instruction should 
be the equivalent of regular schooling, for in that case the school 
would be supervising religious instruction, which the law expressly 
prohibits. The program simply provides that the child can be 
excused during the day to take private lessons at home or attend 
religious instruction, if the parent so desires. These periods are 
never taken from the academic work, and therefore do not detract 
from the regular work of the school. As in the case of play and 
auditorium, it is simply time which, in the traditional school, the 
child would spend upon the street. What is taught in these outside 
classes and how it is taught is not and should not be the concern of 
the school. 
The attitude of those who view the school chiefly from the angle 
of costs is illustrated in the following program announced by the 
controller: 
1. The total elimination of any increase in the budget of the board of educa- 
tion for 1916. This means a saving of about $4,000,000. 
2. The total elimination of part time and overcrowding in the schools. This 
is accompanied by intensive use of school buildings as they exist. New con- 
struction will be limited almost exclusively to new districts or where pres- 
ent buildings are in bad condition.
-P-A-G-E-50
  30 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
3. The extension of the school year from 40 to 44 weeks. 
4, The lengthening of the school day from 5 to 6 hours. 
5. The total elimination of extra pay for services in vacation schools and 
other forms of extra pay for persons employed on annual salaries . 
6. A reduction of 10 per cent in the number of teachers’ positions. This 
is made possible by lengthening the school day and the school year. 
7. A change in the system of promoting teachers whereby merit alone shall 
control. This means the eradication of the system of paying teachers more 
for service in seventh and eighth grades and the substitution of a plan whereby 
each teacher shall teach the classes for which she is best fitted. 
8, The reduction of the common-school course to seven years. 
The controller thinks the reduction of the course from 8 to 7 years 
could be brought about if the year’s term were increased to 44 weeks 
instead of 40, and that the extension of the school day might make 
it possible for children to complete the course in even less time. 
The attitude of those who regard the schools first from the point 
of view of their purpose is voiced by the president of the board of 
education as follows: 
It is but natural that the controller, from his official position should con-* 
sider school problems primarily from a standpoint of finances rather than of 
education best for the children. The members of the board of education, how- 
ever, decide all proposals, first, upon the basis of what is the best for children 
and, secondly, upon the basis of less expense to the people. 
Even in communities where the part-time problem is either less 
acute or else nonexistent, and where the expenditures for schools 
have not become so burdensome as in New York, there will be de- 
cided interest in the Gary duplicate plan. This gigantic experiment 
in education, now in full operation in one of the smaller cities and in 
partial operation in the largest American municipality, is unques- 
tionably of vast importance, yet the changes required in installing 
the system in existing schools are so radical and so expensive that 
school authorities will be disposed to await the result of an adequate 
trial in New York City before departing from the present policy 
which reserves a seat for every child. 
Several brief reports have been made upon the plan as found in 
operation in the Gary (Ind.) schools. Another, more extended and 
more thorough, is projected under the auspices of the General Educa- 
tion Board, with Dr. Elwood P. Cubberly in charge. A thoroughly 
scientific study of the duplicate plan, such as may be expected from 
Dr. Cubberly, will be awaited with keen interest by boards of educa- 
tion, by superintendents of schools, and by the public in general. 
READJUSTMENTS IN GRADES ABOVE THE SIXTH. 
The advisability of introducing differentiated courses open to 
choice two years before a pupil is ready for the high school is less 
under discussion now than last year. The rapid spread of the idea,
-P-A-G-E-51
  EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 31 
together with the wide acceptance which it has met, is in strong con- 
trast to the ordinary progress of a new movement in school organi- 
zation and management. Ordinarily it takes years of time to incor- 
porate in practice so radical a departure from traditional procedure. 
The discussion now relates rather to ways and means of introducing 
the courses than to the merits of the plan. 
During the past two years nine elementary schools in Boston have 
been reorganized on the intermediate plan. In other words, the 
work of the seventh and eighth grades in these schools has been re- 
organized to allow some choice of studies with opportunity for 
capable pupils to begin work carrying high-school credit. It is now 
recommended that the ninth grade be included and that a junior 
high school be established to provide for pupils of the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades, thus relieving the high school of its present 
first-year work. 
In many cities having crowded high schools the problem before 
the school authorities is whether to add to existing high-school ac- 
commodations or to relieve both grade and high school pressure by 
erecting separate school for grades 7, 8, and 9. It is argued that 
this plan is not only better educationally, but less expensive than the 
one so long customary. In several recent surveys this plan has been 
advocated as a solution to difficulties otherwise well-nigh insur- 
mountable. Even in a city or a section of a city where new build- 
ings are not imperatively needed the educational merits of the plan 
seem sufficient to suggest reorganization of the upper-grade work. 
In the city of Buffalo, N. Y., the differentiated courses have 
been introduced in a section which, while densely populated, was 
already adequately supplied with school buildings. The plan 
adopted is suggestive of what may easily be done for similar areas 
elsewhere. In Buffalo it is called the “group plan of organization 
of prevocational instruction.” Four adjoining school districts, Nos. 
12, 37, 41, and 47, have been formed in a group, as follows: No. 12 
continues the traditional courses. No. 37 offers a prevocational 
course for seventh, eighth, and ninth grade pupils along commercial 
lines. No. 41 offers a household-arts course for these grades. No. 47 
provides an industrial-arts course for the same grades. The first 
six grades in all of these schools continue as formerly. Upon com- 
pletion of six grades pupils who live in any one of these four dis- 
tricts are given the opportunity of choosing the type of course they 
wish to follow. A boy may choose between the traditional, com- 
mercial, and industrial-arts courses. A girl may choose between the 
traditional, commercial, and household-arts courses. There are 
about 150 pupils in the traditional course, 200 in the commercial 
course, 125 in the industrial-arts course, and 125 in the household- 
arts course. These courses are conducted on the plan of half-time
-P-A-G-E-52
  82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
shopwork and half-time book work. The present is the second year 
of this work and the people in the districts affected continue to give 
substantial support. No extensions of the plan have been made this 
year, but future extensions are contemplated. This plan is feasible 
where the schools are near enough and where a sufficient number of 
pupils in one course are available to use one building economically. 
Before reorganizing the work in the four Buffalo schools a circular 
of explanation was sent to the parents of all children enrolled in them 
above the fifth grade, and the parent was asked to sign a card after 
indicating upon it his choice among the courses listed upon it. The 
following paragraphs from the circular made it clear to the parents 
that not all children could continue at the home school even if they 
chose the old line course. 
We can not have all four courses in each school building. Each school will 
do a special part of the work, all of which is equally important. 
It is planned to divide the work as shown below, but it may be necessary to 
make changes according to the demands: 
Boys’ industrial work at School No. 47, Hickory, near Sycamore. 
Girls’ industrial work at School No. 41, Jefferson, near Sycamore. 
Boys’ and girls’ commercial course at School No. 37, Carlton and Peach. 
Preacademic (old line) course at School No. 12, Spruce, near Broadway, and 
in the other schools, if there is enough demand for them. 
These buildings are so near. each other that pupils in any one of the dis- 
tricts will have but a short distance to travel to reach any one of the centers. 
The junior high school plan as worked out in Rochester, N. Y., 
illustrates still another way of handling the problem. In a con- 
gested section of the city there were seven elementary schools, all 
overcrowded. Additional room had to be provided. Plans had 
already been drawn for additions to two buildings only, when the 
board of education took under consideration the erection of a central 
building in which might be gathered the pupils of the seventh and 
eighth grades of the surrounding schools, thereby giving the needed 
room and leaving these schools easily accessible for the younger 
pupils of the first six grades. The cost of these two additions alone 
would exceed $100,000, and it was estimated that the cost of all the 
additions required would fully equal, if it would not exceed, the cost 
of a central building. Six of these seven schools were, roughly 
speaking, in the circumference of a circle, while the seventh was 
approximately in the center of that circle. No one of these sur- 
rounding schools was scarcely more than one-half mile from the 
central grammar school building, thus making the maximum dis- 
tance to the central building not excessive for seventh and eight 
grade pupils. 
There was also another building problem which seemed to favor 
this central building plan. The East High School, which serves this 
particular community, was also overcrowded. If, then, the seventh 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 83 
and eighth grade pupils could continue their ninth year or first year 
high-school work in this central building, some measure of relief 
would be afforded to the East High School. These conditions, there- 
fore, pointed to the wisdom of the six-three-three plan of organiza- 
tion for this community. 
A grammar school central to this congested section was a com- 
paratively new building, having been first occupied in 1908. It was, 
furthermore, the largest grammar school in the city. It had a large 
assembly hall, a gymnasium, shower baths, and a swimming pool, a 
library, and other facilities which seemed to adapt it admirably for 
junior high-school purposes. It was lacking, however, in adequate 
shop room. It was decided, therefore, to add to the building the 
necessary shops and use this plant for the first junior high school. 
A new elementary school building was erected for the kindergarten 
and first six grades of this grammar school. 
The lines of work in this junior high school are the academic, the 
commercial, the household arts, and the industrial arts. At the 
present time no differentiation in courses is made until the beginning 
of the seventh A, or latter half of the seventh grade. This allows 
one-half year in which to study the needs, ability, and interests of 
each pupil. No pupil is assigned to any one of these courses until 
the home has been consulted, the entire record of the pupil in the 
elementary school studied, and the judgment of the present teacher 
secured.. Even in the seventh A grade the differentiation lies in 
subject content rather than in subjects. All pupils, for example, 
continue arithmetic, the application, however, in each course being 
adapted to the nature of the work in that course. The boy in the 
industrial arts course finds practical application of his arithmetic 
along trade lines, while the pupil in the commercial course finds 
special application along business lines. This is illustrative of the 
general principle of differentiation throughout the seventh A work, 
so far as the book subjects are concerned. At this time also the 
pupils of the household arts and industrial arts courses begin to 
spend one-third of their time in shop or manual work and the remain- 
ing two-thirds in book work. 
At the beginning of the eighth grade or second year of junior high 
school work a sharper differentiation takes place. Here the study 
of foreign language and general mathematics, including arithmetic, 
concrete geometry, and elementary principles in algebra, is begun by 
the pupils in the academic course. All the pupils here expect to go 
on into the general and college preparatory courses of the upper 
high school. The foreign language, Latin, for example, and the 
English grammar and composition, are taught by the same teacher, 
while the literature of the English work is taught by the teacher 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——3  
-P-A-G-E-54
  34 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of history and civics. Elementary science, drawing, music, penman- 
ship, and physical education, together with three hours each week 
of household arts for girls and shopwork for boys, make up the 
remaining schedule for the pupils of the academic course. This 
shopwork for the boys of the academic course is taken in the regular 
shops, and is given by the regular teacher of shopwork. Thus the 
manual training is linked with practical problems and is removed 
from the general and disciplinary field. The same principle applies 
to the girls of this course in the household arts work. 
In like manner no specialized work of secondary grade is at- 
tempted in the other courses until the ninth year, or regular first 
year high school period is reached. In the industrial arts course, the 
following types of shopwork are given: Machine, gas engine, print- 
ing, plumbing, cabinetmaking, and wood finishing. From the time 
the boy begins his work in this course at the beginning of the sev- 
enth A until he reaches the first year regular high school period, his 
time is spent, not in any one shop, but in all the shops, giving thereby 
a certain number of weeks to each. If at the end of this time, there- 
fore, he must go directly into the trades, he will have had some 
insight into the field of each, and some hand training, consistent with 
his maturity, that will be of service to him. On the other hand, if 
he is to continue his school work in the trades, he can with reason- 
able intelligence select his specialized trade. In other words, the 
work up to this point is prevocational rather than vocational. 
The school day begins at 8.80 and closes at 4.15, with one and one- 
fourth hours for noon intermission. This makes the school day six 
and one-half hours in length. The day is divided into four periods 
of one hour and thirty minutes each for actual instruction. During 
this time the entire school work of the pupil for the day is to be done. 
This gives a school day and a school period of sufficient length to 
provide for both the preparation and the recitation of lessons. 
STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT. 
One of the important duties of the school superintendent has 
always been the testing of his schools by some type of examination. 
At times this duty has been delegated to the principal of each indi- 
vidual school or the teacher of each room. Undoubtedly much good 
has been accomplished by this procedure, blindly as it has been car- 
ried out in most instances. The stimulating and constructive effects 
have varied with the vision of the superintendent. Only too fre- 
quently high nervous tension has been the greatest apparent effect 
upon teachers and pupils, other results remaining buried in the 
superintendent’s office. 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
    EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 35 
The development of standard scales, tests, and scores promises to 
place this important school function on a more rational basis, not 
only giving the superintendent the information he needs in much 
more reliable form, but giving motive to the work of both teachers 
and pupils by recognizing accomplishment in a substantial manner 
and by replacing archaic demands for perfection by standards grow- 
ing out of the actual accomplishments of pupils of the same ages, 
grades, and mental abilities. 
City superintendents are making use of standard tests and scores 
in many ways. Often the tests are used first in a school survey; 
curiosity or pride is aroused as to whether progress is made during 
the ensuing year, so the tests are repeated; and satisfaction with the 
comparative results shown by the returns leads to the continued use 
of the tests. Again, the influence of a university may stimulate 
neighboring superintendents to experiment with the tests, university 
professors and graduate students visiting the schools to do the actual 
work of testing. Sometimes the university seeks the schools as a 
laboratory, at other times the superintendent asks the cooperation 
of the trained workers in the university. In systems where large 
initiative is permitted, it is not unusual to find individual super- 
visors, principals, or teachers experimenting along this line, thus 
driving the entering wedge in introducing knowledge of reliable 
standards of achievement. 
There is general recognition of the inadequacy of present scales, 
tests, and standards, the leaders in the development of those now in 
use being among those most in earnest for their improvement. Only 
by use of those now available and experimentation with those in 
process of development can progress come, however, and it is encour- 
aging to see the initiative shown by some cities in this direction. 
Boston is working out a rational basis for judging grade work, 
seniors in the normal school helping by conducting the tests. Nash- 
ville is opening her schools to the professors from the teachers’ 
college located in the city, as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and other leading cities have been 
doing. Newton teachers have collaborated with the department of 
education at Harvard in developing a new scale for measuring com- 
position work in the seventh and eighth grades. 
Detroit has inaugurated a system of measuring and following up 
the achievements of pupils. The appointment of S. A. Courtis to 
take charge of this work is another recognition of the fact that the 
public schools need the services of those most highly trained in par- 
ticular fields. Not only are the standard scales now known used in 
Detroit most intelligently, but the teachers have also cooperated with 
Mr. Courtis in preparing tentative scales in early-grade language
-P-A-G-E-56
  86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
work, and the sensible practice has been inaugurated of excusing from 
drill lessons those pupils who have reached a given standard in form 
work. This latter practice has brought about marked economy of 
time. In a paper read at the Cincinnati meeting, Mr. Courtis says— 
I was astonished to find, in checking up the time cost for one class of 20 pupils, 
that the total time set free in 12 weeks by excusing those. who had reached the 
standard amounted to 1,460 minutes, or 13 per cent of the total time given by the 
class to the drill work. Other classes gave similar results. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.* 
The fitting of vocational education to real community needs, the 
humanizing of vocational programs, and the extension of the part- 
time plan to high-school pupils and pupils of working age in the 
grades are some of the recent developments of this subject. 
The Richmond survey and the surveys made in New York and 
Brooklyn as a preliminary step in the development of Dean Schnei- 
der’s progressive plans, point to the barrenness of certain trade fields, 
to the paucity of training required to fit pupils to enter the positions 
which will be open to them. Definite data as to needs in training 
skilled workers were also secured, however, and the work in those 
cities will be more definitely helpful because of this clearer under- 
standing of trade conditions. The industrial and tenchnical con- 
ference in Philadelphia also emphasized knowledge of trade oppor- 
tunities as coequal in importance with trade education. 
Training in the three R’s for pupils taking vocational courses will 
always find strong motivation in the projects with which the pupils 
are dealing and in the trades for which they are preparing. The 
first recognition of the needs in these special fields led teachers to 
swing entirely to lessons related to the vocational work. Experience 
has proved, however, that these pupils need preparation for leisure 
as well as for labor, and the courses are becoming adapted to meet 
both needs. Where classes are relatively backward in getting thought 
from the printed page, the teacher does not hesitate to present to 
them the literature of power through her own reading. 
The meeting of the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Education Association, held in Cincinnati in February, brought to 
the attention of the visiting association the many ways in which that 
-city is developing in vocational education. The following statements 
are from a bulletin prepared for distribution at that time: 
THE MANUAL-TRAINING COURSE. 
Those boys who elect the manual-training course in the high school devote one 
and one-half hours per day for four years to shop work and mechanical draw- 
ing. * * * The purpose of the course is one of general training, but to those 
  
1¥or further discussion of progress in vocational education see Ch. IX. 
   
-P-A-G-E-57
    
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 87 
who later take up some particular line of manual work it proves vocational. 
The University of Cincinnati recognizes the four years’ work in manual train- 
ing as 4 units of the 16 required for entrance. * * * 
BOYS’ TECHNICAL COOPERATIVE COURSE. 
It is presumed the boys who enroll in the technical cooperative course expect 
to learn some trade. Because of this the whole course is arranged to meet their 
needs without reference to college entrance requirements. Graduates from this 
course are, however, admitted to the cooperative engineering course of the 
University of Cincinnati. The academic work of this course differs from both 
the general and manual training courses, no language other than English being 
studied for the first two years. The shop work differs little from that of the 
manual-training course, except that it is taken in two years instead of four, 
three hours per day being devoted to this branch alone. After two years these 
boys are introduced to a number of skilled trades and are better able intelli- 
gently to select their life work than the boys who have not had this training. 
They are now taken in charge by the coordinator, who finds places for them 
in commercial shops according to the line of work they choose to follow. In 
September they are arranged in pairs and spend alternate weeks in commercial 
shops and school. 
THE DOMESTIC-SCIENCE COURSE. 
The purpose of this course is to provide one form of general training and a 
foundation for higher training in home economics. The University of Cincinnati 
credits this course, giving four units for the four years’ work. 
GIRLS’ TECHNICAL COOPERATIVE COURSE. 
This course was planned for the girl who expects to earn her living on leay- 
ing high school and who wants definite help in finding her field of work. 
Cooking and sewing are given for four years. From this beginning the sewing 
takes on the trade phase. The girl does not sew for herself, but on orders for 
others. The fact that a garment is made for the trade, up to trade standards, 
creates the right attitude toward the work. 
At the beginning of the third year the girl elects to take trade work in either 
dressmaking or millinery and the cooperative program is put into operation. 
The girls spend one week in trade shop or establishment and one week in school. 
Two girls form a team and occupy one position in alternate weeks. 
PREVOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 
In 11 schools of the city special adaptation has been made of the manual 
training and domestic science work in order to meet more completely the 
various needs of the community. The time allowance of these subjects is 
increased in some cases to five hours, or one-fifth of the school week, and in 
all cases is extended beyond the hour or hour and a half regularly devoted 
to the subjects in elementary schools. 
The work is extended also to grades below the sixth, in some cases reaching 
even as-low as the second. The aim is to take care of pupils 12 years of age 
and over. 
The character of the work varies with the school. The general purpose, 
however, is to find the problems for the industrial work in the daily life of 
the school and the home. For girls this takes the form of real home problems 
in sewing, cooking, and the household arts. For boys the industrial work 
uses wood, metal, and other materials for the making of whatever may appeal 
to the boy’s interest and be of use in the school or home.

SALESMANSHIP. 
The school was opened in May, 1911, with an enrollment of 200; each pupil 
attended one-half day a week without loss of pay. A graduate of the Boston 
school of salesmanship was appointed teacher of the class. The course in- 
cluded the study of textiles, salesmanship, color and design as applied to the 
work, business arithmetic, English, civics, hygiene, and economics. 
SALESMANSHIP IN MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENTS. 
As this movement represents something of a departure in public education 
whereby teachers employed by the board of education offer Instruction to the 
employees in private establishments, it may be well to state the basis upon 
which it rests. 
The controlling motive is to be the educational and social improvement of 
the employees themselves, which shall result in improved service for the public. 
Upon ‘these grounds the plan can be justified as a measure of public education, 
even though one of the direct results is an improved service for the employers. 
More satisfactory and valuable service for the employer follows, as a matter 
of course, from increased intelligence and skill on the part of the employees 
and from improved service to the public. 
With this position clearly understood and accepted, we have no hesitation 
in sending teachers into commercial and industrial establishments to perform 
their work under conditions most favorable for teaching the theory that is 
to be wrought out into practice under real commercial and industrial condi- 
tions. 
SALESMANSHIP IN THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
In September, 1914, salesmanship was introduced into Woodward High 
School as an elective in all grades. Ninety students are enrolled. In the 
commercial department it is planned to have a three-year course, beginning 
in the second year and extending through the fourth. Students are to work 
part time in the various department stores. A few high-school students are 
already working part time in the stores. 
MESSENGER SERVICE. : 
In October, 1914, the superintendent of schools authorized the establishing 
of an elementary cooperative course for messengers, whereby boys would be 
permitted to attend school for half time, both the work and the study to be 
under the general direction of school officials cooperating with the officials of 
the messenger service. Only boys over 15 years of age are permitted to enter 
the service, the aim being to give to those boys permitted by law to leave school 
a chance to become wage earners and at the same time to receive extended 
school training. 
Conferences with the superintendents of the messenger companies followed, 
with the result that officials of the Western Union not only promised coopera- 
tion but offered to provide, at the expense of the company, the equipment nec- 
essary for teaching telegraphy and the services of an expert teacher, in order 
that boys electing to take a course in telegraphy might have full opportunity 
to master its technicalities. The boys who have entered the service meet 
alternate weeks for class instruction at the Guilford Continuation School.

EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 39 
VOLUNTARY ATTENDANCE IN HOME ECONOMICS. 
Classes are formed in any school district where 20 or more women make 
application for a definite line of instruction. They meet once a week in a 
two-hour session. The enthusiasm and interest in this work is shown in the 
enrollment, which has reached 2,000. 
Specific training is given in one branch and a general course in home eco- 
nomics, including lectures and discussions on topics relating to household prob- 
Jems. 
The aim in all work is to strengthen the bond between the home and the 
school and to awaken a spirit of community interest and helpfulness. 
VOLUNTARY CONTINUATION SCHOOLS FOR APPRENTICES. 
The continuation school for machine-shop and pattern-maker apprentices was 
organized about seven years ago, after an agreement had been entered into 
by a number of employers and the board of education, whereby apprentices 
were to be sent to school one-half day per week without loss of pay, the board 
of education agreeing to maintain the school, while the employers sent their 
boys and paid their wages. This school is in session throughout the year. The 
principal and his assistant spend Monday morning and Saturday morning 
visiting shops in which the boys are employed. The methods of teaching are 
unique, and most of the instruction is individual. 
Another field in which outside agencies are developing work 
closely related to that of the schools is in the introduction of visiting 
housekeepers. In New York and Cleveland the social workers of the 
United Charities have found fine opportunities for this service, and 
the tenement-house inspectors in our large cities have also been able 
to do much. If the home is considered as the real laboratory con- 
nected with domestic science and domestic art courses, as the shop 
is in connection with trade courses, some visiting relationship may 
become both possible and advisable. 
BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADE PUPILS. 
Boston and Cincinnati are both dealing with the problem of closer 
adjustment between the kindergarten and primary grades. The 
object is not so much to save time for the pupils as to so integrate 
the work that the pupils will learn certain habits in the kindergarten 
which will be of value in primary work and will use in the primary 
grades more of the knowledge and skill attained in the kindergarten.* 
Summer schools for elementary pupils continue to grow in favor. 
Newark, N. J., registered 10,000, and Jersey City over 8,000 during 
the last summer. Nashville gave credit this fall to those pupils who 
attended the demonstration school conducted at George Peabody 
College for Teachers last summer. Cincinnati, Ohio, and Decatur, 
Til, are among the cities which are attempting this work on a small 
scale.

ATYPICAL CHILDREN, 
The public is becoming interested in the supernormal child; the 
press is eager for information regarding this type of child; and the 
school is rapidly becoming aware that it has neglected this problem. 
Rapid advancement classes are held for these children in certain 
cities, in others extra work is given them in regular classes. But 
as yet few cities have had the courage to attempt to develop a pro- 
gram exactly fitted to their needs, nor have the psychological clinics 
said much regarding tests to discover the supernormal. 
_ Wherever psychological laboratories have been established in con- 
nection with the public schools they have found it impossible to keep 
pace with the surprisingly large demand for examination of sub- 
normal cases. These naturally attract most attention because an un- 
due proportion of the teacher’s time is consumed in the vain effort 
to have them master the traditional course of study, a course which is 
little suited to their needs. Ways and means are being sought 
to relieve the regular classrooms of these misfits. It is not an easy 
problem nor one to be solved without increased expenditures; for it 
means small classes, varied equipment, and materials which cost more 
per capita than books. All this benefits the supernormal child at 
least indirectly for it enables him to secure more attention in pro- 
portion as the regular teacher is released from the impossible task 
of keeping subnormal children up to grade. After the more 
obvious task of dealing with the subnormal has been accomplished 
the still more valuable service to the State of devising a suitable 
program for the supernormal will doubtless receive increased atten- 
tion. 
Among the plans for subnormal pupils the system of centers, 
begun in Boston in 1912, has been well developed in Newark, N. J. 
There are a few individual classes for defectives in out-lying schools, 
but most pupils of this type are cared for in a series of schools used 
by them alone. Classification is by mental age; each building has 
shops, gymnasium, and playground all sensibly equipped; work in 
the usual school subjects is limited to those who can profit by it. One 
of these schools has a large kitchen with both kitchen and laundry 
appliances. Each class, except the youngest, spends one period a 
day in scrubbing, laundering, cooking, or dishwashing. Careful 
training is given in these home activities. Each child is at liberty to 
bring his lunch from home or to buy the lunch prepared in the 
kitchen. He is given hot soup if he brings a cold lunch. White 
tablecloths and napkins are used, and the lunch tables are carefully 
set and served. The children are very happy in the work. Parents 
report that they are more contented at home because they can take 
part in the home activities. There is a trade aspect also to the work,
-P-A-G-E-61
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 41 
for these pupils may become unskilled laborers in small laundries, 
bakeries, and restaurants. 
St. Louis has opened a psychological clinic at. the College for 
Teachers under the direction of Dr. J. E. W. Wallin. Detroit has 
employed an educational clinicist on part time. It is now possible to 
engage a trained clinicist for brief periods, so that the best service is 
at the call of the smallest city. 
HEALTH OF SCHOOL CHILDREN.* 
More and more is the health of school children considered as part 
of the business of the school. In no other department does the school 
administrator find it so easily possible to affiliate with the professions 
on one hand and the general public on the other. The public is 
accustomed to the school physician and is rapidly becoming used. 
to the school dentist. The school nurse has become established as a 
necessary part of the administrative system. Both the practical and 
the theoretical sides of this subject have received marked attention 
during the past year. 
The school lunch problem came acutely to the front in New York 
because of the unusual suffering caused by unemployment, and the 
school lunch service was extended to meet these conditions. Other 
cities felt the same pressure and responded accordingly; but there 
seems to be-growth also because of a realization that when the school’s 
requirements make it difficult for pupils to reach home easily for a 
warm lunch, it is the business of the school to face the lunch problem. 
The cold lunch eaten in a corner is not conducive either to health or 
to good social relations. This is a business proposition. Our busi- 
ness houses and factories are finding it to their interests to furnish 
luncheon opportunities to their employees, and New York has 
recently opened a lunchroom managed by civic authorities for the 
accommodation of civic employees. 
In many cities attention is still centered on the problem of equip- 
ment and administration. Those cities which have settled the admin- 
istrative problems of the school lunch are busy with the scientific and 
educational phases. Philadelphia’s studies of cost and value in calo- 
ries have been followed by attempts to work out a balanced ration. 
One New York school requires 1 cent to be spent for a proteid, 1 
cent for bread; the rest of the lunch is a matter of choice. Other 
schools suggest several menus, each being a balanced ration. Cost, 
balance, and calorie value are the three factors in which the public 
needs education. 
The experiments on ventilation carried on by the New York State 
commission on ventilation are being watched with interest by school 
men. The College of the City of New York furnished rooms so 
  
1See also Ch. XVII.
-P-A-G-E-62
  42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
equipped that heat, motion, humidity, and freshness could each be 
separately controlled. College students volunteered to do mental 
work under varying conditions of ventilation, a small sum being paid 
them for their services. Results showed vaso-motor efficiency as 
studied by the Crampton method to be 50 per cent greater at 68° 
than at 86°. There was no change in mental efficiency with high 
temperature, nor with stagnant versus fresh air, though the stagnant 
air diminished the appetite. The presence of carbon-dioxide in much 
larger amounts than has been thought safe, had no deleterious ef- 
fects. These experiments will be continued. Conditions in certain 
New York schoolrooms will be changed in accordance with the 
knowledge thus gained, and we shall eventually have a scientific 
basis for our ventilating systems. 
New York’s board of health is experimenting with sunning and 
scrubbing as a substitute for fumigating both in homes and in pub- 
lic buildings, basing this practice upon the experimental work in 
destruction of germs carried on in Rhode Island. Comparison of 
results in the checking of contagious diseases in the districts in which 
the new methods are used with those where fumigation is continued, 
will be of interest to all school men. 
The aggressive work of State and city dental associations is 
bearing much fruit. Preservation of the first teeth is receiving more 
attention. Dr. Osler states that the loss to the Nation from the 
neglect of children’s teeth is as great as the loss from alcohol. No 
city as yet reports as comprehensive a program as that of Bridgeport, 
Conn., though a recent court decision in Ohio that the cleaning of 
teeth is a hygienic not a professional operation makes such a pro- 
gram feasible in that State. Meantime motion pictures, popular lec- 
tures, and the distribution of literature are awakening the parents. 
An “oral hygiene week” is used to focus attention upon this im- 
portant matter. Dental clinics are opening in many cities. 
Though the following statement of what the American school 
should be is far from realization in any city, nevertheless it sets 
up a fitting twentieth-century goal toward which the best schools are 
tending. It is from the Pittsburgh souvenir of the Pennsylvania 
State educational association: 
SCHOOLS WITH A PERFECT SCORE. 
A PITTSBURGH IDEAL. 
The schools of the people should give to the children: 
Ample provision for exercise and joyous play. 
Buildings simple, but stately; thoughtfully planned, skillfully built, gener- 
ously equipped. 
A course of study offering training for service and appreciation; presenting 
in the order of their importance those things which contribute to a strong, 
healthy body, an alert, sure mind, a fine, steadfast spirit.
-P-A-G-E-63
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER. CITIES. 43 
Those things in art or craft which develop to the full the latent ability of 
each one to serve his fellows with dexterous hand, a lofty mind, and a glad 
heart, rich in response to the beautiful and noble in life. 
Teachers who love children with a parent’s love and books with a scholar’s 
fondness; who find beauty and joy in service; are large of vision, learners 
always. 
A training which leads from learning and doing on to wisdom, to high ideals, 
to service as a sacred trust, to worthy citizenship, to character. 
And, having given these things to the children, the schools of the people 
should also give to all citizens an exalted, neighborly life more abundant, 
making the big red schoolhouse a radiating center for the final good of all 
Americans and then for the world. 
INCREASED COOPERATION OF CIVIC AUTHORITIES AND INSTITUTIONS. 
No better means has been discovered for training children in citi- 
zenship than the bringing about of situations in which children feel 
themselves to be integral parts of civic life. The sporadic campaign 
undertaken for improving civic conditions is increasingly likely to 
include the school children as workers with other civic forces. 
Clean-up day and fire-preyention day enlist the support of the 
schools. Fly campaigns are waged unceasingly. The Brooklyn 
Rapid Transit Co. is cooperating with the schools in a “ safety first ” 
campaign, hoping to train pupils to be more careful in crossing 
streets and in alighting from street cars. 
Police women have been appointed in 25 cities; among these Chi- 
cago has 20, Los Angeles 5, Baltimore 5, Seattle 5, Pittsburgh 4, 
San Francisco and St. Paul 3 each, Minneapolis, Topeka, and 
Kansas City 2 each. While not primarily connected with the schools, 
they supplement the work of attendance officers in many ways, being 
especially helpful in looking after older girls. 
The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of 
Natural History are both extending their work in connection with 
the public schools of New York City. Teachers are instructed how 
to explain exhibits to their classes; lectures are given in certain 
schools; slides are loaned; and the natural history museum is open- 
ing a branch exhibition museum in Washington Irving High School. 
In Providence, R. I., the Park Museum has arranged for some mem- 
ber of its staff to speak at each of the 17 grammar school three times 
a year. This cooperation of museum authorities promises the same 
type of valuable help which our libraries have been giving so gen- 
erously for many years. The libraries are continuing to inaugurate 
new methods of helpfulness.* 
Emphasis upon training in thrift is bringing the banks of many 
cities into close touch with the schools. In most cities the teachers 
conduct the necessary business; in otHers a social worker or a bank 
official visits the school. In Little Rock, Ark., six banks have united 
  
1See also Ch. XXII.
-P-A-G-E-64
44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to pay the salary of a manager for the school savings association, 
each child choosing the bank in which he will make a deposit. The 
growing practice of employing women in banks may be another step 
in helping children to realize that a bank is less official than it looks. 
This is a field in which the cooperation of outside agencies should 
be encouraged. That the teaching of thrift is of great importance 
no one will deny. It does not follow, however, that the actual book- 
keeping that is necessary in taking account of children’s savings 
should be assumed by the teachers in our public schools. It is suffi- 
cient for them to provide opportunities for the children to resort to 
the desk of the bank representative or philanthropic worker in the 
school office or hallway and by word and example encourage children 
to form the habit of saving. The detailed work involved in ac- 
counting penny savings is an unprofitable use of the energy and time 
of a teacher or school principal. It is easy to secure outside interest 
and cooperation in this enterprise, for it appeals strongly to organi- 
zations that are in an excellent position to assume charge of the 
details. 
SCHOOLS AS SOCIAL CENTERS. 
The passage of legislation enabling Washington, D. C., to use its 
school buildings as social centers promises valuable opportunities to 
the residents of the Nation’s capital city. There will be no lack of 
inspiring leaders in such a city. St. Louis has won a three-year 
fight for legislation to allow her to open her schools for social centers. 
Plans for individual neighborhoods will be developed largely by 
each, but a supervisor will probably be appointed to help with the 
organization. Boston expends about $30,000 annually in social- 
center work. 
In the auditorium of its new High School of Commerce, Spring- 
field, Mass., is providing motion-picture entertainments each Friday 
afternoon and evening. Three audiences of 1,000 to 1,600 persons 
have been accommodated at each performance thus far. At 2.30 
p. m., a high-school audience is admitted; at 4 p. m., a grammar- 
school audience, and at 8 p. m., an adult audience, the last at a nomi- 
nal charge of 5 cents for each person to pay operating expenses. 
Among the films in the year’s program are several based on literature 
used in the grades and high school. 
The rental of the films is a-charge upon the budget of the school. 
One of the science teachers has qualified as an operator and the prin- 
cipal of the school has general charge. The 5 cents admission fee 
collected at the evening performance for adults pays for this service 
and all incidental expenses. The motion-picture machine is the 
property of the school. ;

EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 45 
ORGANIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF URBAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The development of State universities has been recognized as a fine 
- forward sweep of democratic education, but the municipal university 
is now making a strong appeal for support on the ground that it is 
still more democratic. It offers higher education to the youth of the 
city, who can live at home more economically than away. By co- 
operation with city departments it offers these the services of expert 
professors and earnest students; while the testing of theories in the 
light of actual conditions forces the theorist to improve his theories, 
and research is stimulated. It is still further claimed that by initiat- 
ing the future citizen into the mysteries of the conduct of civic af- 
fairs by actual constructive work, it may inaugurate the higher 
municipal consciousness so greatly needed. 
The organization of the Association of Urban Universities at 
Washington last winter emphasizes the growing importance of this 
problem. State legislation has been analyzed so that any city can 
easily find what statutory changes need to be made in order to permit 
taxation for a municipal university. Ohio still leads in numbers, 
universities at Toledo and Akron having been opened in addition to 
that at Cincinnati, the pioneer as a real municipal university. The 
way is being paved for such a university in Detroit, a city eminently 
fitted to support such an institution. 
RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF TEACHERS, 
Among the encouraging phases of educational growth is the in- 
creasing tendency among grade teachers to seek a larger responsi- 
bility professionally, to become a more intelligent part of the ad- 
ministrative school unit. The progressive superintendent welcomes 
this added cooperation, endeavoring to make it directly serviceable 
to the school system. The selection of textbooks, the organization of 
courses of study, the development of new lines of work, and the 
arousing of public sentiment in favor of increased taxation for school 
purposes, are matters in which teachers have rendered inestimable 
service to many communities. By careful study of salaries and liv- 
ing condition, certain groups have brought about more equable ad- 
justment of salaries. Other groups are making studies of the health 
of teachers which promise to be exceedingly valuable. 
Illinois has a plan of affiliation between the State and sectional 
teachers’ organizations whereby teachers can work together for 
needed legislation. The extension of woman’s suffrage has brought 
added power to teachers in many States. 
It can not arouse surprise that so new a force, working within an 
institution somewhat conservative in many of its procedures, causes 
questions to be asked as to the rights and wrongs of customary lines  
-P-A-G-E-66
  46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of action. Nor is it strange that different cities see these questions 
from varying angles. 
New York has been greatly agitated during the past year by the 
question of the teacher-mother. The decision of Commissioner Fin-” 
ley that the attitude of the board of education was opposed to public 
policy operated to change the board’s rules and to reinstate a number 
of teacher-mothers. The commissioner, however, ruled against the 
reinstatement of two teachers, one of whom had considered herself 
justified in practicing deception, while the other had printed an un- 
dignified criticism of the board in the public press. 
Chicago has recently ruled against teachers becoming federated 
with labor unions, a subject which has been a bone of contention in 
Cleveland also. 
Final adjudication of these relationships as they come to the front 
will rest in our courts and in those charged with authority; no ques- 
tion being settled, if we maintain our traditions, until it has been 
determined on the basis of what is for the best welfare of the children 
in the schools.

CHAPTER ITI. 
EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 
By W. S. DerrensaueH, 
Chief of Division of School Administration, Bureau of Education. 
ConreNnTs.—The school board—The schools and the municipality—Business manage- 
ment—The full-time secretary—School reports—The superintendent—Teachers— 
Course of study and organization—Growth of high schools—Kindergartens—Cooper- 
ating with the community—School credit for home work—Home and school gardens— 
Cooperative courses—Wider use of the school plant—Retardation—School savings 
banks—Miscellaneous items. 
During the past year or two the most important steps taken by 
many schools in the smaller cities have been the reorganization of 
the course of study, especially in the seventh and eighth grades, the 
introduction of some form of industrial work and domestic science, 
and a better cooperation between the school and the community. 
The greatest growth has undoubtedly been in the high schools—in 
enrollment, in improved courses, and in better buildings and equip- 
ment. 
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 
Few changes have been made during the past year by general 
legislative enactment or by special charter provision in the manner 
of electing school board members, in the length of term, in the num- 
ber of members, or in the relation of the school board to the city 
council. 
Recent charter changes at Waycross, Ga., provide that the mayor 
of the city shall become a member of the board of education and a 
member of the finance committee. The declared object of the change 
is to bring about a closer relation between the city council and the 
school board. At Americus, Ga., the charter has been amended with 
the provision that the members of the board be elected by the city 
council as formerly, but that they be nominated by the board of 
education, the idea being that the board of education knows best 
what members take an interest in the schools. The school board at 
Henderson, N. C., which has formerly been self-perpetuating, is now 
elected by popular vote. The schools at Nyack, N. Y., by special act 
of the legislature, shift from a special charter administration to the 
AT 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  48 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
general education law. The schools at Jacksonville, Tl., also change 
from special charter to the general law. 
THE SCHOOLS AND THE MUNICIPALITY. 
One of the most radical changes in the management of a school 
system in a small city has been at Asheville, N. C. An act amending 
the charter of that city provides that the schools be placed directly 
in charge of the board of commissioners, which is composed of three 
members—the commissioner of public works, commissioner of pub- 
lic safety, and the mayor, who is the commissioner of public accounts 
and finances. 
Since this movement of placing the schools under the direct con- 
trol of the city commission is so recent, the new charter provisions 
relating to the schools of Asheville are given herewith in full: 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The board of commissioners shall be charged with the duty of maintaining 
an adequate and sufficient system of public schools in the city of Asheville, 
and shall construct and maintain proper buildings, and to that end the public- 
school buildings and all other property now used or which may be hereafter 
acquired within the city of Asheville for school purposes shall be under their 
control and subject to the disposition of the said board of commissioners; and 
the said board shall have the power and authority to condemn lands and to do 
and perform any and all other acts, to acquire and control school property, 
as is given or may be conferred by law upon said board with reference to 
acquiring lands for streets or any other public purposes, and may control 
school property and grounds in like manner as they are empowered to control 
streets; and the said board of commissioners shall also have such power with 
regard to the public schools of Asheville as is now conferred by law upon 
the board of county commissioners of Buncombe County and the board of 
education of Buncombe County with regard to the public schools of the county; 
and the said board of commissioners of Asheville shall have charge of the 
collection of taxes to maintain the schools and construct school buildings and 
the handling and disbursement of all moneys used for school purposes; and 
it shall be the duty of said board of commissioners of the city of Asheville to 
appropriate from the funds of the city, in addition to the special school funds, 
such amounts as may be necessary to discharge their duties of maintaining an 
adequate and sufficient system of public schools. 
The board of commissioners are charged with the duty of electing biennially 
a competent, skilled, and expert man as superintendent of the public schools 
of the city of Asheville, and also such other teachers and employees for the 
conduct of such schools as may be necessary for such time as they may indi- 
cate: Provided, All teachers and other employees in said schools shall be 
selected from a list submitted to the board by the superintendent; and if the 
board is unable or refuses to select from the list so furnished it shall call on 
the superintendent from time to time for other lists, which it shall be his duty 
to furnish. 
It shall be the duty of the superintendent in making his recommendations 
and the board in electing persons to serve the public schools’ interests to con- 
sider ability, education, character, and efficiency for the performance of the  
-P-A-G-E-69
EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 49 
duties for which such person or persons’ names are being considered and 
allow these qualities to control in making such selection. 
Only persons who are bona file residents of the city shall be entitled as pupils 
to the benefits of the public schools thereof: Provided, however, if there be fa- 
cilities after providing for the education of all residents, nonresidents of the — 
city. may be admitted by the board of commissioners to the public schools of 
Asheville upon the payment of such charges as the board may determine, by 
order spread upon its minutes, is just. 
It shall be the duty of the superintendent of schools of Asheville to devote 
his time and attention exclusively to them during the school year, except when 
leave of absence is granted by the board of commissioners for short periods for 
good cause. He shall have immediate and direct control over all teachers and 
janitors of the school buildings, and other persons in charge thereof, and shall 
be responsible for their efficiency, and he shall have power to discharge any 
teacher or other employee connected with the schools, for any cause satisfactory 
to himself, and to maintain discipline and order, and establish rules and regula- 
tions for the government of the schools, and from his rulings, with respect to 
these matters, there shall be right of appeal to the board of commissioners. 
He shall report to board of commissioners, within 24 hours after any employee 
is discharged, the fact of such discharge; and if the superintendent is requested 
by any member of the board of commissioners to state his reasons for discharg- 
ing any employee, he shall, within 48 hours after such request is made, make 
to the board of commissioners, in writing, a full report of his action, and of 
all reasons influencing him to discharge such employee. 
The superintendent of public schools of Asheville shall be subject to be 
removed from his office by the board of commissioners for inefficiency, or other 
cause satisfactory to the said board, and from that action by the board there 
shall be no appeal or review. 
The argument generally advanced in favor of placing the schools 
under the city commission is that all the affairs of a city should be 
managed as a business corporation by one board; that under this 
plan the departments of the city work together harmoniously; that 
where the schools are under the board of commissioners the health 
department, the police department, and the finance department will 
cooperate more heartily and promptly with the schools than they do 
in cities where the schools are considered a distinct department, sepa- 
rate and apart from the city government. How this theory works 
out in practice will be awaited with equal interest by those who claim 
that the schools should not have a separate management apart from 
municipal affairs, and by those who claim that the school department 
is large enough and important enough to have a management of its 
own by a board independent of the city commissioners or the city 
council. 
Though there has been but little legislation within the last year 
or two regarding city schools, the opinion has been expressed on 
several occasions that there “is still much for State legislatures to 
do before all the cities of the country have good schools.” An in- 
stance is cited in the American School for March, 1915, of a council

in a small city killing a needed bond issue for school purposes and 
a few evenings later floating a bond issue to purchase some equipment 
for the city. The editor, commenting upon the action of the city 
council, says: 
The board of education, not the city council, knows whether more school- 
houses and grounds are required; it is the board of education which should 
have the right to say when the people shall be asked to vote on bond issues 
or purchases for school purposes. All over the country where city councils 
have the power to revise school budgets or to grant or withhold school-build- 
ing appropriations or to decide whether school-bond issues shall be submitted 
to the people they are buying apparatus and doing paving and raising the 
wages of city officials with money that belongs to the children. © 
In the State of New York an attempt was made at the last session 
of the legislature to secure what was considered needed school legis- 
lation. There was offered for the first time in the history of the 
State a bill to reorganize the school system of all the State. Under 
the plan proposed all provisions of law relating to the schools of 
cities now carried on the charters of cities were repealed. It was 
the intention of the framers of the bill to bring together all the 
statutes relating to the schools of cities into one general act and to 
remove school provisions from the charters, so that the continual 
modification of the charters of cities by the legislature would not 
involve the schools. There was much opposition to this from the 
municipal officers, but it is reported that considerable progress was 
made. Although the bill was defeated, a similar bill will be intro- 
duced in the next legislature. 
. Dr. Thomas E. Finegan, assistant commissioner of slucation of the 
State of New York, writing in regard to the lack of a general plan of 
organization in the management of city schools and of the various 
special acts of the legislature, says:* ‘ 
The school systems of the cities of this State have never been organized 
upon a general plan having special reference to policies which the students of 
school administration are generally agreed will produce the best educational 
results. In fact, the school systems in the Cities of this State have not been 
organized upon a general plan of any character. The schools in the cities have 
very generally been organized in accordance with the ideas of the municipal 
officers of each city. The cases are rare in which the men charged with the 
responsibility of the management of the school systems of a city have been 
consulted as to the basis of the legal structure of such system. This procedure 
in such matters has resulted in a general policy of associating the laws govern- 
ing a city school system with the statutes regulating the municipal functions 
instead of associating such laws with the general statutes on public education. 
In 85 cities of the State the laws regulating the local management of the 
schools are incorporated in the charters of such cities. In 12 other cities the 
laws governing the local direction of the schools have been enacted as special 
statutes. The antiquated provisions enacted into the consolidated school act, 
now the education law, over a quarter of a century ago, together with cer-

tain special laws, regulate the local control of the schoo]s in the five other 
cities of the State. * * * § 
These laws in many cities give to the municipal authorities greater power in 
the management of the schools than is given to the legally designated school 
officers. In such cases the schools are regarded by the municipal authorities as 
mere municipal bureaus and looked upon as furnishing the same legitimate 
patronage to sustain the political end of the city government as the street de- 
partment, the fire department, the police department, and other purely city de- 
partments. The cities whose schools are managed by their regularly chosen 
school officers with freedom and independence have the best and most flourishing 
schools. The cities whose schools are submerged into the municipal government 
and whose school policies are dominated from the city hall have the poorest . 
schools. The propositions to revise city charters, which are constantly pre- 
sented to the legislature, create a feeling of unrest and uncertainty in educa- 
tional matters which is detrimental to the schools in those cities in which the 
laws regulating the schools are a part of the city charters. The schools in 
about one-half of the cities of the State have suffered from this action within 
the last three years. The special laws which control the schools in other cities 
are in many instances inadequate to the proper management of a modern city 
school system. It should be unnecessary for a city of the second class to come to 
the legislature to obtain authority to erect a technical high school, or for a city 
of the third class to be compelled to obtain permission from the legislature to 
permit its citizens to vote upon a proposition to appropriate $24,000 for the 
erection of an elementary school system, as has recently been the case. These 
are questions which each city should have the power to determine. The laws 
governing their schools should confer that power. 
BUSINESS MANAGEMENT. 
As an example of what boards in the smaller cities are beginning 
to do to manage the business affairs of the schools efficiently, the fol- 
lowing account of a plan inaugurated by the school board of Alpena, 
Mich., in September, 1914, is given: 
During the summer before installing the new system the superintendent took 
a complete inventory of every dollar’s worth of property owned by the schools. 
The assets were inventoried as follows: Real estate, buildings, furniture, equip- 
ment, fuel, supplies, unexpired insurance. Inventory sheets covering every- 
thing of value in each building are kept on file in the superintendent’s office, 
duplicates of the same being in the hands of the principals of the several 
buildings. New furniture and equipment added during the year increase the 
fixed investment and are noted on the inventory sheets. A general ledger 
account is kept for each of the accounts noted above. 
All purchases are now made from the superintendent’s office, purchase orders 
of which duplicates are kept, being issued for each purchase made. The 
duplicates are checked when the goods are received and are then transferred 
to a binder designed for filled purchase orders. Bills for the same presented 
pefore the 5th of the month are approved by the finance committee of the 
board of education, ordered paid by the board of education at its regular 
meeting, and paid by voucher check drawn on the treasurer, signed by the 
president and secretary of the board, and issued from the superintendent’s 
office. This obviates the necessity of receipts for the payment of bills. Teach- 
ers’ salaries are paid at the bank from a monthly pay roll, one warrant 
covering all.  
-P-A-G-E-72
  52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Supply requisitions are sent to the office twice each month by ward princi- 
pals for school and janitors’ supplies. Thesé are filled, priced, and charged to 
the school at the end of the month, the stock rooms being credited with the 
amount taken from them. 
The cash book keeps an account of all school receipts, such as primary funds, 
interest, tax appropriations, nonresident tuition fees, etc. It also records all 
warrants issued and the distribution of the same to the various departments. 
It is self-balancing. The expense ledger is a record for the month and year 
to date of the expense in salaries, supplies, fuel, insurance, repairs, etc., by 
schools and departments. The ledger and journal are simply double-entry 
records of the daily transactions. The monthly statement, including a balance 
sheet, is a recapitulation of the month’s business, a statement of the average 
attendance by schools and departments, and a comparison of the total expense 
and per capita cost of education by school and department for the present and 
corresponding month of the preceding year, and for the present and preceding 
years to date. It is always accessible to the patrons of the schools and is 
easily understood by the uninitiated. 
THE FULL-TIME SECRETARY. 
Some boards in cities of more than 10,000 population have found 
it profitable to employ a secretary to give all his time to clerical 
work. The duties of such an officer consist not merely in recording 
transactions, but in acting as business agent under the direction of 
the superintendent. Where this plan is in operation it is possible to 
hold one person, instead of a half dozen committees, responsible for 
carrying out the orders of the board relating to business matters. 
In some cities the superintendent’s clerk is profitably made the 
secretary of the board. 
One superintendent in a city of about 12,000 population, who has 
recently had his clerk made secretary of the school board, says: 
The superintendent becomes the executive head of the school system in the 
full sense of the word both in respect to professional and business matters. In 
fact he really becomes a sort of general manager with a threefold function— 
supervisor of instruction, inspector, and business manager. Under proper con- 
ditions this in no wise interferes with the prerogatives of the school board, but 
it does eliminate the assumed prerogatives of individual members of the board. 
The superintendent must get his authority from the board as a whole or from 
committees to whom definite duties are assigned. 
Instead of our secretary being a school-board member, whose private duties 
make it necessary for him to consider his secretaryship a side issue, we employ 
a man who gives all of his attention to our business, As a consequence the 
business phase of the administration of the schools is “up to the minute,” and 
professional matters are not sidetracked on account_of the slowness of the 
business department. 
SCHOOL REPORTS. 
Superintendents are beginning to make careful investigations of 
school conditions and to report the facts with interpretations to the 
school boards and to the public. Some of the reports now contain 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 53 
fiscal statistics properly classified, with per capita costs worked out 
for each item of expenditure for elementary and high schools, and in 
a few instances per capita cost for each building. Several reports 
contain tables showing the per capita cost of each subject taught in 
the high school. In one report at least the cost of fuel is reduced 
to a unit basis of 1,000 cubic feet. Most reports for 1914 contain 
tables showing enrollment by ages and grades. Some few introduce 
tables showing to what extent retardation has been reduced. Other 
statistical tables showing present conditions as compared with con- 
ditions a few years ago are included in a few reports. 
Though only a few reports contain tables showing progress from 
year to year or from period to period, there is every indication of a 
tendency to make a greater use of comparative statistics. 
Several of the reports practically amount to school surveys made 
by superintendents and their assistants. It is realized that a super- 
intendent should continually “survey” his schools and embody the 
significant facts in his annual reports. Dansville, N. Y., affords an 
excellent example of this.1 Another investigation of note was that 
made under the direction of the superintendent of schools at Man- 
kato, Minn. In September, 1914, the superintendent appointed a com- 
mittee consisting of the high-school principal, the principal of five 
grade schools, and five teachers for the purpose of making a study 
of the matter of vocational guidance in relation to the schools of 
Mankato. 
The committee adopted the following aims and program for its 
work: 
AIMS. 
1. To find out whether or not Mankato has a problem of children leaving 
school without guidance and without proper training to insure their earning 
an income sufficient for an efficient standard of living. 
2. To gather statistics which would enable us to compare from local condi- 
tions the advantages toward occupational life of a high-school course with 
leaving school before entering the high school. 
8. To find out why children do leave school before entering the high school. 
4. To find out what occupational opportunities exist in Mankato and what 
employers demand in regard to the training of the pupils. 
5. To find out if the school is meeting this demand. 
6. To gather a fund of information along vocational lines that will be useful 
in the work of vocational counseling. 
PROGRAM OF WORK. 
1. A survey of the causes for children leaving school after having reached 
the age of 16 or finishing the eighth grade and before entering the high school. 
2. The causes for pupils in the high school leaving school before finishing 
their course.

THE SUPERINTENDENT. 
Schoo]. boards in the smaller cities are gradually granting superin- 
tendents more power in the selection and promotion of teachers, and 
in the selection of textbooks. Some of the rules recently adopted by 
school boards define rather definitely the powers and duties of the 
superintendent and indicate the general tendency to enlarge his 
duties and make him responsible for the efficient management of the 
system of schools under his charge. It is now recognized by many 
school boards that the superintendent must be the head of the system 
and that any meddling on the part of the board or of individual 
members of the board in matters that belong to a paid expert is to be 
condemned.t 
Salaries of superintendents in the smaller cities are steadily ad- 
vancing. It is now possible for a superintendent in a city of from 
10,000 to 25,000 population to have an income of about $2,400 a year. 
In some of the more progressive of the smaller cities the salary of the 
superintendent is now $3,000 or $4,000 a year. During the past year 
the salaries of a number of superintendents were increased $500 a 
year, and in someecities the increase was as much as $700 or $800 a 
year. 
School boards are beginning to realize that if a school system is to 
make progress steadily there must not be a change of superintendents 
every year or two, and that it is usually better to advance the salary 
of the superintendent who is producing good results than it is to take 
chances on securing another superintendent who may prove equally 
efficient. It may also be noted that there is at the present time less 
use made of superintendency positions as stepping stones to other 
professions. A few years ago it was not unusual to find a superin- 
tendent in the smaller cities preparing for another line of work. 
Superintendents in these cities are beginning to discuss their own 
problems rather than the problems of the larger cities. One of the

largest round-tables at the Department of Superintendence of the 
National Educational Association is that for superintendents of 
schools in cities of less than 25,000 population. A program was first 
arranged for such superintendents for the department meeting in 
1914. In 1915 President Henry Snyder formulated a program of 
unusual interest. This round-table proved so popular and helpful 
that it was unanimously voted by those in attendance to ask the presi- 
dent of the department to arrange, if possible without interfering 
with the general program, two sessions at the department meeting in 
1916. 
Some of the State educational associations have provided round- 
table programs for city superintendents, but several of the associa- 
tions existing in States where there are a number of city superin- 
tendents fail to provide such programs. If special programs for 
rural school supervisors prove beneficial to these officials, programs 
relating especially to city school problems would, no doubt, prove 
helpful to city superintendents. 
In a few of the States city superintendents held special con- 
ferences for the study of their problems. In New Jersey, for ex- 
ample, there were held during the year 1914-15 three such confer- 
ences of two days each for superintendents in the smaller cities. 
Among the topics discussed were: Methods of helping inexperienced 
teachers, profitable district and grade meetings, efficiency of super- 
vision as measured by results, and efficiency of supervision as meas- 
ured by instruction. In addition to these conferences the State 
superintendent of public instruction arranged for a special con- 
ference week of superintendents and principals during the summer. 
TEACHERS. 
Reports continue to indicate that school boards in the smaller 
cities are gradually raising the standard for beginning teachers. 
Many boards will not now employ high-school graduates unless they 
have had two years of professional preparation in addition to a 
four-year high-school course. 
Salary schedules are also being changed or modified, so that teach- 
ers who attend summer training schools or in some way make further 
preparation are rewarded with an increase of salary. Salary sched- 
ules that promote teachers upon experience alone are still common, 
but the tendency is to promote teachers largely upon merit and addi- 
tional preparation. The following rules regarding the promotion 
of teachers are typical of many received at this bureau:* 
  
1Qther interesting promotion plans for smaller cities are those of Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Newton, Kans., and Waynesburg, Pa.

EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES, Ole 
ALPENA, MICH. 
For grade teachers the minimum salary of a normal or college graduate 
without experience will be $500; with experience the salary will be $550. For 
all others the salary will be $450 without experience and $475 with experience. 
Annual increases of $25 will be given until the maximum of $600 is reached. 
Teachers who attain the maximum salary may, after a four-year period, 
receive $650 provided they have fulfilled all the conditions; after a second four- 
year period such teachers may receive $700. 
Regular teachers in the grades who have taught 10 years or more will receive 
the maximum salary beginning with 1915-16. 
Teachers who have taught 10 years or more in graded schools may receive 
the maximum salary beginning 1915-16, with the privilege of having the first 
four-year period shortened to a two-year period. Teachers who have taught 
five years or more and who have complied with the conditions (a) or (ec), 
namely, attend one of the State normal schools or some reputable college or 
university for two summer sessions, or spend two months in extensive travel 
and make such reports as may be required by the superintendent of schools, 
may receive the maximum salary. 
All other teachers in the grades shall be paid salaries for the year 1915-16 
as follows: Those receiving $440 will receive $475; those whose salary is $470 
will receive $500; those who receive $540 will be paid $575; those whose 
salary is now $570 will receive $600. 
Six plans are provided under which the teachers may be promoted and 
receive increases. They are: Plan I—a, d, f, g; Plan Il—a, e, f, g; Plan 
IlI—d, d, f, g; Plan IV—2, e, f, g; Plan V—ec, d, f, g; Plan VI—, .e, f, g. 
The conditions which the teacher must observe are as follows: 
(a) Attend one of the State normal schools or some reputable college or 
university for two summer sessions. 
(b) Carry on systematic study of some definite line of work assigned by the 
committee on examinations, and pass satisfactory examinations in this work. 
This work is to be equivalent to that of the two summer terms at one of the 
State normal schools. 
(c) Spend two months in extensive travel and make such reports as may be 
required by the superintendent of schools. 
(d) Attend the State teachers’ association two years, and make reports as 
may be required by the superintendent of schools. 
(e) Spend four days (not more than two in any one system, and not more 
than two during any one school year) visiting schools in other systems as des- 
ignated by the superintendent and make such reports as he may require. 
(f) Subscribe for two educational publications, one of which shall be devoted 
to some other grade or subject than the one taught by the teacher, and make 
such reports as may be required by the superintendent. . 
(g) Attend teachers’ meetings regularly, and prepare the work thoroughly. 
A teacher desiring to apply for an increase beyond the maximum shall notify 
the superintendent in writing at the beginning of the year of the intention to 
take advantage of one of these plans, and state which plan has been selected. 
The committee on examination will determine when a teacher has complied 
with any of the above conditions. 
In many of the smaller cities teachers’ salaries are so low that it 
is impossible to obtain normal or college graduates, or if they are 
obtained and prove successful they remain for only a year or two. 
In many of the high schools in the small towns and cities near

larger cities that offer more salary the teaching corps changes en- 
tirely within a few years. In one city of 12,000 population, located 
within 40 miles of a large city, 12 of the 15 high-school teachers 
have found better positions in the large city or in its suburbs within 
the past three years. Practically all the small cities within a radius 
of 40 or 50 miles of this large city are continually losing their best 
teachers to the large city because it can offer better salaries. The 
following table showing salaries paid teachers in different groups of 
cities explains, in part at least, why teachers are constantly migrat- 
ing to the larger cities:

One of the subjects engaging the attention of superintendents is 
the improvement of teachers in service. Among the plans worked 
out are increased salary for attending college or university summer 
schools, general teachers’ meetings, grade meetings, special demon- 
stration classes. 
At the general teachers’ meetings topics bearing upon general class- 
room management and teaching are discussed by the superintendent 
and the teachers, by a superintendent from a near-by city or by a 
professor of education from some college or university. This plan 
is a great improvement over the old plan of holding teachers’ meet- 
ings where questions of interest to only one or two teachers were dis- 
cussed. 
The grade meeting now has a place in all progressive-school sys- 
tems. At these meetings problems peculiar to the particular grade 
are discussed. Often a teacher presents the result of some study 
she has made in regard to the teaching of a subject in the grade. In 
connection with the grade meetings demonstration lessons are some- 
times given. For example, a teacher who has made a marked suc- 
cess in teaching arithmetic presents a lesson to her pupils while the 
other teachers make notes and afterwards discuss the method used. 
   
-P-A-G-E-79
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 59 
Another kind of meeting helpful to teachers is conducted by the 
principal of the building at which problems relating to general dis- 
cipline are discussed. Often the teachers of the building organize 
into a reading circle under the direction of the principal and read 
and discuss during the term two or three books on education. 
Many of the smaller cities, in States where a city may hold a 
teachers’ institute apart from the county institute, have taken ad- 
vantage of this provision. A superintendent in a city of about 
15,000 population reports that he began holding his own institutes 
because the county institute was a large mass meeting of 500 teachers 
where it was impossible for a teacher to derive anything of value 
from the lectures, most of which were of a popular nature. Since 
organizing his own institute he has divided the work into depart- 
ments, primary, intermediate, grammar, and high school. A special 
instructor is employed for each of these for the morning sessions. At 
the afternoon sessions some one lectures upon a general topic. The 
superintendent reports that this plan is vastly better than that of 
meeting with the county institute where instructors too often deal in 
glittering generalities and the impractical. 
The use of standard tests, it is uniformly reported, has hada most 
salutary effect. Many teachers are spurred on to greater efforts when 
the score made by their pupils in arithmetic, for example, is much 
below the median for the school. They begin to question their own 
methods of teaching. Devices for grading teachers on certain points, 
it is also reported, have been a means for holding the teachers up to 
a higher standard. A few of the score cards used by superintendents 
were included in chapter 4, volume 1, of the Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1914. It is not claimed that these tests are 
perfect, yet they are better than the happy-go-lucky methods of 
former days for estimating a teacher’s worth. 
COURSE OF STUDY AND ORGANIZATION. 
ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY. 
Much effort has been spent in simplifying the courses of study. 
In arithmetic, for example, there is an attempt to eliminate obsolete 
subject matter. In language study stress is placed upon speaking 
and writing with clearness rather than upon the mere mechanics of 
composition. Hygienic living is emphasized and not the memorizing 
of anatomical terms, while courses in geography dwell upon the fact 
that the study of the earth is not a study of the location of capes, etc., 
but a study of the work of the world. In brief, courses of study show 
much improvement in the arrangement and in the selection of mate- 
rial, though many schools in the small towns and cities still adhere to 
old-time courses, teaching subject matter that never had and never 
will have any direct bearing on life, especially on child life.

60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
REORGANIZATION. 
Many smaller cities are experimenting with the administrative 
reorganization of the lower elementary grades. 
At Beaver, Pa., the superintendent has worked out a scheme of 
departmental work for the elementary grades differing from the 
usual plan of organization in the elementary school. Grades 1 and 2 
constitute one department; grades 8, 4, and 5 a second department; 
and grades 6, 7, and 8 a third department. In each building there are 
three teachers for grades 1 and 2, thus making it possible to main- 
tain a separate room for the children in the first half of grade 1. 
The average registration in each room is 32. The superintendent 
says that this experiment has more than met expectations in point of 
efficiency, economy, and the attention given to the individual pupil. 
As Neosho, Mo., the schools have been reorganized so that each 
subject or group of subjects is taught by a special teacher. The 
superintendent says that the plan is solving the problem of super- 
visors for the special subjects. One teacher, for instance, teaches all 
the drawing, another has charge of the playground work, and some 
construction work for the lower grades. Another teaches all the 
writing and drawing. 
The greatest interest in the reorganization of the schools has cen- 
tered on the seventh and eighth grades. For some time the fact has 
been apparent that pupils lose time in passing through these two 
grades; that the work of the elementary school has been unnecessarily 
dragged out over two extra years; and that a child can come into 
possession of the school arts in six years. 
It is felt more and more that in many schools the seventh and 
eighth grade work repeats very largely that of the fifth and sixth 
grades. In the fifth grade a pupil studies common and decimal 
fractions and in the seventh grade he studies these same subjects; 
in the sixth grade he studies percentage and interest; and again in 
the eighth grade. In the fifth grade he studies the geography of the 
United States from a small textbook, and again in the seventh grade, 
but from a larger textbook. By the time a pupil reaches the seventh 
grade he has gone over most of the subjects offered in the elementary 
course. The last two years simply repeat, and the methods em- 
ployed are practically the same drill methods of the fifth and sixth 
grades. For this reason it is claimed that pupils in the grammar 
grades are to a great extent merely marking time. Other arguments 
for a reorganization in the seventh and eighth grades are sufficiently 
familar. : 
SIX-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL. 
Many superintendents have been reorganizing their schools on 
what is popularly known as the six-and-six plan—six years in the 
elementary grades and six years in the high school, the high-school  
-P-A-G-E-81
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 61 
course being divided into two administrative units, a junior and a 
senior high school of three years each. In some schools the junior 
high school consist of only two grades, the seventh and eighth. 
Reports indicate that the movement to reorganize on a six-and-six 
plan is in full swing, and that it is not confined to any one section of 
the country, though possibly making greater progress in certain sec- 
tions. Reports also indicate that many more superintendents would 
establish junior and senior high schools were it possible to do so. 
Often it is impossible to centralize the upper grammar grades in 
one building or to have them in the high-school building. In the 
small cities there are usually only one seventh and eighth grade in a 
. building, so to work out the junior high-school idea as it should be is 
rather difficult without a central building. Many superintendents 
are looking ahead and laying plans for new buildings, so that the six- 
year high-school idea may be worked out completely. 
A school organized on the departmental plan is not entitled to be, 
called a junior high school. This is one step, but not the vital one. 
A six-year high school, if it means anything, means a complete 
reorganization as to aims and method. 
In chapter 6, volume 1, of the Commissioner’s. Report for 1914 
the junior high school was discussed at length, and some courses of 
study were included. None of these showed what changes had been 
made in the elementary schools. 
A reorganization of the upper six grades should also mean a 
reorganization in the lower six grades. The aims of each should 
be more clearly defined than at present. The work now done in the 
lower grades should not be made more difficult, as some opponents to 
the six-year high school claim will be the result. 
The superintendent of schools at Lewiston, Idaho, has effected a 
complete reorganization from the first grade up, so that the aims of 
the elementary school and the high school may be fully realized. 
He says: 
The elementary course of stdy is undifferentiated, and emphasizes the idea 
that here is preeminently the place in which the fundamental facts, habits, 
drills, and attitudes should be fixed as working tools and the child’s impulses 
and instincts be developed as working interests. Physical training, organized 
playground work, art, music, elementary manual arts, ethics, dramatization of 
reading work, are strongly stressed in the elementary grades. A grade circu- 
lating library has recently beem provided in the way of 200 sets of “ classics ” 
(40 classics to the set), each set of. classics encased in a strong cardboard box 
and given out on requisition. The reading matter in these “literary wholes” 
covers a wide range of interest for each grade, and the teachers have found it 
wise to devote at least one-half of all reading time to this line of work. Stereo- 
scopes, views, and other illustrative material is sent out on the same plan. 
The first half of the elementary course is known as the primary school and 
the second half as the intermediate school. In order that the teacher’s person- 
ality and responsibility be made more effective, teachers in the primary school  
-P-A-G-E-82
62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
are promoted with the pupils, making it possible for a teacher to direct a class 
three years. This is also true of the intermediate school. The position of 
elementary-grade supervisor has been created during the past year, relieving 
grade principals from classroom supervision, and the plan has proved a most 
successful one in coordinating and unifying the grade work. All promotions 
are made semiannually, based entirely on the judgment of the teacher 
(approved by the supervisor and superintendent). No final examinations are 
given for promotion. The last week of each semester is spent in unifying and 
classifying the work gone over. 
The Lewiston High School is organized on the basis of six years’ work and is 
divided into two administrative units of three years each—a junior and a 
senior high school, each with its own principal and assembly. The new high- 
school building of 36 rooms, exclusive of assembly rooms, is divided into two 
sections, with a combination gymnasium and auditorium between them. One 
wing is occupied by the junior high school and the other by the senior high 
school, This facilitates exchange of work between the junior and senior high 
school. All high-school work is closely organized by departments. The heads 
of departments constitute a school council. The school day consists of six 
60-minute periods, preceded each morning by a 20-minute general assembly in 
each high school. Each Wednesday the entire high school meets for a joint 
assembly. 
Four units of credit constitute a regular high school year’s assignment, hence 
24 units are required for graduation. Of the 24 units 3 may be earned in sub- 
sidiary work, and classes are now organized in band, orchestra, violin, piano, 
chorus, glee club, dramatics, debating, wireless telegraphy, photography, art 
work, and several other lines of activity. In order to receive credit, classes 
must meet regularly once a week and be in charge of high-school teachers or 
some teacher regularly authorized for this work. One-fourth credit a year is 
given for successful work in any line of work deemed worthy of educational 
credit. All promotions are made by units of credit earned, based on the average 
of the term’s work. No final examinations are given to determine promotions. 
Good students, in regular attendance, by doing outside work will be able to 
graduate in five years. 
“The junior high school is the crux of the entire fegesanieatign movement. 
Here is the place for the wisest, ablest teachers available, who will exercise 
unusual care and sympathy in introducing pupils to departmental teaching and 
work of a prevocational nature in which the pupil has an opportunity to try 
his powers, to test himself, to find himself, as it were. It is confidently ex- 
pected that the junior high school will greatly transcend the work heretofore 
done by the grammar school.” The junior high school does away with the sharp 
distinction which has hitherto existed between the eighth and ninth grades 
and permits an earlier introduction of many subjects which have hitherto been 
reserved for the high school—a reservation which is extremely unwise. The 
Lewiston High School experienced an increase of more than 20 per cent in 
attendance this year over that of the previous year, having in regular attend- 
ance at the present time 465 students. The Lewiston High School makes the 
same requirements for teachers in the junior high school that it does in the 
senior high school. 
In the first year of junior high school the following subjects are required: 
Arithmetic, English (reading, grammar, and spelling), history-geography, to- 
gether with drills in music, penmanship, and physical culture. Electives are 
Spanish, German, and Latin, sewing and cooking, shop work, fine and indus- 
trial arts. The second junior year requires mathematics (arithmetic and alge- 
bra), English, history, and citizenship (one-half) year, elementary science,
-P-A-G-E-83
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 63 
labratory work (one-half) year. Electives are a continuation of the work 
offered in the first junior year. The third junior year has only one required 
subject, and that is English, and from this on all work is elective except English. 
All work, however, must be elected by majors and minors. Five years’ regular 
high-school work is offered in Spanish, German, and Latin, and six years’ work 
in shop work, which includes forging and actual construction work. Six 
years’ high-school work is offered in home economics. The senior high-school 
industrial work for both boys and girls is made strongly vocational. Agricul- 
ture was introduced this year, and we are now offering two years’ work. Forty- 
five boys are taking this work. 
Not only are individual cities working out programs for junior 
high schools, but State departments have turned their attention to the 
matter. Some years ago the schools of New York State were reor- 
ganized with six years in the elementary grades, the seventh and 
eighth grades being designated as the intermediate school and the 
ninth to twelfth grades as the high school. Prof. C. D. Koch, in- 
spector of high schools in Pennsylvania, offers for the first time a 
program of studies for a junior high school. This outline is exceed- 
ingly suggestive and will no doubt be of interest to superintendents 
in the smaller cities where such schools are located or where there is 
prospect of organizing. The program is as follows:

-P-A-G-E-84
  64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
In discussing this program, Dr. Koch declares: 
A minimum amount of time expressed in 60-minute hours per week is as- 
signed to each of the school studies. This is not to be taken to mean that the 
recitation periods must be an hour long. The time prescribed means that at 
least this much time should be given weekly to the studies herein outlined. 
It is a minimum requirement. The five hours assigned to English includes 
some time for reading, language, and spelling. About half of this time should 
be devoted to reading. 
This distribution gives four hours to arithmetic, four hours to geography and 
hygiene, three hours to history, four hours to the study of a foreign language 
(optional), three hours to the manual arts, and one hour to vocal music. With 
a foreign language or commercial subjects this gives a total of 24 hours of 
required work. A five-hour school day will allow one hour of unassigned time. 
This may be used at the discretion of the teacher on the studies needing more 
than the allotted time. A longer school day will give more time to be used in 
this way. 
The time allotment has no thought of fixing the method of handling the 
recitations. This is left to the judgment of the principal and teachers. Part 
of the time may be used by the pupils in preparing work for the recitation or 
the whole hour may be given to study and recitation under the supervision 
of the teacher. The chief point is to see that all the pupils give to the studies 
the full amount of time assigned to them. 
The teacher of arithmetic should see that each pupil of the class actually 
works at arithmetic one full hour for each of four days in a week or 48 
minutes for each of five days. With this plan consistently and persistently 
followed, teachers may be assured that the character of the work in this sub- 
ject will be much improved. 
GROWTH OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Even in schools where junior and senior high schools have not 
yet been organized important changes in the course of study have 
taken place. One result of the better adaptation of high-school 
courses to the needs of the children has been the large increase in 
high-school enrollment. 
The following tables will show the increased enrollment in the 
high school as compared with the grades for the two years 1911 
and 1914:

KINDERGARTENS, 
One phase of school work that has received but little attention in 
the smaller cities is the kindergarten. Many school boards have not 
established kindergartens because of a lack of funds, others have not 
yet been convinced of the need for kindergartens. In many cities the 
high school and the grades have grown so rapidly in enrollment that 
the problem of housing the kindergarten has been a serious one. In 
one city, for example, a kindergarten was maintained for several 
years by a women’s club, the school board providing the use of a 
room in the school building. Increased enrollment in the grades 
finally necessitated the use of the room, and the kindergarten had to 
be abandoned. 
The lack of kindergartens in the smaller cities is due mainly to the 
fact, however, that public sentiment has not been sufficiently aroused
-P-A-G-E-87
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 67 
to the value of kindergarten training. Nevertheless, considerable 
kindergarten progress has been made within the past year in the 
smaller cities. During the term 93 cities in the North Central States 
have established kindergartens, Michigan leading this group with 22 
cities and 44 new kindergartens. Notable progress has also been 
made in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and California. 
The following table, compiled from statistics collected by the Kin- 
dergarten Division of the Bureau of Education, shows the progress 
made by cities of 25,000 population and less in the several States:

68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
COOPERATING WITH THE COMMUNITY. 
The attempt to bring the school into closer touch with the home | 
- and the community is meeting with marked success in many of the 
smaller cities, though only a beginning has been made in the use 
of community resources as an aid to the schools. Cooperation be- 
tween school and home has been found necessary from the fact that 
the schools have been getting out of touch with real life and that 
children have been taught. too much under artificial school condi- 
tions and not enough under real life situations. Then again it has 
been recognized that the schools of a community can not make 
progress unless parents heartily cooperate with school officials in the 
attempt to make the schools meet new conditions. 
Parent-teacher organizations have proved helpful in bringing 
home and school into closer relations. The following accounts may 
be taken as examples of the value of having parents and teachers 
meet together. 
Holland, Mich—The meeting of the parent-teacher association is held once a 
month in each building. Matters pertaining to the welfare of. children, their 
health, care of their teeth, their conduct out of school and in school, and their 
home life are discussed. Physicians, dentists, juvenile judges, and others 
who are authorities on various subjects are secured to speak at these meetings. 
The entertainment feature is quite strongly emphasized, the programs consist- 
ing of music, exercises by the children, and stereopticon travel talks. A nursery 
is provided in the building at the time of each meeting so that mothers may 
bring their children and have them well cared for while they are attending the 
exercises. Committees from each club visit the sick, take flowers to the sick 
or to homes where there has been a death, and send cards of congratulation to 
families where there have been recent births. Visiting committees see to it 
that those who most need the meetings have personal invitations. 
Mount Pleasant, Pa.—A large per cent of the population of Mount Pleasant is 
foreign born. A parent-teacher association has been organized principally to 
make school friends of these people. Our programs are shaped to this end. 
In the first place, we are careful to hold the meetings in the evening, when the 
fathers can attend. Invitations, signed by the teacher, are sent to each home, 
These are followed up by the attendance officer, who makes the meeting the 
object of a house-to-house canvass among the foreigners and negroes for about 
a week before the meeting. 
The program is made up of adults and children, divided about equally in the 
number of parts taken. At least one adult from the foreign parents is given 
a place. Then possibly a minister, a teacher or two, or a good business 
man makes a short address on vital topics affecting the best operation of the 
schools—regularity of attendance, cooperation of parents with teachers, selec- 
tion of books for home libraries, the kind of toys to give children, sanitation, 
food, etc. The teachers are careful to select at least one-half the children 
from foreign homes for the program. 
Following the formal program, which lasts about an hour, light refreshments 
are served by girls from the upper classes at the expense of the school district. 
While refreshments are being served the teachers move about among the 
parents, calling them by name (learned from the attendance officer), reporting

and making friendly inquiry about the children. On tables in the halls are 
placed written work, drawings, kindergarten material made up, etc., for the 
inspection of the parents. 
The immediate result is a rare good time for these people. The practical 
results noticeable are: Better attendance and more orderly conduct on the part 
of their children. 
SCHOOL CREDIT FOR HOME WORK. 
The movement to give school credit for definte home work is 
still progressing. A number of high schools now allow one or more 
units for work done at home, in the store or the shop, under the 
supervision of the school authorities. The giving of credit for any 
kind of work that a parent certifies his child has done is not gen- 
erally considered advisable, though some schools report good results 
where this plan has been tried. The giving of school credit for 
some definite home project properly standardized and supervised is 
recognized as a great aid in bringing the work of the home and the 
school closer together and of offering an opportunity to pupils to 
work on some industrial or agricultural project under real condi- 
tions. The great problem that superintendents are compelled to 
solve in this connection is the proper supervision of the work with 
the funds in hand or securing such supervision without adding any. 
great amount to the annual budget. 
Space does not permit presentation of the many different tate 
of providing for school credit for home work, but the following is 
cited to show what one of the smaller cities is doing to bring about 
a closer relation between the school and the industries of the home 
and the community. 
NEWTON, KANS. 
First. Sixteen units are required for graduation, at least 15 of which shall 
be regular credits. One credit may be granted for systematic and definite 
home credit work as outlined below. 
Second. Seventeen units are required for graduation “ with credit,” two of 
which may be for home or continuation work; provided, however, that gradua- 
tion “ with credit ” will be granted any student who completes but 16 “regular 
credits ” with an average standing of 85 or above. 
Third. Eighteen or more units are required for graduation “ with honors,” 
three of which may be for home or continuation work ;-provided, however, that 
graduation “with honor” will be granted any student who completes but 16 
“regular credits ” with an average standing of 90 or above. 
Credit, as indicated above, will be given for the following outside work when 
properly certified to: 
Regular weekly music lessons, instrumental or voice, under an accredited 
instructor, one-fourth unit per year for not to exceed four years. 
Active membership in any high-school or approved city musical organization, 
one-fourth unit per year, for not to exceed four years. 
Active membership in high-school literary work, consisting of rhetoricals, 
debate, public speaking, expressive reading, and dramatics; provided, however, 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
that an extra one-fourth unit’s credit will be given in English for the working 
out, taking part in, and filing with the superintendent a typewritten copy of 
the speech in any inter-school debate. 
Steady work on the farm, in the home, in the store, bank, shop, factory, office, 
ete., 14 units for three months. 
Judging with degree of accuracy different types of horses, cattle, hogs, and 
chickens, one-fourth unit. 
China painting, oil painting, art needlework, or other handicraft, or other 
home-decoration work with satisfactory exhibit, one-fourth to one unit’s 
credit. 
Definite Bible study, one-fourth for each year, provided the applicant for 
such credit submit a certificate of at least 90 per cent of attendance and take 
an examination, given or authorized by the school, or submit such other evidence 
as the school may require. 
The superintendent of schools at Chippewa Falls, Wis., reports that he has 
brought the schools and the home into closer relation by having the pupils 
write a report each week of everything they have done that pertains to domestic 
economy, the parents being required to indorse the report. Particular stress is 
laid upon such points as the ventilation and care of rooms; the preparation 
of entire meals; and the making of purchasing lists. A statement of results 
is required and a discussion of these is made during class periods to enable 
the pupils to understand and correct their mistakes. From 1 to 10 per cent 
credit, depending upon the amount of work done, is added to the monthly stand- 
ing. This system is used from the seventh to the twelfth grades, inclusive. 
HOME AND SCHOOL GARDENS. 
The home and school garden movement has also made considerable 
progress in the smaller cities during the past year. Especially in the 
South and the West there is abundant opportunity for the school 
to cooperate with the home in the cultivation of gardens, the school 
furnishing the necessary instruction and supervision. Among the 
many schools that have assisted in introducing home gardening may 
be mentioned those in Gadsden, Ala.; Rome, Ga.; Asheville, Char- 
lotte, Goldsboro, Hickory, Monroe, Raleigh, and Statesville, N. C.; 
Bristol, Murfreesboro, Clarksville, and Park City, Tenn.; Darling- 
ton, Rockville, and Sumter, S. C.; Alexandria and Bristol, Va.; 
Charleston, Huntington, and Chester, W. Va.; Lexington and Frank- 
fort, Ky.; Hot Springs, Ark.; Milton, Mass.; New Rochelle, Tarry- 
town, and Dobbs Ferry, N. Y. 
COOPERATIVE COURSES. 
No definite data have been collected showing to what extent coop- 
erative industrial courses such as those at Fitchburg, Mass., and 
York, Pa., have been introduced into the schools of cities of less than 
25,000 population, but several cities report such courses. At West- 
brook, Me., for example, the city cooperates with the paper mills, 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. ak 
silk mills, and machine shops in maintaining a full-time cooperative 
school. The course of study meets the requirements of college en- 
trance and at the same time contains two options, paper making and 
textile work. Instruction in the process of paper making and tex- 
tiles, study of machines, and other mechanical details is given. Stu- 
dents spend one-half day each week in the mills. This work is sup- 
plemented with analytic chemistry, mathematics, history, and physics 
as applied to these industries. Upon graduation students are taken 
into the mills if they so elect, or they may enter the University of 
Maine. 
An interesting experiment in cooperation has been made at Mont- 
clair, N. J. The superintendent became convinced that cooking in 
microscopic quantities did not afford the girls an opportunity to 
work under home conditions. He has attempted to solve the problem 
in the following way :* 
On the day when bread making is scheduled the members of the class are 
privileged to take orders from the home for a certain number of loaves, to be 
furnished at the cost of material. The girls thus cook in sufficient quantity 
to duplicate home conditions. At the same time the work is done at no cost 
to the department, and best of all there is no waste of good material. Inciden- 
tally, the school receives two by-products which are of no inconsiderable value. 
In the first place, the home is very much interested in the girls’ work and the 
plan tends to establish a very cordial relationship between the school and the 
home. In the second place, the department is stimulated to do its best. 
That the above plan provides real conditions for the domestic- 
science class is evident from the following facts: Last year one of the 
school kitchens turned out, in a single day, 120 dozen cookies; 60 
dozen doughnuts was another result of the plan. Canning on a prac- 
tical basis receives considerable attention, 28 quarts of tomatoes and 
2 gallons of chopped pickles being representative undertakings. An- 
other phase of the practical work is the cooking and serving of com- 
plete meals in the school dining room. 
The extension of school work so as to bring the older persons in 
the home to school is another item of progress that may be noted. At 
Athens, Ga., for example, there is organized each year a class for 
cooks actively engaged in service. This class meets twice a week 
for six or eight weeks. In addition to the instruction furnished by 
the domestic science department, the services of expert cooks in the 
city are secured. This course proved so popular that the school 
board decided to make it a permanent feature of the school system.” 
One hundred and fifty-two were enrolled during the last term.

WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT.? 
The smaller cities are making great strides in their attempts to 
educate the whole community by opening the school buildings in the 
evenings for educational classes and for social and recreational pur- 
poses. School buildings are now used as community centers more 
than they were a year or two ago. 
Wisconsin continues to offer interesting instances of this develop- 
ment. In several places in the State steps have already been taken 
toward employing the school principal as civic and social secretary.” 
The school board of Osseo, Wis., has voted to engage the principal 
of the schools of that town as civic secretary. The school board at 
Sauk City, Wis., has reengaged the principal of schools with the 
specific understanding that he is to act as civic secretary, the servant 
of the adults and older youth, not as a matter of unauthorized and 
extra effort, but as a definite part of the service for which he is hired 
by the community. 
Neilsville,* Wis., is another city which has inaugurated a civic 
secretary and organized a community association to cooperate with 
him. Nine public school principals in Wisconsin have been made vil- 
lage or town clerks, but Neilsville is said to be the first place where 
the board of education has added to its staff a civic secretary whose 
full time will be shared by the city in promoting its business, recrea- 
tional, and municipal work. The inauguration of the civic secretary 
in Neilsville was the occasion of a great mass meeting. Congratu- 
latory messages were read from many prominent people in the United 
States, among them Miss Margaret Wilson, who expressed her appre- 
ciation of the unique action the people of Neilsville were taking, 
referring to it as an appointment of unusual importance and sig- 
nificance. 
The use of school buildings for community purposes can not pro- 
ceed very far without a paid director. Even if school boards can 
not appropriate funds for such purposes, a superintendent who is 
trying to promote the social-center idea need not fail. Cities that 
can not employ a civic secretary may well imitate what is being done 
at Boise, Idaho, and other places which are exemplifying the get- 
together spirit in promoting evening meetings in the schools. At 
four schoolhouses in different sections of the city of Boise one enter- 
tainment a week is given, these being furnished once a fortnight by 
a joint committee from the three large women’s clubs and in the 
alternating weeks by the mothers’ clubs.

  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 73 
At Plainfield, N. J., the use of the school buildings in the evenings 
is carried on in four different fields: 1. In cooperation with the 
public library a number of schools are opened once a week as library 
substations. 2. Two or more buildings are used for free enter- 
tainments, lectures, etc., and for evening high school and evening 
elementary schools. 3. The public are encouraged to use the school 
buildings for various social purposes, the schoolrooms being fur- 
nished to clubs or individuals quite freely at a price to cover ex- 
penses of operating. 4. Evening recreation in lines other than 
educational in the usual sense of the term are offered under the 
direction and stimulus of two paid secretaries, who devote their 
whole time, day and evening, to this work. The movement has been 
under the management of a public recreation committee, who have 
worked in close cooperation with the superintendent of schools. The 
funds for the support of the work have come from three sources: 
A grant from the city council, a grant from the board of education, 
and fees charged at the various occasions. 
The utilization of school buildings for university-extension lec- 
tures may be noted in several centers. At Mannington, W. Va., for 
example, the superintendent of schools arranged with the State uni- 
versity to furnish a series of lectures to the people of Mannington, 
who subscribed to an expense fund. The lectures were free to the 
public and were well attended, not only by persons who possessed 
the advantages of a higher education but by those lacking such ad- 
vantages. A similar course will be offered this year. 
A special questionnaire was sent to the towns and cities of West 
Virginia by the bureau to ascertain what use the town and city 
boards are making of the school plant for social-center and recre- 
ational purposes. The following tabulation of the replies received 
no doubt represents what the average small city is doing to bring 
about a wider use of the school plant: 
Bridgeport.—Hlection and general citizens’ meetings. 
Bluefield.—Mntertainments given by the school. 
Belington.—Lyceum lecture course, plays, box parties, lectures, musicals, 
students’ socials.

RETARDATION. 
Though no data have been compiled showing to what extent re- 
tardation has been diminished, practically every superintendent 
reporting says that there is now a smaller percentage of overage 
children in the grades than there was several years ago. At Fort 
Smith, Ark., for example, the percentage of overage children has 
dropped from 37.2 in 1910 to 23.5 in 1914, and the percentage of 
underage children has risen from 8.6 in 1910 to 8.8 in 1914. The fol- 
lowing table shows the percentage of children in each grade above 
and under normal age in June, 1911, at Boise, Idaho, and the per- 
centage above and under normal age in June, 1915:

The improvement in the smaller cities is due largely to the fact 
that (1) superintendents are beginning to study their problems; (2) 
teachers are giving more attention to the individual pupil, studying 
his needs and recording necessary facts; (3) there is a more flexible 
classification, made possible by shorter promotion intervals, as a half- 
year period, or better still, children in some schools are promoted at
-P-A-G-E-95
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 15 
any time; (4) special classes are provided for retarded or exception- 
ally bright children; and (5) vacation schools of from four to eight 
weeks are affording an opportunity to children who have failed of 
promotion in one or two subjects at the close of the school year to 
pass on these at the beginning of the following term. 
That superintendents are making a study of the subject of retarda- 
tion is evident from the fact that nearly every published report now 
contains age and grade tables, while formerly no mention was made 
of age and grade. Some of the reports compare the amount of re- 
tardation of this year with the amount two or three years ago, thus 
showing whether any progress has been made in reducing the per- 
centage of retarded pupils. Superintendents are also studying this 
problem by requiring reports from principals and teachers of pupils 
whose promotion is doubtful, thus making it necessary for principals 
and teachers to study individual pupils. 
Though not all of the smaller cities have seriously attacked the 
problem of the retarded or the especially bright pupil, some schools 
are doing much to prevent retardation and to help pupils gain a grade 
or two. The following are some of the plans inaugurated within the 
past few years in several of the smaller cities: 
The pupils at Wausau, Wis., are given a chance under special 
teachers to make as rapid progress as possible. It was found that 
the most troublesome cases in the Wausau schools were those children 
who had much more than average capacity and who had become 
troublesome because they did not have enough to do. The superin- 
tendent discovered that from 30 to 50 pupils in each of the ungraded 
rooms make an extra half year each semester and some of them an 
extra year, and that they become better students, acquire industrious 
habits, and cease to be a disturbing factor in the schools. 
In the ungraded rooms there are also placed those pupils who for 
any cause have been absent for a time, yet have ability to catch up with 
their grades. As soon as they are prepared to reenter their grades 
they are taken out of the ungraded room and placed in the grade in 
which they were before their absence. 
A third class of pupils accommodated in the ungraded rooms are 
those who for any reason are slow or deficient in some one branch. 
In Elyria, Ohio, the school board has recently started a school of 
20 boys from 14 to 17 years of age who have several times failed of 
promotion and showed but little prospect of getting into the high 
school. These boys are given academic work for one half the time 
under a specially selected teacher; for the other half of their time 
they are distributed through the various industrial classes of the 
upper grammar: grades with the idea of giving them a chance of 
finding themselves in some line of industrial work. In many cases 
the teachers give them individual problems suited to their ability. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
At Anderson, Ind., the scheme of promoting through all the grades 
by subjects has been inaugurated. If a child is unsuccessful in 
arithmetic, for example, he repeats his arithmetic but goes on in 
other subjects. In many instances the child repeats the arithmetic 
and has the various other subjects in the same room under the same 
teacher. Where this can not be done, at a certain period each day 
the child is sent to another room where the lower-grade arithmetic is 
taught. 
That unusually capable teachers should be placed in charge of spe- 
cial classes is evident, but in many of the smaller cities school boards 
have not been willing to appropriate funds for special classes. Some 
superintendents have worked out plans to help the retarded pupils 
without any additional expense to the city. These are no doubt only 
a step toward special classes under specially trained teachers. The 
superintendent of schools at Jamestown, N. Dak., reports a plan that 
may commend itself to those superintendents who are trying to per- 
fect some scheme that does not involve additional expense to the city. 
He says: 
While considering the problem of the slow pupil and trying to find some plan 
which did not involve expense, and which was feasible in a small school, I hit 
upon the following scheme: I found out how many girls in the junior high 
school class intended to teach in rural schools when they received their high- 
school diploma. I then arranged to give these girls a course in psychology and 
pedagogy in the following way: A suitable textbook for the first was selected, 
then when this work was completed each girl was given practice-teaching expe- 
rience in the rooms of regular teachers in the grades. ‘These teachers were 
told that these girls were not to be treated as visitors but were to be given a 
chance to observe and then were to be given such tasks as preparing seat work, 
marking spelling papers, giving extra time and special assistance to slow pupils, 
dull pupils, or those who had lost ground through absence. These girls were 
required to spend one or two periods each day in a given room for an interval 
of two to four weeks, and then they passed on to some other teacher for similar 
work. The girls were given credit on their high-school course for this work 
in the same amount which they would have received if they had pursued a 
regular textbook course. I found that retardation was reduced in a marked 
degree through this plan and that the student teachers received very valuable 
training and were able to get a much better salary when they went out to 
teach themselves than those girls who lacked this training. It also had the 
effect of helping some of these girls decide whether they really wanted to 
engage in teaching or not. It also relieved the situation where it was necessary 
to give a teacher too many pupils. More recently I have tried the same plan 
at Jamestown, N. Dak., and it works well, and has saved the city the expense of 
at least one extra teacher this year, because we have a class of sufficient size 
so that We can assign several girls to a given teacher, each one at a different 
period of the day. The children soon become accustomed to the situation and 
do not seem to mind it at all. 
At the present time 39 pupils, after being given the Binet-Simon test, have 
been grouped in two sections. In one are the feeble-minded and in the other 
those who, for reasons like absence, temporary ill health, discouragement, or 
wasted will power are below grade. The groups have separate rooms and are
-P-A-G-E-97

in charge of teachers especially competent for this particular work. The chil- 
dren are, in the main, either of Irish or Italian nationality or of the Negro race 
and vary in age between 10 and 15 years and between the first and seventh 
in grade. 
The course of study arranged for them embraces the essentials of arithmetic, 
English, geography, spelling, physiology, and history taught in the corresponding 
grades of the primary and grammar school. The pupils enter the general con- 
tests and examinations given throughout the school, and when strong enough 
normal pupils are encouraged to return to the regular grades. Effort is con- 
tinually made to unite both book and handwork subjects so firmly that sewing 
and woodwork are, plus much review, the arithmetic, while cooking and agri- 
culture furnish the thought content for English. 
SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS, 
During the past few years the smaller cities especially have been 
active in the matter of establishing school savings banks. In Con- 
necticut, for example, 26 such cities have within the last year or- 
ganized banks. Of the total number of school savings banks in the 
United States 75 per cent are in the smaller cities. 
What the schools at Conway, Ark., are doing to train pupils to 
thrift habits and business methods is worthy of note. The plan is 
described by the superintendent, as follows: 
Beginning some months in advance, we talked over the advisability of estab- 
lishing early in life the saving habit. Next we secured from the attorney gen- 
eral and from the State bank commission rulings to the effect that the pro- 
posed institution would not come under banking laws. Then we had a full 
line of bank stationery printed, the line including checks, pass books, deposit 
slips, identification cards, and last, but not least, beautiful lithographed stock 
certificates. Two loose-leaf ledgers, an iron box, and a converted cloakroom 
for the bank completed the equipment. 
On a day advertised a week in advance we began the sale of stock. No one 
except pupils, teachers, and members of the school board were allowed to buy. 
Only one share was sold to any person, At the close of the sale we had sold 82 
shares and had $82 in our strong box. 
As soon as the stock certificates could be filled out and delivered the stock- 
holders met and elected a board of directors for the school year. By direction 
of the superintendent the stockholders elected three directors, the president 
and the secretary of the school board, the superintendent and the teacher of 
the business department of the high school being ex officio directors. It was 
also ruled in advance that the said teacher of the business department should 
be ex officio president of the bank. 
Immediately after the adjournment of the stockholders’ meeting the directors 
organized and elected a cashier to serve one month. It was arranged to hold 
the monthly meetings one week before the close of the month, so that the 
newly elected cashier should work a week with the outgoing cashier and learn 
the work. The work was too heavy for one to do in the short time allowed (30 
minutes a day), and we elected the cashier for two months. He served one 
month as assistant and the second as chief. 
The president appointed his committees—one to audit the books at the end 
of each cashier’s term, one to buy supplies for the sales department, and one 
to look after investments, loans, etc. The last-named committee, as its first

task, arranged with one of the local banks to place our funds from day to day. 
For the use of our money while in this depository we get 4 per cent interest on 
the average daily balance. The account is kept as an individual account to save 
the bank extra bookkeeping. It is understood that the local banks will all be 
used as depository in turn. 
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS. 
In response to an inquiry by the Commissioner of Education, super- 
intendents in the smaller cities sent interesting statements of prog- 
ress. The following items are selected to show the general trend: 
Hl Dorado, Ark.—Farm demonstration and canning club work. 
Alhambra, Cal.—The development from a small academic high school to a 
large polytechnic high school with about 500 students; the introduction of 
health inspection, manual training, cooking, sewing, etc. 
Bakersfield, Cal.—The establishment of seven kindergartens. 
Evanston, Ill—A wider use of the school plant. Hach building has been 
opened three nights a week and on certain Sundays. Classes in physical culture 
and social dancing are held after school hours. 
Streator, Ill.—The organization of a room for defective children. This school 
is in a house entirely apart from any other school activities. The girls are 
learning to cook, to prepare lunches, and to keep house. The boys have been 
engaged for a considerable part of their time this year in redressing old furni- 
ture for use in the home. 
Madison, Ind.—The establishment of a special school for children who are 
behind because of economic or social conditions. It has been found that there are 
a great many children in Madison who are bright and capable, and yet because of 
lack of encouragement at home or lack of ideals or poverty, are behind two or 
more years in their school work. As a class they have no interest in school 
work, their attendance is poor, and because of their dislike for school they are 
troublesome to the teachers. The experience so far with the special school indi- 
cates that it is possible to give such children a renewed ambition to succeed 
and to get from them a special amount of effort. 
Muncie, Ind.—The erection of an industrial and vocational high school at a 
cost of $300,000. The organization of junior and senior high schools. Hxten- 
sion of industrial and manual training work, introduction of vocational and 
physical culture courses. 
Keokuk, Iowa.—The introduction of standard tests to bring about a more 
definite standard of efficiency ; the introduction of kindergartens, organized play, 
and supervised playgrounds. 
Parsons, Kans.—Improved salary schedule for teachers and the recognition 
that teachers must be elected and retained wholly on their merits; the intro- 
duction of manual training and domestic science in the elementary schools; 
the abolition of all formal examinations in the elementary and the high school. 
Ithaca, N. Y.—The organization of distinct vocational classes both in the day 
and the night school and the segregation of the worst cases of retarded pupils. 
Emphasis has been placed on the night school and summer session. The be- 
ginning of the 6-8-3 plan; physical instruction has been begun in all ele- 
mentary and grammar grades. 
Ironwood, Mich.—In former years teachers from the ranks were appointed 
as supervisors of special subjects. This year specially trained teachers have 
been appointed as supervisors.
-P-A-G-E-99
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES, 79 
Solway, N. Y.—The differentiation of curriculum to meet individual needs of 
pupils, socialization of the school, establishment of the junior high school, the

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
The year 1914-15 has shown marked progress in a number of lines 
of work in rural education. These have been, in the main, a con- 
tinuation of plans for the reorganization and improvement in school 
conditions begun prior to the present year. Certain definite school 
policies and educational standards have by this time been accepted 
by educators for rural school reorganization that are bound to be_ 
of great value in unifying the many experiments now in progress 
to improve rural school conditions. In this work of unifying edu- 
cational effort, the rural school division of the Bureau of Education 
has found an important field of activity. 
The discussion in the present chapter naturally falls under the 
heads of administration, school practice, and school extension work 
and coincides roughly with the work of the three subdivisions of the 
rural division of the bureau. ; 
PROGRESS IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Administration—Many serious attempts were made by State edu- 
cational authorities in the 40 States whose legislatures met during 
the past year to secure legislation providing for important changes 
in the administration of rural schools. In all cases the movements 
were either for strengthened State and county departments of edu- 
cation or for the adoption of larger units of local control or for both. 
A reorganization of State boards of education or of State depart- 
ments was attempted in 7 States; in 2 only were important changes 
made. The abandonment of the local “district” unit system for 
either the township or the county system, or the abandonment of a

  82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
system where the management was divided between local district 
authorities and county authorities for the county system, was at- 
tempted in 16 States; in four instances the attempt was successful. 
Included in this number are only those attempts which received 
serious consideration and strong support. 
These attempts are worthy of note, because they serve to indicate 
the trend in rural administration. They seem to indicate that there 
is strong sentiment in favor of the State as a unit in education, with 
a State system headed by a State department of sufficient strength 
to direct and unify the educational development in the State, and 
intrusted with the control of sufficient funds to insure equally good 
educational opportunities in all portions of the State; also in favor 
of a local unit of administration and support large enough to secure 
efficiency and economy in management, and a distribution of the 
benefits of corporate and other wealth concentrated in small areas 
over other territory where it may be needed. The discussion created 
in the legislatures and elsewhere by these proposed measures has 
done much to spread information about more efficient school man- 
agement. 
The two States in which the organization of the State departments 
have been changed are Tennessee and Vermont. 
Tennessee has now, for administrative purposes, a system that per- 
mits rapid progress in rural-school development. Its general plan 
of administration includes a State board of education, appointed by 
the governor, charged with the general administration of school af- 
fairs, acting through the State superintendent, who is appointed by 
the board. Each county has its county board of education, elected by 
the people and having control of all schools in the county except 
those in independent city districts. The county superintendents are 
appointed by the county courts. 
Vermont has substituted for its old State board of education, 
appointed by the governor with the consent of the senate, a new 
board of five members appointed by the governor for five-year terms, 
and given definite and large functions concerning the general admin- 
istration of the schools of the State. This board appoints the State 
commissioner of education, fixes his term and his salary, appoints 
State supervisors as assistants to the State commissioner, and ap- 
points the school superintendents for the union superintendency 
districts of the State, in which are included all towns and townships 
in the State with less than 25 schools. This means that under the 
new law all school superintendents in the State with but 10 or 12 
exceptions are appointed by the State board rather than by local 
authorities, as in the past. Each town (township) remains a unit 
in organization and management as before. The State course of
-P-A-G-E-103
  RURAL EDUCATION, ; 83 
study, however, must be followed in all schools, and all teachers must 
be certified and approved by the State, and the State board is au- 
thorized to enforce these two provisions of the law. 
In Alabama, one of the States without a State board of education, 
an attempt was made to provide one. It was proposed that a board 
should be appointed by the governor, with the approval of the senate, 
which would act in an advisory capacity to the present State super- 
intendent of public instruction and the State department of educa- 
tion, and which would replace several independent boards. The bil 
met with favorable reception and was reported unanimously out of 
both the senate and the house committee on education. Little serious 
attempt was made, however, to secure the passage of the bill through 
either the house or senate on account of other important school 
measures before these bodies. 
In North Dakota an attempt was made to replace the existing 
board by a smaller board appointed by the governor. The present 
board consists of nine persons—the president of the State university, 
the president of the State agricultural college, the State superintend- 
ent of public instruction, the State inspector of graded and rural 
schools, the State high school inspector, all ex officio; one normal 
school president, one industrial school president, one county super- 
intendent, and one male citizen of the State not connected with the 
educational system. These four are appointed by the governor. 
The proposed board would contain no ex officio members whatever, 
but would provide a nonpolitical board and one not necessarily made 
up of education officers. This is in keeping with the general 
tendency. 
The 1915 Legislature of Wisconsin passed a “State board of edu- 
cation bill” providing a board whose function is to have “complete 
control of all the finances of all the educational activities” of the 
State. In Illinois the legislature was asked to create a State depart- 
ment of education under the general supervision of a State board of ~ 
education. 
The Legislature of Oregon was asked to reorganize the State board 
of education, which now consists of three ex officio State officers— 
the governor, secretary of state, and superintendent of public instruc- 
tion—and to confer upon the new State board additional functions. 
It was proposed in South Dakota, where there is no State board of 
education at the present time, to create one to consist of the superin- 
tendent of public instruction, the president of the State college of 
agriculture and mechanic arts, and four persons appointed by the 
governor, two of whom would be presidents of State normal schools, 
one a superintendent or principal of a city or town school, and one a 
county superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-104
    84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
In. connection with this movement on the part of these States and 
others in recent years, it is worthy of note that while several States 
without State boards of education at the present time, or with State 
boards composed of ex officio State officers, are proposing boards 
made up wholly or in part of ex officio educational officers, that 
other States which have had boards made up of ex officio educational 
officers have given up or are proposing to give up such boards and 
to substitute boards composed of citizens of the States selected by 
the governors without reference to whether they are engaged in 
educational work or not. In several instances States have. specified 
that all or a majority of the board must be persons not engaged in 
educational work. 
At least 12 States now organized on the district-unit basis made 
seridus attempts to change their systems of local management to the 
county-unit basis, and one (New York) to the township-unit basis. 
Alabama and Texas, two States which already had a county or a 
semicounty system, passed laws providing for a more centralized 
county system. Utah, with the county system in part of the State, 
has applied its county law to all counties. New Mexico has adopted 
the county unit of taxation but not of administration. 
Alabama has had a county system of administration since 1903. 
The counties were divided into single school districts and three 
trustees were elected in each district. The county board of education 
consisted of the county superintendent, who was elected by the peo- 
ple for four years, and four others elected for four years by the 
chairmen of the school district trustees. The system had several 
weaknesses which it is hoped the new law will eliminate. Under ‘it 
the single school districts were necessarily fixed territories and 
changes in boundary lines and consolidation of small districts into 
large districts were practically impossible. Furthermore, the county 
boards were largely influenced in their actions by the wishes of the 
chairmen of the district boards who appointed them, and. conse- 
quently did not exercise the full authority of a county board. An- 
other weakness of the system was that all members of the board, in- 
cluding the county superintendent, came into office and retired at the 
same time. Under the new law the board is composed of five mem- 
bers serving for six years, with not more than one-third of the terms 
expiring each biennium. The board is elected directly by the people. 
The county superintendents, at the expiration of the terms for which 
those now in office were elected, will be appointed by the county 
boards instead of elected by the people. They will be required to 
give their entire time to the work; their salaries will be fixed by the 
boards employing them. The boards will select all supervisors and 
teachers on the recommendation of the county superintendent. The 
new law in effect adopts for all counties in the State the system

under which Mobile County by special legislation has been’ organ- 
ized for several years. The principal changes brought about by the 
new law are given below. The first election of county board mem- 
bers will take place in November, 1916.

Another important measure passed by the Alabama Legislature, 
providing for an election on a constitutional amendment, tends also 
to strengthen the county system of administration. This action is 
relative to the support of the schools of the State. 
Under the present law, which has been in effect for many years, 
the source of the principal support for the public schools is the 
State. The State fund is distributed to the various counties on the 
basis of school population and is expended by the county boards 
of education in such a way as to provide as nearly as practicable . 
school terms of equal duration in all parts of the county, first appor- 
tioning to independent city districts their school population per 
capita share. This fund the counties, by a constitutional provision, 
may supplement by a local county tax, the maximum being 10 cents 
on $100 assessed valuation, but only on a three-fifths vote of the 
qualified electors of the county. Out of the 67 counties in the State 
only 46 have voted the local county tax; the others expend no money 
on their schools except that received from the State. There is no 
provision for any tax districts smaller than the county. Sentiment 
in the State for a constitutional amendment permitting a county tax 
greater than 10 cents on the $100 has been crystallizing for several 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
RURAL EDUCATION, 87 
years, and there has been considerable agitation for a provision for 
local tax districts. The 1915 legislature has provided for an amend- 
ment to be voted upon in the fall of 1915. If it passes, it will provide 
that a county may tax itself for school purposes a maximum of 50 
cents on the $100, and also that in counties levying a county school 
tax of at least 30 cents on the $100 local districts whose boundaries 
have been fixed and approved by the county board of education may, 
with the approval of the county board, tax themselves an additional 
30 cents to be expended in the district for purposes also approved by 
the county board. 
Texas has been organized for the management of rural schools 
under a semicounty system. Each county has been divided into 
local districts, which formerly had the entire control of the schools. 
For high-school purposes a board of “county school trustees” was 
provided several years ago, and to this board were given several 
functions besides the management of the high schools. It was ex- 
pected to classify all schools in the county as “ primary, intermediate, 
and high schools,” and prescribe the course of study for all of these 
schools. In its classifications it was authorized to limit the number 
of grades in any school, to establish consolidated schools with high- 
school departments with the consent of the district trustees, and to 
apportion the State and county school funds. The 1915 legislature 
has passed a law which will go into effect in 1916 under the name 
of the “ Rural-school law.” This puts the general management and 
control of all the public free schools of each county in the hands of 
the county school trustees, who are elected by the people. The new 
board of county school trustees has all the powers and duties of the 
old board and, in addition, prescribes, in cooperation with the county 
superintendent, the course of study for all schools in the county; 
exercises the authority heretofore vested in the county commis- 
sioners with respect to subdividing the county into school districts, 
as well as the authority to consolidate school districts into larger 
districts; and to apportion, as prescribed by law, the school moneys 
to the various schools in the county. The county superintendent 
is made by law the secretary and executive officer of the county 
school trustees. 
Utah, in 1905, provided an optional county organization for ad- 
ministration in counties with 2,500 school population or over. Eight 
counties adopted this plan, practically all that could do so under the 
law. The 1915 legislature has made the county-unit law mandatory 
for all counties in the State. 
New Mexico has adopted the county as the unit of taxation, but 
not as a unit of administration. Under this law, school directors of 
rural school districts, on or before the 1st day of May of each year, 
must submit to their county superintendent an estimate of the  
-P-A-G-E-108
  88. EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
amount of funds necessary for conducting the schools for the follow- 
ing year. After approval by the county superintendents, the esti- 
mate will be sent to the county board of commissioners. The boards 
of education of municipal school districts are required to send similar 
estimates direct to the county commissioners. The county commis- 
sioners are required to levy a tax upon all taxable property of the 
county sufficient to produce funds to support and maintain schools 
in municipal districts and rural districts employing at least four 
teachers. for nine months, and to support and maintain schools in 
other rural districts for at least seven months. No district may 
expend more than $60 per month for instructional purposes for each 
teacher holding a third-grade certificate, more than $75 per month 
for each teacher holding a second-grade certificate, nor more than 
$90 per month for each teacher holding a first-grade or higher certifi- 
cate. No rural school district shall be entitled to apportionment for 
more than one teacher for each 50 children or fraction thereof. 
Money for the purchase of land and the erection and repair of school 
buildings is to be raised by taxes in the local districts as heretofore. 
Nebraska has provided for the county unit of organization in the 
support and administration of the schools in counties of less than 
7,000 population upon majority vote in favor of the county unit in 
the various counties. There are 27 counties in the State to which this 
law may be applied. The Nebraska State school code commission, 
provided by the legislature of 19138 and appointed by the governor, 
recommended an optional county-unit law for the entire State. The 
proposed law met with such violent opposition that it seemed im- 
possible to secure its passage and it was amended to apply only as 
stated above. The school code commission presented several other 
recommendations that would have affected rural school administra- 
tion, but none of them were adopted. 
Among the other States in which attempts were made to secure a 
larger unit of organization for the administration of rural schools 
than now exists were New York, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Montana, Oklahoma, and Oregon. 
The Oklahoma attempt consisted of a measure before the State 
legislature, urged by the State superintendent of public instruction, 
for an optional county system which might be adopted by any 
county on majority vote and would give to g county board of edu- 
cation the control and management of all schools in the county ex- 
cept those in independent city districts. The legislature of Oregon 
was asked to pass an optional county-unit bill similar to the Okla- 
homa bill, but one which would give to the county board authority 
to appoint the county superintendent. This could not be done in 
Oklahoma without a constitutional amendment. Montana’s county- 
unit bill, defeated in the legislature by one vote, would have pro- 
vided for the State a county system very similar to that of Utah.  
-P-A-G-E-109
  RURAL ‘EDUCATION. 89 
The county-unit bill of Colorado, before the legislature in 1915 
for the second time, seemed to meet with the general approval of the 
educational forces of the State. It was concerned almost wholly 
with the administrative unit, as the State now has a 4-mill county 
tax. The opposition, however, proved too strong to secure its pas- 
sage. The State teachers’ association has already begun a campaign 
of education preparatory to the introduction of the same measure in 
the 1917 legislature. 
The State school code commission of Minnesota reported in favor 
of the adoption of the county unit, but did not ask for legislation, 
because the sentiment against it in the legislature seemed too great 
to overcome. For the same reason the county unit bill proposed and 
prepared by the State teachers’ association of Missouri was withheld 
from the legislature, and an educational movement was started to 
create sentiment throughout the State in its favor, with the hope of 
having the bill passed by the legislature in 1917. 
In New York a bill was introduced into the legislature providing’ 
for the adoption of the township unit of administration, with a 
township board of education to have jurisdiction of all schools in 
the township except those in union free districts with 5,000 popula- 
tion or more, and employing a superintendent of schools. The 
board would consist of seven members elected by the people for 
three-year terms and would have all the powers and duties now con- 
ferred upon city boards of education or trustees of rural school dis- 
tricts relative to locating school houses, erecting buildings, assigning 
children to the various schools, appointing teachers, etc. The schools 
of the township would be supported by a township tax. The town- 
ship system would probably be a very satisfactory organization for 
New York, as the New York township in civil functions is similar 
to the New England township, which has proved for New. England to 
be a conspicuously successful unit of administration in school affairs. 
The bill before the New York Legislature for the township system 
was prepared and urged by the State department of education. 
The State commissioner addressed to the State legislature a circular, 
in which he called attention to the necessity for legislation making 
possible the betterment of rural school conditions, pointing out that 
there were in the State 8,430 one-room schools, in almost half of 
which the average daily attendance was 10 or less. The State con- 
tributes from $125 to $200 to each of these schools, whatever the 
average attendance may be, and it has therefore a concern in the 
economic aspect of the problem. He called the legislature’s atten- 
tion to the fact that the district property valuation, basis for the 
support of schools in about one-half of the one-room schools is less 
than $40,000; that is, a valuation which at 1 per cent would yield a 
maximum of $400 for school purposes; also that 1,300 of these dis-
-P-A-G-E-110
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
tricts have a valuation of $20,000 or less, and 27 a valuation of less 
than $5,000. He proposed two remedies; first, the consolidation of 
districts and transportation of pupils where necessary; and second, 
the creation of a larger local unit of taxation, and consequently of 
administration. In regard to these two measures Dr. Finley has 
the following to say: 
As to the first (1), voluntary consolidation has proceeded slowly. In recent 
years the legislature has sought to encourage the movement and has authorized 
consolidation by district superintendents; but, while the educational results 
promise to be wholesome, even under this plan progress is made only in spots 
and with difficulty. If there could be a redistricting of the entire State for 
school purposes, taking natural and social centers as the school centers, the 
problem, I believe, would in that way be most successfully solvéd; but it would 
be a task requiring not only closest sympathetic study of local conditions and 
tendencies (a prodigious labor in itself), but the highest and most courageous 
intelligence and judgment that the State could command. 
The present district boundaries were many of them determined by economic 
and social and physical conditions which existed more than 50 years ago. (The 
districting was authorized under an act of 1812.) These conditions have been 
changed, not only by movements above referred to, but also by facilities of 
communication and transportation, and in many cases have been so changed 
as to give no reason for the continuance of these boundaries, except the con- 
venience of a few and a sentiment (most worthy in itself) which attaches to a 
school that has cherished associations. Consolidation is a method of making 
readjustments slowly and, chiefly, in extreme cases, to changed conditions. 
Arbitrary redistricting by the department or by a commission of the State 
would be a means of swift readjustment. The first is practicable but slow; the 
second is ideal but also remote. 
There remains one other course: (2) That of widening the local area of 
taxation and administration, so that the burden may be more equitably dis- 
tributed and a better school provision more generally maintained without dimin- 
ishing local initiative or responsibility or increasing State provision or control. 
The so-called “ township bill” is intended to call the attention of the legislature 
to this alternative plan. While the township system is in vogue in all the 
States immediately surrounding New York State, and while it has been for 
years discussed in reports and in meetings of school teachers and officers, it 
has not recently, at any rate, been brought effectively to the attention of the 
people as a whole. 
Even if, as is probable, your honorable body will not find itself ready to act 
favorably upon such a proposed plan this year, its presentation will at any rate 
invite your serious thought, and will through you reach the thousands of dis- 
tricts in the State which you represent, and there compel attention and have 
serious discussion. This department has no desire to impose a system from 
above, even if it could; but it is under compulsion to urge upon your careful 
and courageous thought what it believes to be for the good of the schools of 
the State, that there may come a united effort, and sacrifice if necessary, fer 
their improvement where it is most needful. 
Just as the schools of our cities are now managed as a whole by the several 
cities, it should be possible, without in any way impairing local initiative, 
interest, or pride, to plan for each township as a whole, to make each school 
a more vital force in the larger area and to relate it more closely to the daily 
life of the community which it serves. 3

While the movement in all of the States mentioned above, except 
New York, is toward the county as a unit of local control, in Wis- 
consin there has been a reaction and legislation in the other direction. 
A semicounty system was provided for the State by legislation in 
1913; the law providing it was repealed by the 1915 legislature be- 
fore the system had had a reasonable trial. This action can not be 
taken as an indication that the county plan adopted by Wisconsin 
was a failure, for it came before the system provided by the 1913 
law was in full operation and before the parts in operation had been 
tested. The system adopted was far from the ideal and many of the 
provisions of the law providing it were very indefinite; however, 
these facts had little to do with its repeal. 
The “county board of education bill,” as it was called in Wis- 
consin, was passed in August, 1913, after a long fight. As passed, 
it contained but few of the provisions of the original county bill 
presented to the legislature. It provided for an elected board of 
five members in each county, the first election to be held on the first 
Tuesday in April, 1914 (April 7). The newly elected boards were 
required to meet and organize on May 5 (1914), on which date they 
were to assume the powers and duties conferred upon them by the 
law, with a few important exceptions. Each board, for instance, 
was given power to fix the salaries of the county superintendent and 
his assistants and to audit the accounts of the superintendent’s office. 
This function, however, it could not exercise till the expiration of 
the terms for which the superintendent then in office was elected. 
The terms of the superintendents ended in July, 1915. The law was 
repealed before this date. The principal duties given the county 
boards of education were the general oversight of the work of the 
county superintendents, fixing their salaries and appointing and 
fixing the salaries of their assistants, also the power to change district 
lines and to consolidate schools. The immediate management and 
control of the schools rested with the local district trustees as before. 
The law repealing the “county board of education bill” provides 
a “county committee on common schools,” composed of three per- 
sons appointed by the county board of supervisors. The function of 
these committees is to appoint for their counties special county super- 
visory teachers as assistants to the county superintendents. For 
every county of 60 or less teachers one supervisor is required; larger 
counties must have two. The committees have no other functions. 
Three States have made provision for extensive inquiries into their 
public-school systems with a view of ascertaining how the adminis- 
tration of rural schools may be improved. Washington State has 
created a commission to study the management of the public-school 
system of the State, to be composed of one man from the senate, one
-P-A-G-E-112
  92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
from the attorney general’s office, one from the bureau of inspection, 
and the State superintendent of public instruction. Utah has created 
a commission known as the “ Educational code commission,” con- 
sisting of the State superintendent, the attorney general, and three 
members appointed by the governor, to make a study of the organi- 
zation of the present public-school system, investigate the present 
needs of the State as to educational organization, and report with 
recommendations for the reconstruction and codification of the 
school laws of the State, particularly in regard to schools outside of 
the cities of the first and second class. The sum of $500 was appro- 
priated for expenses. Wyoming appropriated $1,500 to pay the 
expenses of a State school-code commission of five persons, including 
the State superintendent and four others appointed by the governor. 
The members appointed by the governor include the principal of the 
State normal school, a county superintendent of schools, a high- 
school principal, and a ranchman. This commission is making a 
study of the rural-school situation of the State and will report with 
recommendations concerning methods of betterment of the situation. 
Supervision—The action of the legislatures in several States is 
evidence that the need for more expert supervision of rural schools 
is becoming generally recognized, and that there is a growing appre- 
ciation that effective supervision, as a rule, can be given only by men 
and women with professional training and chosen for their fitness 
for the work rather than for other considerations. The movement 
to make school officers, both State superintendents and county super- 
intendents, appointive rather than elective is going forward. One of 
the greatest difficulties seems to be that both State superintendents of 
public instruction and county superintendents of schools in many 
States, particularly in those west of the Mississippi River, are con- 
stitutional officers and must continue to be elected with other politi- 
cal officers until constitutional amendments can be adopted in the 
various States. Up to the present rural-school superintendents in 
20 States have been appointed by State departments of education or 
by the local beards of education to which they are responsible. Ala- 
bama and Utah are now added to this list. Alabama, as mentioned 
above, made provision for the appointment of the county superin- 
tendents by the county boards of education instead of by election by 
the people. Utah, by making the county-unit law mandatory for all 
counties, makes all county superintendents in the State appointed 
officers, the appointment being made by county boards. 
Actual bills to provide for the appointment of the county superin- 
tendents, either directly in States where the legislature has final 
power, or indirectly through a constitutional amendment where an 
amendment is necessary, were before seven other legislatures—Ne- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113

braska, North Dakota, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Nevada, and Cali- 
fornia. The Texas bill passed the senate but failed in the house. 
In regard to the elective versus the appointive educational officers, 
David Snedden, State commissioner of education of Massachusetts, 
recently declared :* 
In almost every State in the Union the question of the elective versus the ap- 
pointive system of selecting public servants is under discussion. Formerly the 
attempt was made to elect an official for every possible function. Gradually 
this has been abandoned in progressive communities, except as regards those 
representatives of the people, like legislators and such chief executives as Presi- 
dents, governors, and mayors, who are expected to reflect popular demands and 
to. give voice to popular policies. 
It is proper that we should have the popular election of lay boards in educa- 
tion. It is doubtful if the popular election of officials responsible for adminis- 
tration’ and directive duties can be defended any longer. But in many States 
we still elect, by popular vote, the chief educational executive. It is also com- 
mon to find the chief county educational executive chosen by popular vote. It 
can not be denied that this system of selection from time to time brings to the 
front men of rare ability, and also that their services are recognized and re- 
warded by a relatively long tenure. 
Nevertheless, the time has come when, throughout the country, educators 
should go on record more definitely than has hitherto been the case as to the 
fundamental soundness of the system of popular election for educational execu- 
tives. We must seriously examine not only the effects of this system as these 
are manifested in the work done in States and counties, but also as to the 
effects of the system on. the development of a thoroughly professional point 
of view on the part of those qualified for educational leadership. . Any system 
that does not bring to the front, in an administrative capacity, those who by 
nature and training are best suited for such work, and which does not retain 
such persons. in service as long as their accumulated experience makes them 
available, is bound to be faulty. It should, of course, be recognized that, up to 
a certain level, a system of popular election may work fairly well, and yet ut- 
terly break down beyond. Few people now would argue that an engineer or a 
superintendent of a water-supply system should be chosen by popular vote. It 
ought to be equally difficult to argue that an expert educational administrator 
should be chosen any more than an architect or accountant. 
In American cities it would seem that educational administration is now or- 
ganized along substantially right lines. The lay board, representative of the 
public, is the final source of authority. This lay board appoints its chief execu- 
tive, and holds itself ready to scrutinize his policies and to pass judgment upon 
the results of his work. Under the chief executive are found, in various stages 
of service down to the rank and file of teachers, other executives, nominated by 
the superintendent and communicating through him to the board of education. 
A system analogous to this must be developed if county and State supervision 
are to rise to the new level of responsibilities now confronting them. We must 
make a career for the county superintendent no less dignified and important— 
and enduring—than that of the city superintendent. 
This is one of the large problems confronting educational administration in 
America. It must become definitely professional. It can not become profes- 
sional as long as the methods of selecting State and county executives are what 
they are at present.

  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The action of the Wisconsin Legislature has already been men- 
tioned. Oregon, after three years’ experience with its supervision 
law, has amended it so that it becomes optional in each county in- 
stead of mandatory, remaining in force in each county, however, 
until voted out. The original act was passed in 1914. Under its 
provisions, in every county with 60 or more teachers the county super- 
intendent was required to appoint a county board of education which 
divided the county in supervisory districts of 60 teachers each and 
appointed a supervisor for each district so formed. 
Indiana, under the vocational education act of 1913, has accom- 
plished a great deal in the introduction of practical arts subjects in 
the schools. This was possible through the employment of 116 spe- 
cial township and county supervisors for practical arts subjects, 34 
for agriculture, 59 for domestic science, and 23 for industrial arts. 
Of the total number, 46 were county supervisors. 
In several States measures were passed providing increased rural 
supervision. The action of Vermont in providing for increased 
supervision and for the appointment of all rural superintendents by 
the State board of education, instead of by local authorities, has 
already been mentioned. The school code of Pennsylvania, adopted 
in 1911, provided for assistant county superintendents to be paid 
from State funds. None, however, had been appointed until the 
present year, because the legislature made no appropriation for their 
salaries. This the 1915 legislature has done, and assistants have now 
been appointed in accordance with the law. The law provides that 
every county superintendent with more than 200 teachers under his 
supervision shall have one assistant; with more than 400 teachers, two 
assistants; with more than 600 teachers and less than 800, three assist-- 
ants; and for every additional 400 teachers or fraction thereof, an ad- 
ditional assistant. These assistants must be nominated by the county 
superintendent and confirmed by a majority vote of the five officers of 
the “ directors’ association” of the county ; that is, the five officers of an 
association which includes all township school directors of the county. 
These assistants must be able to present the same qualifications as are 
required for county superintendents. The salaries paid are fixed by 
the directors’ convention. The minimum, $1,200, is paid out of the 
State appropriation. 
CONSOLIDATION. 
Special State aid to stimulate consolidation was granted in several 
additional States during the year. Nebraska was one of the States 
which provided such aid in 1915, and the State superintendent re- 
ports that 300 new schools of the consolidated or cooperative and 
rural high-school types were to be ready for opening in September, 
1915.
-P-A-G-E-115
  RURAL EDUCATION. 95 
Missouri reports 175 consolidated schools to which 7,000 children 
are transported in 400 wagons, and 200 other consolidated schools 
without transportation. 
North Dakota reports 333 consolidated schools, 205 of which are 
in towns and 128 in open country. This is an increase of 60 during 
the past year. The records of the State inspector of rural schools 
show that the proportion of pupils enrolled in the eighth grade in 
the consolidated schools of the State is twice as great as in the 
eighth grades of the other rural schools; also that on account of 
these consolidated schools the high-school enrollment of country 
children has increased over threefold in the past four years. Con- 
solidation in North Dakota has been stimulated by the vigorous edu- 
cational campaign conducted by the State department. 
Indiana reports that in 1914 there were 665 consolidated schools 
in 71 of the 92 counties in the State, attended by 73,404 children, or 
35.9 per cent of all the pupils attending rural schools; 26,403 children 
were transported at an expense to the public of $491,265. This is 
approximately 36 per cent of the children attending the consolidated 
schools. A recent study of the consolidated schools in Indiana by 
the State department of education reveals certain evidences that 
better educational opportunities are presented in the consolidated 
schools than in other rural schools; for instance, that better teachers 
are provided is indicated by the fact that the average daily wages 
paid in consolidated schools are $3.37, as compared with $2.76 in 
other rural schools. In spite of this greatly increased salary, the 
cost per pupil in the consolidated school is not much greater than in 
‘the other rural schools, the figures being $25.64 and $22.71, re- 
spectively. The establishment of so many consolidated schools has 
made high-school education possible to country children within easy 
reach of their homes. This is evidenced by the fact that of the 
total number of children enrolled in the consolidated schools 22 per 
cent are in the high-school departments. That Indiana, after 25 
years of experience with such a large number of consolidated schools, 
is satisfied with the type of school even when the expense is greater 
than that of the old type is evidenced by the rapidity with which 
district schools have been abandoned for consolidated schools. In 
the past five years the number of schools abandoned was 916. 
The State Legislature of Delaware has passed an act which will 
probably result in considerable consolidation. At the present time 
the average school district of the State contains less than 6 square 
miles. One-half the number of schools properly located might re- 
place the present schools and still leave no children more than 24 
miles from the schoolhouse. The law, however, contemplates con- 
solidation with transportation. Upon the petition of five or more 
residents of any district the State board of education is required to 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
investigate the advisabilty of altering the district, and at a properly 
advertised meeting for the districts affected must submit to the resi- 
dents and property owners a tentative plan for consolidation. If 
the board considers the change advisable, it is to submit the question 
to the school voters of the territory affected. A majority vote will 
be necessary to carry. The bill provides for the disposition of school 
property, the erection of new buildings, and the raising of funds for 
the support of-the new school. 
Oklahoma has amended the State law relative to the consolidation 
of rural schools, providing that in the future the election to deter- 
mine whether consolidation shall be effected or not shall be at one 
central meeting of all the districts concerned and shall be carried 
by a majority vote of those present. Several other States have already 
such a provision, and it has been demonstrated that consolidation is 
more easily agreed upon than when each district concerned votes 
independently and must be in favor of the movement before con- 
solidation may take place. 
In Towa 55 consolidated schools were established during the year, 
nearly all with two or four year high-school departments. These 
schools have all been established under the provisions of an act of thé 
legislature of 1913, giving special State aid for departments of agri- 
culture, domestic science, and manual training in consolidated 
schools. Each school has a site of from 4 to 10 acres for agricul- 
tural teaching. In order to receive State aid the consolidated schools 
must meet the requirements of the State department of education 
concerning buildings, grounds, course of study, and qualification of 
teachers. All of these buildings have been approved by the depart-* 
ment; all have satisfactory equipment for work in agriculture, 
manual training, or domestic science. Several of them have teachers’ 
cottages on the grounds. : 
PREPARATION OF RURAL-SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
It requires a force of approximately’ 365,000 teachers to supply 
the needs of rural communities in the United States. The most 
careful estimates that can be made indicate that one-third of the 
teachers, or 122,000, have little or no professional preparation for 
their duties. The average teacher remains in the profession less 
than four years of 140 days each. This means that there is an 
entire change of personnel every four years, or that 92,000 new 
teachers must be provided annually. The supply of professionally 
prepared rural teachers comes from State normal schools, agricul- 
- tural colleges, teacher-training high schools, and county normal 
schools, and a few schools of education in colleges and universities. 
Teachers who are in the field of service are finding increasing facili-
-P-A-G-E-117
  RURAL EDUCATION. ° 97 
ties for improvement in the summer schools which are now in opera- 
tion in every section of the country. 
Several States report interesting progress during the year. Indi- 
ana has passed a law providing for higher qualifications of rural 
teachers, equalizing this matter at the same time by enacting an 
improved minimum-salary law. Iowa will hereafter require at 
least 12 weeks of professional training of all teachers in rural schools. 
Oklahoma has enacted a law that after 1917 all teachers, whether 
in city or open country, must be high-school graduates with some 
normal-school preparation. Nebraska has made provision by law 
for the organization of special rural-school departments in all its 
four State normal schools. Mississippi and Georgia have begun 
to prepare rural teachers in the strongest of their agricultural high 
schools, and the former State also in a few strong consolidated 
schools. This is in addition to the courses for. rural teachers in the 
State Normal School at Hattiesburg. Alabama has reorganized the 
courses of its class A normal schools to answer more nearly the needs 
of rural teachers. West Virginia, Florida, and Oklahoma have 
been added to the list of States making use of high schools in the 
preparation of rural teachers, while several of the other 17 States 
with high-school training courses have materially strengthened the 
organization of this work. Finally, several States, and among these 
Iowa and Connecticut, have put into effect successful systems for 
training teachers in active service. 
IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Special departments for training rural teachers—In 1908 only one 
or two State normal schools had separate departments offering spe- 
cific courses for rural teachers. At the present time at least 43 such 
departments have been organized and 36 other normal schools offer 
excellent general courses for rural teachers. In addition, at least 50 
normal schools have strong departments which offer instruction to 
teachers of agriculture, many of them being aided in this work by a 
very complete farm equipment. 
In Nebraska State normal schools. 
above provides: ‘The Nebraska law referred to   
There shall be established in the State normal schools of Nebraska a course 
of study for rural teachers. Said course shall contain thorough instruction in 
the common-school subjects, rural sociology, management and organization of 
rural schools, observation, consideration of how to organize a rural school and 
make the schoolhouse the social center, médnual training, sanitary science, 
household economy, agriculture, and vocal music. The course shall cover two 
years, and mature students shall enter directly from the tenth grade, and upon 
completion of said course may be granted county certificates under the rules 
to be prescribed by the State superintendent of public instruction.

Teacher training in secondary schools is now carried on in 20 
States... This includes the so-called county training schools as well 
as teacher-training departments in connection with high schools and 
teacher training as a part of regular high-school courses. Wisconsin 
is the only one in the group with genuine county training schools in 
every respect separate from the public high schools. New York, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, and Ohio have what are called county 
training schools or classes or separate departments more or less 
closely connected with the public high schools and using public-school 
buildings and equipment for the work. Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, 
Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia, and Wis- 
consin have training courses as part of the ordinary high-school 
courses, leaving all except the professional work in charge of the 
regular high-school instructors. Maine offers teacher training in a 
few of its accredited acadeniies. North Carolina has similar courses 
in a number of high schools, although it has no legal enactment 
directly authorizing their organization. During the past year West 
Virginia, Florida, and Oklahoma have been added to the list. West

  RURAL EDUCATION. 99 
Virginia and Florida have direct legislation to this end, while Okla- 
homa has enacted a law through which the State superintendent of 
public instruction has been enabled to organize such departments. 
Probably the chief objection to teacher training in high schools 
has been the fear that the emphasis on teacher training will weaken 
the academic courses. Schoolmen are not agreed on this point, but 
the general tendency is now to lengthen the course and grant no cer- 
tificate until four years of high-school work shall have been com- 
pleted. A number of States have taken steps to add a fifth year to 
the high-school course, or, rather, are organizing the teacher-training 
departments as a one-year course, to be taken upon the conclusion of 
the regular four-year course. The State of Ohio, which organized its 
first training courses of this kind one year ago, has practically aban- 
doned its short course and expects hereafter to graduate from the 
long course only. This requires graduation from high school before 
entering the training course. New York, the first State to organize 
this system of teacher training, has just passed a law to the effect 
that after 1917 no one shall be permitted to enter teacher-training 
courses who is not a graduate of a regular four-year high school. 
Many other States are contemplating similar requirements. The 
total number of high-school training departments and classes for the 
past year was 1,089, with an approximate attendance of 25,000 and 
11,088 graduates. 
Aisbaiha has made radical changes in its class A noun schools 
during the year. Classical and other subjects preparing primarily 
for university courses have given place to rural sociology, hygiene 
and sanitation, and such other subjects as have distinct value in the 
preparation of teachers for the rural schools. The controlling motive 
of the new course of study is to provide professional training for the 
1,200 beginning teachers needed each year in the elementary schools 
of the State. 
Louisiana reports that the teachers prepared in the rural school 
department of the State normal school at Natchitoches receive better 
salaries than teachers prepared in other departments of the normal 
school. Mississippi has organized at Hattiesburg a normal school 
primarily for rural teachers, which in the three years of its existence 
has prepared 2,000 teachers, 1,000 of these being in attendance during 
the past year. Illinois reports that its State normal schools are 
recognizing more clearly than ever before that rural teaching is dif- 
ferent from grade-school teaching. Four of the five State normal 
schools have now made special provision for the preparation of 
teachers for the rural schools. Three of them have ample ground 
and are giving instruction in agricultural subjects which will enable 
teachers to link up school work with the work children are interested 
in at home.

  ‘100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE. 
Aside from the important work accomplished by the summer 
schools in every section of the country, many States and educational 
institutions have adopted plans for training their teachers while in 
-active school service. In this connection may be mentioned also the 
National Rural Teachers’ Reading Circle, which has just been inau- 
gurated by the Bureau of Education in conjunction with an advisory 
committee appointed by the association of State superintendents of 
the National Education Association. 
The National Rural Teachers’? Reading Circle-——The plans .for 
organizing a national rural teachers’ reading circle were first broached 
at the National Educational Association meeting in St. Paul in 
1914. The final plans, as worked out by the Bureau of Education 
in cooperation with the advisory committee mentioned above, have 
been put into operation, and teachers throughout the country have 
been invited to its membership. Thirty-four States have already 
joined the reading circle. Only teachers residing within States 
which have expressed a desire to cooperate will be permitted to join. 
The reading circle work is without cost to the members, except 
for the purchase of books. There is no restriction as to membership. 
The books to be read in the study course for the years 1915-1917 
are classified under five heads, as nonprofessional books of ‘cultural 
value, educational classics, general principles and methods of educa- 
tion, rural education, and rural life problems. The work is organ- 
ized as a two-year course, although it may be completed by the in- 
dustrious student-teacher in a shorter time. 
To those who give satisfactory evidence of having read not less 
than five books from the general culture list, and not less than three 
from the other four lists—17 books in all—within two years of the 
time of registering, will be awarded a national rural teachers’ reading 
circle certificate signed by the United States Commissioner of Edu- 
eation and the chief school official in the State in which the reader 
lives at the time when the course is completed.* 
The Iowa plan of extension service for rural teachers.—An effective 
plan of State-wide extension service for rural teachers has been 
in operation in Iowa for two years under the direction of the Lowa 
State Teachers’ College at Cedar Falls. The development of the 
work is thus described by President Homer H. Seerley: 
Preliminary work was undertaken in 1913-14 by the organization of several 
counties with teachers’ study centers as a demonstration of an effective plan 
for the permanent assistance of teachérs at work in the rural schools. These 
study centers were composed of voluntary classes of teachers who were willing

to come together on Saturdays and give the entire day to recitations on topics 
of immediate value to their school work. The classes met as frequently as was 
deemed advisable and preparation by study and reading was required for all 
meetings after the preliminary one. By this means much benefit was received 
and nearly all these original study centers were continued for the year 1914-15 
and enough new ones were added to organize more than half of the counties 
of the State, over 5,000 teachers being thus instructed without any fees for 
service. For 1915-16 the Iowa General Assembly has made a special appro- 
priation of $20,000 and has provided that an equal amount may be thus ex- 
pended annually thereafter, with the further understanding that if the results 
anticipated are reached that additional income sufficient to give the best effi- 
ciency will be added. This plan gives permanency to the work and makes the 
demonstration a permanent policy. 
The management of this extension service is placed under the supervision of 
an officer called “'The Director of Hxtension Service.* His relation to the 
Teachers’ College is that of head of the department of education, which receives 
his attention in the classroom Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays of each 
week during term time, while Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are given 
to the extension service through instruction in county teachers’ institutes and 
instruction in teachers’ study centers. : 
The instructors in the teachers’ study centers are selected’ by the director of 
extension service. 
The demonstration rural schools—Fundamental to the study center service 
Iowa places her system of demonstration rural schools conducted and super- 
vised by the rural education department of the Iowa State Teachers’ College. 
These rural demonstration schools are 20 in number and are all of them typical 
“rural schools managed either by rural independent school districts or by rural 
township school districts. * * * All pupils have a-course of study in the 
schoolroom to complete and another equally emphasized course of study. in 
the home and on the farm to complete, and their study and effort involves 
every secular. day the year round, the rural education department being on 
duty to supervise, to instruct, and to help the pupils to succeed in their voca- 
tional work to the same degree as should be expected in their regular school 
work. To accomplish this desirable end, the fathers and mothers have become 
the assistant supervisors of the home work and the farm work and they re- 
ceive the advice, the suggestions, and the instruction of the rural supervisors 
in so far as they may need it, while everything is done to get the best returns 
for the endeavors made and to establish the facts by photograph, by samples, 
and by financial realization of cost and returns. These undertakings are sup- 
plemented by neighborhood meetings of large variety and purpose that have 
had the effect of enlarging community interest, community support, and com- 
munity improvement. Out of this have come better social conditions, more 
harmonious relations, larger development of ideals, and better conceptions of 
living. 
The supervisors of the rural demonstration schools become acquainted with 
every man, woman, and child in this cooperative district; they secure from 
each one some special assistance that enlarges individual usefulness to the 
community, while they obtain competent teachers for the schools, introduce 
appropriate libraries, equipment, and apparatus, hold social center meetings, 
and inspect constructively the training in teaching being done by the senior 
students of the rural-teachers’ course maintained by the college. To facilitate 
business and to give the best results transportation by automobile is provided 
for supervisors and student-teachers and rapid communication is established 
between the college and its most remote rural schools.

102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The Connecticut plan for training teachers while in service.—Con- 
necticut makes use of a unique system for training teachers while in 
service. Under this plan all new teachers are classed as apprentices. 
In all the smaller towns (townships) having supervisors assigned to 
duty and paid by the State, these apprentice teachers are placed in 
charge of the supervisors who, under law, must devote a certain 
amount of their time to instruction of the teachers within their 
supervision districts. In order to facilitate this work of instruction, 
the last State legislature made provision for the establishment of 
model schools in the State-supervised towns to be used as adjuncts 
in this system of training the apprentice teachers while pursuing 
their regular teaching. The law is in part as follows: 
Srcrion I. One school in each town having 20 teachers or less may be organ- 
ized as a model school for observation and instruction of the training class con- 
ducted by the supervisor. 
Src. II. The State board of education may make application to the comptroller 
for an order on the treasurer for a sum not exceeding $3 a week for each 
teacher in such model schools. No application shall be made to the comptroller 
under the provisions of this act unless the town in which said model school 
is located shall pay to the teachers of the model school a wage of not less 
than $10 a week or not less than the wage which was paid for teaching in 
said school during the previous year. 
From this it will be understood that there is at least one model 
school for each 20 teachers in service and that, with the special State 
aid, the strongest teachers in the township can be placed in the 
model school. The requirements for approval as a model school are 
given by the State department as follows: 
The rural school should be a one-room school in a situation acceptable to all 
teachers of the town. 
The building must be in good repair, with sufficient blackboard space. 
There must be ample equipment of aids to teaching, including a hectograph 
and a complete set of wall maps. 
There must be a suitable selection of supplementary reading—at least 15 sets. 
There should be not less than 15 pupils registered and five grades repre- 
sented, to include one first grade and at least one grade above the fifth. 
The teacher must be able to secure results with well-defined and approved 
methods. ; 
She must have a good program and keep a book of lesson plans. 
She must prepare in some detail one model lesson outline each week for the 
instruction of visiting teachers. 
She is to consider herself as an assistant to the supervisor and be prepared 
at all times to consult with him relative to the needs of teachers sent to 
observe her work. 
During the past year 25 model schools of this kind have been estab- 
lished, while at least 17 additional towns have asked to be placed on 
the list for the coming year. The schools established serve a territory 
with 227 teachers, all of whom, according to the State department   
 
-P-A-G-E-123
_ RURAL EDUCATION. 103 
of education, “have enjoyed the benefits of observation in them and 
conferences with their teachers.” 
It is readily seen that model schools of this kind in charge of 
strong instructors can be made of inestimable value to inexperienced 
teachers. Under the Connecticut plan, the apprentice teachers are 
allowed certain days during which they attend these model schools 
and gain the benefit of expert instruction. Says the State depart- 
ment of education further: 
The close correlation between the semimonthly visits of the supervisor, the 
monthly meetings of all the teachers, the observations at the local model school, 
and the daily practice in her own school, rapidly develops the young teacher 
so that she soon acquires confidence and some real skill. Scores of Connecticut 
young women are now prepared in this way for successful service as teachers. 
This is done, too, while they are actually earning a livelihood during the 
apprenticeship. 
RELATION OF SALARIES TO PREPARATION AND LENGTH OF TENURE. 
The salary received by the teachers of the Nation is partly a meas- 
ure of the value in which their services are held by the country and 
partly a measure of their efficiency. The National Education Associ- 
ation committee on teachers’ salaries and cost of living, in cooperation 
with the Bureau of Education,! discloses that the annual average 
wage of farm laborers in 1913 was $257, while the average for rural 
teachers was slightly more, although the exact figures are not avail- 
able. At the same time the average wage of rural mail carriers was 
$1,115. The study makes an interesting contrast of these three fig- 
ures for a certain number of States, showing throughout a very slight 
variation in the wage of the teachers and farm laborers, with the 
mail carriers receiving more than three times as much as either 
teacher or farm worker. It is clear that so long as the Nation con- 
tinues to place a low valuation on teachers’ services, it will have to 
get along with much poor teaching. Unquestionably, on the other 
hand, the individual teacher’s preparation and efficiency have much 
to do with the salary he draws. It is considered food policy now to 
provide by legal enactment for a liberal sliding scale salary, allowing 
the teacher’s salary to increase in direct ratio to his increasing effi- 
ciency and length of service in the same community. 
How accomplished in Wisconsin.—The last legislature in Wiscon- 
sin made provision for rewards such as have just been mentioned for 
continued and efficient service in the same community. The law 
states in part: 
If any school district not composed wholly or in part of an incorporated 
village or city shall have retained or shall hereafter retain any teacher after the 
first year such teacher shall be entitled to receive State aid as follows: If such 
teacher shall be retained for and shall have successfully taught such school 
  
1 Hduc. Bull., 1915, No, 31. 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
during a second year, $2 per month for each month of such year during which 
the school maintained in such district is taught by such teacher; if for a third 
year, $4 for each such month; and if for a fourth or any succeeding year, $8 for 
each such month. : 
If any school district not composed wholly or in part of an incorporated 
village or city in which the school shall have been successfully taught for the 
whole or any part of any year by a teacher who is a graduate from a rural 
school course two years beyond high-school graduation in any normal school or 
country training school of the State or the equivalent thereof, such teacher shall 
be entitled to special aid of $10 for each month during which such school is 
taught by such teacher. And each succeeding year that such teacher shall be 
retained and shall continue to teach such school successfully he or she shall be 
entitled to special State aid in the sum of $15 in each month. 
It will be noted that the law emphasizes the expression “ success- 
fully taught.” The county superintendent and State department of 
education are to decide whether or not a school has, in their judg- 
ment, been successfully taught. It is also interesting to note that the 
amount of salary granted by the State as an award for efficiency and 
Jong tenure is in addition to any sum that the district boards pay the 
teacher, and there can be no bargaining with the teacher on the as- 
sumption that the district will pay a part and the State the balance 
of the salary due. 
Grading salaries in Indiana—Indiana also has recently adopted a 
law providing for a carefully graded scale of salaries for teachers 
depending on their qualifications and length of service, although not 
necessarily in the same community. The law provides that— 
the daily wages of teachers for teaching in the public schools of the State shall 
not be less, in the case of beginning teachers, than an amount determined by 
multiplying 24 cents by the general average given such teachers on a highest 
grade of license at the time of contracting. For teachers having had a success- 
ful experience for one school year of not less than six months the daily wages 
shall be not less than an amount determined by multiplying 3 cents by the gen- 
eral average given such teacher on the highest grade of license at the time of con- 
tracting. For teachers having had a successful experience for three or four school 
years of not less than six months each, the daily wages shall not be less than an 
amount multiplied by 34 cents for the general average given such teacher on 
his highest grade of license at the time of contracting. For teachers having had 
a successful experience of five or more school years of not less than six months 
each, the daily wage shall be not less than an amount determined by multiply- 
ing 4 cents by the general average given such teacher on his highest grade of 
license at the time of contracting. All teachers now exempt from examination 
shall be paid, as daily wages for teaching in the public schools, not less than 
an amount determined by multiplying 33 cents by the general average of 
scholarship and success given such teachers: Provided, That the grade of 
scholarship accounted in each case be that given at the teacher’s last examina- 
tion and that the grade of successful accounting be that of the teacher’s term 
last preceding the date of contracting: And provided further, That 2 cents 
shall be added to the teacher’s general average of scholarship and success for 
attending the county institute the full number of days, and that said 2 cents 
shall be added to the average scholarship of beginning teachers.
-P-A-G-E-125
  RURAL EDUCATION. 105 
It appears from a study of this section of the law that the teacher's 
‘scholarship and success are both recognized in the grade of license 
held. The Indiana law further provides a penalty of an amount not 
to exceed $100 and liability in civil action for wages if any school 
officer shall pay a teacher for school services at a rate less than that 
fixed in this act. 
““ STANDARDIZING ” THE ONE-TEACHER RURAL SCHOOL. 
In certain sections of the country where it is impracticable at this 
time to reorganize the one-teacher rural schools as centralized graded 
schools, a movement is under way to make the schools as effective as 
possible by improving their physical conditions, including grounds, 
buildings, and equipment, organization for teaching purposes, and 
efficiency of teacher. This system of school improvement is popularly 
known as school standardization. 
Illinois has probably led the country in the movement to standard- 
ize the small one-teacher schools. The State department of education, 
which in this State recognizes two grades of improved schools, 
“standardized” and “superior,” reports highly satisfactory results 
from what has been done in the State the past several years. Minne- 
sota makes the granting of State aid to schools contingent on certain 
high standards to be attained by the ungraded and semigraded rural 
schools. Texas has recently enacted a law providing State aid to 
weak schools in the sum of $1,000,000 for the next biennium, to be 
distributed on the standardization basis under the direction of the 
State department of education. Wisconsin, Kansas, Georgia, West 
Virginia, Alabama, and Oregon are other States that have reported 
satisfactory results from State or county systems of rural school 
standardization. 
The Oregon plan—tIn Oregon school standardization began as a 
local plan in Polk County five years ago. Other counties readily 
adopted the plan, and in 1914, at a convention held under the aus- 
pices of the State superintendent, a plan was adopted for State-wide 
school standardization. The standards are to be raised year by year 
so that there shall be no stagnation. The following is a list of require- 
ments for 1914-15: 
Flag.—Must be flying, weather permitting. 
Schoolhouse.—Properly lighted. 
Aquipment.—Teacher’s desk and chair; desks for pupils properly adapted and 
placed ; suitable blackboards ; window shades in good condition. 
Heating and ventilating—Jacketed ‘stove properly situated, minimum re- 
quirement ; window boards or some other approved method of ventilating. 
Rooms.—Attractive at all times. 
Standard picture——One new one, unless three are already in the room, 
framed.
-P-A-G-E-126
  106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Grounds.—To be clean, free from paper, ete. At least three features of play 
apparatus. Walks, if necessary. 
Sanitation—Pure drinking water; either drinking fountain or covered tank 
and individual drinking cups; individual, family, or paper towels. 
Outbuildings.—At least two good ones, to be sanitary at all times and free 
from marks. 
Teacher——Must maintain good order at all times; supervise the playground; 
have her work well prepared; follow State course of study; take at least one 
educational journal; have program posted in room; keep register in good 
condition; be neat in attire. 
Library.—Good selection of books from State list. Case for the books. 
Books kept upright, in good condition, and recorded according to rules specified 
by Oregon State Library and required by law. 
Attendance.—Average 92 per cent for year and not to exceed 2 per cent in 
tardiness for year. 
Length of term.—Not less than eight months of school each year. 
The following statement made by the State superintendent of pub- 
lic instruction shows graphically the progress made in school stand- 
ardization during the year: 
The rural schools of Oregon have, during the past year, made great progress 
in the way of equipment, better buildings, and playgrounds; and the interest 
aroused through community meetings held for the purpose of making these 
improvements has developed a desire among the people to have teachers espe- 
cially trained for rural work. 
The standardization of rural schools has furnished a concrete work for the 
administrative departments and to this plan may be attributed most of the 
progress of the past year. * * * Thousands of dollars have been spent in 
enlarging and equipping the playgrounds. The State department of educa- 
tion published a very complete Recreation Manual, compiled by the National 
Playground Association, a copy of which is furnished every teacher. After 
September 1, 1915, no person is eligible to enter a teachers’ examination for 
certificate unless he has completed two years’ of work in an accredited high 
school, and has had at least a summer’s term of work in a standard normal 
school, or is the graduate of the teachers’ training course of an accredited four- 
year high school. 
The Oklahoma model schools—In Oklahoma another form of 
standardization has been inaugurated by the State department of 
education. During the year the State superintendent of schools has 
encouraged the county superintendents to organize one model rural 
school in each county to serve as an illustration for all other rural 
schools in the county. The majority of county superintendents 
organized from one to three such schools. The county superintend- 
ents are now planning to organize five or more additional model 
schools per county. 
The plan includes decoration of the schoolroom to make it as 
nearly ideal as possible, care of the school grounds, organization of 
agricultural clubs, installation of library equipment for use for the 
entire community, encouragement of the social center movement, 
provisions for a rural-life course, frequent visits by the county super- 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  RURAL EDUCATION. 107 
intendent, and encouragement of patrons’ clubs. In counties where 
the schools were organized during the year there was considerable 
competition among rural districts wishing the county superintendent 
to designate their schools as model schools for the ensuing year. In 
these districts great care was exercised in the choice of teachers for 
the year 1916, since only well-prepared teachers are desired for the 
model schools. 
RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
High-school development has been comparatively slow in rural 
communities. Rural children are still largely obliged to look to 
town for their secondary school education. Only here and there is 
the high school an integral part of rural education. There is still 
too much of the feeling abroad that the farm child should get to 
work as soon as the traditional eight-year elementary school course 
is finished. School centralization, however, is doing much to modify 
the old standards. People are beginning to realize more and more 
that the demands on intelligence and technical preparation for life 
are at least as exacting in the country as for the average worker in 
town. To meet the new demands a variety of rural high schools are 
being established. They are variously known as district, township, 
and county high schools. The former may correspond to the ordi- 
nary school district organization or may represent an entire con- 
gressional district, as in Georgia. Township and county high schools, 
as the name would indicate, represent respectively the civil units of 
’ the same designation. Township high schools are common in New 
England and in some of the Middle Atlantic and Middle Western 
States. Kansas, Oklahoma, and several other Middle Western States 
have county high schools. Other designations for rural high schools 
are agricultural high schools, as in Mississippi, and farm-life schools, 
as in North Carolina. 
Township high schools in Illinois —The objection to the township 
and county high schools has been that they are not accessible to all 
the children of the township or county. In Illinois the township 
high-school act of 1913 has resulted in the establishment of 100 town- 
ship high schools accessible to many rural children. Another law 
requires all districts to pay tuition in a four-year high school for 
graduates from rural schools. These laws make it possible for all 
rural children to take advantage of high-school privileges, although 
unfortunately, not always within convenient distance of home. 
New rural school law in Kansas.—This State has a large number 
of county high schools organized under the so-called Barnes law. 
These high schools are generally located at the county seat or a 
rural village near the center of the county. Some of the schools 
have from 5 to 15 or more acres of land for experiment purposes,
-P-A-G-E-128
  108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
although a majority adhere rather closely to. the old traditional 
course of study. The last legislature of the State enacted a law 
under which other independent rural high-school districts may be 
established for areas of not less than 16 square miles, with separate 
high-school boards, under the jurisdiction of the county and State 
superintendents. Under the new law rural high-school organization 
has received a new impetus in Kansas. 
North Carolina county farm-life schools—The State of North 
Carolina has begun to organize what are called county farm-life 
schools. The general county law provides for a special county elec- 
tion by which the community may bond itself to provide the neces- 
sary funds for buying a school farm and other, equipment. After 
this has been done bids for the location of the school are advertised. 
The school is then placed in that community within the county of 
not exceeding 1,000 population which offers the largest financial aid 
for maintenance and equipment. The community getting the school 
is generally expected to provide some, if not all, the land for grounds 
and experiment farm and a large part of the funds for school build- 
ings, including dormitory facilities, barns for stock, etc., at an out- 
lay of from $15,000 to $25,000, and also to provide a maintenance 
fund of $2,500 a year. On these conditions the State will supple- 
ment the maintenance fund of the school by $2,500 a year. The law 
provides further that in case a county bond election fails to carry 
any township or two or more contiguous townships may issue bonds 
for equipment and levy special tax for maintenance. Guilford 
County, which is an exceptionally wealthy county, organizes farm- 
life schools under a special act which has allowed it to establish two 
or more such schools in the county. 
A number of schools have been organized under the several acts ~ 
up to the present term. The influence of the schools is already very 
marked on North Carolina community life. The schools provide a 
‘practical training in the problems and pursuits of everyday life. 
The courses of study are centered about scientific farming and home 
making. The faculties of the schools carry on a definite and vigor- 
ous extension work throughout the county, giving instruction to 
grown-up people as well. The trained experts of the faculty extend 
the influence of the school through demonstration work and by 
organizing adult clubs throughout the county. In a similar way, 
the teachers of the farm-life schools wield a progressive influence 
over the general body of rural teachers. The teachers of the small 
rural schools meet at the village schools for demonstrations and 
instructions on the school farm and in the laboratories. The head 
of the agricultural department of the farm-life school is often the 
county supervisor of vocational subjects.

PROGRESS IN RURAL-SCHOOL EXTENSION. 
The primary purpose of school extension is to find a way for every 
man and woman in the State who otherwise would not have an op- 
portunity to gain an education. In accordance with this view of 
extension work, many universities, colleges, normal schools, and 
high schools throughout the country have taken upon themselves 
the. great task of extending educational privileges by correspondence 
courses, instruction by lectures, debating, and public discussion, 
general information and welfare departments, and rural chautauquas, 
to every man and woman who desires to take advantage of these 
means of obtaining an education. 
Ruradl-life conferences—Among the States doing effective work 
in rural-life conferences during the school year 1914-15 were Arkan- 
sas and Maryland. . At. Fayetteville, the seat of the University of 
Arkansas, there was an enrollment of over 600, and three programs 
were maintained each day for 10 days—one for teachers, one for 
ministers and social leaders, and one for farmers and their wives. 
Much of the success of the conference was due to the hearty 
cooperation of a large number of organizations. The director of 
the conference was able to bring together the best workers of the 
State board of education, the State board of health, the State horti- 
cultural society, the State bankers’ association, the farmers’ union, 
and the State organizations of the leading religious denominations 
found in the Southwest. 
Preliminary to this great summer meeting a number of local rural 
conferences had been held through the cooperation of the department 
of country life of the Presbyterian Church and the school of educa- 
tion of the university. 
The Maryland Agricultural College held country-life schools for 
ministers during the summers of 1914 and 1915. These country-life 
schools of this institution were largely the result of two desires—the 
desire of the college to be of the greatest possible help to the farm- 
ing communities of the State, and the desire of the ministers to get 
in touch with the farmers’ problems. 
Motion pictures in eatension service—One of the newest features 
in rural-school extension is the use of motion pictures. The Louisi- 
ana State University has been doing pioneer work in the rural schools 
of the State. The scope and purpose of this work is set forth in the 
University Bulletin, July, 1915, as follows: 
During the first seven months of 1915 the junior extension service of the 
Louisiana State University visited 140 schools in 17 parishes and rendered 
programs with the autostereopticon and moving-picture machine to an estimated 
* attendance of 23,840 school children, school patrons, and farmers. About one 
week was devoted to each parish: »
-P-A-G-E-130
  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
In addition to several reels of educational pictures, there were shown at each 
school stereopticon slides depicting the various phases of corn, pig, poultry, 
and canning club work. These slides were accompanied by lectures explaining 
the meaning of the clubs and the valuable training they offer to the boys and 
girls on the farms. An increased interest in the club work has been manifested 
in each community in which these lectures have been given, and they have been 
very effective, also, in acquainting the people of rural districts with the efforts 
their State university is making to assist them, through its extension service, 
to solve the problems that confront them in their farming pursuits. 
In addition to its use in the production of moving pictures and lantern slides, 
the current generated by the electric motor of this machine may be utilized to 
provide heat for cooking demonstrations. An electric cook stove has been added 
to the equipment of the automobile and successful cooking demonstrations have 
been made. This feature is expected to prove an important part of the exten- 
sion work in home demonstration. Cooking by electricity is not to be em- 
phasized, but the apparatus will afford a convenient and ready means of pro- 
ducing heat for cooking demonstrations. 
Illustrative of the type of motion pictures now becoming available 
for extension use is the 7,000 feet of motion-picture film which the 
Lincoln Highway Association has recently had made. This film por- 
trays the beautiful scenery of plain, mountain, valley, and desert 
“from coast to coast in an easy chair” for the millions of men, women, 
and children who are unable to drive over the Lincoln Highway. 
This film is available for farmers’ clubs, farmers’ institutes, women’s 
clubs, good-roads clubs, rural-life conferences, and other similar 
organizations. 
Work of private agencies—The efforts of the National and State 
Governments and educational institutions are also aided by numerous 
private agencies. Typical of the definitely valuable work done in this 
way is the extension service of the International Harvester Co. 
This company distributes thousands of agricultural lecture charts to 
teachers and others on soils, sanitation, weeds, alfalfa, live stock, gar- 
den and canning, diversified farming, etc. A typical lecture is “The 
great forward movement in education.” The company also has a 
force of extension lecturers who, upon invitation from the proper au- 
thorities, go into various States and conduct forward-movement cam- 
paigns for better agriculture, better homes, better schools, and bet- 
ter living, holding from 25 to 50 meetings in a single county in one 
day, and thus continuing until the State is thoroughly covered. Ar- 
kansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Oklahoma have been so 
campaigned, and Prof. P. G. Holden, who is in charge of the service, 
is now directing a campaign in the Big Horn Basin, Wyo., with a 
large force of extension workers. 
“ How to organize a club of United Farm Women” is an excellent 
little booklet published by the Progressive Farmer, Raleigh, N. C. 
Mrs. W. N. Hutt is the general organizer of this work in that State.
-P-A-G-E-131
  RURAL EDUCATION, 111 
In the foreword of this booklet for 1915 Mrs. Hutt says: 
The United Farm Women enters upon its first birthday, with 435 branches. 
These clubs are in every State in the South. Some are strong; some still 
struggling. Some have undertaken ambitious programs; some are almost with- 
out programs, but the members enjoy the sociability of coming together. Some 
are interesting themselves in baby contests, county fairs, and other public mat- 
ters, while others are providing wholesome pleasures for the young people. But 
one and all, they are working for more efficient homes and more united 
communities. 
Chautauquas and lecture courses——Probably the greatest fields of 
school extension are the hundreds of Chautauquas and thousands of 
lecture courses held in the United States every year. These Chautau- 
quas and lecture courses are now established at places within reach 
of the rural people as never before. During the past year many vil- 
lage and rural communities in Virginia and many other States were 
privileged for the first time to have a rural lecture course or a rural 
Chautauqua, or both, during the year. While scores of these as- 
semblies have imitated only one or two features of the original Chau- 
tauqua—neglecting its fundamental principles—and while many of 
them are commercial enterprises managed for profit, the Chautauqua 
system is one of the most potent factors of modern times for pro- 
moting public education. Millions of men and women have been en- 
lightened and given a broader vision of life through its influence. 
The free rural delivery of mail, carrying the daily papers, the 
magazines, and Government bulletins to millions of rural people; the 
ownership of automobiles by hundreds of thousands of farmers, thus 
making it possible for the rural people to attend Chautauquas and 
lecture courses at centers of population, and by the use of the automo- 
bile in taking lyceum talent into the country where community meet- 
ings are now held by the thousand throughout the Nation—these ex- 
tend educational privileges to millions of people who otherwise would 
be without many of these advantages. 
THE DIVISION OF RURAL EDUCATION IN THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
Reference was made at the beginning of this chapter to the present 
organization of the division of rural education. 
The following statement will make clear the scope of the work of 
the division: . 
Organization—The division of rural education in the Bureau of 
Education has been reorganized during the year in order to make it 
better able to meet the increasing demands for expert advice and 
assistance in the rural field. As now organized the division com- 
prises the subdivisions of rural-school administration, rural-school 
practice, and rural-school extension service. The subdivision of 
rural-school administration has been organized to offer expert advice
-P-A-G-E-132
112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
in rural-school administration to State and local boards of education; : 
to advise with commissions and committees on school legislation; to 
make’ school surveys and to carry on special educational studies in 
its particular field. The subdivision of rural-school practice is organ- 
ized to make a fundamental study of the curricula of rural elementary 
and secondary schools and to offer such aid to rural teachers and school 
officers as may be required of them; to become a clearing house for 
the latest and best of subject matter and helps in other phases of 
school practice, including the training of rural teachers, both before 
going into the service and while in the field. This subdivision has 
charge of the propagation of the National Rural Teachers’ Reading 
Circle, which has recently been adopted by more than half of the 
States. The subdivision of rural-school extension is primarily active 
in such educational interests in rural communities as boys’ and girls’ 
industrial clubs, educational rallies, illiteracy campaigns, school 
fairs, rural-life conferences, wider use of schoolhouses for lecture 
centers, work for the extension of the school term, securing better 
teachers’ salaries, improvement of school buildings and grounds, 
organization of parent-teachers’ associations, cooperation with farm 
demonstration agents and local and State supervisors. 
The specialists and assistants in the division of rural education are 
aided very effectively by nearly 100 special collaborators who are 
nominally in the service of the Government, but who, as members of 
various school faculties or as State or local school officials, are in 
position to report to the Bureau of Education every progressive 
movement taking place in the rural field. Several of these have 
undertaken valuable studies, of which a few have already been 
completed. 
Publications —A large number of publications dealing with rural 
and agricultural education have been distributed by the Bureau of 
Education during the year. 
Bulletins of the bureau in this field were as follows: 
1914, No. 12. Rural Schoolhouses and Grounds. 
No. 17. Sanitary Survey of the Schools of Orange County, Va. 
No. 20, The Rural School and the Hookworm Disease. 
No. 22. The Danish Folk High Schools. 
No. 24. Danish Elementary Rural Schools. 
No. 25. Important Features in Rural School Improvement. 
No. 27.. Agricultural Teaching. 
No. 80. Consolidation of Rural Schools and Transportation of Pupils at 
Public Expense. 
No. 44. County Unit Organization for the Administration of Rural Schools. 
: No. 49. Efficiency in Preparation of Rural School Teachers.

CHAPTER V. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
By THomas H. Briaes, 
Associate Professor of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University. 
ConTenTs.—Extension of opportunities for secondary education—Reorganization of 
courses of study—Influence of State inspectors of high schools—Provisions for 
economy of time. 
To read both official and unofficial reports on secondary education 
from all parts of the country is to be profoundly impressed by the 
confident acceptance everywhere of the assumption that the United 
States shall continue and extend its undertaking of affording educa- 
tion free of charge to all the children of all the people. Despite the 
fact that in 10 years there has been an increase in the number of 
public high schools from 7,576 to 11,515 (59 per cent), in the enroll- 
ment from 679,702 to 1,218,804 (92 per cent), in the length of time 
pupils remain in school, and in the annual cost to an astounding 
total (the income of 24 per cent of all public high schools in 1913-14 
was $19,117,841), there is nowhere any indication that the work is 
to be prosecuted less vigorously. Indeed, the reports are unanimous 
that the campaign to afford opportunities for free secondary educa- 
tion and also to adapt that education to the needs of all pupils is even 
extended. This means that the “sifting ” function of the high schools 
is receiving less and less emphasis, and that as the cost of the newer 
subjects in the program of studies is usually higher than that of the 
older academic subjects, preparation must be made for a greatly 
increased high-school budget. 
EXTENSION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The opportunities for secondary education are being extended in 
various ways. Besides the increase in urban communities, there is 
a notable extension, even in States of relatively small wealth, of high- 
school privileges in rural districts. In perhaps a majority of the 
States in which school legislation was enacted last year some law ap- 
plied to rural high schools.!' As instances may be cited the following

items: Delaware has enacted a consolidation school law, permissive 
in its nature, under which 20 per cent of the cost of a new building 
is borne by the State (up to the amount of $2,000), and by which 
$1,000 is contributed by the State toward the cost of operating such 
school if a course in agriculture is made a part of its work. In North 
Carolina a beginning has been made with 18 rural high schools con- 
taining “ farm-life” departments; the law has recently been amended 
by striking out the requirement that a county shall be able to main- 
tain a six months’ school term before establishing farm-life depart-, 
ments in public schools and by authorizing the county commissioners, 
if they should desire to do so, to make appropriations to farm-life 
departments out of the funds for necessary county expenses. Iowa 
has now 138 consolidated rural schools, to which transportation is 
provided, offering high-school instruction. Subsequent to the offer- 
ing by the Nebraska department of public instruction of a program 
which through cooperation would permit the rural districts to estab- 
lish high schools covering 9, 10, or 11 grades, depending upon the 
resources of the district, more than 200 such schools have been or- 
ganized. An interesting feature of several of these cooperative 
schools is a cottage for the teacher, who also is employed as a “ com- 
munity manager of social interests.” 
It is well known that a number of the States, especially those that 
most wisely administered their land grants, have stimulated the 
development of high schools by direct appropriations, usually to 
promote and aid the introduction of some new feature of the cur- 
riculum. West Virginia has recently increased the amount for dis- 
tribution from $40,000 to $85,000. North Carolina reduced its 
minimum apportionment from $250 to $200 and increased the maxi- 
mum from $500 to $600.. The State appropriation for high schools 
will hereafter be distributed on the basis of attendance, number of 
full-time teachers, and grade and character of work done. <A school 
meeting only the minimum requirements hereafter will receive, 
therefore, from the State only $200; and a school that measures 
up to good standards, maintains a good attendance, has a good 
building and sufficient equipment and teachers, and has the stand- 
ard term of nine months, may receive as much as $600 from the 
State fund. This provision encourages schools to put forth greater 
efforts to increase their attendance, to erect good buildings and 
equip them properly, to organize their work according to proper 
standards, and to lengthen their terms, by providing more liberal 
State aid for those that do these things. Nebraska gives directly 
to each of the new consolidated schools $100 for equipment and 
$150 annually for expenses. Texas appropriates from $500 to $1,500 
to each school that teaches agriculture and from $500 to $1,000 
(with a maximum of $2,000 for both items) for manual training.  
-P-A-G-E-135
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 115 
In Minnesota the direct aid is even more generous. An unfor- 
tunate item which must be reported is that in May, 1915, the 
Arkansas supreme court declared unconstitutional the law provid- 
ing State aid to high schools, a law under which in four years the 
number of high schools had increased 150 per cent and the enroll- 
ment 126 per cent, with a corresponding improvement in standards 
of teachers and equipment. The decision is based on the facts that, 
first, the law provided for what the court considered “ discrimina- 
tory disbursement of the funds”—that is, it forbade aid for a 
school in any city or town having over 3,500 inhabitants; second, 
the law provided for the education, in the teacher-training depart- 
ments for the aided high schools, of students of any age, thus violat- 
ing the express provision of the constitution with respect to age 
limits. 
One other change of the law regarding State aid to high schools, 
that in California, is of sufficient general interest to be reported. 
Previous to 1915 the high schools of California were maintained very 
largely by district taxation. Communities might organize high-school 
districts, but they were expected to bear practically all of the expense 
of maintaining their high schools. The average cost per pupil, com- 
puted on the basis of average daily attendance in the high schools of 
the State, in 1914 was $121. Of this amount the State raised $15 and 
the high-school district $106. An investigation of the problem of 
financing secondary education in California revealed the fact that 
property assessed at $400,000,000—one-seventh of the total assessed 
valuation of the State—was not subject to a high-school district tax. 
Pupils living in territory outside of high-school districts were attend- 
ing high schools furnished and maintained by the high-school dis- 
tricts and paying only a small tax to meet tuition charges. The 
average rate of tax for high-school purposes levied on property in 
high-school districts was about 5 mills, while the average rate levied 
in territory outside of high-school districts for tuition of pupils 
attending from such territory was about seven-tenths of a mill. In 
other words, territory inside was paying at least seven times as heavy 
a rate as territory outside. The county high-school fund bill which 
was enacted by the legislature of 1915 provides that a general high- 
school tax shall be levied on all the property in each county sufficient 
to raise an amount computed at $60 per pupil in average daily attend- 
ance in the high schools of the county during the previous school 
year. The amount thus raised is apportioned among the various 
high schools of the county in such a manner as to equalize the burden 
of high-school taxation. First, $250 is apportioned to each school 
for each teacher actually employed, not exceeding four teachers for 
any school. The remainder is apportioned according to average 
daily attendance. The plan of apportioning a part of the fund on
-P-A-G-E-136
  116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the teacher basis was introduced to give the small high school a slight 
advantage. However, this advantage is not so great as to encourage 
the organization of weak high schools. It is provided that a high 
school which does not employ two teachers or more, after its first 
year, shall not share in county high-school funds. In providing 
extra apportionments for the first four teachers, the bill encourages 
the employment of at least that number of teachers in ‘each high 
school. Of the 264 public high schools in California only 26 employ 
fewer than four teachers. Most of the schools employing less than 
four teachers have been established for less than four years and will 
have the normal number of teachers when the full four-year course 
has been established. Under the county high-school fund bill the 
territory not included in any high-school district pays a tax twice as 
great, on an average, as it paid formerly when only a high-school 
tuition tax was levied on such territory. Taxation for high-school 
purposes is equalized under the plan of county taxation. Districts 
having large assessed valuations per pupil contribute something to 
the support of high schools established in less wealthy districts. The 
general effect of the law was to reduce high-school tax rates in more 
than half of the high-school districts of the State. The State and 
county now bear five-eighths of the cost of maintaining the high 
schools, leaving only three-eighths of the cost to be met by the 
district. 
Where the high-school privileges are not carried to the children 
provision is, in many places, made that they may secure instruction 
in established schools at no cost to themselves. A number of. the 
new school laws provide for the payment of tuition by the local dis- 
trict or by the State. Inasmuch as the amount provided is fre- 
quently less than the per capita cost of the school receiving outside 
pupils, there has been considerable effort, sometimes successful, to 
secure an equitable amendment to such laws. A recent amendment in 
New York permits, what was previously prohibited, that a parent 
may pay any tuition demanded by the receiving district in excess of 
the $20 provided by the State. Oregon has done away altogether 
with tuition for high-school pupils. A pupil living outside a dis- 
trict maintaining a standard four-year high school is permitted to 
select and attend a school anywhere in the State. At the end of the 
year the school is paid by a tax levied on all districts in the pupil’s 
county that do not maintain a standard high school. California 
provides. that a pupil living in a school district without a high school 
may attend any high school in the county without charge, and, more- 
over, that he is entitled to have his transportation paid up to $5 a 
month. The law provides that no tuition charge shall be made in any 
high-school district in California. Two or three counties in Florida— 
and the number, it is said, will increase—have done even better, hav-
-P-A-G-E-137
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 117 
ing made provision for aid other than tuition for a pupil who must go 
outside his own district to secure his secondary education. -Alachua 
County, for example, has agreed to pay $10 a month for the expenses 
of any such pupil. 
REORGANIZATION OF COURSES OF STUDY. 
Perhaps of even greater importance than the increase in the 
number of public secondary schools is the reorganization going on 
within the courses of study. Stimulated partly by criticism from 
without and partly by a need felt from within, those responsible for 
the various subjects have been active in formulating such statements 
of the purposes of each subject as will direct the presentation in 
the classroom. The movement, as reflected in educational journals, 
in discussions at conventions, and in textbooks themselves, is every- 
where toward an alignment with the established principles of 
psychology and the more progressive social theory. It may not seem 
invidious to mention specifically the tremendous effect of the National 
Council of Teachers of English and its official organ, The E'nglish 
Journal. The greatest single unifying force is undoubtedly the Com- 
mission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education. Since the pre- 
liminary report in Bulletin No. 41, 1913, of the United States Bureau 
of Education, the committees composing the commission have had 
frequent meetings, each committee formulating the principles that 
should govern the organization and presentation of the material in 
the several subjects of the program of studies. The reports of these 
committees were carefully studied and edited by the reviewing com- 
mittee during the Thanksgiving week of 1915, and a second general 
report is to be presented at the meeting of the Department of Super- 
intendence in Detroit February, 1916. 
As an instance of the kind of reorganization attempted, that pro- 
posed for the teaching of civics may be cited. Besides being in differ- 
ent ways exemplified in outlines printed for use in the local schools 
at Newark, Kansas City, and Wichita, it is fully expounded in Bul- 
letin, 1914, No. 23, of the Bureau of Education. This subject, as 
outlined in the bulletin, might really be called “The element of 
welfare,” because the work is organized with a view to leading the 
pupil to an appreciation of the importance of each of these so-called 
elements of welfare, to realize the dependence of the individual upon 
social agencies, to secure the right social attitude toward the prob- 
Jems involved, and then to study in detail certain of the agencies that 
have been set up either by the entire community or by groups of 
individuals for the purpose of securing these elements of welfare. 
Tn studying these agencies in detail, the aim is to secure such knowl- 
edge as will assist the citizen in meeting his responsibilities. The new
-P-A-G-E-138
  118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
type of civics differs from the old type in several important respects 
such as the following: 
1. It discusses the ends for which government exists before discuss- 
ing the machinery of government. This is important for the reasons 
stated on page 12 of the bulletin, namely: “ Many courses in civics 
fail because they fix attention upon the machinery of government 
rather than the elements of community welfare for which govern- 
ment exists; that is, they familiarize the pupil with the manipula- 
tion of social machinery without showing him the importance of the 
social ends for which this machinery should be used.” 
2. A distinction is made between the duties of the citizen and the 
duties of the official, as stated at the bottom of page 16 of the bul- 
letin; and this course in civics aims primarily to prepare for the 
duties of citizenship rather than to discuss in detail the duties of 
officials. 
3. The old-time civics concerned itself largely with the future 
responsibilities of the pupil, whereas this course in civics recognizes 
the importance of teaching not only the future responsibilities, but 
also the present responsibilities of the pupil for intelligent coopera- 
tion in community activities. The future responsibilities, however, 
are by no means neglected, because it is necessary to set up ideals of 
action that will be operative when the pupil becomes an adult. 
4. The old-time civics concerned itself only with the govern- 
mental agencies for community welfare, whereas this course in civics 
includes also those voluntary agencies that are established by certain 
members of the community, either for the promotion of the interests 
of a group of people or for the welfare of the entire community. 
This inclusion is, of course, in every way desirable, because the 
voluntary agencies blaze the way for the establishment of govern- 
mental agencies when the community is educated up to that point. 
There seems to be a distinct tendency to civics of this kind in the 
junior high school and in the first year of the more usual organization 
so that it may reach the large number of pupils eliminated before 
the senior year, when the subject is recommended for presentation 
by the committee of seven. Supplementing such civics outside the 
school are the Americanization day advocated by the Commissioner 
of Education and citizenship receptions proposed by Frederic Howe.t 
An effort was made in 1914 to ascertain by means of a questionnaire 
circulated from the Bureau of Education, the status of the social 
sciences in secondary schools. The data received were interpreted 
and tabulated by students working under Prof. Henry Johnson, of 
Teachers College, Columbia University, and a detailed report, which 
will be published in the History Teachers’ Magazine, was prepared 
by Edward A. Jesser. Returns were received from 62.5 per cent 
  
1See School and Society, 1: 880-1.
-P-A-G-E-139
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 119 
(7,197 of 11,515) of all the public secondary schools in the United 
States. Unfortunately there was no indication in the returns as to 
whether or not each school reporting had a full course of four years 
or one that was shorter; consequently, all the conclusions are not 
as satisfactory as might be desired. If it is kept in mind, however, 
that perhaps three-fourths of the schools reporting have courses four 
years in length, Table 1 will give a very good idea of the distribution 
of required and elective history work in American high schools. 
The excess in the number of replies over the number of schools re- 
porting is due to the fact that some principals of the larger schools 
very properly recorded the required and elective courses in history 
in each curriculum. The questions relative to the number of hours 
spent on history were so misunderstood that many of the answers 
had to be discarded ; however, the returns from the remaining schools 
are probably representative of conditions throughout the country. 
Thirty per cent of the schools reporting required for graduation all 
of the history that they offer, while 13 per cent make history entirely 
an elective subject. Perhaps the most interesting facts in the table 
relate to the increase or decrease of the amount of history offered. 
It will be noted that there is an increase of offerings in 43 per cent 
of all schools reporting, a decrease in 11.5 per cent, and no change in 
the remaining schools. The average increase or decrease of those 
reporting definitely was about a year’s work.

Table 2 shows the number of schools offering required and elective 
courses in the various social sciences during each academic year. The 
table is so clear that no detailed interpretation of it will here be 
presented. The only point in which the data are not worth their 
apparent value concerns the number of courses in civics. There was
-P-A-G-E-140
  120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
evidence in some of the returns that civics was reported as a sepa- 
rate subject, when, in fact, it was combined with American history. 
It may be credited, however, that civics is offered either alone or 
with American history as a prescribed study in more than half of 
the schools reporting and as an elective in another third of them. 
The distribution of civics over the four years of the course is note- 
worthy, as is the paucity of the once popular courses in general his- 
tory. The evident, though not overwhelming, distribution of the 
so-called “four blocks of history” manifests the influence of the 
report of the Committee of Seven.

As was implied in the paragraph concerning State aid, the — 
ment of secondary education involves far more than the offering of 
an increased number of academic courses. Not only is there a steady 
increase in the number of schools offering work of an immediately 
practical kind, but there is also a noticeable change in the character 
of such work. Manual training is changed in character, as in name, 
to industrial or vocational training, guided by such studies as the ex- 
cellent report to the Iowa State Teachers’ Association in 1914, and sup- 
plemented by “life career study,” as in San Jose, Cal., Decatur, Tl., 
and elsewhere. The plan of cooperative work, half in school and half 
in the shop, has spread from Cincinnati, Fitchburg, and Beverly to 
Dayton, New York, and other cities, besides being considered by 
many other places that are awaiting the results of the experiment. 
One new phase of high-school work that is developing with great 
rapidity is the training of elementary | school teachers.

SECONDARY EDUCATION. 121 
INFLUENCE OF STATE INSPECTORS OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
A factor responsible for much of the recent progress in secondary 
education, especially in the smaller schools, is the State inspector. In 
some instances he is sent out by the State university primarily to 
accredit schools, so that graduates may be admitted to the college by 
certificate; in others, by the State department of education, to 
ascertain if schools have earned subsidies that are available... From 
the circular of “Advice and Instruction to High School Visitors,” 
issued by Commissioner Sisson, of Idaho, the following items are 
taken: 
The first and chief aim of the visitation is to help the schools solve their 
problems in meeting the needs of the communities which they serve. The second 
aim is the standardizing of the schools. 
Note carefully the emphasis laid upon the elementary school. Do not encour- 
age any policy that would sacrifice the elementary school in order to build up a 
high school. 
Definite and specific criticism in a friendly spirit will almost invariably be 
received with appreciaton. One should remember that an unfavorable judgment 
sometimes falls with serious force upon a teacher or superintendent, and that an 
American community is exceedingly sensitive as to its schools. 
It is to the general credit of these inspectors that they have inter- 
preted their duties in such a way as to afford the largest amount of 
assistance to schools in their development. Besides giving advice to 
each school as they visit it, they have, among other things, been in- 
strumental in promoting conferences of high-school principals and 
teachers and State-wide contests of high-school pupils. The 1914 
Mllinois High School Conference issued a report of 328-pages outlining 
what was done in the general sessions and in the meetings of the 
15 permanently organized departments, one of which has for some 
years published a monthly magazine, “The Bulletin of the Ilinois 
Association of Teachers of English.” It is of general interest that an 
increasing number of the delegates to the Illinois conference have 
their expenses paid wholly or in part by their respective school 
boards. In 1914, 51 per cent of the school boards represented in this 
way manifested their appreciation of the professional spirit of the 
teachers. California has gone even further, having passed a law 
empowering the State board of education to call an annual convention 
of high-school principals or to divide the State into four districts 
and call in each of such districts a convention of the principals. 
The law requires attendance by each principal and the payment of his 
traveling expenses by the district. The State-wide contests of pupils

derson presents the purposes, the means of appointment and control, a list of the duties, 
and a digest of the State systems of high-school inspectors ; in School and Society, 2 : 402-8, 
Prof. George R. Twiss explains the high-school inspection in Ohio under the new State 
laws; and in the report of the General Education Board, 1914, are detailed statements of 
what the inspectors in the Southern States have done. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
in athletics, debating, or mastery of academic subjects are not infre- 
quently coincident with the conference of high-school teachers. In 
Georgia one-third of all the high-school pupils of the State are 
reported to have participated in some form-of the preliminary con- 
tests. The North Carolina Debating League and the Interscholastic 
' Public-Speaking League of California have been unusually well 
organized and successful. 
The high-school inspectors have almost from the first issued sug- 
gestive curricula, which have been of material influence in determin- 
ing what the secondary schools taught. Recently the curricula have 
been more carefully planned and justified; a 1915 bulletin from 
the University of Texas, for instance, first gives the basic principles 
on which curricula should be erected and then offers several examples 
that are adapted for schools of different size and kind. In addition, 
the inspectors are each year issuing more and more detailed and valu- 
able courses of study for the individual subjects. A considerable 
number of reports for 1914-15 contain specific minimum require- 
ments for high schools desiring standard classification. In Texas, 
where three classes of high schools are recognized, the minimum 
requirements for the first class are as follows: 
(1) Not fewer than three teachers who hold first grade or higher grade State 
certificates, and who give their entire time to high-school work; that is, work 
above the seventh grade. 
(2) A public school term of at least eight scholastic months. 
(3) A course of study which shall be the equivalent of the one outlined by 
the State department of education for high schools of the first class; that is, a 
course in which at least 18 units of work shall be required for graduation. A 
unit of work, as defined by this department, represents five recitations per 
week in a subject, each recitation being 35 to 40 minutes long, and the subject 
being pursued for a period of at least 36 weeks. 
(4) Recitation periods of from 35 to 40 minutes in length for high-school 
subjects. The recitation periods for the subjects of agriculture, manual train- 
ing, and domestic economy, being less frequent, may be 80 or 90 minutes in 
length. 
(5) Laboratory apparatus sufficient to offer at least three units in high-school 
science, one of the sciences being physics. 
(6) The State department of education also takes into consideration the play- 
ground, library, and building facilities, as well as the provisions that are made 
for instruction in the primary and intermediate grades. 
Usually, as in the Texas circular, there is added a detailed list of 
desirable laboratory apparatus and shop equipment, with the price 
of each article added. Missouri adds to such a list of apparatus an 
extended recommendation as to the best reference books, both for 
general use and for supplementing the textbooks in each subject. 
While standardizing schools, those in authority are seeing to it 
that the qualifications for teachers are raised. Sometimes the quali- 
fications are determined by statute, as in California and Florida;
-P-A-G-E-143
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 123 
again by the State department of education or others to whom the 
power has been delegated, as in Nebraska and Kentucky. In Cali- 
fornia the statute has for some years required for the high-school 
certificate a year of postgraduate study; but as there developed a 
tendency for candidates to center the work of the postgraduate year 
about one academic subject, the new law requires, among other things, 
that each candidate must have completed in graduate or under- 
graduate standing, or the two combined, not less than 15 units 
(semester hours) of work in courses listed in the department of edu- 
cation in the institution in which the graduate work is completed, or 
courses in other departments of that or other institutions accepted as 
preparation by the department of education. Minnesota likewise has 
amended its law so as to require of new candidates and even of all 
others who have taught less than 18 months a year of special prepara- 
tion and training for teaching. Kentucky in 1914 for the first time 
gave the State board of education the right to fix the qualifications of 
teachers for public high schools; and numerous State superintendents 
or inspectors have exercised their right, directly or indirectly con- 
ferred, to specify definitely qualifications that high-school teachers 
shall have. 
PROVISIONS FOR ECONOMY OF TIME. 
As there has come a better understanding of individual differences 
in children, both in abilities and in life purposes, more and better 
provisions are made by the schools to care for them and thus to effect 
an economy of time in education. Differentiated courses, the junior 
high school, summer schools, sex segregation in classes, and other 
means are all based on a recognition of such differences. No extensive 
data have been secured this year as to the number of junior high 
schools established, but it is known that a number of cities—e. g., 
Rochester, N. Y.; Montclair and East Orange, N. J.; Richmond, Va.; 
and Cleveland, Ohio—have realized their declared purpose and es- 
tablished one or more. There is a distinct tendency in Minnesota to- 
ward organizing high schools on the junior-senior plan, though 
Superintendent Schultz reports that no definite standards have yet 
been adopted; the State board of education of North Dakota has 
recommended that “high schools so far as possible organize on the 
six-and-six plan”; many of the rural high schools in Nebraska are 
essentially junior schools; and in Pennsylvania Inspector Koch re- 
ports that at least a dozen high schools have reorganized on the basis 
of a six years’ course. Inspector Wheelock, of New York, writes 
that— 
the junior high-school movement is just beginning to receive marked attention 
in the State. It is a fact not generally appreciated that the New York State 
elementary course has for many years provided definitely for a differentiation
-P-A-G-E-144
  124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
beginning at the seventh year; that while most New York schools have -not 
definitely organized with reference to this particular plan, the number of 
individual cases in which the differentiation has actually occurred is consider- 
able. During the past year definite action looking toward the establishment 
of organized junior schools has been taken in Rochester, Solvay, Dansville, 
Hllenviile, Hempstead, and perhaps some other places. 
Of the three plans proposed by Prof. Bobbitt in the report of the 
survey of San Antonio for future care of the secondary school popu- 
lation, one requires the establishment of “a half-dozen intermediate 
schools scattered judiciously over the city, each containing the sev- 
enth, eighth, and a portion, at least, of the ninth grades.” This 
plan seems to receive more approval than the others. In the Oakland 
survey Prof. Cubberley writes: 
As the elementary school buildings become more and more crowded and the 
high-school attendance increases, the best arrangement from an educational 
point of view, as well as the most economical plan from a school building 
point of view, will be to build five or six or possibly more new buildings, at 
central locations, designed especially for junior high-school work. 
Although California was the first State to establish the interme- 
diate school, it has only recently given definite legal recognition to 
this type of school. The constitution of the State provides a fund 
for secondary schools distinct from the fund for elementary schools. 
This distinction of funds frequently stood in the way of the organi- 
‘zation of intermediate schools, which enroll pupils of both elementary 
and secondary grades. Only in cities where the elementary and 
high-school districts were coterminous could the intermediate school 
be established. The legislature of 1915 passed an act legalizing the 
organization of intermediate schools and removing the difficulty 
caused by the separation of funds. The intermediate-school grades 
“are made a part of the secondary school, and a transfer of the money 
from the elementary-school fund to the secondary-school fund to 
pay for the tuition of pupils in the first two grades of the inter- 
mediate school is provided for. It is also provided that by a majority 
vote of electors union high-school districts, consisting of several ele- 
mentary school districts, may organize intermediate-school courses 
and admit thereto pupils who have completed the sixth grade. The 
legislature also provided that normal-school graduates who have 
taken one year of college work, or holders of elementary certificates 
granted upon examination who have taken two years of college 
work, under regulations prescribed by the State board of education, 
may be granted permits to teach in any grade of the intermediate 
school. In some of the intermediate schools all teachers have been 
required to hold high-school certificates. This requirement has re- 
sulted in the displacement of very capable teachers of the seventh 
and eighth grade work who held only elementary-school certificates. 
This law will enable ambitious teachers holding elementary-school
-P-A-G-E-145
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 125 
certificates to qualify for intermediate-school work, thus removing 
a cause for much ill feeling among teachers. The State board of 
education has adopted regulations requiring that normal-school grad- 
uates who are candidates for the intermediate-school teaching permit 
shall take at least 20 semester hours of college work in two subjects, 
and holders of elementary-school certificates granted on examina- 
tion shall take at least 10 semester hours of pedagogy and 30 semester 
hours of college work in three subjects. The subjects in which the 
prescribed college work must be done are as follows: French, English, 
German, Spanish, Latin, history, mathematics, physical science, 
biological science. 
Vermont, too, in 1915, passed an act authorizing the establishment 
of junior high schools. From it the following sections are quoted: 
Section 1. Classification of junior and senior high schools—The State board 
of education may, with the approval of the school directors in the towns con- 
cerned, divide the secondary schools of the State, now existing or hereafter to 
be established, into two classes: (a@) Junior high schools, having a four-year 
eourse; and (0) senior high schools, having a six-year course. 
Sec. 4. Courses—Each junior high school shall have a four-year course, 
fiexible in character, designed for the instruction of pupils who have completed 
an elementary course of not less than six years, and suitable to the number 
and needs of local pupils; and the State board of education shall arrange for a 
course of study, including vocational opportunities appropriate to the needs ‘of 
the pupils in the several communities. In any town where a junior high school 
is established the State board of education shall make the necessary readjust- 
ments of the course of study in the elementary schools. 
Sec. 8. Vocational education.—Junior high schools shall include, in accord- 
ance with such directions and regulations as to courses, teachers, and equipment 
as the State board of education may prescribe, within their courses of study 
a vocational course in one or more of the following subjects: Agriculture, 
manual arts, commercial subjects, or domestic science, appropriate to the needs 
and environment of the particular school. 
In his sixteenth annual report Supt. W. H. Maxwell, regretting 
the fact that our children “are losing at least two years in the prepa- 
ration for life as compared with their European contemporaries,” 
states three causes for this loss: That “the so-called secondary 
studies are commenced much earlier for those who take them in 
Germany “and France than in America”; that “the German and 
French boy are at school more hours in the day and more weeks in 
the year than the American boy”; and that “the American parent 
is unwilling to allow his children to work hard while they are in 
school.” Because of the condition as he sees it, Dr. Maxwell proposes 
“three effective ways” of saving time: An extension of the school 
day in grades 7 through 12 from five to six hours a day, the added 
time being mainly for recreation; an increase in the same grades of 
the school year to 220 days; opportunity for a more rapid advance 
for those pupils who have demonstrated in the first six grades un- 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
  126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
usual ability along academic lines. Although the school day has been 
extended in many schools—e. g., the Los Angeles Technical High 
School and the Springfield (Mass.) High School of Commerce—and 
provision is made in many places by various devices for accelerating 
the progress of the more able pupils, an experiment has been under- 
taken in three schools of New York City to see what can be done for 
some 600 pupils who have completed the sixth grade with credit. 
One group of 200 is housed in the Speyer School of Teachers Col- 
lege, which will participate in the experiment. 
Increase in the length of the school year is opposed generally 
because of the cost and because of a fear that the confinement will 
injure the health of the children. There is rapid growth, how- 
ever, in the movement to hold summer sessions of high schools. 
Most of the summer sessions in public schools have been inaugu- 
rated by private or semipublic enterprise, primarily to afford op- 
portunity for industrial work, supervised play, and coaching for 
children backward in their books. But as the opportunity has been 
extended into the secondary grades, and not infrequently taken 
over by the city, a large element in the enrollment has been made 
up of ambitious pupils desirous of advancing more rapidly than is 
possible in regular session. Testimony to this effect is general. To 
an inquiry concerning summer schools sent in 1914 by Charles Otter- 
man to 104 cities, 71 replies were received; of these 51 stated that 
they offer in the summer academic work for high-school pupils. 
Thirty-four of these summer high schools were established in 1913. 
That the movement may develop most effectively a careful study 
should be made of what has already been done. : 
Indicative of what may be accomplished by a longer school day and 
year is the work at the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society Or- 
phan Asylum, near Pleasantville, N. Y. ‘There the work is so 
organized by the superintendent, Dr. L. B. Bernstein, that in each 
year there are, exclusive of holidays and examination periods, 225 
school days divided into three terms. Thus the curriculum which 
in public schools requires 12 years is completed in 8, though a 
ninth is ordinarily added for “mental digestion” and also for voca- 
tional specialization. In the summer the children for six weeks 
do only half work, omitting the academic and the industrial exer- 
cises for periods of three weeks each. In secondary education, 
which consumes 10 terms of 75 full school days, each of the 5 school 
days in the week has five 45-minute periods for academic instruc- 
tion and three additional periods for industrial or vocational work. 
In this department are about 140 boys and girls. The curricula are 
modeled after the New York syllabus, and have been approved by 
the board of regents. The question very naturally arises as to the 
ability of children to endure physically such continuous work and
-P-A-G-E-147
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 127 
to assimilate mentally instruction usually offered to pupils some- 
what older. Although there have been’ no exact measurements of 
the results, the very careful medical records confirm the impression 
of visual inspection, that the children are in excellent physical con- 
dition; and the two municipal colleges of New York—the College 
of the City of New York and Hunter College—give full academic 
credit to the graduates of the high-school department. Moreover, 
teachers in charge of English, French, German, and mathematics 
in the New York city high schools have been repeatedly called to 
Pleasantville to inspect and criticize the work there. According to 
the superintendent’s report, they have given “ gratifying assurances 
that on the whole the work compares favorably with the corre- 
sponding terms in our public high schools, and this in spite of the 
fact that the children are from two to three years younger.” In the 
first four terms of the secondary school, as well as in the elementary 
grades, the industrial work is prevocational, about one-fourth of it 
being repair work; after that each student specializes in some trade. 
Both boys and girls take home-craft courses, which they apply 
practically in the 17 cottages. 
W. H. Hand, high-school inspector for South Carolina, continues 
the campaign begun several years ago to decrease elimination in high 
schools. In his annual report issued January, 1915, he presents a 
table showing the persistence of boys and girls in each high school 
in the State during the three-year period beginning 1911-12, con- 
cluding with a brief statement of the causes of elimination: 
In different communities these wide differences in holding the pupil in the 
high school are traceable to various causes, but wherever the falling off is 
marked the community should investigate the conditions and locate the trouble. 
It may be due to an inadequate teaching force or to some teacher or teachers 
lacking in the ability to inspire pupils, or to a course of study honeycombed 
with dry rot, or to the apathy of parents, or to the raids of the college drum- 
mers, or to the commercial spirit in young America. Whatever it is ought to 
be discovered and made known to the community. 
Most of these causes he discusses at length, particularly the prac- 
tice of some colleges to receive as freshmen high-school pupils who 
had not completed their secondary education. After printing de- 
tailed tables of high-school and college registration, which manifest 
“one of the most abnormal educational situations conceivable—a 
total regular academic college enrollment of over 40 per cent of the 
total secondary school enrollment, both public and private,” Mr. 
Hand indicates with convincingly specific data each college that has 
failed to maintain its professed standard. The purpose of his cam- 
paign is revealed in his statement that “the colleges do not seem to 
realize that they are yet in the high-school business and that they 
are retarding the growth of their own feeders.” Such a situation,
-P-A-G-E-148
  128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
in South Carolina or in other States, needs only to be seen clearly and 
continuously to insure a betterment. At the request of the Associa- 
tion of Virginia Colleges, the State Department of Education has 
published the names of all freshmen in the “ Standard Colleges” of 
the State, with detailed facts of subjects offered for admission. 
Only three other tendencies may be briefly noted: Those toward 
a divided period for study and recitation, toward sex segregation in 
classes of the same subject, and toward social guidance. The first 
innovation has two general forms—that used by Principal Wiener, of 
Newark, N. J., who lengthened his periods to 60 minutes and gave 
his teachers the option of using either half or even all of a period, 
as the daily situation demanded, for supervised study; and that 
used by Principal Brown, of Joliet, Ill., who at first gave to such 
teachers as desired it and later to practically all of his staff a full 
period immediately following the recitation for supervising study. 
No complete data as to the number of schools adopting the plan has 
been sought, but news items are continually noted that indicate its 
rapid spread. Some of the schools besides Newark and Joliet re- 
ported as using one of the plans, usually the divided period, are the 
Wisconsin High School, at Madison; the High School of Commerce, 
Springfield, Mass.; and high schools at Topeka and Kansas City, 
Kans., Reading and Pottstown, Pa., Richmond, Ind.; Pasadena and 
“ several other places in California.” An extended article on “ Pres- 
ent Tendencies in Supervised Study” was recently presented by 
Prof. Hall-Quest, in Educational Administration and Supervision, 
volume 1, pages 239-256. 
Since the experiment by Principal Armstrong, of the Englewood 
High School, Chicago, several years ago, there has been a steady 
interest concerning the matter of sex segregation within classes of 
the same subjects. Complaint is frequently heard that in art sub- 
jects a readier and fuller response by girls in mixed classes tends to 
cause the boys first to restrain themselves and finally to lose interest; 
that in the sciences the larger experience of most boys in the physical 
world enables them to outstrip the girls in recitation, however stu- 
dious the latter may be; and that girls naturally have little aptitude, 
and so are ordinarily a drag on the classes in algebra and geometry. 
But for administrative reasons the complaints have seldom resulted 
in carefully prepared and measured experiments, which should defi- 
nitely decide which policy is the more profitable. The industrial 
work by its very nature causes sex segregation, though occasionally 
even a metropolitan school is found that still gives boys and girls 
alike only “exercises” in wood, and increasingly, as is evidenced by 
published programs of study and the character of new textbooks, 
there is differentiation for sex in the allied sciences. There is urgent 
need for more studies like that by Mr. Minnick (School Review,
-P-A-G-E-149
  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 129 
23: 78-84), which goes far toward discrediting the complaint that 
mathematics is peculiarly unadapted to the minds of girls. Prin- 
cipal Cole, of the Broadway High School, Seattle, reports (School 
Review, 23: 550-554) that in 1914-15 he segregated by sex the pupils 
in 244 of the 287 classes in the school, and that he kept a record par- 
ticularly of the number of pupils receiving the higher grades as 
compared with the preceding years when the classes were mixed. At 
the end of the year, as a result of experience with both segregated 
and mixed classes, 53 of the teachers expressed their opinion regard- 
ing the experiment—24 were in favor of segregation, 17 were op- 
posed, and 12 saw no beneficial results from it. After considering 
both the data and the opinions expressed, Supt. Cooper recom- 
mended that the segregation be continued in all sciences and in 
mathematics, in the first year of history, and in the first two years of 
English; and that there be no segregation in the commercial work 
and in foreign languages. 
Hardly any problem has given conscientious and intelligent school- 
men more concern than that of the social guidance of pupils, a prob- 
lem that has been intensified by the increasing size of high schools 
and the tendency because of numerous electives and departmental 
teaching for natural personal relations between teachers and pupils 
to be made difficult and in many cases actually impossible. The effort 
to supply the need through a home-room teacher, which is most 
often made, is successful only as such a teacher by chance has the 
talent and the time for the required additional and arduous work. 
Strangely enough, provision is more often made for the social over- 
sight of the girls than of the boys. In one State in the Rocky Moun- 
tain section the home-room teachers are supplemented by a “ matron,” 
whose duties almost entirely concern the physical comfort of the 
girls during school hours. Recently, as a decided advance over 
either plan, several schools have appointed as adviser a woman 
especially trained and competent for a larger type of'work. In Har- 
risburg, Pa., there is an adviser who gives all of her time to looking 
after the interests of the girls. It is her duty to visit the homes; to 
investigate the cause of absences; to encourage and aid pupils in re- 
maining in school, improving their work, and making up failures; to 
give vocational guidance and personal counsel when needed. In the 
Broadway High School, Seattle, Wash., one of the teachers, who is 
trained in the social sciences, has general charge of the work, which 
pertains especially to organizing and directing other teacher-advisers 
who endeavor to get personally in touch with the entering girls and to 
see that they actively participate in the social life of the school. In 
the Washington Irving High School, New York City, so far as possi- 
ble the girls are kept in the same class groups throughout their course, 
12084°—xp 1915—vor 1——9
-P-A-G-E-150
  130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
in order that they may develop friendships, which otherwise would be 
extremely difficult in a school of 6,000 pupils. The social work of the 
La Salle-Peru (Iil.) Township High School is probably not surpassed 
anywhere elsg in the United States. Annexed to the academic high 
school are buildings for manual training and domestic science, for a 
hygienic institute, and for a social center.. An extended athletic field 
and playground are now being constructed. All of the equipment is 
used for many and varied activities that extend throughout the year 
both for students of the high school and for citizens of the com- 
munity. 
THE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SURVEYS." 
In the report of a survey of the San Antonio school system Prof. 
J. F. Bobbitt lays commendable emphasis on the need of supervision 
of instruction in the high school, declaring that the principal should 
during school hours make this his prime duty. And finally he oe 
sents what he considers an “index of community valuations” in 
various tables? which, at some sacrifice of clearness, are condensed

  GENERAL TENDENCIES, 
The academic year just closed has been in several important 
respects noteworthy in the field of higher education. Certain con- 
structive movements already under way have gained added mo- 
mentum. The times have been full of significant signs and por- 
tents. Statistical reports show in general a steady and nornial 
growth in enrollment with exceptional increases only in a few areas 
and in the newer professional courses,' but the efforts of college and 
university officials and of the governing bodies behind them have 
apparently been directed less toward expansion than toward the 
ordering and fortifying of territory already won. The conviction 
that both higher and secondary education must be made more sound 
and serious has been reiterated in educational gatherings through- 
out the country and has found reflection in numerous intensive studies 
of college and university administration and standards. On several 
occasions the belief has risen to expression that recent international 
happenings have placed an added responsibility upon American edu- 
cation and must act as a potent stimulus to American scholarship. 
As specific manifestations of these larger tendencies and motives 
the following may be mentioned: The organization and management 
of State-supported institutions have been critically investigated at 
the behest of legislatures or State educational authorities in Ore- 
gon, Washington, and Wisconsin. Other investigations have been 
ordered and are in progress in Iowa and North Dakota. The legis-   
1In view of the earlier publication of the Annual Report this year it has been impos- 
sible to summarize these figures. 
131
-P-A-G-E-152
  
132 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
latures of several other States, notably Montana, Minnesota, Idaho, 
and Nebraska, have made more or less searching inquiries into the 
administrative methods of the State higher institutions. The Legis- 
lature of Massachusetts had under consideration a plan for the estab- 
lishment of a State university. The Legislature of Vermont reor- 
ganized the educational system of the State in response to the report 
of its survey commission. Legislative measures relative to State 
institutions, passed or proposed, dealt with forms of control, financial 
management, and even with courses and scholastic requirements. In 
some quarters this legislative activity has been regarded as an un- 
warranted and dangerous intrusion into fields which should be re- 
served to expert regulation. Yet in spite of a few failures to draw 
the line between matters which are the legitimate concern of the 
appropriating body and those which are the province of the expert, 
and in spite of some superficial and temporary hostility, this activity 
has on the whole revealed a sincere friendliness to the cause of higher 
education and a surprisingly unanimous desire to give it sound and 
generous support. 
Many of the smaller colleges and institutions in the educationally 
backward sections have raised their admission requirements to 14 
units, an amount of precollegiate training which is fast coming to 
national recognition as the minimum standard. But along with the 
common acceptance of the principle that a certain definite period of 
preliminary schooling is an essential prerequisite to a college course 
there is a growing distrust of the value of purely quantitative meas- 
ures of intellectual attainment. This is evidenced not only in the 
recent recommendations of the National Conference Committee on 
Standards of Colleges and Secondary Schools but also in the action 
of the College Entrance Examination Board and of several institu- 
tions looking toward the establishment of more effective qualitative 
tests. In line with this tendency has been the recognition by certain 
college officials of the desirability of offering special encouragements 
and providing special facilities during the college course itself for 
highly gifted students. The sentiment of many is apparently ex- 
pressed in the bold demand of President Hyde, of Bowdoin, that 
colleges should run a “few limited trains with Pullman cars only” 
for the benefit of the exceptional students. : 
The year has seen the further solidifying of higher educational 
interests through the formation of three important associations, one 
of which has already exerted nation-wide influence upon professional 
“standards. These are the Association of Urban Universities, the 
Association of American Colleges, and the American Association of 
University Professors. 
The more important of the movements and happenings here sum- 
marized are accorded detailed treatment in the following paragraphs.
-P-A-G-E-153
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 133 
SURVEYS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION. 
The outstanding events in the field of higher education during the 
“year 1914-15 center around university surveys. Surveys, especially 
of public educational institutions, are becoming increasingly fre- 
quent. The bureau of education has record of more than 50 carried 
on within the past few years.1 Higher institutions long lay beyond 
the rising tide of the survey movement, but the considerable num- 
ber of university surveys completed within the past two years, or 
already projected for the immediate future, shows that the current 
has at last reached, these institutions. As might be expected, the 
majority of universities and colleges already surveyed or shortly to 
be surveyed are controlled by the State. Such institutions are more 
directly subject to the popular will and consequently respond more 
quickly to the urge of popular educational movements. 
The survey movement as affecting colleges and universities has 
had several highly gratifying results. In the first place, it has called 
attention to those processes in college and university administration 
which may be accurately measured and recorded, those educational 
results which may be statistically demonstrated, those particular 
needs which, on the basis of precise records, may be definitely fore- 
cast. There is not yet, to be sure, an accepted technique for the uni- 
versity survey. No two surveys have sought exactly the same ends 
or used the same methods. Yet, in spite of this variation and of the 
uncertainties which have thus far characterized educational stand- 
ards of measurement, the university surveys are feeling their way to- 
ward objective criteria, whereby university administration may be 
judged, and toward a technique of educational investigation. Di- 
verse as they are, they have already established certain points of 
agreement. In other words, a science of university administration is 
slowly being worked out, and in the process the survey is proving 
itself a very useful agent. 
Still more encouraging for the future of State universities is the 
fact that State legislatures have in several instances either ordered or 
inspired surveys with the expressed intention of basing legislation 
relating to the institutions concerned upon the findings of survey 
commissions. This is another manifestation of that growing con- 
viction on the part of the people that, since the schools are their 
own, it is their duty to exact a strict accounting of the way in which 
education has been managed, to the end that the enormous sums of 
public money invested may bring the most profitable return. While 
admitting that the legislation subsequently passed in at least one 
important case is potentially dangerous to higher education in the

134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
State, and that some other post-survey educational bills have been 
disappointing, the principle that careful, impartial investigation _ 
should precede legislative action is beyond cavil. If the principle 
becomes generally recognized State institutions will be freed from” 
the ever-present menace of the capricious and hasty determination of 
questions vital to their welfare and to the educational policies of a 
State. Because of this intimate causal relation between certain re- 
cent surveys and legislation, it is appropriate to treat these two topics 
in a single division of the present chapter. 
THE REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION IN VERMONT. 
The study of education in Vermont made by the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching, at the request of the commis- 
sion appointed by the Vermont legislature of 1912 to inquire into the 
educational system of the State, was briefly summarized in the pre- 
- vious report of the Commissioner of Education (p.170 et seq.). The 
commission, which reported to the 1914 legislature, adopted without 
substantial change the principal recommendations made by the Car- 
negie Foundation. The report dealt with the whole educational sys- 
tem of Vermont. Only those recommendations relating to general 
educational organization and to State aid for higher education are 
discussed in the present chapter.t 
With regard to administration, the commission recommends— 
that the existing board of education be so reorganized as to provide a board 
of five members appointed by the governor, one member for the term of five 
years, one for the term of four years, one for the term of three years, one for 
the term of two years, and one for the term of one year, and at the expiration 
of a term the term of office should be five years; * * * that the board 
shall be given plenary administrative powers within the law over the whole 
educational system and organization of the State, and be charged definitely with 
the responsibility of providing, through a commissioner of education and at 
least two deputies, for the effective administration of the educational policy 
of the State. 
The following paragraph summarizes its recommendations as to 
higher education: 
All institutions of higher learning within the State are private institutions 
and not entitled of right to State aid. * * * The commission finds that 
the State in proportion to its property valuation has been making appropria- 
tions to higher education far beyond those made by any other of the New 
England States or by the State of New York; * * * and that in so dis- 
continuing State aid to higher education the State is in no way laying itself 
open to a charge of failure of duty to its youth; and that a continuance of 
such appropriations in present amount would be a gross neglect of such duty 
under the constitution, 
A comprehensive bill was introduced in the legislature embodying 
substantially all the commission’s recommendations, but was not

passed. The measures finally carried differed in several important 
respects. The commission’s recommendations relating to general 
agencies for administration, however, were, in the main, ratified by 
legislation. An act was passed creating a State board of education 
consisting of five persons to be appointed by the governor, each mem- 
ber to hold office for five years. The board is enjoined to employ a 
skilled executive officer to be called the commissioner of education, 
to fix his salary, and through the commissioner of education and his 
assistants to have general charge of the entire public educational 
system of the State. Its control of higher education extends to the 
supervision of the expenditure of all State money expended under 
the provisions of the act creating the board, the inspection of all 
institutions in which or by which such money is used, and the prep- 
aration of a budget for these expenditures. The commissioner of 
education is to be appointed by the board for an indefinite term and 
to be subject to removal only upon a majority vote of the entire 
board. He must be a person of special training and experience in 
educational work, and is to act as the secretary of the board. Ver- 
mont is therefore to be added to the list of States that have now 
placed all public educational activities of the State under strong cen- 
tral direction. In the person of the commissioner the act provides 
for an official with large powers and opportunities for constructive 
“leadership and corresponding responsibilities. 
The State in effect repudiated the commission’s recommendations 
with regard to subsidizing higher institutions. Special acts were 
passed making the same appropriations to Middlebury College and 
Norwich University as were made in the preceding biennium. The 
appropriation for the University of Vermont was increased by the 
addition of $6,500, for the use of the college of medicine. The prin- 
ciple of partial support by the State of privately endowed institu- 
tions is thus reaffirmed, contrary to the arguments presented in the 
report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching.* 
SURVEY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
Mention was also-made in the last annual report of the survey of 
the University of Wisconsin, which was undertaken in the spring 
of 1914 by the State board of public affairs, The board engaged W. 
H. Allen and KE. C. Branson as investigators. Detailed studies of 
numerous phases of the university work, organization, and manage- 
ment were made and the findings reported to the board of public 
affairs, which made its report to the legislature on December 29, 
1914,

  136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The published report is a volume of 957 pages (not including the 
table of contents), more than 800 of which are in fine print. One 
hundred and forty-two of these pages are devoted to the official re- 
port of the State board of public affairs.. The remainder contains 
the reports of the investigators (called directors of the survey) to 
the board and the comment of the university thereon. Mr. Bran- 
son’s report relates exclusively to the college of agriculture. The 
section devoted to it and the university’s comment is 26 pages long. 
Some 680 pages are occupied by Mr. Allen’s report and the uni- 
versity comment. The Allen report begins with a 39-page summary 
outlining the purpose and the method of the survey, discussing the 
general function of the university in its relation to the State and 
Nation, pointing out what are, in the surveyor’s opinion, its major 
qualities and defects, and finally suggesting an answer to each of the 
12 questions which the survey set before it at the beginning of its 
work! This summary is followed by a general comment by the uni- 
versity, 22 pages in length, on the methods of Dr. Allen and the 
principal points of agreement and disagreement between him and 
the university officers. The section closes with the following para- 
graphs: 
The university * * * submits the following requests: 
1. It formally requests that the board of public affairs do not accept the Allen 
report and exhibits in whole or in part. : 
The university is anxious that this request should not be misunderstood. It 
makes no categorical denial of all Dr. Allen’s criticisms. Some of the criti- 
cisms are just and the matters should be corrected; some are half true and 
ought to be considered, but the good recommendations are not seldom mingled 
with others whose only support is evidence that is partial or even warped. 
The sound criticisms are so mingled with incorrect statements, half truths, 
improper insinuations, and unworthy innuendoes that no exhibit ought to be 
accepted in the lump. 
The board of public affairs ought not to take any account or draw any con- 
clusions from the report or exhibits without a careful, independent review of 
the evidence for and against the Allen recommendations. 
2, The university also asks that the board of public affairs, in case it accepts 
any part of the Allen report or exhibits, accept also in the same manner and 
degree the comment or reply which the university may make to the part in 
question, This request does not relate to any statements or recommendations 
of Dr. Allen which the board may make its own. 
8. The university further asks that if any part of the Allen report’ or ex- 
hibits is ordered printed (though not accepted by the board) the university 
may have the time necessary to prepare an adequate reply, and that this reply 
also be printed, section by section, along with the Allen material. 
The compliance of the board with this last request apparently ac- 
counts in large measure for the formidable size of the printed report. 
Following the summary are 36 “ exhibits,” some of which are divided 
into several subsections. Accompanying every exhibit and nearly all   
2 See Rep. of Commis. of Ed., 1914, vol. 1, pp. 173, 174.
-P-A-G-E-157
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 187 
subsections are specific comments by the university. The 36 “ex- 
hibits” deal with questions of varying degrees of importance from 
the administrative point of view. Among those of the greatest in- 
terest to other institutions, discussion of which might be of general 
value if the method used were less controversial, are the following: 
1. Supervision of instruction. 2. Effects of research upon teaching 
efficiency. 3. Different bases for grading students’ work now used 
by faculty members. 4. University extension. 5. Effect of social 
diversion on students’ ability to do class work, as reported by 351 
faculty members. 6. Faculty machinery for investigating and gov- 
erning. 7. Telling the Wisconsin public in 1914 “what our univer- 
sity does for us.” 8. The university budget. 9. Per capita cost and 
cost of research. ’ 
. The last exhibit is entitled “ Next steps suggested that do not re- 
quire legislation,” and contains 339 suggestions. The university’s 
comment on this “exhibit ” estimates that— 
‘The outcome of the Allen survey is an accumulation of some 1,200 to 1,500 
or more “suggestions ” which are “next steps” for the university; * ‘* * 
suggestions in such number and variety * * * may serve as hints or warn- 
ings to a competent administrator, but they are not and can not constitute a 
program. 
The report of the board of public affairs itself, which opens the 
volume and constitutes the official statement to the legislature, while 
making use of the findings of the investigators and the discussion 
thereof by the university, wisely avoids wholesale indorsement of 
the views or recommendations of either party. It begins with an in- 
troductory statement relating the history of the university and sum- 
marizes the criticisms of the institution which have lately had cur- 
rency in the State. These are said to be: 
That extravagance and lax business methods have characterized the adminis- 
tration of the university. 
That the university is in politics. 
That the members of the faculty are sacrificing instructional work to write 
books, to lecture, and to do other outside work for pay. 
That under the cloak of research faculty members are shirking classroom 
work and devoting much time to other pursuits. 
That students are deprived of personal contact with the strong minds of the 
faculty and that instruction is left to men of less experience. 
That instruction is not adequately supervised by deans and heads of depart- 
ments. 
That the university is a school for rich men’s sons, : 
That it is educating students from other States at the expense of the tax- 
payers of Wisconsin. 
That it dominates the high schools of the State to the detriment of education 
in local communities. 
That the university is receiving a larger portion of the moneys expended by 
the State for educational purposes than is justified by the number availing 
themselves of university instruction.

  1388 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The body of the report consists of three sections: General and edu- 
cational policies, land and buildings, business organization. The 
last two are chiefly descriptive, dealing with the physical and finan- 
cial resources of the university and its business methods and accom- 
panied by statistical tables, together with exhibits of blank forms, 
records, etc. The first section, on general and educational policies, 
contains what both the general public and the legislature will regard 
as the pith of the report. Here the board takes up the criticisms 
of the university which led to the investigation (finding all of them 
to be either exaggerated or unfounded), discusses a few questions of 
vital import raised by the investigators, and makes certain broad 
recommendations which will probably affect the attitude of the State 
toward the university, the tréatment accorded it by the legislature, 
and the general policies of the institution for some time to come. In 
view of the wide public interest in this particular survey and the 
common misconception of its results, some of these findings and 
recommendations are worth noting. 
In regard to the criticism that the university is in politics, the 
report points out that: 
In recent years while the State has been attempting to meet economic and 
industrial needs by new legislation, it has been a common practice to consult 
with those who have studied and written on these problems. In the university 
faculty there have been, and now are, men who by reason of a lifetime of study 
are familiar with the various phases of these problems as they have developed 
and as they have been treated in other countries and States. * * * The 
State having engaged the services of the men in the university faculty is 
entitled to such advice and counsel as these men can give regarding the sub- 
jects to which they have devoted much ard special attention. * * * While 
new administrative policies were being inaugurated the State in a few in- 
stances has drawn upon the university faculty for members of its commis- 
sions. The State sought the services of these men on the theory that the 
inauguration of a new administrative policy required the advice, counsel, and 
direction of those familiar with the practices under similar administrative 
policies in other States and countries. * * * Both the State and uni- 
versity profited rather than suffered by this arrangement. 
Criticism has also been made of*the practice (not a common one) of the 
State employing members of the faculty to devote a part of their time to 
work connected with the State government. A common expression of this 
criticism has been couched in the phrase that “a university professor should 
not be allowed to draw two- salaries from the State.” * * * Inquiry has 
shown that to have secured the services of men of the same ability would have 
resulted in many instances either in employing professors from other uni- 
‘versity faculties or in employing those experts who are in the pay of private 
corporations, and also would have resulted in the State paying a much greate 
sum for the same services. t 
Investigation shows that in so far as students, faculty members, and regents 
are in politics as individuals, the University of Wisconsin is in politics. Stu- 
dents form political organizations, both partisan and factional, representing 
every faction and every party. Members of the faculty on occasions address 
these student clubs and give expression to personal convictions. In so doing,
-P-A-G-E-159
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 139 
students, professors, and regents, in the opinion of this board, have exercised 
only their rights to independent thought and action as individuals and citi- 
zens. No information has come to this board which shows that the University 
of Wisconsin as an organization is, or has been, in party or factional politics, 
With respect to research and its supervision the report comments 
briefly upon the recognized value of research to the State, and ap- 
proves the continuance of such facilities for it as now exist, but adds: 
However, there is evidence tending to show that some few [instructors] for- 
get their responsibilities and use the sincere and earnest work done by the 
many as a cloak for indolence. To prevent this it is necessary that every 
member of the faculty be held to some degree of accountability. Each man 
engaged in research work must be always ready to demonstrate to his col- 
leagues the possibilities of his subject. * * * He must satisfy his col- 
leagues and superior officers as to his earnestness and faithfulness in his work. 
Unless some such step is taken this board is convinced of the danger that 
particular instances may be used to discredit research, with the result that 
such opportunities as now exist may be diminished. 
    A relatively new aspect of university administration is treated 
under the heading of “Supervision of instruction.” The report 
says: 
The tradition that it is not consistent with the dignity of instructors of uni- 
versity rank to be closely supervised does not justify, in the judgment of this 
board, what is in some instances an almost entire absence of supervision in 
. Classroom work. 
Certainly there are those of the instructional staff who have demonstrated 
distinctly the excellence of their scholarship and pedagogical methods. Wven 
these, however, should not be permitted to pursue their work without refer- 
ence to the work of other instructors. It is necessary that the work of differ- 
ent departments and instructors be correlated, that uniform standards of schol- 
arship be maintained, and that unity of purpose and ideals be achieved. It 
is impossible to accomplish these ends without adequate supervision. * * * 
Such supervision need not be antagonistic, but should be at once critical, 
sympathetic, and constructive, 
The criticism that the university is a school for rich men’s sons is 
refuted by elaborate statistics of the cost of living, and the report 
adds: 
While it can not be the policy of a State university to discriminate against 
any class, rich or poor, this board believes that wide publicity should be given 
to the fact that investigation has shown that a moderate sum is sufficient to 
maintain a student at the University of Wisconsin in complete comfort. 
Valuable statistical material is also adduced to show that the uni- 
versity is not “receiving a larger proportion of moneys expended 
for educational purposes than is warranted when the number avail- 
ing themselves of university education is considered.” It is shown 
that the University of Wisconsin in its present form is much more 
than an institution for the “education of youth”; that— 
its laboratories, its libraries, and its faculty have constituted a source of infor- 
mation which has contributed to the well-being of the people as a whole and
-P-A-G-E-160
140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to the material welfare of individuals of every calling, employment, and occu- 
pation; that in 10 years there has been but little increase in the proportion of 
State moneys expended for instruction in the university at Madison to the total 
expenditures for instructional purposes in all branches of the State’s educa- 
tional system; and that far better than to curtail the opportunity now pro- 
vided by reducing future appropriations of the university, the State * * * 
should direct its attention rather to the development of a plan which would 
make it possible for a larger number of the youth of the State to utilize the 
advantages of university training. 
The report points out that additional junior colleges are needed, 
citing in defense of the recommendation the relatively small number 
of high-school graduates who go to college, the tendency of any 
higher institution to draw from a geographically restricted area, 
and the large mortality in university classes before the beginning of 
the junior year. 
With respect to the foreign language requirements, which received 
much unfavorable comment in the Allen report, the board says: 
In the opinion of the board it is neither right nor wise for the State absolutely 
to deny persons qualified in other respects the right to enter the university and 
pursue regular courses leading to graduation simply because they do not 
possess and do not wish to acquire, or who because of their surroundings have 
been unable to acquire, such knowledge of foreign languages as is now required. 
This general section of the report closes with recommendations 
regarding university extension, in the course of which the board 
says: 
The growth [of the extension department] has been so rapid and its work 
has been so largely experimental that the organization is not yet fully de- 
yeloped. There is also evidence of weakness in the case of some members of 
the faculty. This board realizes that in building up an entirely new depart- 
ment, with no precedents to follow and no experience as a guide, it is difficult 
to secure at once for each position in the faculty men equipped and temper- 
mentally adapted to the particular work required. It is no criticism of the past 
to say that now better organization and more systematic management of the 
extension division are demanded and that the instructional force should be 
strengthened. 
The survey eventuated in certain very unusual legislation. It also 
gave rise to numerous other proposals which failed to pass. Indeed, 
the session of the Wisconsin Legislature just ended saw the intro- 
duction of more than 30 bills and several joint resolutions directly 
affecting the university. 
Of most far-reaching influence among these measures is the act 
creating a State board of education. Effort was at first made to 
establish a central board of education, to have control of all edu- 
cational matters in the State and to supersede the board of regents 
of the university and the board of regents of the normal schools. 
This proved to be impossible. The boards of regents were left, but 
their actions rendered subject to review. The act creating the State
-P-A-G-E-161
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 141 
board of education provides for a board to consist of five members, 
the governor, the secretary of state, and the State superintendent of 
public instruction to be ex officio members, and one member to be 
appointed by the board: of regents of the University of Wisconsin 
and one by the board of regents of the normal schools. The board 
is charged with the management of all the financial affairs of the edu- 
cational activities of the State, including normal schools and the 
university. It is ordered to examine and audit the accounts of these 
institutions at the close of each fiscal year and to present on or before 
the 15th day of December next preceding the convening of the 
legislature its recommendations as to financial and business needs 
of the institutions under its jurisdiction, together with estimates for 
each, specifying in detail the amount of money that will be required 
for their support and maintenance. No new buildings shall be con- 
structed or lands purchased except by and under the direction of the 
board. Fifteen thousand dollars is to be appropriated annually for 
necessary expenses. : 
A supplemental act provides that all money appropriated for the 
use of the board of regents of the university and the board of 
regents of the normal schools is now available for, and to be used 
exclusively by, the State board of education. In this connection it 
should be noted that although the University of Wisconsin is the 
beneficiary of a mill tax, the money raised by this means is not avail- 
able to the university until it has been specifically appropriated by 
the legislature. 
It is not always possible to tell how any piece of administrative 
machinery will run until it is started. Occasionally the inventors 
are surprised. It is perfectly apparent in the present instance, how- 
ever, that the power to determine the educational policy of Wis- 
consin’s higher institutions now resides in the new board of educa- 
tion, in which three ex officio members, elected on political tickets, 
two of them presumably for political reasons, form a majority. The 
fact that the superintendent of public instruction is also a member 
of the boards of regents of the university and normal schools will 
probably tend to give added strength to the action of these bodies 
and to render the review of them by the board of education in 
general purely formal. But if it chooses, this board, through its 
control of finances, is able practically to nullify the action of either 
of the boards of regents. Wisconsin has thus contributed a novel 
and startling variant to the growing group of central boards of 
control. 
The financial dependence of the university upon political officers 
of the State acting ex officio is still further increased by other legis- 
lative action. The university appropriation bills were cut about 10  
-P-A-G-E-162
  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
per cent. When it was pointed out by the university authorities 
that a reduction in salaries or the dismissal of part of the teaching 
staff must inevitably result, the legislature passed an act supple- 
mentary to the appropriation bills appropriating from unexpended 
moneys such additional amounts as may be necessary to conduct any 
State department (including the university) in the customary man- 
ner and authorizing the governor, secretary of state, and State treas- 
urer to determine what amounts are thus needed. 
Other important enactments which appear to be the direct out- 
come of the survey were: The raising of the tuition fee to nonresi- 
dent students from $100 to $124; the repeal of the appropriation 
made by the previous legislature for the construction of a men’s 
dormitory; a joint resolution declaring that members of the uni- 
versity faculty are to feel free at any time to appear before legisla- 
tive committees to give special information when called upon by a 
member of the legislature or of a committee; and a joint resolution 
ordering an investigation of the purchases of realty by the board 
of regents during the last eight years in Dane County (the seat of 
the university). 
Among the bills introduced which failed to pass and which were 
evidently inspired by the survey were measures (1) requiring the 
university to admit any graduate of a four-year free high school or 
other public school and ordering the suspension of high-school 
inspection by university officers; (2) ‘providing that any resident 
graduate of an accredited high school shall be admitted to any 
college or department of the university; (3) establishing an English 
course at the university, admission to which and graduation from 
which shall not entail knowledge of any other language than Eng- 
lish; and (4) removing the president of the university from the 
board of regents and from its standing committees. 
THE SURVEY OF STATE-SUPPORTED HIGHER INSTITUTIONS IN WASHINGTON. 
Washington is another State that is seeking to secure a basis of 
exact Inowledge and impartial opinion before passing radical legis- 
lation affecting higher education. The rapid parallel expansion of 
the State university and the State college in recent years has led to 
vigorous, but not always accurately informed, protest against dupli- 
cation. This has been aggravated, as is usually the case, by the 
activity before the legislature and elsewhere of the partisans of both 
institutions and by the dynamic loyalty of the district in which each 
is located. During the 1915 session of the legislature, which was 
pledged to economy, a crisis seemed to be imminent. Several bills 
were introduced which it was felt might, if passed, damage one or 
both of the institutions and hurt the cause of higher education in the 
State. In order to forestall this possibility, friends of both institu-
-P-A-G-E-163
HIGHER EDUCATION. 143 
tions, together with the governor, invited the Commissioner of 
Education to come to Washington, study the situation, and recom- 
mend a course of action. During the closing days of the session the 
commissioner and the specialist in higher education made such a 
review of the situation on the ground as was possible in the time 
available. On the basis of this investigation the commissioner made 
a report to the joint committee on educational institutions and educa- 
tion, in which he outlined the major functions of the State university, 
the State college, and the State normal schools, and recommended a 
comprehensive survey of these institutions, with such general survey 
of the public-school system of the State as may be necessary before 
legislative action limiting the sphere of any of the institutions is 
taken. To have charge of the survey he recommended the creation 
of a legislative commission which should work through experts, and 
he offered the services of the Bureau of Education in the prosecution 
of the survey. 
In compliance with these recommendations the legislature passed 
an act creating a survey commission, and naming as its members the 
subcommittee of the joint committee on educational institutions and 
education, before which the hearings relating to the institutions in 
question had been held. The commission was instructed to conduct 
a survey as outlined by the Commissioner of Education and to 
report to the governor on or before April 30, 1916. Each member 
of the commission is to receive as compensation $5 a day while actu- 
ally engaged in the performance of ‘his duties, and for the payment 
of these honorariums, the traveling expenses of the commission, and 
the expenses of the experts to be employed, the sum of $5,000 was 
appropriated. The survey commission at once called upon the 
Bureau of Education for the assistance promised by the commis- 
sioner, and the preliminary steps in the survey have already been 
taken under the commissioner’s direction. 
THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE BOARD OF REGENTS. 
Like Vermont, North Dakota has regarded a survey as an essential 
part of educational house cleaning. For several years the Legisla- 
ture of North Dakota has contemplated the possibility of a compre- 
hensive reorganization of the State educational system. Mention 
has already been made of the temporary educational commission 
created by the legislature of 1911 and its very suggestive report.t 
An act passed by the 1915 legislature organizing the administration 
of State-supported higher educational institutions appears to be a 
somewhat remote and not altogether consonant echo of the work of 
the commission. The act provides for the appointment by the gov- 
ernor of a State board of regents consisting of five members, with   
1See Ann. Rep. of Commis, of Ed., 1912, p. 95. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
a six-year term of office, but removable by the governor for cause 
before the expiration of the term, one, and not more than two, to 
be appointed from each congressional district, and not more than 
one from any county, nor more than one who is an alumnus of any 
institution under the control of the board. The board is to elect 
a secretary, at a salary of $2,500. Members of the board are to 
receive $7 a day and their necessary traveling expenses. The board 
will supersede the governing boards of the State university and 
school of mines, the State agricultural college and experiment sta- 
tion, the school of science, the normal industrial school, and the 
school of forestry, and it is charged with all the duties of these 
boards. ; 
A novel feature of the new act is the provision that— 
the State board of regents first appointed shall, as soon as practicable after hav- 
ing organized, procure, to be made by a competent expert or experts from with- 
out the State, an educational survey of all institutions under its control, for 
the purpose of ascertaining wherein the efficiency of the State insitutions can 
be best served and economy in conducting the same best practiced. 
Upon the completion of the educational survey the board is in- 
structed to appoint as its executive officer a commissioner of educa- 
tion from without the State. The commissioner is to— 
perform such duties of examination, inspection, and visitation as the board may 
direct and; * * * [to] advise the board on all matters pertaining to the 
curricula, coordination, and correlating of work .in the institutions under its 
control; * * * and [to] make a special study of the particular needs and 
requirements of each institution, and report thereon to the board at such time 
as they shall direct. 
The commissioner’s salary is to be fixed by the board at a sum-not 
to exceed $5,000 a year. The board is to have the power to elect 
the presidents and other officers of each of the institutions and fix 
their salaries, to coordinate and correlate the work of the several 
schools so as to prevent wasteful duplication, to fix tuition fees, and 
to prepare a budget for the consideration of each legislative assembly 
setting forth the financial needs of the institutions under its con- 
trol. It is required to hold one annual meeting at the State capital 
and quarterly meetings at one of the institutions under its control, 
if practicable. Eighteen thousand dollars annually is appropriated 
for the expenses of the board. 
Although the powers of the new officers are not specified as ex- 
plicitly as in the cases of Idaho and Vermont, it is, nevertheless, 
apparent that the Commissioner of Education when finally appointed 
under this new North Dakota statute will be the responsible executive 
head of the higher educational system.

OTHER SURVEYS ORDERED BY STATE EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITIES. 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, 
The president and board of regents of the University of Oregon 
requested the Commissioner of Education, in March, 1915, to provide 
for a survey of the organization and management of that institution. 
The survey was undertaken during the summer and early fall, under 
the direction of the specialist in higher education, and treated the 
following topics: 
1. The field of the university and the attitude of the State toward the insti- 
tution. 
2. Organization and administration of the university: (@) The board of 
regents. (0b) Administrative officers and heads of departments. 
3. Faculty. Training and experience. Methods of appointment. Salary 
scale. Teaching hours and student hours. 
4, Provisions for research and results in service to the State. 
5. Curricula of various schools and departments. 
6. Scholastic relation of the university to its students, including the require- 
ments for admission and graduation and their enforcement. 
7. General comparison of the financial status of the University of Oregon with 
that of other State institutions. 
8. The equipment. 
The report was rendered on September 26 to the board of regents 
of the university. 
° STATE-SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONS OF IOWA. 
The Iowa State board of education, created in 1909 to take charge 
of the affairs of the State university, the State college of agriculture 
and mechanic arts, the State teachers’ college, and the college for 
the blind, issued in October, 1912, an order looking toward the co- 
ordination of the work of these institutions. The general provisions 
of the order were that courses in engineering should be concentrated 
at the State college of agriculture and mechanic arts, and that pro- 
fessional training in education and in the liberal arts and work in 
home economics be centered at the university. In response to reso- 
lutions passed by both houses of the legislature, the board rescinded 
its ruling before it was put into operation. Since then the expenses 
of the three principal State institutions have been increasing. 
Rivalry between them and their partisans has not diminished. Gen- 
eral complaints of unnecessary duplication are becoming more and 
more insistent. In view of this situation, the State board of educa- 
tion requested the Commissioner of Education, in May, 1915, to 
undertake the direction of a survey of the higher institutions of the 
State and to employ such assistants as he deemed necessary. The 
commissioner has assembled for the purpose a survey commission 
consisting of seven educational experts, two members of the Bureau 
of Education and five outsiders.

INSPECTIONS OF HIGHER INSTITUTIONS BY THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
NORTH CAROLINA, 
Less thoroughgoing investigations, which are nevertheless to be 
regarded as minor manifestations of the survey movement, were 
undertaken by the Bureau of Education in two States. 
Under the rules of the department of public instruction of North 
Carolina the State board of examiners is authorized to exempt from 
part of the examination for the high-school teachers’ certificate grad- 
uates of those colleges and universities in the State which satisfy 
the board of their ability to give the required training in the prin- 
cipal branches covered by the high-school teachers’ examination. 
That the board might have the benefit of the impartial advice of an 
outsider in selecting its group of approved institutions, the State 
superintendent of public instruction requested the Bureau of Edu- 
cation to inspect and report upon the colleges and universities of 
the State. Accordingly the specialist in high education visited, dur- 
ing the academic year 1914-15, 27 of these institutions and reported 
upon their work and equipment to the State board of examiners. 
OREGON. 
The State of Oregon passed a law in 1911 authorizing the issuance 
of teachers’ certificates to graduates of standard colleges and univer- 
sities and providing that “a standard college, university, or normal 
school is one that shall be standardized by the United States Bureau 
of Education.” In case of the bureau’s failure to pass upon the 
standard of any higher institution of Oregon, the law further speci- 
fied how such standardization was to be accomplished by local agen- 
cies. The bureau accepted the invitation to assist the State of Oregon 
in the standardization of the higher institutions of that State. In 
1911 the specialist in higher education visited ail degree-conferring 
institutions, examined their administration, support, equipment, and 
faculty, and reported to the State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, recommending that three of them be considered as meeting the 
requirements of a standard college or university according to the 
State law.*. The conviction that certain of the others had in the 
meantime improved and were now entitled to recognition under the 
terms of the law led the State superintendent early in 1915 to request 
the bureau to repeat its inspection. The specialist in higher educa- 
tion was sent to Oregon for this purpose in March, 1915. He re- 
ported to the State superintendent that, judged by the criteria which 
had been applied in the previous inspection, the following institu- 
tions might be recognized as standard: Albany College, McMinnville 
College, University of Oregon, Reed College, Pacific University, and 
Willamette University.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 147 
LEGISLATION AFFECTING HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, 
In the reports of 1912 and 1914 attention was called to various 
efforts of the legislature, educational officials, and interested groups 
of citizens to bring about a closer correlation of the higher institu- 
tions of Montana and to do away with wasteful duplication and de- 
structive institutional rivalries. The 1913 legislature organized the 
State university at Missoula, the State college of agriculture and 
mechanic arts at Bozeman, the State school of mines at Butte, and 
the State normal school at Dillon, into the University of Montana, 
without consolidating them, and created the oflice of chancellor of the 
university, without appropriating money to pay his salary. 
Certain citizens of the State felt that the issue was not settled and 
proposed by initiative petition a bill providing for the consolidation 
of the State university, the college of agriculture and mechanic arts, 
and the school of mines under the name of the University of Mon- 
tana, and for the appointment of an out-of-State commission of five 
presidents of State universities which are already consolidated, to 
determine whether the institution should be located at Missoula or 
Bozeman. This bill was defeated at the election of 1914. 
The legislature of 1915 did not make an appropriation for the 
salary of the chancellor. Indeed, a bill was introduced, but defeated, 
to abolish that office. After the adjournment of the legislature the 
State board of education voted to divide the expense of maintaining 
the chancellor pro rata among the institutions under his jurisdiction. 
As this report goes to press announcement is made of.the election of 
Prof. Edward C. Elliott, director of the course for the training of 
teachers at the University of Wisconsin, to this important and in- 
fluential office. 
THE NEBRASKA INITIATIVE. 
The Nebraska Legislature of 1913 passed an act authorizing a tax 
of three-fourths of 1 mill on the grand roll for six years to provide 
a special university building fund.t The opertaion of the act was 
suspended until the electors of the State should have an opportunity 
under the initiative to express their choice as to the future site of 
the colleges of the institution. At the general election of 1914 the 
two following questions were submitted to the electors in response to 
initiative petitions: 
(a) Shall all colleges of the State university, excepting the college of medi- 
cine, be consolidated as soon as practicable on the farm campus? 
(b) Shall the colleges of the State university, excepting the college of agri- 
eulture and the college of medicine, be housed in buildings located or to be 
located on the present city campus and on land contiguous thereto¥ 
  
1In Nebraska the assessors divide the value of the property found by five before turn- 
ing in the same. Hence, the grand assessment roll for tax purposes is only one-fifth of 
the value of the property of the State as found by the assessors.  
-P-A-G-E-168
  148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
In the event of the passage of the first provision the proceeds of 
the tax were to become available for the erection of buildings. If 
the second option was chosen by the voters, then one-third of the levy 
was to become available for the purpose of erecting buildings on the 
farm campus and two-thirds for the extension of the city campus 
and the erection of buildings thereon. The second option was chosen 
by the electors, and the program of expansion under it has already 
begun. 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS. 
A very significant movement relating to the quality of college prep- 
aration and the methods for testing it is now, after several years of 
careful fashioning, successfully and auspiciously launched. The 
“comprehensive examination” has been formally baptized by two of 
the most influential bodies dealing with college entrance. The term 
is comparatively new and until recently has probably not been fully 
understood by the majority of educators, although the thing itself 
has long been the subject of discussion. The extended consideration 
of comprehensive examinations by the Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland in 1912 
helped to give currency to the designation and to focus the attention 
of educational leaders in that section upon the desirability of adopt- 
ing this kind of test in place of the prevailing type of college entrance 
examinations. The discussion, which resulted in the appointment of 
a committee by the association to study and report on comprehensive 
examinations, was opened by President Lowell, of Harvard Uni- 
versity. Harvard’s leadership in this new movement was thus appro- 
priately recognized. 
Comprehensive examinations, though under a different name, were 
in effect already being given in connection with the new plan of 
admission to Harvard put into operation in 1911. The old plan of 
admission required that each student be examined in each subject 
demanded by the university for entrance. The university accepted 
no secondary-school certificates in lieu of examination. The new 
plan combines the characteristic features of both the examination 
and the certificate methods of admission. A candidate for admission 
under the new plan presents a certificate from his secondary-school 
principal testifying to the quantity of the work covered; the uni- 
versity then takes a sample of the quality of this preparatory train- 
ing by examining him in four subjects. Effort has been made to 
frame examinations which should not be merely mechanical quizzes 
on certain books or prescribed portions of subjects, but which should 
test the student’s general knowledge of the several subjects and his
-P-A-G-E-169
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 149 
power to organize and apply it. Substantially the same plan of ad- 
mission has lately been adopted by Princeton (there designated the 
“alternative method”), by Yale, and by certain other institutions. 
This official indorsement of the combined examination and certifi- 
cate method of admission, together with evidence of its success where 
it has been put into operation, led the National Conference Commit- 
tee on Standards of Colleges and Secondary Schools, at its meeting in 
March, 1915, to make a special order of business of comprehensive 
examinations and to adopt the following resolution: 
Resowed, That the national conference committee on standards of colleges 
and secondary schools recommends that consideration be given by colleges to 
the method of admission by means of a certified school record and compre- 
hensive examinations in a limited number of subjects. 
The College Entrance Examination Board, meeting about three 
weeks later, in April, 1915, gave added impetus to the movement by 
the adoption of the following resolutions: 
That there be offered by the College Entrance Examination Board in June, 
1916, and thereafter, a set of comprehensive examinations adapted to the use 
of those colleges in the board which offer or propose to offer comprehensive 
examinations for admission purposes. * * * 
That separate committees of examiners be appointed by the board for the 
preparation of the two sets of examinations offered. 
That separate bodies of readers be appointed for the reading of the answer 
books of the two systems of examinations. 
That untii otherwise arranged, each college shall determine the conditions 
under which its own candidates shall be admitted to the examinations of the 
new system, and that each college shall be allowed, on request, to have the 
answer books of its candidates for admission under this system forwarded to 
it without reading on the part of the board. 
In the annual report of the board for 1915 appears a memorandum 
by J. G. Hart, chairman of the Harvard committee on admissions, 
giving a brief description of comprehensive examinations as the 
committee understands them. It reads: 
'To be most useful the new comprehensive papers must be adapted: 
(1) To such variety of school instruction as exists in the several subjects— 
i, e., they must not prescribe methods, but must recognize the general principle 
that the schools determine how they shall teach a subject and that the college 
tests results or power. 
(2) To different stages of training in the subjects in which they are set— 
i. e., they must give boys opportunities to show their power, whether they have 
had the minimum or the maximum training given in school; for example, the 
papers in French should be so drawn up as to enable a boy who has had only 
two years of French to show that he has as much command over the language 
as can be expected from that amount of training, and they must be similarly 
useful for the boy who has had three or four years of French.

: OTHER ACTION RELATING TO COLLEGE ENTRANCE. 
National Conference Committee on Standards of Colleges and See- 
ondary Schools.—Iin the preceding annual report (pp. 177 and 179) 
appeared a brief description of the proposed changes in the unit 
values of mathematics and history. It was there brought out that 
schoolmen generally testify that Mathematics A as defined by the 
College Entrance Examination Board actually demands two units of 
time if properly covered. A careful consideration of the subject led 
the National Conference Committee to the conclusion that the criti- 
cisms of the present valuation of the unit in mathematics were 
justified. It therefore voted, at its meeting in 1915, the following 
resolution : 
Resolved: That the National Conference Committee on Standards of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools recommends that the valuation of the College Entrance 
Examination Board requirement in elementary algebra be increased to two 
units—mathematics Al and mathematics A2—each to be counted as one unit; 
that colleges admitting on certificate, however, give credit for one and a half 
or two units for mathematics A, according to the time actually devoted to the 
subject, no more than two units credit to be given in any case. 
In the case of history the objection had been raised that the pres- 
ent unit values were too liberal. The national conference committee 
passed the following resolutions bearing on this matter: 
Resolved: That the national conference committee on standards of colleges 
and secondary schools recommends that courses in history of less than four or 
five periods per week be not given in the first or second year of the secondary 
school course; that the minimum admission credit in history be one unit, and 
that credit be not given for more than one unit in one historical field. 
That the College Entrance Examination Board establish two examinations 
in each of the historical fields, to be known as elementary and advanced, or 
by some other distinguishing terms, and that elementary history be given a 
credit of one-half unit, and advanced history of one unit. 
That colleges admitting on certificate grant credit for work in history of one- 
half unit or one unit, according to the time employed. 
A consultation of bedies which prepare accredited or approved 
lists of secondary schools, with a view to greater cooperation, was 
also recommended in the resolution quoted below. Such a meeting 
should have important results. 
Resolved: That, with a view to securing more uniformity in the standards 
of certification, it is recommended that the associations and commissions which 
draw up lists of approved schools for the use of colleges hold a conference in the 
near future, to which shall be invited also representatives of colleges in other 
parts of the country. 
College Entrance Examination Board—The board, at its meet- 
ing in April, adopted the recommendations of the national confer- 
ence committee in regard to the unit weight of mathematics A, but, 
in view of the recent appointment of a committee to define more
-P-A-G-E-171
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 151 
fully the requirements in history, it did not take action on the recom- 
mendations of the conference committee relating to this subject. 
The board authorized the printing and circulation of the pro- 
posed definition of the requirements in biology, botany, and zoology, 
with a view to their adoption at the November meeting of the board. 
The original purpose for which the board was founded was to 
substitute for “the separate entrance examinations held every June 
by individual universities, colleges, and scientific schools,” the uni- 
form examinations of the board. The simultaneous action, in 1915, 
of the faculties of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (which had hith- 
erto conducted each its own examinations) adopting after the pres- 
ent year the board’s examinations in place of those previously given 
by these institutions in June, marks the accomplishment of this 
original purpose. 
CLASSIFICATION. 
COMMITTEE O¥ THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES, 
The Association of American Universities, consisting of 22 pri- 
vately endowed institutions and State universities which have de- 
veloped strong graduate schools, has quite naturally long been in- 
terested in the question of classification. Its members must have 
fairly accurate knowledge of the standards and equipment of the 
majority of colleges in the country in order that the standards of 
their graduate departments may not be depressed by the admission ~ 
of ill-prepared students. It is a matter both of self-defense and the 
defense of scholarship. Whatever may be said in favor of not in- 
quiring to closely into the quality of the preliminary training of 
boys and girls who aspire to a college education, of putting as few 
obstacles as possible in their way—-and there are many who advocate 
almost complete academic free trade at this point—the same argu- 
ments do not apply to the relationship of the graduate school to the 
college. The graduate school stands preeminently for the promotion 
of scholarship. Its double function is the training of specialists in 
the higher branches for the teaching profession and the facilitation 
of research. In weighing the measure of its fidelity to both these 
aims, it is its own judge. There is no ready litmus test whereby the 
quality of its product may be at once revealed. Only the passage of 
years makes clear whether or not it has kept the faith. This high 
obligation both to the foundational profession and to the very spirit 
of scholarship itself, transcends the claims of any ill-equipped col- 
legiate institution to recognition of its conscientious efforts and even 
outweighs the ambition for professional training of the earnest but 
poorly prepared individual. 
From various sources (though chiefly in the last four years from 
the unpublished tentative classification made by the Bureau of Edu-
-P-A-G-E-172
  152. EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
cation in 1911) the members of the Association of American Uni- 
versities have each more or less independently attempted to grade 
institutions whose graduates apply for candidacy for advanced de- 
grees. At its meeting in 1913 the association not only took action 
formally recognizing the degrees of 119 American colleges, but 
appointed a committee on the classification of colleges under the 
chairmanship of Dean Kendric C. Babcock, of the University of 
Illinois. This committee made at the meeting of the association 
in 1914 the following striking report: 
1. That there be prepared and circulated among the members of this associa- 
tion a list of universities and colleges, consisting of three groups as outlined 
below, based primarily upon the experience and practice of this association, 
such a list to be used privately by the members for one year as a provisional 
list, with a view to its revision and subsequent publication in the proceedings 
of the association, 
Group A.—Iastitutions whose graduates should ordinarily be admitted to the 
graduate schools of this association for work in lines for which they have had 
adequate undergraduate preparation, with a reasonable presumption that ad- 
vanced degreees may be taken with the minimum amount of prescribed work 
and in the minimum time prescribed. Students who choose work in lines for 
which their undergraduate courses has not prepared them adequately must 
expect to take more time and do additional work. 
Group B.—Institutions from which only those graduates of high standing in 
their classes who are individually recommended by the department of under- 
graduate instruction corresponding to that in which they purpose to do their 
graduate work may be admitted on the same basis as graduates from the insti- 
tutions in group A. 
Group C.—Other institutions whose graduates should be admitted to graduate 
schools, but with the presumption that more than the minimum time and mini- 
mum amount of work will be ordinarily required for an advanced degree. 
2. That the dean of each graduate school of this association furnish before 
March to the secretary of the association, for the private information of mem- 
bers of the association, a list of all students newly admitted to his school dur- 
ing the last three years who were rated as deficient. Such a list is to show, 
as far as practicable, the name of the student, college, degree, date of degree, 
any work or study intervening between that date and admission to the graduate 
school, the principal subject of the undergraduate course, the principal subject 
chosen for graduate work, an estimate of the undergraduate course and the 
deficiences assessed in the estimate, or special prescriptions made to compensate 
for deficiencies. 
It is further recommended in this connection that each dean furnish a list 
of institutions other than members of this association from which students have 
been admitted during the last three years. 
The association accepted the report and voted to continue this com- 
mittee. 
RECOGNITION OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE BY THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES 
AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
Reference has been made in the annual reports of 1912 and 1914 
to the multiplication of junior colleges and the attempts of various 
State and university authorities to define this new type of institution.

  HIGHER. EDUCATION. 153 
The Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern 
States, at its meeting in 1913, appointed a committee to study the 
junior college problem. The committee reported at the meeting of 
the association in October, 1914, recommending that the association 
pass a resolution to establish a category of members, known as junior 
colleges, under the following conditions: 
1. The college work must be the essential part of the curriculum of any insti- 
tution recognized as a junior college; therefore, junior colleges must publish in 
their annual catalogues a classified list of all their students. 
2. If a preparatory department is maintained, its work must be approved by 
the association. 
8. The minimum requirements for admission to the college classes must corre- 
spond with the present requirements of the association. 
4, For graduation from the junior college, the student must complete satis- 
factorily 30 year, or 60 semester, hours of work equivalent to that given in the 
freshman and sophomore years of colleges belonging to the association. 
5. No junior college should confer a degree; a junior college diploma may. be 
awarded. 
6. The number of teachers, their training, the amount of work assigned them, 
the number of college students, the resources and equipment of the junior col- 
lege, are all vital factors in fixing the standard of an institution and must be 
considered by the executive committee in recommending any institution for mem- 
bership. On these points, therefore, the committee shall issue recommendations 
from time to time for the purpose of informing institutions seeking membership 
in the association concerning conditons to be met. 
The association went on record as favoring the establishment of a 
new category of members, to be known as junior colleges, under the 
requirements proposed. A constitutional amendment providing that 
“the membership of the association shall consist of four classes—(1) 
colleges and universities; (2) junior colleges; (3) schools; and (4) 
individuals ”—was proposed and referred for adoption or rejection to 
the next meeting of the association. 
NEW ASSOCIATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS. 
THE MAYO FOUNDATION. 
The University of Minnesota was, in February, 1915, offered the 
Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research at Rochester, 
Minn., endowed by the Mayo brothers to the amount of one million 
and a half. The foundation was to come under the control of the 
university only after a trial period of six years. Before the regents 
of the university took definite action on the offer there arose a vigor- 
ous public opposition, which culminated in the introduction of a bill 
before the legislature to prevent the University of Minnesota from 
affiliating with agencies outside of the campus. The bill was de- 
feated. This opposition was, in the opinion of the Journal of the 
American Medical Association, of positive benefit, since it resulted  
-P-A-G-E-174
  154 ° EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
in a thorough investigation of the Mayo clinic and the new research 
foundation and in wide publicity concerning them. In June the 
board of regents accepted the proposed union. The Journal of the 
American Medical Association thus comments upon the new impetus 
given to medical education in Minnesota by the arrangement: 
Meuical education in Minnesota has been unified to a remarkable extent.in 
recent years and has been placed entirely under the control of the State uni- 
versity. * * * At the present time, it is stated, graduate courses are being 
offered in all laboratory and clinical departments except those of genito- 
“urinary diseases and dermatology, and this work has been arranged in syste- 
matic courses leading to the graduate degree of doctor of science. * * * The 
acceptance of the proposal to unite the work of the Mayo foundation with 
that of the university is directly in line with the policy to retain the control 
of all medical education in Minnesota, both undergraduate and graduate, in the 
hands of the State university. 
The facilities for research and graduate instruction of the university and of 
the Mayo foundation in a large measure supplement each other. Such in- 
struction has been best established at the university in connection with the 
laboratory branches, whereas, at Rochester, more work has naturally been 
done in connection with the clinical departments. This being the case, the 
rotation of graduate students between the university and Rochester will result 
in a more thorough and all-around training in both the laboratory and clinical 
aspects of any chosen specialty. Under the plan proposed the research work 
at the two places will be unified and harmonized under the control of the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota.* 
THE ASSOCIATION OF URBAN UNIVERSITIES. 
In recognition of the peculiar problems and obligations of the 
city college or university and with the conviction that these can 
most effectively be met by combined action and the interchange of 
experience and opinion, representatives of a number of these insti- 
tutions in attendance upon the meeting of the National Association 
of State Universities at Washington, in November, 1914, formed an 
Association of Urban Universities. The call for the meeting which 
led to the formation of this association thus set forth the tasks and 
purposes of these urban institutions: 
The municipal colleges are aiming to do for their cities some of the things 
the State universities are doing so admirably for their States. Private insti- 
tutions in cities, realizing the obligations resulting from freedom of taxation, 
are endeavoring to serve their local communities. The general public, on the 
one side, is awakening to the value and necessity of expert knowledge, and the 
universities, on the other, are realizing as never before their duty to train 
men and women for municipal, State, and national positions. Since much of 
this is new and experimental, it is thought that a conference on the relations 
of civie universities to their local institutions and communities will prove 
helpful. . 
The following institutions were represented at the meeting: Uni- 
versity of Akron, College of the City of New York, Johns Hopkins   
1See also Ch. VIII, Medical Education.
-P-A-G-E-175
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 155. 
University, University of Cincinnati, James Milliken University, 
University of Louisville, Reed College, Washington University, 
Northwestern University, New York University, University of Pitts- 
burgh, Boston University, University of Buffalo, and Toledo Uni- 
versity. 
The report of the committee on organization, besides providing 
for the formation of the association and suggesting its name, recom- 
mended as officers for the ensuing year: President, President Dab- 
ney, of the University of Cincinnati; vice president, Dean Lord, of 
Boston University ; secretary and treasurer, Prof. Clark, of the Col- 
lege of the City of New York. 
It also recommended that membership be by institutions for the 
present and that each institution pay an annual fee of $10 to cover 
the expenses of organization and publication of the minutes. It 
recommended that those municipal universities and urban universi- 
ties and colleges interested in cooperation with municipal institutions 
and in training for public service be eligible for membership. 
The gathering then resolved itself into an experience meeting, 
each institution reporting upon the methods of cooperation with 
city activities which it had already adopted. This material has 
since been summarized and printed as a bulletin of the Bureau 
of Education under the title of “The Municipality and the 
University.” (1915, No. 38.) 
THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN COLLEGES. 
The Association of American Colleges was formally organized in 
Chicago on January 15. As stated in the preamble to the constitu- 
tion of the new association, its duties are to be “the consideration of 
questions relating to the promotion of higher education in all its 
forms in the independent and denominational colleges in the United 
States, and the discussion and prosecution of such plans as may tend 
to make more efficient the institutions included in the membership 
of the association.” The first session of the association was held 
jointly with the council of church boards of education on January 
14, and was devoted to a discussion of the moral and religious phases 
of education. This session preceded formal organization. 
The first independent session of the new association, on the morn- 
ing of January 15, was devoted to a general discussion of the place 
and function of such an organization. The fact was brought out 
that the interests of the independent colleges, as distinct from the 
public and private universities, are nowhere the particular care of 
any organization or group of people. The great graduate schools 
of the country have for a number of years maintained an association 
(the Association of American Universities), which is charged with 
defining the ideals and maintaining the standards of these institu-
-P-A-G-E-176
  156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
tions. The State universities have profited much by the formation 
of the National Association of State Universities. Although the 
universities which comprise these two associations have collegiate 
departments, nevertheless the problems of college education, as such, 
seemed to the promoters of the new association to lack serious and 
organized attention. From these older associations also and from 
the National Education Association have emanated certain proposi- 
tions relating to the organization of the American system of higher 
education which, it was said, if generally adopted, would render the 
college wholly or in part superfluous. The college should be in a 
position to discuss its own situation and to present forcibly its own 
claims before a policy looking to its elimination from the scheme of 
American education was adopted. Moreover, colleges, especially the 
independent colleges, are largely without information of their own 
operations and needs. In the reports and bulletins of the Bureau of 
Education and elsewhere much information relating particularly to 
State universities is available. If the independent colleges were sup- 
plied with the same record of facts concerning themselves it would 
be reasonable to expect a great improvement in college education. 
Much of the false emphasis known to characterize catalogue state- 
ments is due to ignorance on the part of catalogue editors of the, 
offerings of sister institutions. The opinion was reiterated also that 
what is known as the “Christian college” (by some called the “ de- 
nominational college,” although the term “ Christian” is commonly 
used to include institutions not under denominational control but 
merely on terms of friendly cooperation with some denomination) 
has a particular mission to perform which the strictly nonsectarian 
public institutions can not attempt—namely, the higher education of 
youth under strongly positive religious influences. For all these 
reasons and many others it was felt that there is a distinct place for 
such an association. 
The essential clauses of the constitution adopted were those on 
membership, representation, and officers, the gist of these clauses he- 
ing as follows: é 
All colleges conforming to the definition of a minimum college 
given in the by-laws are eligible to membership. Each institution is 
entitled to one vote in each meeting. The officers of the association 
are a president, vice president, and a secretary and treasurer, who 
are to hold office for one year and to be ineligible for reelection. 
The association adopted one by-law at the same business session. 
The by-law defined eligibility. To be eligible for membership a col- 
lege must require 14 units for admission and 120 semester hours for 
graduation, except that by a two-thirds vote of the association a col- 
lege not meeting these requirements may be admitted to membership. 
Immediately upon the passage of the by-law the association voted 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 157 
unanimously to admit Clark College, Worcester, Mass., which, being 
a three-year institution, requires but 108 semester hours for gradua- 
tion, to membership. 
The report of the committee on classification, which was adopted, 
recommended that the Bureau of Education and other classifying 
bodies be urged to use the following terminology in listing insti- 
tutions: (1) Tax supported—(a) State, (b) municipal; (2) nontax 
supported—(a) Denominational, (b) with denominational affiliations, 
(c) independent. 
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, 
Robert L. Kelly, Earlham College; vice president, George E. Fel- 
lows, James Millikin University; secretary-treasurer, Richard: W. 
Cooper, Upper Iowa University. 
A COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY. 
Another step toward the creation of a teachers’ college in Balti- 
more was taken in the recent creation of the degree of bachelor of 
science in education, by the Johns Hopkins University. This marks 
a partial fulfillment of the hopes of the university which have been 
entertained for a number of years. As early as 1910 the university 
announced its desire of establishing a department for the higher 
training of teachers as an organic part of the university. 
The curriculum leading to the new degree will be based on the col- 
lege courses for teachers and the summer courses. The former, which 
were established in 1909, are conducted during the regular session in 
the afternoons and on Saturdays. The latter have been conducted 
since 1911. The new degree will be open to men and women on equal 
terms. The regulations concerning matriculation and the curriculum 
will be determined by a special advisory committee of the faculty. 
The title of director of these courses has been assigned to Prof. Ed- 
ward F. Buchner, who organized and has conducted both of these 
branches of the university’s activities. 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM. 
From time to time the suspicion arises that governing boards are 
trying to check free speech, that the utterances of American univer- 
sity and college professors, particularly on the tender themes of re- 
ligion and politics, are subject to review by the trustees who appoint 
them, and that loss of position is the penalty for a lapse from strict 
orthodoxy. 
That there is always some pressure exerted in academic communi- 
ties, as elsewhere, to keep radical propagandists quiet and to dis- 
courage destructive criticism of the existing order none will deny. 
Tts extent varies with the institution. As a rule, it is exerted subtly, 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
often unconsciously, in large universities which are supposedly free. 
Generally it vanishes as soon as the right of free speech is publicly 
broached. Within the past two or three years, however, there have 
been so many recurrences of disciplinary action directed by trustees 
and presidents of prominent institutions against professors reputed 
to hold unorthodox political, economic, or religious views that the 
question of academic freedom has become temporarily one of the 
foremost issues in university administration. Upon its correct set- 
tlement depends not only the integrity of the universities, but, more 
remotely, the whole welfare of American education. 
Another phase of the issue concerns the limitations of trustee rule. 
This is particularly acute in private foundations. Are the trustees 
the employers of all persons connected with the university, the owners 
of the business, as it were, whose will is law and not subject to ques- 
tion? Are professors “hired men” merely, to be engaged and dis- 
charged without assigned cause at the trustees’ good pleasure? Has 
the faculty a moral, if not a legal, right to be heard in matters relat- 
ing to appointments and dismissals? In State universities the trus- 
tees are less likely to resort to star-chamber tactics because the public 
has the power to force an accounting. Still, instances are not un- 
known where the governing boards of State institutions have behaved 
as if the institutions under their control belonged to them and neither 
the educational officers nor the public had the right to demand reasons 
for their acts. Are any boards of trustees, whether of public or pri- 
vate institutions, exempt from responsibility to the public? Is any 
university, even if partly or wholly supported by private endowment, 
a private institution? Does the measure of its accountability to the 
public differ from that of the State university? These are some of 
the more insistent questions that have been raised by the alleged 
breaches of academic freedom during the present year. 
Boards of control, whether of public or private institutions, can no 
longer hope to have their action involving a decision on one of these 
points go unchallenged by outside bodies. As test cases have arisen 
within the past few years, various associations of scholars whose 
members have suffered from alleged arbitrary treatment have in- 
vestigated them and given wide publicity to the findings. In the 
course of the year under review, as well as in the six months pre- 
ceding, the limits of free speech and the powers of trustees have 
been illuminatingly set forth in various documents published in part 
by the associations and in part by other agencies. 
THE LAFAYETTE CASE, 
The first of these chronologically is the report of the committee 
of the American Philosophical Association and the American Psy- 
chological Association, appointed to inquire into the circumstances
-P-A-G-E-179
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 159 
connected with the resignation of Dr. John M. Mecklin from the 
professorship of philosophy and psychology at Lafayette College. 
The committee considered itself commissioned to find out the reason 
for action which might “have the effect of injuring the professional 
standing and opportunities” of a member of these associations, and 
also to discover what “ doctrinal restrictions are imposed upon teach- 
ers and investigators in philosophy and psychology” at Lafayette 
College. The administration of the college “courteously declined ” 
to furnish the committee information on these points. From other 
sources, however, the committee secured. evidence which enabled it 
to form conclusions. 
With regard to the limits of freedom in philosophical and psy- 
chological teaching at Lafayette College the report says: 
American colleges and universities fall into two classes: Those in which 
freedom of inquiry, of belief, and of teaching is, if not absolutely unrestricted, 
at least subject to limitations so few and so remote as to give practically no 
occasion for difference of opinion; and those which are frankly instruments of 
denominational or political propaganda. 
The associations, the committe believes, should intervene— 
only for three ends: (1) To ascertain which institutions do, and which do not, 
officially profess the principle of freedom of teaching; (2) to ascertain with a 
fair degree of definiteness in the case of those institutions which do not, what 
the doctrinal limitations imposed upon their teachers of philosophy and psychol- 
ogy are; and (3) to call attention publicly to all instances in which in institu- 
tions of the former sort freedom of teaching appears to have been interfered 
with, or in which in the latter sort restrictions other than those antecedently 
laid down appear to have been imposed. 
The committee found much disagreement among the trustees, 
graduates, and faculty of Lafayette College as to whether the insti- 
tution was of the first or the second type. It came at length to the 
conclusion that, to quote a trustee, it had been “commonly under- 
stood that the teachings in such departments (i. e., those of phil- 
osophy and psychology) are generally to be in harmony with the 
doctrines of philosophy usually taught and held in the Presbyterian 
Church.” There had been apparently no definite agreement upon 
this matter between the administration and the new appointees, and 
the opinion of the trustee just quoted was in contradiction with a 
clause in the college charter. Moreover, the points in Prof. Mecklin’s 
teaching which were objected to as in conflict with Presbyterian prin- 
ciples had not been specified. All of which led the committee to 
record its belief that “in no institution, of whatever type, should a 
professor be compelled to relinquish, his position for doctrinal rea- 
sons, except upon definite charges communicated to him in writing 
and Jaid with the supporting evidence before the entire board of 
trustees and the faculty;” and that “it is unfortunate in any case 
of this kind that even by agreement between the persons concerned
-P-A-G-E-180
  160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the matter should fail to be brought to an explicit issue before the 
responsible governing body of the institution.” 
Taking up the general question of the accountability of the college 
administration to the public the committee remarks, apropos of 
President Warfield’s intimation that it was improper for persons 
not connected with the college to ask or for him to answer “ ques- 
tions concerning the college or its members”: 
The attitude thus assumed does not seem to this committee one which can 
with propriety be maintained by the officers of any college or university toward 
the inquiries of a representative national organization of college and university 
teachers and other scholars. We believe it to be the right of the general body 
of professors of philosophy and psychology to know definitely the conditions 
of the tenure of any professorship in their subject; and also their right and 
that of the public, to which colleges look for support, to understand un- 
equivocally what measure of freedom of teaching is granted in any college; 
and to be informed as to the essential details of any case in which creedal re- 
strictions other than those to which the college officially stands committed are 
publicly declared by responsible persons to have been imposed. 
REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE OF AMERICAN ECONOMIC AND OTHER ASSOCIATIONS. 
A more extended discussion of the general principles involved 
appeared in the preliminary report rendered in December, 1914, by 
the joint committee on academic freedom and academic tenure ap- 
pointed by the American Economic Association, the American 
Sociological Society, and the American Political Science Association. 
The committee found the subject more complex than has hitherto 
been assumed. Like the committee of the American Philosophical 
Association and the American Psychological Association this com- 
mittee also recognized that the problem does not exist in institutions 
“under obligations to teach denominationalism” or “designed to 
spread specific doctrines of any kind.” In other types of institu- 
tions there is a very real problem which is likely to lead to contro- 
versy in the case of any instructor whose utterances run counter to 
accepted standards. Instructors in the field of economics and po- 
litical science are at the present time especially in danger. The 
committee examines the difficulties which prevent a dogmatic solu- 
tion and finds the “nature of employment and tenure of a college 
or university teacher” to be the most fundamental point in the 
problem.’ Here there are two views: One that “academic teaching 
is a purely private employment resting on a contract between the em- 
ploying authority and the teachers”; the other that “academic 
teaching must be regarded as a quasi public official employment in 
which the original appointment is made by the authorities, who are 
bound to act not as private employers, or from private motives, but 
as public trustees.” The report then formulates certain queries
-P-A-G-E-181
HIGHER EDUCATION. 161 
which the committee believes must be answered before a definite 
agreement on the question is reached: 
1. Ought an academic teacher ever to be dismissed at all; or ought he to be 
virtually irremovable, as in the continental universities? 
2. Ought a distinction to be drawn in this respect between a college and a 
university teacher, between an officer of high grade and one of low grade, be- 
tween an officer of long standing and one of recent tenure? 
3. If such a distinction is permissible, ought an academic teacher of long 
standing ever to be dismissed without the payment of a pension? 
4, Ought an academic teacher of any grade ever to be summarily dismissed 
by the authorities without hearing or trial? 
5. If there is to be a hearing or trial, ought this to be before the university 
authorities or before some tribunal representing the real interests of scholar- 
ship? 
6. Ought an academic teacher to be dismissed without public declaration of 
the reasons therefor; and, if not, ought the reasons alleged ever to be a mere 
pretext, even if suppression of the real reason is in the supposed interest of the 
individual himself? 
The committee records its conclusions that in previous cases of con- 
troversy on the question of academic freedom and tenure mistakes 
have been made on beth sides, and that “the chief difficulty arises 
from a failure of academic teachers as well as of academic authorities 
to observe the duties no less than the rights of their position.” 
_ The committee asked to be continued and was reappointed for 
further study of the subject. 
THE UTAH CASE. 
The impersonal and judicial study of the general issue of academic 
freedom which the committee contemplated was, by an untoward 
event, suddenly transformed into the investigation of .a concrete 
case of. the violation of that freedom. The committee was also 
practically merged into a new committee representing a new asso- 
ciation. 
In the early part of 1915 the American Association of University 
Professors was constituted, with Prof. John Dewey, of Columbia, as 
president, and Prof. A. O. Lovejoy, of Johns Hopkins, as secretary. 
In view of the widely representative character of the association, in- 
cluding as it does specialists in all lines and standing for the promo- 
tion of the ideals and the defense of the interests of the profession 
as a whole, it was felt that the investigation of the problem of aca- 
demic tenure and academic freedom was an especially appropriate task 
for the association to undertake. The president, therefore, appointed 
a committee of 15, which was to include the joint committee of 9 
of the other associations. Prof. Seligman, of Cclumbia, who was 
chairman of the joint committee of 9, was made chairman of the new 
12034°—xp 1915—vort 1——11
-P-A-G-E-182
  162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
committee. It later developed that two members of the joint com- 
mittee were ineligible to membership in the new committee of 15. 
“Tt was, therefore, resolved to continue both committees for the 
present; the old joint committee of 9 to act with the new committee 
of 15 on all questions which might seem to be common to both com- 
mittees, and, on the other hand, to act separately whenever it might 
seem wise.” Then occurred the event which precipitated the action 
of the new committee. 
The board of regents of the University of Utah, on March 17, 1915, 
on the president’s recommendation, dismissed four members of the 
faculty of that institution, and demoted one. On March 18 and 
within 5 weeks thereafter 17 other members of the faculty resigned 
from positions in protest against this action. President Dewey con- 
sidered the situation so significant that he appointed a special sub- 
committee of seven, consisting of the following persons: Prof. E. R. 
A. Seligman, of Columbia University, chairman; Prof. John Dewey, 
of Columbia University; Prof. Frank A. Fetter, of Princeton Uni- 
versity; Prof. J. P. Lichtenberger, of the University of Pennsy!- 
vania; Prof. A. O. Lovejoy, of Johns Hopkins University; Prof. 
Roesco Pound, of Harvard University, and Prof. Howard C. Warren, 
of Princeton University, to investigate and report on it. 
A preliminary report of the findings of this committee appeared 
in The Nation June 8, 1915, and in School and Society June 12, 1915. 
The full report was published as a-separate pamphlet in July. While 
the ramifications of this affair as set down in the report are so numer- 
ous and complicated that a summary of it is impossible within the 
limits of the present chapter, certain documents in the case and the 
findings of the committee relative to the general questions of tenure 
and academic freedom are worth noting. 
It appears that appointments at the University of Utah are, under 
the laws of the State, for a period of one year and terminable at 
the will of the board of regents even before the expiration of that 
term. The power conferred upon the board by this statute has, 
however, never been exercised. Indeed, there has always been, in 
the case of persons of professorial rank, “a definite presumption 
of continuous reappointment. after a certain number of years of 
satisfactory service.” But there are no statutes or permanent regula- 
tions of the governing board defining the grounds for dismissal. 
The committee comments: “In this sense, the government of this 
university, like that of many others in America, is a government of 
men and not of laws.” The kind of action with reference to dis- 
missals which is possible under this sort of government was illus- 
trated when the president recommended that “two instructors, 
Messrs. Snow and Bing be not reappointed; and also recommended
-P-A-G-E-183
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 163 
the dismissal of two associate professors, Messrs. Knowlton and 
Wise, and stated the charges against these professors as follows: — 
First. Dr. A. A. Knowlton. The following are the reasons why I do not 
nominate Dr. A. A. Knowlton for reemployment: I am convinced that Dr. Knowl- 
ton has worked against the administration of the university. Dr. Knowlton 
has also spoken very disrespectfuily of the chairman of the board of regents. 
My opinion is that respect is due the regents, especially their presiding officer, 
from the faculty; and that therefore the author of such remarks should not 
be retained in the employment of the university. 
Second. Associate Prof. George C. Wise. I can not recommend Prof. George 
©. Wise for reemployment in the university for reasons as follows: I am con- 
vinced that Prof. Wise has spoken in a depreciatory way about the university 
before his classes and that he has also spoken in a very uncomplimentary way 
about the administration. 
The committee summarizes the grounds regarded by President 
Kingsbury as proper for public charges followed by dismissal, thus: 
(a) Speaking in a very uncomplimentary way about the administration; (0) 
speaking very disrespectfully of the chairman of the board of regents; (c¢) 
speaking in a depreciatory way of the university before classes; (d@) working 
against the administration. 
The committee, after a careful sifting of the evidence bearing upon 
the truth of these charges, the fairness and wisdom of the president’s 
action, and the board’s attitude toward the demands of the dismissed 
professors for an investigation and toward dismissals in general, thus 
summarizes its findings: 
(a) Of the four charges which were given by the president of the university 
as his reasons for recommending the dismissal of professors, three specified no 
proper grounds for such action and the fourth is without basis in fact. 
(b) The president of the University and the chairman of the board of regents, 
by their recent action, virtually gave notice that the expression by a professor 
in private conversation of an unfavorable opinion of their qualifications for 
office would be a ground for dismissal. This action, unjustified in general, the 
committee regards as peculiarly unsuitable in officials of a State university. 
(ce) The governing body of the university has publicly declared that in cases 
of serious friction between officers and teachers of the university, it is not con- 
cerned to know “ who is right and who is wrong in the disagreement,” but only 
to secure harmony, by eliminating from the university those whose services it 
believes to be relatively less valuable. This, in the light thrown upon its prac- 
tical meaning by recent action of the board, appears to the committee equivalent 
to a formal announcement that considerations of equity have not been, and will 
not be, taken account of by the board in cases involving the relations of the 
president of the university to the faculty. 
(d) The board has, however, given two irreconcilable versions of its atti- 
ture on March 17 toward the request for a judicial investigation of the charges. 
The first version is that, in view of the board’s adoption of the.last-mentioned 
principle, no investigation could alter the essential consideration upon which 
the board based its action, and that, in fact, the board “refused to be forced 
into a public, or any, investigation.” The other version is that an opportunity 
for an investigation was actually afforded the professors accused and was
-P-A-G-E-184
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
rejected. The committee finds that, though the professors accused were in- 
vited to appear at a meeting of the board, no proper investigation into the 
truth of the charges has ever been made either by the president or by the 
board of regents. 
(e) The board now appears to regard either two or three of the charges 
as “not constituting proper grounds for terminating a professor’s connection 
with the university.” It has aiso received, through this committee, the sworn 
statement of the professor against whom the fourth charge was made, cate- 
gorically denying the truth of the charge. The board nevertheless refuses to 
withdraw this charge, to present evidence in support of it, or to reopen the 
eases of the professors against whom these four charges were brought. 
(f) The evidence shows that under the present administration, unverified 
gossip, coming from persons unwilling to assume public responsibility for 
their statements, has played an unfortunate part in the affairs of the Univer- 
sity of Utah, and that Prof. Knowlton was dismissed without ever being per- 
mitted to know who were his accusers in the case of the principal charge 
against him, 
(g) In its published statement, issued on March 17, in explanation of the dis- 
missals, the board denied the limits of freedom of speech in the university in 
such a way as to justify any member of the faculty in resigning forthwith. 
With regard to the last-mentioned point, the committee in another 
place quotes at length the board’s “ novel conception of the meaning 
of freedom of speech”: 
It is argued to the board that professors and instructors should have the 
right of free thought, free speech, and free action. This can not be, and is 
not, questioned. The board, however, has the same rights. These privileges 
are reciprocal. When the rights of the two clash, then it, is for the board to 
determine which is right and which course serves, or is inimical to, the best 
interests of the university. Some one must have the right and the responsi- 
bility to decide such matters, and the law has vested it in the board. Prof. 
Wise, for instance, has seen fit to belittle the university and to speak in an 
uncomplimentary way about the administration. That is his privilege. It is 
also the right and privilege of the board to say that his course is wrong and 
refuse longer to employ him. Prof. Wise may then go to another institution 
and State where his views and those of the governing board may coincide, if 
there is any place where the employee is permitted to belittle the institution 
that employs him and to criticize its management unjustly. 
What has just been said applies also to Dr. Knowlton, who has seen fit to 
speak very disrespectfully, if not insultingly, of the chairman of the board of 
regents. From his standpoint, this doubtless means that he has exercised his 
inalienable rights of free thought, free speech, and free action; but the presi- 
dent and the board have also an equal right to free thought, free speech, and 
free action, with the result that the president and the board do not agree with 
Dr. Knowlton’s sentiments. He may hereafter find an institution and State 
where similar sentiments against the presiding officer of the governing board 
may be approved. If so, that is where he belongs. 
As bearing upon the obligations of boards of regents or trustees to 
faculty members and to the general public, two passages in the com- 
mittee’s preliminary report are especially interesting. The first is: 
One of the causes of the resignation of members of the university faculty was 
the existence of conditions before March 17, such that the faculty had no
-P-A-G-E-185
HIGHER EDUCATION. 165 
proper means of bringing its views on university matters—when its views 
differed from those of the president—to the notice of the governing body. It 
was, in the opinion of the resigning professors, partly in consequence of those 
conditions that the board on March 17 took action which those professors re- 
garded as unjust to individuals and injurious to the interests of the university. 
Since the resignations the board has adopted radical and excellently conceived 
alterations in the plan of administration of the university. These changes 
should give the University of Utah an exceptionally advanced position among 
American colleges in respect to provision for consultation between faculty and 
trustees. * * * The committee deems itself bound in simple justice to note 
that the credit for whatever benefits may accrue to the university from the 
reforms mentioned must be given primarily to the professors who by their 
resignations made effective protest against the antecedent conditions, certain of 
which these reforms are designed to correct. 
The second passage reads: 
One of the gravest and most regrettable features of the crisis at this uni- 
versity, in the committee’s opinion, is the attitude still maintained by the board 
of regents toward numerous petitions asking for a thorough public investigation 
of the recent incidents and of general university conditions. These petitions 
* * * the board has in all cases.rejeeted, declaring that it alone is respon- 
sible for the management of the university ; that it has no doubts as to the cor- 
rectness of its past action and the rectitude of its own motives and those of the 
president; and that it therefore can not permit its action to be influenced by 
protests coming from others. This position seems to the committee to show that 
the board fails to understand, or at least to act upon, three fundamental facts, 
namely: That every institution of public education, and especially a State uni- 
versity, requires for its success the confidence and respect of the public; that 
there can be no sure hold upon public confidence without an unflinching readi- 
ness to face publicity in regard to all official acts and policies; and that the only 
effective way in which any public body can meet serious charges brought by 
responsible persons is by not merely permitting, but demanding, a searching and 
open inquiry into its methods. 
THE NEARING CASE, 
Another case of the dismissal+ of a professor without assigned 
cause, which has aroused, if possible, even greater public interest 
than the Utah situation, has recently occurred at the University of 
Pennsylvania. On June 14, 1915, the board of trustees voted not to 
reappoint Dr. Scott Nearing, assistant professor of economics, for 
the academic year 1915-16. No official explanation of the action 
of the board had been made by the end of the year covered by this 
review. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania are appointed 
for an indefinite term. Assistant professors and other officers of in- 
struction, unless a term of two or three years is specified, are ap- 
pointed for a single year. Dr. Nearing was promoted from an 
instructorship to an assistant professorship in June, 1914. He was 
unanimously recommended by the dean and faculty of the Wharton 
  
1Technically Prof. Nearing was not dismissed, but failed of reappointment at the end 
of a one-year term of service. Actually, in view of the past practice of the trustees of 
the University of Pennsylvania, the failure to reappoint was tantamount to a dismissal, 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
166 EDUCATION BEPOBT, 1915. 
School, on the staff of which he served, for reappointment. The 
board has, as a rule, accepted the recommendations of these officers 
in the matter of appointments. In the present instance, also, it ap- 
pears to have made no criticism of Dr. Nearing’s ability as a teacher. 
His dismissal, therefore, is generally assumed to have been voted on 
other grounds. 
Because of Dr. Nearing’s public advocacy of child-labor laws and 
his indictment of various other forms of industrial injustice—activi- 
ties which have been sharply criticized in the past by certain of the 
more conservative elements among the constituency of the univer- 
sity—the press of the East and various groups of alumni, faculty, 
and students have assumed that these activities constitute the grounds 
for his dismissal. The issue has been interpreted as one of free 
speech. The case has seemed to the friends of academic freedom to 
be of sufficient importance to justify its investigation by a committee 
of the American Association of University Professors. Pending 
the report of such a committee no attempt is made here to estimate 
the justice of the conflicting claims. Certain statements of members 
of the board and of officials of the general alumni association con- 
cerning the limits of freedom of speech and the authority and re- 
sponsibility of boards of trustees of endowed universities are, how- 
ever, not without interest. 
George Wharton Pepper, a member of the board—in answer to an 
appeal by Harrison S. Morris, one of the trustees of the estate of 
Joseph Wharton who endowed the Wharton School, that Mr. Pepper 
place himself at the head of a movement to restore and assure free 
speech at the university—thus interprets “ free speech”: 
If by free speech is meant the unrestricted right of the teacher to adopt any 
method he pleases for the propagation of any view he happens to hold, then 
I could not bring myself to advocate such license, either at the university or 
anywhere else. Conceivably, a man might feel himself justified in advocating 
a disregard of moral principles regarded by the rest of us as fundamental. 
If, on the other hand, free speech means the right to proclaim views not dis- 
cordant with the ethical sense of the community and so proclaimed as to eyi- 
dence due consideration for the sensibilities of those holding different views, 
I shall be happy to enlist in a campaign for free speech at the university or 
anywhere else where the right appears to be in jeopardy. 
J. Levering Jones, a member of the board, is thus quoted by the 
Philadelphia Public Ledger of June 19, 1915, on the accountability 
of the trustees: 
The University of Pennsylvania is not a public institution. It is only quasi- 
public. We are answerable only to our own sense of duty and responsibility. 
No one has the right to question us.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 167 
In February, 1914, the Alumni Register, the organ of the general 
alumni association, says editorially, under the title “The Professors’ 
-Union”: 
There has been much in the public press recently of their [college professors] 
forming a “union,” to force the right of free speech and to maintain the 
security of their positions under all circumstances. There is talk of their 
cowardice in surrendering to the views of trustees and rich benefactors in 
their teachings. * * * It is a curious development for those of high educa- 
tion, rare culture, and sound minds to catch the popular desire for the employed 
to manage the employers and to attribute to distinguished gentlemen of char- 
acter and ability qualities which are the creation of the ordinary popular hys- 
teria. . It seems simple and elementary to believe that a man should do the 
things he is employed to do and for which he accepts remuneration, * * * 
The mania for making laws to reform the universe has been unbridled, with- 
out regard to the economic fallacies involyed in the proposed statutes. * * * 
We should look to our seats of higher learning to educate men to meet these 
problems with balance and a wisdom just to all. Their solving is not easy 
or superficial or quick, and it is a courageous thing for the trustees of a uni- 
yersity to stand firm for sound thought and a guarded education in these 
erises, as against the whim of popular fancy. 
Another and contrasting view of the limits of academic freedom 
has recently emanated from a neighboring institution. In answer 
to Prof. Kuno Meyer, of the University of Berlin, who had raised 
a question in connection with matter appearing in a university publica- 
tion, President Lowell, of Harvard, thus defines Harvard’s attitude 
on freedom of speech: 
As you are aware, the freedom of speech of neither the professors nor the 
students in any American university is limited, nor are they themselves sub- 
ject in their utterances to the direction of the authorities. On the contrary, 
we have endeavored to maintain the right of all members of the university 
to express themselves freely without censorship or supervision by the authori- 
ties of the university. * * * This policy of freedom of speech we shall 
continue to pursue, for we believe it to be the only one which accords with 
the principle of academic freedom.

CHAPTER VII. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
By SAMUEL CHESTER PARKER, 
Dean of the College of Education of the University of Chicago. 
ConTeNnts.—I. Notable local events: Opening of Peabody College for Teachers—Radical 
progress in Ohio—Opening of University of Wisconsin high school—Normal-school 
surveys in Wisconsin and Missouri—Contract renewed between Teachers’ College and 
Columbia University. II. General progress: Increased professional requirements for 
teachers’ certificates—Increased facilities for practice. teaching—Teacher-training 
courses in high schools—Differentiated courses for primary and upper-grade teach- 
ers—Advancing entrance requirements professionalize the normal schools-—-Extension 
courses for teachers in service —Generous appropriations for buildings-—Courses for 
improving college teachers. 
In this brief chapter it is proposed, first, to describe certain 
notable local events or developments in the training of teachers, and 
then to discuss certain more general types of development. 
I, NOTABLE LOCAL EVENTS. 
The local events which will be described are the following: 
1. The opening of the Peabody Teachers College at Nashville, 
Tenn. 
2. The adoption of very advanced professional requirements for 
teachers’ certificates in Ohio, and the influence of these require- 
ments on the educational institutions of the State, especially in the 
training of secondary teachers. 
8. The opening of the practice and model high school of the 
University of Wisconsin. 
4, The organization of surveys of two large systems of State nor- 
mal schools, namely, those of Wisconsin and Missouri. 
+. The renewal of the contract between Teachers College of New 
York City and Columbia University in such a form as to define 
more specifically the financial autonomy of Teachers College and to 
assure to Columbia University that its academic standards shall be 
properly conserved. 
OPENING OF PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS, 
The opening of the Peabody Teachers College at Nashville, Tenn., 
will contribute greatly to the progress in general education which 
has prevailed in recent years in the South. Through its specific 
169
-P-A-G-E-190
  170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
training of teachers of all grades and its general stimulating effect 
upon the teachers in the field, the new institution will no doubt 
become the center for this educational progress. President Bruce 
R. Payne has furnished, upon request, the following statement con- 
cerning the opening of the new Teachers College: 
1. The new George Peabody College for Teachers was opened on its present 
campus June 25, 1914. 
2. The college has the following assets: Approximately $500,000 invested in 
land, approximately $900,000 invested in buildings and equipment, and a 
$2,000,000 endowment fund. 
8. Peabody College cooperates with Vanderbilt University, whose campus 
adjoins that of the college, in providing all of the academic subjects usually 
needed by teachers. Students registered in Peabody may avail themselves for 
the same fee of all the courses in Vanderbilt, and those registering in Vanderbilt 
may likewise profit by the work in Peabody. It is left, then, to Peabody to 
supply the technical work in education and such special subjects as teachers 
need which are not given in the academic courses at Vanderbilt University. 
4, In addition to the work ordinarily found in teachers’ colleges, Peabody 
makes a special feature of the study of country life, which is provided in the 
Seaman A. Knapp School of Country Life. 
5. During the first college year, just closed, under this method of organization 
the following courses and subjects were available for Peabody students, either 
at Peabody or in Vanderbilt:

RADICAL PROGRESS IN OHIO. 
The recent legislation in Ohio contemplates a complete system for 
the training of teachers, including prospective elementary teachers 
in rural and city schools, prospective high-school teachers, and © 
untrained teachers in the field. The advanced standards prescribed 
in the law created feverish activity in the organization of profes- 
sional courses by the public educational institutions and by the large 
number of private colleges of the State. Among the most striking 
features of the law are: (1) The large amount of professional and 
semiprofessional work required of a prospective high-school teacher 
(namely, one-fourth of his college course for the Bachelor’s degree) ; 
and (2) the fact that this professional work must include a definite 
amount of actual practice teaching, namely, at least 27 hours. 
OPENING OF UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN HIGH SCHOOL. 
The new high school for educational experimentation and for 
observation and practice teaching recently opened at the University 
of Wisconsin is a notable investment by a State university in an 
effort to provide practice teaching upon a large scale. About two- 
thirds of the whole building has been completed at a cost of approxi- 
mately $140,000. The following quotations from official bulletins 
describe the work of the school: 
The Wisconsin High School is maintained by the university as an integral 
part of the course for the training of teachers. The school has been in operation 
since September, 1914, in a building especially equipped for its purposes. The 
Wisconsin High School is a secondary school based essentially upon a six-year 
elementary school, There are six classes or grades constituting a unified six- 
year high-school program of studies, Pupils in the lower years do not have 
typical seventh and eighth grade work, but the beginnings of high-school work 
under departmental teaching. They are under the same general regulations 
and discipline as older pupils.
-P-A-G-E-192
  172. EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Novel form of directed teaching—In order to provide for the 
large number of prospective teachers that graduate annually from 
the University of Wisconsin, a scheme was devised which is intended 
to provide the maximum amount of practical contact with and train- 
ing in teaching, and at the same time a minimum amount of actual 
teaching by the student-teachers. This scheme requires the college 
student to participate continuously as a member of a high-school 
class. He must be prepared to recite or teach at any moment. Cer- 
tain features of this scheme are described as follows: 
The first requirement of students is a proved familiarity with the subject 
matter of instruction. Such daily preparation is required as will enable them 
to deal rapidly and effectively with the facts and skills of the subject. The 
test of such ability lies in practical demonstration. The student is called upon 
to participate in the performances of the class as a regular member of the group, 
and to respond in terms of knowledge, skill, and appreciation of the subject 
matter. 
Attention is directed to the elements of instruction, methods of learning, and 
: factors in class management. The various phases of teaching are studied with 
reference to the concrete conditions of the classroom. For example, daily 
preparation is made with the expectation of occupying the position of the 
teacher in the group, as well as the position of the pupil. The student is given 
a rigid and protracted discipline in these two essential aspects of the classroom. 
More specifically, students are called upon, with or without previous notice, 
to meet all sorts of real situations in the class—e. g., to answer questions; 
present topics in the lesson; quiz the class; develop types of work; summarize a 
review; illustrate by means of objective material; check results; analyze per- 
formances of pupils, locating difficulties and suggesting ways of meeting them; 
in short, to take the next step in developing either a lesson or any other phase 
of the teaching process. 'The effectiveness with which these various typical 
situations are met constitutes the principal basis of estimating teacher qualities 
and teacher possibilities. 
In frequent conferences with demonstration teacher, principal, and special 
supervisor, students are assisted in the analysis and interpretation of principles 
and methods of teaching. These conferences are based upon the circumstances 
of actual teaching. Intending teachers are given the benefits of the judgment 
and experience of those charged with the immediate responsibilities for the 
direction and control of the laboratory facilities provided in the school. 
    NORMAL-SCHOOL SURVEYS IN WISCONSIN AND MISSOURI. 
Surveys of the two large systems of State normal schools in Wis- 
consin and Missouri mark the beginning of systematic efforts to 
determine precisely the character of the work of such institutions 
and their effectiveness in achieving economically the purposes for 
which they are organized. 
The Wisconsin survey—tThe report of the Wisconsin survey * com- 
prises 12 chapters, an appendix of 15 exhibits and 10 statistical tables, 
and numerous other tables. The State map is frequently used to

show the distribution of several types of data concerning the survey. 
The topics of the chapters are: : 
Normal school survey ; development of a system; summary of survey findings; 
Wisconsin’s debt to normal schools; administration of normal-school system; 
the student body; faculty members; questionnaire replies by normal department 
instructors; the training school; courses of study; supervision of classroom 
instruction; character of classroom instruction. 
The exhibits present: 
Courses of study; results of examinations given to students who entered 
Wisconsin normal school in September, 1913; replies in psychology test; steno- 
graphic report of a recitation in psychology (three exhibits) ; replies of students 
in pedagogy test; replies of students in psychology test; replies of students in 
history tests; stenographic report of recitation in civics; lists of books in 
children’s literature; schedules prepared by the accountant of the board of 
regents for the annual proceedings and biennial report; classroom instruction 
card; extracts from students’ physiology notebooks; cost of instruction per 
student recitation hour. 
The statistical tables present: 
Data on length of teaching service of graduates and nongraduates ;. residence 
of students enrolled in normal schools, by counties; residence of students en- 
rolled in normal schools, by cities and towns; academic and professional train- 
ing of public-school teachers employed during school year 1913-14; relation 
of teachers’ training to salary; relation of salary to length of teaching service; 
academic and professional training of teachers in one-room rural schools; 
teaching experience and tenure in present positions of teachers in one-room 
rural schools; ages of students entering normal schools, September, 1913; 
positions held by normal-school graduates and nongraduates in public schools 
during school year 1913-14, 
The report presents a summary of its findings and details the 
suggestions making up the constructive program for directing the 
next steps taken toward the improvement of the work of the normal 
schools. These are grouped under four headings: Service rendered 
by the normal schools; forward steps taken by the board of normal 
regents; conditions needing attention; and constructive suggestions. 
An indication of the amount of service rendered by the normal schools in 
supplying trained teachers for the Wisconsin public schools is indicated by 
the fact that 48 per cent of the teachers outside of one-room rural schools, 
supplying information to the survey, are graduates of the normal schools, 
occupying administrative positions, teaching in high schools, or in grades of 
elementary schools; and approximately one-fourth of the 6,639 teachers in 
one-room rural schools are either graduates or have received partial training in 
the normal schools. 
During the past two years the board of regents of the normal schools has 
adopted a new and more scientific system of accounting; a new plan for legis- 
lative appropriations for normal-school purposes; appointed. a business agent; 
appointed three inspectors for the purpose of inspecting and reporting conditions 
to the board as to the character and quality of the work done within the 
normal schools; changed the entire policy of teacher training by creating pri- 
mary, grammar, and high-school departments so as to separate students into
-P-A-G-E-194
  174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
groups who are preparing to teach in different grades of public school work; 
abolished (February, 1914) the courses known as the Latin, the German, and 
the English courses, which had continued for 21 years, and also the two-year 
college course in three of the normal schools; prohibited the organization of 
classes which enroll fewer than 10 students, except by special arrangement of 
the committee on courses of study; raised the entrance requirements of the 
rural-school course, to take effect September, 1915. 
The constructive suggestions of the report center around one 
principal recommendation: “The. most urgent need of the normal- 
school system is that the regents definitely ascertain the State’s need 
for teachers, and, in cooperation with other State institutions whose 
business it is to train teachers, formulate a comprehensive program 
for meeting these needs.” The definite suggestions developing from 
this may be summarized as follows: 
Present needs should be ascertained and future needs anticipated, including 
the need for teachers in special schools. This study should be based on definite 
budget appropriations. Further study should be made of the quality of service 
rendered by the normal-school graduates. Extension work should be carried 
on by each normal school in its own territory. Courses of study should be 
changed on the basis of the point that mastery of the subject matter to be taught 
is of the first importance in the training of teachers. The attempt to meet 
university requirements in the courses for training teachers should cease. 
Work in observation courses needs to be organized. Presidents should be re- 
lieved of clerical work. Demonstrated skill in teaching and a knowledge of 
the problems of elementary schools should become a prime requisite in the 
selection of normal-school teachers. Salaries should be increased and the 
working programs of instructors made lighter. The basis for judging the 
efficiency of individual schools should be changed. The poor janitor service 
should be improved. Some provision for the retirement and pensioning of 
teachers, instructors, and administrative officers of the normal-school system 
should be made.* 
In discussing the Wisconsin normal schools survey Prof. ©. H. 
Judd says: 
The most extensive study which has ever been made of a State system of 
normal schools is reported in a thick volume of 653 pages issued by the State 
Board of Public Affairs of the State of Wisconsin. This report contains a 
great deal of material which was collected from all of the normal schools of 
the State. The material is of various types. Much of it is the personal views 
of presidents or other officers on matters which were covered by series of ques- 
tions. There are maps showing the sections of the State from which students 
come and maps showing the distribution of graduates. There are reports of 
recitations heard in the various normal schools, in some cases stenographic re- 
ports. The courses of study, the training of teachers and distribution of their 
work, the organization of the normal school and of the practice school are 
among the important topics discussed. 
The report describes the survey as a cooperative undertaking. The director 
of the survey was Mr. A. N. Farmer, who almost immediately after the com- 
pletion of the report was employed by the State normal school board as a kind 
of general overpresident of the whole system of the State. 
‘From analysis prepared by HE, F, Buchner. For other surveys see Ch. XVIII.

: The report contains a great mass of material. Scarcely anyone but the 
technical student of educational administration will read it through. The 
tables in the appendix and the maps and earlier chapters will be consulted by 
anyone who wishes to get at details. The impression grows on one, however, as 
he tries to use the material, that there is very little organization and generali- 
zation. The very richness of the material is baffling. * * * 
It is appropriate to comment on the great need of intelligent general discus- 
sion of the problems of normal schools. These institutions have long been iso- 
lated from other higher institutions of learning, and there has not been such 
insistent demand made upon them that they organize themselves uniformly as 
there has been in the case of colleges and high schools. It is to be hoped that 
the Wisconsin survey marks the opening of a period of vigorous study of 
normal-school problems. 
The Missouri survey by the Carnegie F oundation.—The investiga- 
tion of the training of teachers in Missouri grew out of the efforts 
of former State Superintendent Evans and a committee which he 
had appointed to consider this matter. About the time the committee 
began its work Mr. Evans learned that the Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching contemplated a survey of certain 
Western States and asked its consideration of Missouri as a favorable 
field for study. Upon invitation of the governor the foundation 
agreed to undertake the investigation. At a large meeting of repre- 
sentatives of various educational interests of the State the hearty 
cooperation of all concerned was pledged to the movement. In 
speaking of the situation Supt. Evans said in his last report: 
The resources of the foundation, the standing of its officers, and the personal 
interest of its president because of early associations prompt the forecast that 
conclusions of moment to the cause of public education here and elsewhere 
will result from the survey. Just how any work that has been prosecuted in 
good faith can suffer is not apparent. We may well look for the discovery of 
some things overlooked that one from the outside will readily find. It is recog- 
nized that we are all working for the improvement of conditions for the rising 
generation, and anything that we should know for their good should be welcome. 
We all know this is true and want the knowledge, whether it ministers to our 
self-esteem or not. 
The foundation has had a large staff of expert investigators at 
work upon the Missouri survey for some time. It is planned to make 
a similar study of the training of teachers in Indiana and compare 
the two situations. The excellent body of statistical material that 
will be secured from these two States should contribute an excellent 
basis for comparative studies in other States. 
CONTRACT RENEWED BETWEEN TEACHERS COLLEGH AND COLUMBIA 
UNIVERSITY. 
The renewal of the contract. between Teachers College of New 
York City and Columbia University is of interest because of the 
prominence of the institutions concerned and because the type of 
affiliation they represent is peculiar and has not been imitated to
-P-A-G-E-196
    176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
any considerable extent in the organization of other colleges for 
teachers connected with great universities. During the early part 
of the year 1915 a prolonged debate occurred between representatives 
of the two institutions concerning the renewal of the contract. The 
Teachers College authorities desired to retain their financial inde- 
pendence, but at the same time enjoy the benefits of the educational 
affiliation with the great university. The university authorities were 
much concerned to assure the maintenance of its educational stand- 
ards if the affiliation were to continue. The new contract provides 
for both of these-items, the most conspicuous evidence of the main- 
tenance of the educational standards being the provision concerning 
the degree of doctor of philosophy. According to the new plan— 
there is to be established in the faculty of philosophy a department of educa- 
tional research, under the direction of a relatively small number of professors 
chosen by the president from the faculty of education, this new department to 
have charge of candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy, with educa- 
tion as their major interest. 
Different type of affiliation in most institutions—As contrasted 
with Teachers College of Columbia University, in most of the great 
universities of the country the organization for the training of 
teachers is financially and academically as much an integral part of 
the university as are the colleges of arts, literature, and science. In 
the great universities of the West and Middle West, this intimate 
relationship is accepted as a. matter of course and the heartiest co- 
operation with the colleges of arts, literature, and science is main- 
tained. The cause of this becomes evident when one considers the 
following facts: (a) That the greatest teacher-training activity of 
these institutions is in training high-school teachers; (b) that thou- 
sands of such prospective teachers graduate from the colleges of arts, 
literature, and science each year; and (c) even in the most extreme 
cases (Ohio, for example), only one-fourth of the studies of these 
students will be professional, the remaining three-fourths being: 
academic. 
II. GENERAL PROGRESS. 
Striking developments in training of secondary and rural teach- 
ers—While each of the local developments described above is of 
sufficient. importance to justify the separate treatment accorded it, 
several of these developments are typical of certain general move- 
ments in the training of teachers which will be discussed below. The 
most striking general developments in recent progress in the train- 
ing of teachers are found in the training of high-school teachers 
and of rural-school teachers, the former affecting the work of col- 
leges and universities, while the training of rural teachers has re- 
ceived wide-spread recognition through the recent organization of
-P-A-G-E-197
  
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 177 
pedagogical courses in the high schools of many States. As con- 
trasted with these very striking changes, the developments in normal 
schools and city training schools appear to be only the usual gradual 
modifications of certain well-established practices. 
INCREASED PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. 
, Increase in the professional requirements for teachers’ certificates 
deserves first consideration in connection with progress in teacher 
training, because, without increased requirements, there will be little 
increased training, even when the facilities for such training are 
provided. This relation appears in many of the reports concern- 
ing recent changes. The report on Ohio, described above, is the 
most striking example of large increase in training as the result of 
increase in requirements. Other examples are found in the following 
quotations from responses to a questionaire: 
From the University of Alabama.—As a result of the recognition by the State 
department of education of the work done in the school of education in the 
University of Alabama, the number pursuing professional courses has been 
increased more than threefold. 
Concerning: conditions in Maine.—One interesting result of this law [provid- 
ing increased recognition for professional training] was the establishment 
last year of about 10 different centers scattered throughout the State where over 
150 high-school teachers met for a 12-week course in educational psychology 
taught by professors in education from the four colleges. 
Ohanges at the Iowa State Agricultural College—The enrollment in courses 
in education in this institution has increased as follows: Fall semester, 1911, 
15; fall, 1912, 34; fall, 1913, 128; fall, 1914, 190; fall, 1915, 257. 
Schools belonging to the North Central Association now require 15 hours in 
education. This, together with the fact that many of the other schools require 
a first-grade certificate, is leading more of our students to take the required 
20 hours in psychology and education in order to secure the first-grade State 
certificate upon graduation. 
Minnesota normal school crowded as a result of increased requirements.— 
The increase in the amount of professional training demanded for State 
teachers’ certificates has increased the attendance in the normal school at St. 
Cloud by a very appreciable per cent. Our school at present is crowded. The 
recognition given to the advanced diploma from the normal school has also 
sent back into the normal school a large number of our elementary graduates. 
It has also prevented our students from attempting to take any course but the 
full course. 
Iitinois.—The change in the Illinois law caused increase in attendance in 
some classes and withdrawals in others in the Macomb Normal School, as indi- 
cated in the following quotation: “ The new State certificating law for teachers 
in this State provides several ways in which professional training is recognized. 
* * %* The result of this law seems to have done two things. It has caused 
an increased attendance of those interested in securing county certificates. One - 
thing has operated, however, in the opposite direction. The fact that students 
of junior standing in the normal school may receive certificates to teach with- 
out examination has caused a good many juniors who would be in the senior 
class this year otherwise to teach instead of coming to school.”

    178 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Summary of certification laws—A general summary of the laws 
governing the granting of teachers’ certificates to professionally 
trained college graduates is found in a report prepared in December, 
1914, by Prof. Harlan Updegraff for the Society of College Teachers 
of Education.+ 
North Central Association requirements——An. unofficial influence 
of considerable importance in increasing the professional training 
of high-school teachers is the recent action of the North Central Asso- 
ciation of Colleges and Secondary Schools in prescribing a minimum 
amount of professional training for the teachers in the high schools 
of the association. The following statement concerning this action 
was prepared by Prof. Charles H. Judd, secretary of the commission 
of the North Central Association: 
Two years ago the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools incorporated into its requirements for teachers in approved high 
schools a definite statement to the effect that the candidate must be trained 
in courses in education. The wording of the standard is as follows: 
The minimum attainment of teachers of academic subjects shall be equivalent 
to gradvation from a college belonging to the North Central Association of 
Colleges and. Secondary Schools requiring the completion of a four-year course 
of study, or 120 semester hours in advance of a standard four-year high-school 
course, and including at least 11 semester hours in education. This shall in- 
clude special study of the subjéct matter and pedagogy of the subject to be 
taught. Such requirements shall not be construed as retroactive. (For the 
succeeding year the board will interpret courses in education as the same 
courses are interpreted by the colleges and universities offering them, not more 
than six hours’ credit being given for a successful teaching experience.)? 
There are twe points to be noted with regard to this rule. The explicit state- 
ment about the length of the course is intended to prevent the appointment in 
North Central schools of candidates who received their bachelor’s degrees from 
institutions not requiring a full collegiate course or from institutions which are 
not adequately equipped to administer such courses. There are a number of 
teachers’ colleges and normal schools in the territory that grant the bachelor’s 
degree, especially the degree of bachelor of education or bachelor of pedagogy 
without requiring for admission a full high-school course. Many of these 
institutions are applying for admission to the association, A number of the 
standard normal schools were admitted to the association last year. Such 
schools probably conform to the full requirement, but their admission to the 
association raises in very acute form the whole question whether the training 
of secondary teachers ought to go on in these normal schools or colleges. 
In the second place, it is perfectly clear that the intent of this regulation is to 
compel the colleges which prepare teachers to devote some attention to the 
special considerations of pedagogy. 
It may be said that in the enforcement of this rule regarding requirements 
in education a good deal of opposition has been encountered. The rule was 
put into force this year for the first time, and a great many candidates are not 
eligible under the rule. Inspectors have been asked, therefore, throughout the 
year with regard to prospective appointments, and many schools say that they 
are quite unable to fill up their corps of teachers from the available candidates

THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 179 
and yet adhere to these requirements, Undoubtedly further consideration of the 
standard will be asked for at the coming meeting of the association. 'The 
present form of the rule was passed on the suggestion of members of the asso- 
ciation who belong to secondary schools, They desire very earnestly that cap- 
didates for teaching positions shall be trained by the colleges, so that they have 
Some acquaintance with general educational problems. At the present time the 
objection to the rule comes from other officers of secondary schools who are 
unable to fill vacancies and who do not regard the educational courses as neces- 
sary for the equipment of a secondary-school teacher. The whole problem of 
professional training of teachers is therefore likely to be a subject of vigorous 
discussion at the meeting in March, 1916. 
INCREASED FACILITIES FOR PRACTICE TEACHING. 
A necessity even for high-school teachers——The development of 
adequate facilities for practice teaching has been a particularly 
crucial issue during recent years in the organization of training for 
high-school teachers. In many States such practice-teaching facili- 
ties are still merely something to be desired, but in a few, such as 
California, Ohio, and Minnesota, the practice teaching has become an 
absolute necessity since the law requires it of prospective high-school 
teachers. The efforts of Ohio to meet this situation has already been 
described. 
Cooperation with public schools necessary.—tt is obvious that, the 
only method by which adequate facilities can be obtained for the 
practice work of the large numbers of normal-school students who 
graduate annually is by some such cooperative arrangement with 
local schools. One of the most successful of such arrangements is 
that enjoyed by the State normal school at Keene, N. H. It is 
described as follows: 
Our school has added to its practice facilities for next year the remaining 
elementary schools of the city of Keene, so that our practice system now consists 
of the entire elementary-school system of our city, numbering about 1,300 
pupils in some 40 rooms. 
The schools are absolutely under our own control. The city provides build- 
ings and furniture and makes necessary repairs, and also pays the water bills. 
The normal-school authorities have entire charge of the educational part of the 
work—hiring the teachers, fixing the salaries, arranging courses of studies— 
and the city pays the State the tuition for the educating of the city children, 
This tuition is based on the average costs of school facilities of the 11 cities of 
the State. 
In addition to these schools we have one rural schoolhouse in a neighboring 
town, which, with the three rural schools of the city system, gives us four rural 
schools for practice purposes. The teachers of these schools meet together for 
eonference cach Saturday. Every girl is required to practice in one of these 
rural schools before graduating. 
From a few other sources come similar reports of the development 
of cooperative arrangements for practice teaching in the local public

schools. Thus the president of the St. Cloud (Minn.) Normal School 
writes as follows: : 
The cooperative relation between the local schools and the normal school in 
St. Cloud has been for years a marked asset for the normal school. The present 
year shows a request that such practice teaching in city schools should take 
place in all the normal schools of the State, and it is hoped that such cooper- 
ative relations may be established. 
Similarly, the president of the Oshkosh (Wis.) Normal School 
writes: 
We worked out a plan which has now been in operation for a year and 
starting on its second year—a plan of cooperation with the city. We put two 
critic teachers into the grades of the city schools, one in the third grade and 
one in the fifth grade. These teachers have four normal-school students in the 
morning and four in the afternoon for practice teaching. This is the beginning, 
but by it we are able to train 32 teachers for grade positions. We shall be 
ready to extend this plan in the city schools and will have to extend it very soon.   
In several instances State universities have made satisfactory 
arrangements for practice teaching in the local public high schools. 
The University of Indiana was one of the first to do this. Other 
examples are the State agricultural college at Ames, Iowa, and the 
State universities at Vermillion, S. Dak., Moscow, Idaho, Lincoln, 
Nebr., and Iowa City, Iowa. It is quite probable that some such 
type of cooperative arrangement with the local high schools will be 
effected by many State universities in the near future. It seems 
desirable in view of the following conditions: (a) The large number 
of high-school teachers to be trained; (6) the relatively small num- 
ber of high-school pupils available in many college and university 
towns; and (c) the cost of equipping and maintaining a good high 
school. 
Large investments in special training-school buildings—In most 
normal schools at the present time the practice teaching is carried on 
in special training-school buildings, and large sums are invested in 
these. Several normal schools report recent additions of this type. 
At Normal, T1., the State recently completed a training-school build- 
ing costing $140,000 and accommodating a kindergarten of 60 pupils, 
an elementary school of 8 grades with 336 pupils, and a high school of 
230 pupils, all of which are used for training purposes. The Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin High School, described above, is an example of 
a similar investment by a State university. 
The following quotations give examples of universities which seem 
to have both facilities for practice teaching in their own training 
schools and happy cooperative arrangements with the local public 
schools: 
University of Nebraska.—The high school maintained by the university for the 
purpose of providing facilities for practice teaching for candidates who desire to 
enter the field of secondary instruction has been enlarged until it now accommo-

dates a hundred and fifty students yearly, giving a full semester’s practice to 
each, 
Relations have been established with the superintendent of the Lincoln public 
schools whereby 75 to 100 students in the teachers’ college who are preparing to 
teach in the elementary schools are accorded the privilege of a full year’s service 
as apprentices in the Lincoln school system. 
University of Iowa.—The plan of cooperation between the university and the 
Towa City High School, which has been in operation for two years, has been 
extended. At the present time the university is paying a part of the salaries of 
17 of the teachers of the Iowa City High School. Ten of these teachers receive 
an extra stipend of $10 a month. These teachers throw their classes open for 
observation to the students in the course in general methods in the university. 
Hach student in this course is required to make 36 observations in the Iowa City 
High School. These observations are closely supervised by the professor in 
charge of this work. The teachers in the high school who receive the extra 
compensation cooperate in making the observation effective. 
The heads of seven of the departments in the high school are employed by the 
university to teach the courses in special methods in the various subjects. For 
example, the head of the department of English in the local high school teaches 
classes in ‘the teaching of English in the university. The same is true for 
mathematics, manual training, German, music, history, and general science. 
The university pays half the salaries of these heads of departments, and 
we are thus enabled to pay better salaries than are paid in any other high 
schools in the State. 
By the action of the State board of education, an elementary school has been 
. established to be used in connection with the experimental work and observa- 
-tion in connection with the training of school superintendents. The three 
teachers in charge are developing the work in the first six grades. About 80 
superintendents who are in training in the university at the present time will 
be able to utilize this school in gaining first-hand knowledge of standards, 
practices, etc., in the first six grades of the elementary school. 
Ohio.--The county normal training school has the right to use the local 
school for practice work, and the two new State normal schools were located 
in towns in which a permanent agreement to that effect was entered into with 
the local school. Elsewhere the practice work is still hampered by lack of 
cooperation of local schools. Each of the State normals was in 1914 authorized 
to open four one-room model rural schools.

TEACHER-TRAINING COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOLS, 
Prof. Burnham, of the Kalamazoo (Mich.) State Normal School, 
has prepared the following statement on teacher training in high 
schools and in county training schools:* 
The course includes one year of attendance and work, which is made up 
of academic reviews of the elementary school subjects, courses in psychology, 
method and management, illuminated by observation and practice; and special 
instruction, including method in the content subjects recently introduced in 
the rural-school curriculum. The high-school training class is well illustrated 
in Minnesota, which this year has 1384 classes at work. Minnesota began this 
plan in 1905 with 18 classes. The classes enroll about 10 students and are 
taught by carefully selected teachers, usually State normal-school graduates. 
The State supervision is by a woman, who is a specialist in rural education. 
Teachers of these classes are paid up to $1,000 and the supervisor is paid 
$2,000. Minnesota’s commission on education a year ago recommended increas- 
ing the annual State subsidy of these classes from $1,000 to $3,000 and salary 
increases up to $1,200. This commission said that these classes were in the way 
of developing to a point where it will not be necessary for any rural school 
in the State to do without a trained teacher. A good illustration of the county 
normal training class is foul in Michigan. In 1905 eight of these classes 
graduated 84 students, and in 1915 there were 667 graduates from 47 classes. 
The work is, in general, the same as that of the high-school training classes, 
An observation and practice room, with pupils of varying ages and several 
grades under the immediate charge of a competent critic teacher, is a feature 
of the Michigan normal training classes. aSlaries, preparation, and supervi- * 
sion of the teachers are comparable with conditions in Minnesota. Principals 
of the classes are in many cases college or university graduates. The average 
academic advancement of students in these secondary school types of normal 
work is about equivalent to that of the last high-school year. However, many 
students are enrolled in their third high-school year, and there are also a con- 
siderable number who have finished the fourth year. Several States have 
already safeguarded progress from the future retardation which the rapid 
influx of teachers of only secondary-school preparation might involve by 
statutes requiring a graduated increase in preparation, 
  Excellent Missouri syllabus for teacher-training courses——One of 
the most important elements in the success of such pedagogical 
courses is the existence of suitable instructional materials in the 
form of textbooks and syllabii. One of the most notable efforts to 
provide such material is the publication by the State department of 
education in Missouri of a Syllabus for Teacher-Training Courses in 
High Schools, which was prepared by Mr. S. E. Davis, the State 
inspector in charge of this work. 
DIFFERENTIATED COURSES FOR PRIMARY AND UPPER-GRADE TEACHERS. 
Specific vocational courses replacing general courses——In the 
larger normal schools which prepare teachers for city schools one of 
the most important phases of recent progress is the differentiation

  THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 183 
of the curricula and departmental courses so as to prepare the stu- 
dents specifically for the tasks of primary teachers or grammar- 
grade teachers. All of the Wisconsin normal schools have been 
reorganized on this basis. One of the most enthusiastic believers 
in the movement is President Keith, of the Oshkosh (Wis.) Normal 
School, who writes as follows: 
We take all of the students in the normal school who are preparing to teach 
in primary grades and segregate them in classes, and in this way we work out 
the subject matter to be taught and the methods of teaching it in a certain 
group of grades. The thing we were suffering under was the inability of the 
teacher to adapt the work in geography, say, to those who were expecting to 
teach in primary grades, in grammar grades, in high school, simultaneously 
and effectively. As a result of this difficulty, the geography became general- 
ized. It dealt with essentials, it hit the high spots, it was not as vocational 
as it ought to have been, and the constant tendency in normal schools for the 
past 20 or 25 years has been a tendency in the direction of generalization of 
subject matter that would, of course, include the essentials and the funda- 
mentals, but which left not infrequently the group high and dry so far as 
practical ability and insight were concerned. * * * In our own school we 
shall have, after a while, a head of the grammar department with a force of 
teachers associated with him, working primarily for the perfecting of a course 
of study for the adequate training of grammar-grade teachers. 
ADVANCING ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS PROFESSIONALIZE THE NORMAL 
SCHOOLS. 
The rapid development of high schools has made it possible for 
many normal schools to advance their entrance requirements and to 
get rid of the academic high-school courses which they have been 
offering. This process has taken place rapidly in some States and, 
as a consequence, has enabled the normal schools to devote more of 
their energy to purely professional training. An example is Minne- 
sota. The president of a public normal school in that State says: 
A change is in process which will make high-school graduation the condition 
of admission probably after this year. But few students are left in the school 
below this standard. 
Similarly, the president of the Oshkosh (Wis.) Normal School 
writes as follows: 
Our entrance requirements have not exactly changed, but they have become 
effective. Four years ago we abolished the long course at Oshkosh; that is, 
the four-year course for those who were not high-school graduates. We have 
been dealing with a diminishing number in the four-year courses, and at the 
close of summer school graduated the last of these people. 
The State superintendent of Michigan writes as follows: 
Practically every person who enters the State normal schools is a high-school 
graduate, and about 70 per cent of the people who enter the county normal 
schools are high-school graduates. We admit none to the county normal 
schools who have not had at least 11 grades’ preparation. 
Large progress resulting from combination. of above factors—Iin 
many of the States there are found various combinations of the five

  184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
general lines of progress that have been discussed, namely, (1) ad- 
vancing professional requirements for teachers’ certificates, (2) 
increased practice-teaching facilities, (3) teacher-training courses in 
high schools, (4) differentiated courses for primary and grammar- 
grade teachers in normal schools, and (5) advancing entrance re- 
quirements for normal schools. 
EXTENSION COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE. 
Systematic continuous instruction in the form of extension courses 
is provided by a number of State normal schools for teachers in 
service. The normal schools of Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio furnish 
notable examples. The instruction provided is the same as in the 
courses given in the normal-school buildings; but it is given in differ- 
ent centers throughout the State. Thus, the normal school at Bowling 
Green, Ohio, employs a professor of education who spends all his 
time except Sunday in the field. On Monday he meets classes in a 
certain town, on Tuesday in another town, and so on through the 
week, returning to the first town on the next Monday. 
GENEROUS APPROPRIATIONS FOR BUILDINGS, 
The policy of liberal support for the professional training of 
teachers is shown by the appropriations for buildings in several 
States. The president of the State normal school at Kalamazoo, 
Mich., writes as follows: ‘ 
We have just completed a new science building which has cost, with equip- 
ment, $110,000. We also have an additional sum of $480,000 available for build- 
ing and other special purposes at the rate of $80,000 a year for the next six 
years. 
Other Michigan State normal schools enjoy similar grants. 
The State department of New York reports: 
A new building was occupied Id&t year by the Oswego State Normal School, 
and the Buffalo State Normal School also moved into its new building during 
the past year. We also obtained an appropriation to rebuild the old Potsdam 
buildings. 
From Maryland comes the following: 
The Maryland State Normal School, of Baltimore, which was established in 
1866, has removed during this month to a new plant located in the suburbs of 
Baltimore on a tract of about 80 acres. The new buildings have just been 
completed at a cost of $800,000. 
Pennsylvania continues buying private normal schools—Several 
years ago Pennsylvania possessed 13 normal schools that were really 
private institutions enjoying State funds. The State undertook to 
reform this situation and one of the most important phases of the 
reform is described in the following sentence by the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction: “The State has purchased four of our 
normal schools and is about to purchase four more.”

and the University of Minnesota, 
The reports on medical education for the two previous years have 
set forth the remarkable reorganization that medical education has 
undergone during the last 10 years. It was shown that from 1865, 
following the Civil War, the medical colleges in the country 
rapidly ‘multiplied, until in 1906 there were 162 separate institu- 
tions—about half of the world’s supply. Although some of these 
were well-conducted and fairly equipped institutions, a large pro- 
portion were owned by individuals or joint-stock corporations and 
conducted for profit. Entrance standards were ignored in many or 
made a mere matter of pretense; “liberal” rules governed the pro- 
motion and graduation of students; and any student who could pay 
the required fees was acceptable. Free use was made of glowing ad- 
vertiseménts; follow-up letters were sent to large lists of possible | 
matriculants; and agents were sent to offices, workshops, and farms 
to solicit students, for which the colleges paid generous commissions. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that in 1904 the ‘total enrollment in 
all medical colleges had reached the amazing number of 28,142, and 
that in that year there were 5,747 graduates.

  186 5 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
REDUCTIONS IN TEN YEARS. 
Tt was also shown in the previous reports that during recent years 
there has been a marked reduction in these annual totals. There are 
now nearly 50 per cent fewer medical colleges and nearly 40 per cent 
fewer medical students and graduates each year than in 1904. As 
can readily be appreciated, these marked reductions represent an 
equally marked improvement in medical education. In 10 years’ time 
a vast oversupply of medical colleges, many of them sans teachers, 
sans laboratories, sans entrance standards, and sans ideals, has given 
way to a more normal supply of well-equipped medical colleges hav- 
ing skilled teachers, fair admission requirements, larger endowments, 
modern laboratories, and an abundance of hospital and dispensary 
material. Instead of a great army of students, many without even a 
grammar-school education, enticed from more fitting occupations by 
glowing promises of princely incomes, there is now about half the 
number; but practically all these have had a preliminary education 
which enables them to understand the more complex problems of 
medicine." 
FEWER BUT BETTER PHYSICIANS. 
As to the reduction in the number ‘of graduates, it is surely better 
for the public welfare to have a hundred well-trained graduates from 
modern high-grade medical schools than a thousand from low-grade 
institutions. There is no danger of a dearth of physicians, since the - 
number of graduates annually is nearly double the loss of physicians 
by death. But even if the number of graduates were less than the 
annual loss, it would be many years before a dearth would result, 
because of the overcrowded condition of the profession. Statistics 
show that there is now one physician. to every 600 to 650 people in 
this country, as compared with one to every 1,500 to 2,000 people in 
the leading countries of Europe. Even with this marked contrast 
the figures for this country do not include the thousands of osteo- 
paths, chiropractors, naprapaths, and other practitioners.   
1The reader will hardly be able to appreciate how marvelous the improvement in the 
entrance requirements to medical schools has been during the last 11 years unless he is 
first made aware of the fact that in 1904 a very small proportion (not more than 15 or 20 
per cent) of all medical colleges required even a high-school education for admission and 
that only.4 medical colleges (less than 3 per cent of the total number) required for admis- 
sion one or more years of collegiate work, in addition to a high-school education. Now 
90 medical colleges (94.7 per cent of all colleges) are on that standard, and of these 40 
(see chart 1) are requiring two or more years of collegiate work. In 1904 -very little 
was known about the practice of colleges, and such standards as were advocated were 
largely on paper, At that time no systematic check was kept on the methods used by the 
medical schools in administering entrance requirements. Now, through the students’ 
register, kept by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, 
with the ready cooperation of at least 90 per cent of all colleges, the standards actually 
enforced by each college are known, faulty methods or “ paper standards” are discovered 
and corrected or exposed. Instead of being an unknown quantity, therefore, preliminary 
requirements are now known with fair accuracy. There is, of course, still room for im- 
provement in methods of administration and in the securing of still better standards, but 
these matters are being rapidly corrected.

FORCES WHICH PROMPTED IMPROVEMENT. 
During the 80 years (1870-1900) when the number of medical 
‘colleges of inferior type and conducted for profit had so rapidly 
multiplied, the very factors were developing which would eventu- 
ally demand an entirely different type of medical teaching institu- 
tion. Prior to that period, medical knowledge was largely a col- 
lection of clinical observations and theories founded on them. 
Since that time, however, there has been an increase of medical 
knowledge unprecedented in the history of medicine. In fact, dur- 
ing the last three decades of the nineteenth century more progress 
was made as a result of experimental research than in all ages’ 
preceding. 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CELLULAR PATHOLOGY. 
It was at the beginning of this period that Virchow established 
the system of cellular pathology which was based on the study, un- 
der the microscope, of the minute structures of both normal and dis- 
eased tissues of the human body. He demonstrated conclusively 
that the origin of disease was in the primary cell. This established 
‘a correlation between gross and microscopic effects of disease proc- 
esses and also removed the conflict previously existing between 
physiology and pathology. Normal and abnormal tissues are now 
known to have certain common characteristics, in that both are a 
product of growth and have their beginning in the individual cell. 
They differ in that in normal growth simple structures become more 
specialized and complex, while in abnormal growths there is a retro- 
gressive process—complicated or highly specialized structures break 
down or give way to more simple structures—scar-tissue, for example. 
Certain chemical processes are doubtless involved in these changes, 
and a vast field is here still open for investigation. Little by little, 
however, as investigation proceeds, the knowledge of these processes 
is continually widened. 
GERM ORIGIN OF MANY DISEASES ESTABLISHED. 
Bacteria were first discovered in 1688 by Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch 
microscopist, and the knowledge regarding them was added to by 
O. F. Miiller in 1786, by Ehrenberg in 1838, and by Henle in 1840. 
It remained for Louis Pasteur, during the seventh decade of the 
nineteenth century, however, to demonstrate positively the rdle 
played by these microorganisms in such familiar natural processes 
as fermentation, decay, and putrefaction. Formerly these processes 
were believed to be due to “spontaneous generation” of life. The 
results of Pasteur’s researches were so profound as to be properly 
termed sensational. His work marked the beginning of bacteri-
-P-A-G-E-209
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 189 
ology, and this, in turn, has had a revolutionary influence in the 
field of medicine, as well as in man’s conception of the world around 
him. Pasteur’s work attracted the attention of research workers 
to the importance of the study of microorganisms. This interest 
was accelerated in 1876, when Robert. Koch demonstrated conclu- 
sively that a disease in cattle (anthrax, or splenic fever) was caused 
by a specific organism, the bacillus anthracis. It was in 1882, how- 
ever, that experimental research received its second great stimulus by 
Koch’s invention of solid culture media. and his origination of 
methods by which single species of bacteria could be isolated. From 
this time on, reports of discoveries of the germ origin of numerous 
diseases, any one of which was epoch-making in its importance, were 
made in rapid succession. 
Within a few years’ time it had been clearly demonstrated that 
many of the common diseases were caused by certain specific forms 
‘of bacteria, or kindred microorganisms. One need only to mention, 
as examples, such common diseases as diphtheria, typhoid fever, 
cerebrospinal meningitis, lockjaw, and consumption to show how 
profoundly important were the discoveries regarding their causes, 
not only in showing how to prevent the spread of those diseases to 
others but also in the positive methods made available for their 
diagnosis and treatment. For example, the discovery that the 
primary cause of diphtheria was the bacillus diphtheriw has been 
followed by a careful study of the habits of that germ. This has 
resulted not only in preventing the spread of that disease through 
isolation of diphtheria patients, and subsequent disinfection of the 
rooms occupied by them, but also in the knowledge—a fact now gen- 
erally well known—that an opposing substance, called antitoxin, is 
formed in the body to antagonize the germ and its toxins. For 
patients who recover, it is the presence of this antitoxin in the blood. 
which prevents the recurrence of the disease—which gives immunity 
to subsequent attacks. It also has been learned that this antitoxin 
can be formed in the blood serum of healthy animals, such as the 
sheep or the horse, and that, without serious discomfort to those ani- 
mals, large quantities can thereby be prepared in advance for emer- 
gency use. Injections of this antitoxin are used not only as a cure 
for patients who have contracted the disease, but also to immunize 
others who have been exposed to the infection. So highly beneficial 
has been the use of this antitoxin as to make it one of the great 
triumphs of modern medicine.

  MEDICAL EDUCATION. 191 
In typhoid fever, as now is also well known, finding the specific 
microorganism causing the disease led, in turn, to the discovery that 
it was usually transmitted through drinking.water which had been 
contaminated by sewage containing the germs. The prevalence of 
typhoid fever has been greatly diminished through the purification 
of our water supply and the warfare on flies. Although no serum 
or antitoxin has been developed having curative powers equal to the 
diphtheria antitoxin, a vaccine has been prepared which has a high 
protective value. The widest application of this vaccine has been in 
the protection of soldiers in the field. During the Spanish-American 
War, before the days of antityphoid vaccine, in the United States 
Army of 107,973 men there were 20,738 cases of typhoid fever, in- 
cluding 1,580 deaths, or nearly 1 case to every 5 men. During the 
summer maneuvers of 1911 an Army division of 12,800 men occupied 
a camp at San Antonio for about four months. All of the men were 
inoculated with the vaccine, and only one mild case developed, and 
this was before the inoculation had been completed. During the 
same period there were 19 deaths from typhoid fever in San Antonio, 
which shows that typhoid fever was prevalent in the neighborhood. 
In the whole United States Army in 1912 (88,178 men) there were 
only 8 cases of typhoid, and no deaths. 
An immunizing antitoxin is now used with decided benefit in 
tetanus (lockjaw); a curative serum is employed in cerebrospinal 
meningitis; a protective virus, the so-called Pasteur treatment, in 
hydrophobia, and within the past few years a chemical preparation 
has been produced which, if injected under proper safeguards into 
the subcutaneous tissues, produces rapid and remarkable improve- 
ment in cases of syphilis. 
The discovery of the microorganism causing bubonic plague, the 
bacillus pestis, has resulted in finding that the germ is transmitted 
from sick to well persons through the bites of such insects as the 
louse or the flea, and that it is carried from one country to another 
not only by human hosts, but by rats and other vermin which get 
into ships. History shows that in the great epidemic in Europe dur- 
ing 1348-49 nearly twenty-five million people—about one-fourth of 
Europe’s population—died of this disease, then commonly known as 
the “black death.” From the present knowledge of the disease, epi- 
demics are quickly stamped out and its spread is prevented. 
It is now known that malaria, which was formerly attributed to a 
“miasma” arising from swampy tracts, is due to a microorganism, 
the plasmodium malariw, and that the disease is generally trans- 
mitted by mosquitoes (anopheles), which, of course, originate in 
swampy places. The spread of the disease is now prevented by screen- 
ing off patients sick of malaria, thereby preventing mosquitoes from
-P-A-G-E-212
  192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
obtaining and transferring the microorganism. Efforts have .also 
been made to exterminate the mosquitoes. 
The transmission of bubonic plague and malaria by the bites of 
insects led to the discovery that yellow fever, Rocky Mountain fever, 
and typhus fever were transmitted by the bites, respectively, of the 
mosquito (stegomyia calopus), the woodtick, and the louse. The dis- 
covery of these facts in regard to malaria and to yellow fever alone 
has saved thousands of lives, has changed Habana and other tropical 
cities from plague-infested spots to places of safe human habitation, 
and has made possible the completion of the Panama Canal. It must 
be remembered that the part played by the mosquito in the transmis- 
“sion of yellow fever was proved by the immortal work of three phy- 
sicians—Reed, Carroll, and Lazear. To prove Maj. Reed’s theory, 
Carroll and Lazear deliberately allowed mosquitoes which had previ- 
ously bitten yellow-fever patients to settle on their hands and infect 
them with the disease. Both contracted yellow fever, and Lazear died 
a martyr to his zeal. The same is true regarding Ricketts and 
McClintic, who died in their effort to discover the cause and cure of 
Rocky Mountain fever. 
ANTISEPTIC SURGERY. 
Another great field of improvement that has been opened as a re- 
sult of Pasteur’s researches is that of antiseptic surgery. Through 
this department of medicine alone, the number of lives that have been 
saved is incalculable. Operations which formerly were almost in- 
variably fatal, and which were undertaken only in emergencies or as 
a last resort, are now regularly performed with comparative safety 
to the patient. Wound infection, which was formerly a matter of 
course, is now the exceptional occurrence. AIl this had its beginning 
in the work of Lord Lister only a few decades ago, following the re- 
searches of Pasteur and the proof that so many infections and putre- 
factive processes were caused by bacteria. 
A NEW ERA IN MEDICINE. 
The researches of Pasteur and the discoveries since his time have 
practically revolutionized the conception of disease. As the old idea 
of etiology of diseases gave way to the absolute knowledge that many 
of them were due to certain recognized germs, so also the old empirical 
methods of treatment were replaced by more scientific methods, 
methods based on an actual study of the germ causing each disease. 
Chemical preparations or drugs are now put to the test, and only 
those of service are retained. More important still, as already shown, 
great results have been obtained from the investigations in regard to 
antitoxins,. immunizing serums, protective vaccines, and the like. 
Only a bare beginning has been made in this great field and herein 
lies the possibility of still further important discoveries.
-P-A-G-E-213
  MEDICAL EDUCATION. : 193 
MEDICINE NOW ON A SCIENTIFIC BASIS. 
In all these great advances during the last few decades it can be 
seen how much depended not only on ‘the premedical sciences— 
physics, chemistry, and biology—but also on the fundamental medi- 
cal sciences, anatomy, physiology, physiologic chemistry, pharma- 
cology, bacteriology, and pathology. It can be seen how essential 
is a knowledge of these sciences for the modern practitioner of the 
healing art, no matter in what particular branch or method he may 
wish to specialize. No longer does a grade-school education con- 
stitute an adequate preliminary training for those who are to study 
medicine. No longer is a medical college in position to furnish its 
students with a satisfactory training unless it possesses thoroughly 
equipped laboratories in the fundamental medical sciences. No 
longer can. these sciences be taught—as they formerly were—by busy 
practitioners, who can give only their spare time to teaching. So 
extensive now is the work in each of these sciences that they must 
be taught by experts who are paid salaries sufficient to enable them 
to devote their entire time to teaching and to research. It goes with- 
out saying that every student of the healing art, after obtaining his 
training in the fundamental sciences, should also have the oppor- 
tunity of observing and further studying the various diseases of 
patients in hospitals and dispensaries, that he may become proficient 
in the latest improved methods of diagnosis and treatment. 
ESSENTIALS OF A MEDICAL TRAINING. 
The victories of medical research, by which untold thousands of 
human lives have been saved since the days of Pasteur, emphasize 
the great importance of an adequate training for those who are here- 
after to have in charge the care of the sick. The student of medicine 
needs a knowledge of physics, of chemistry, and of biology, since a 
knowledge of these sciences enables him better to master the more 
complex medical sciences. He needs a thorough knowledge of human 
anatomy and physiology, since he must know the normal conditions 
and functions of the body and its various organs; otherwise he will 
not be able to differentiate between normal and abnormal, conditions, 
between health and disease. He must have studied bacteriology and 
pathology, since he must know about the various diseases and their 
bacterial causes. He must have studied physiologic chemistry, since 
he must know the composition and the functions of the various secre- 
tions and substances of the body. He must study pharmacology in 
order that he may know the physiologic action of various chemicals 
and medicinal substances, so that, if medicinal treatment is needed, 
he may apply the preparation which will do the most good. While 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——_13  
-P-A-G-E-214
: 
194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
still under instruction, he should have the opportunity to study the 
various types of disease in dispensaries and at the bedside in hos- 
pitals. While he is still under supervision he should further develop 
skill and reliability and round out his course of medical training 
by at least a year’s experience as an intern, or resident physician, in 
a good hospital. A student who has followed this routine course 
will usually become a safe, efficient, and successful practitioner of 
medicine. If he desires to specialize in any particular class of dis- 
ease or in any particular method of treatment, the course thus out- 
lined should be followed by one or two years of study devoted to the 
desired specialty. 
In brief, anyone who is to undertake the repair of delicate life 
processes of human beings, which are rendered doubly sensitive in 
times of sickness, should have had such a training as will enable him 
(a) to differentiate between normal and abnormal conditions, (b) to 
determine what particular disorder is present, and (c) to be ac- 
quainted with all the approved methods of treatment, so as (d) to 
apply the particular form of treatment which will best meet the needs 
of the patient. To safeguard the interests of the public a no less 
educational training should be countenanced. No other department 
of education needs to be more strictly supervised than medicine, since 
in no other calling does the practitioner assume to such a degree the 
responsibility for the lives of human beings and in no other profes- 
. sion can bungling or ignorance work such havoc. This responsi- 
bility has been emphasized since the marvelous discoveries following 
Pasteur’s work have added so much to the positive knowledge re- 
garding the cause, cure, and prevention of diseases—a knowledge 
which is now obtainable in any of the better medical colleges. 
THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARD. 
The educational standard now adopted in all leading nations as the 
reasonable minimum for practitioners of the healing art (medicine) 
includes— 
(a) A secondary, school education equal to that obtained in the 
accredited four-year high schools of the United States and in addi- 
tion one or two years of work in a college of liberal arts, including 
courses in physics, chemistry, and biology; 
(6) A medical training provided by a four-year course in a well- 
equipped medical college, including two years of laboratory work in 
anatomy, physiology, physiologic chemistry, pharmacology, bacteri- 
ology, and pathology, and two years of clinical instruction in dis- 
pensaries and hospitals; and 
(c) The practical experience obtained in a fifth year as an interne 
(resident physician) in a good hospital.  
-P-A-G-E-215
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 195 
PROGRESS OF THE PAST YEAR. 
The beginning of the college session of 1914-15 marks an important 
epoch in the history of medical education in the United States, in 
that it witnessed the general adoption by the medical colleges of 
the country of the standard of preliminary and medical education 
just outlined. Last fall 39 medical colleges began the enforcement 
of the higher entrance standard, which, added to the 43 which had 
previously done so, and 8 which began the requirement since that 
time, make 90 medical colleges which now require for admission one 
or two years of collegiate work in addition to four years of secondary 
school training. Forty of these require two years of such college 
work as the minimum, which makes their entrance requirements 
equal to those of leading medical schools abroad. (See chart on 
p.187.) 
EFFECT OF HIGHER STANDARDS ON STUDENT ENROLLMENTS. 
As was expected, the general adoption of higher entrance require- 
ments caused a marked decrease (nearly 10 per cent) in the student 
enrollment—14,891 in 1914-15, as compared with 16,502 in 1913-14. 
Statistics indicate, however (see Table 2), that after a period of a 
year or two has been allowed for readjustment under the higher 
standards the enrollment in each college will return more nearly 
to normal. Of the 39 medical colleges beginning the higher require- 
ment in 1914, all but 1 had lower enrollments than during the 
previous session; while of the 48 which began the higher admission 
requirement in 1913 of previous years, all but 5 reported either 
increased enrollments or larger freshman classes.

MEDICAL GRADUATES IN 1915. 
There was a slight decrease in the number of medical graduates in 
1915 below that of the previous year, 3,536 as compared with 3,594 
in 1914. This is a decrease of 2,211, or 38.8 per cent, below the total 
for 1904, when 5,747, the largest number, were graduated. Although 
the total number has been diminished, as already shown, the quality 
has been much improved. Whereas in 1910 only 15.3 per cent (see 
Table 3) of all graduates had also secured degrees from colleges of 
arts and sciences, 24.3 per cent of all graduates in 1915 had secured 
these evidences of higher preliminary education.

  FEWER BUT NO DEARTH OF MEDICAL COLLEGES, 
During 1914-15 there were 102 medical colleges which had students 
enrolled, the average in each college being 146, or 36 in each of the 
four classes. As can be readily seen, 50 medical colleges with 75 
students in each class, or 300 students in each college, could have 
taken care of the students enrolled in all colleges last session. It 
is clear, therefore, that the number of medical colleges could still be 
considerably reduced, should that be necessary, without diminish- 
ing the students’ opportunities to study medicine. Some of the 
medical colleges with their present enrollments are spending each 
year for maintenance several times the amount obtained from 
students’ fees. It costs practically as much to furnish a complete 
and well-rounded medical education for 25 or 30 students in a class 
as it would for two or three times that number. As a matter of 
economy, therefore, it would appear better if the number of insti- 
tutions were still further reduced by one-fourth, or one-third. Mean- 
while, with the close of the last college session 7 medical colleges 
ceased to exist, including 2 which merged with other medical col- 
leges. These colleges are: 
Birmingham Medical College, Birmingham, Ala. Discontinued undergradu- 
ate teaching.

Of the 95 medical colleges now remaining, there are 83 non- 
sectarian, 8 homeopathic, and 4 eclectic colleges. Altogether 92 
medical colleges have been closed since 1904, of which 52 were merged 
with other medical colleges and 40 became extinct. It is noteworthy 
that this rapid diminution in the number of medical colleges began 
in 1905, when the Council on Medical Education began the campaign 
for better medical colleges. It is also interesting to note (see Table 
4) that, of these 92 colleges, 48 had been rated in classes A and B 
by the council and 44 in class C; that all but 5 of the colleges in 
classes A and B closed by merger with other colleges, and that all 
but 5 of the colleges which became extinct had been rated in class C.

FURTHER MERGERS AN ADVANTAGE. 
There are still 17 cities in each of which two or more medical 
colleges exist and in two of these (Memphis and Nashville) mergers 
are scarcely possible, since the institutions are for different races, 
leaving 15 cities where mergers might be brought about. These 
cities and the number of colleges in each are: Chicago, 8; New York, 
7; Philadelphia, 6; Boston, 4; San Francisco, 3; St. Louis, 3; 
Washington, 3; and there are two colleges each in Ann Arbor, At- - 
lanta, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Columbus, Iowa City, Los Angeles, 
and Omaha. In 1904 there were 30 cities having from 2 to 15 medi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-218

cal colleges each, a total of 119. The highest development of medi- 
cal education in each city is prevented so long as there are two or 
more competing medical colleges. For the further improvement of 
medical education there should be other mergers in the 15 cities 
named.

NONRECOGNITION OF MEDICAL COLLEGES. 
  Of the 95 medical colleges still existing, there are about 20 which 
do not have unqualified recognition by the licensing boards in from 
15 to 34 States, the reason usually given being that those colleges are 
not considered as properly equipped with teachers, or with labora- 
tories, or that suitable entrance requirements are not enforced. For 
students contemplating the study of medicine it is highly important 
that they should know before selecting a medical college whether the 
diploma it grants will be an acceptable qualification for the license 
to practice. The 34 States in which, as a rule, the licensing boards 
are thus refusing to license graduates of low standard medical col- 
leges are: 5

STATE REQUIREMENTS OF PRELIMINARY EDUCATION. 
Another important fact to be noted by prospective medical stu- 
dents is the minimum standards of preliminary education now re- 
quired by the various State licensing boards. There are now 10 
States in which the boards require, in addition to a four-year course 
in an accredited high school, two years of collegiate work, including 
courses in physics, chemistry, and biology. Some also require a 
reading knowledge of French or German. There are also 18 States 
which, in addition to the high-school course, require one year of 
college work, including the sciences named. These 28 States, the 
number of years required, and the dates when the standard is effec- 
tive are:

CONFERENCE OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
The most important topic on the program of this conference was 
the report of a special committee * on the “ Reorganization of clinical 
teaching,” a report which is sure to have a profound influence on the 
further development of medical education. 
In the introduction to the report it was stated that any standards 
suggested at present should be sufliciently moderate to permit their 
being adopted by all medical schools of the country having sound 
reason for existence. More advanced standards might be suggested, 
however, to be adopted at certain fixed periods in the future. 
In advising a standard of clinical organization the essentials which 
were considered and a brief summary of the conclusions in regard 
to each are as follows: 
REORGANIZATION OF CLINICAL TEACHING.2 
I, ADEQUATE HOSPITAL AND DISPENSARY FACILITIES. 
A properly equipped hospital, under the absolute control of the medical school, 
is a first essential. 
For a class of 100 senior students or less there should be a hospital of at least 
200 beds, which would afford 75 beds for general medicine, 75 beds for general 
surgery, and 50 beds for obstetrics. and gynecology. Such a hospital should 
possess a clinical laboratory, a Réntgen-ray department, a bacteriologic labora- 
tory, a laboratory for metabolic investigation (physiologic chemistry), and space 
for the installment of apparatus for investigating cardiovascular diseases and 
the organs of special sense. 
There should also be an outpatient department of at least 10,000 patients, or 
50,000 visits annually, which should be in intimate and harmonious connection 
with the hospital. 
Il, THE NECESSITY OF ADEQUATE FINANCIAL INCOME, 
Adequate finances for each clinical department of a medical school is another 
essential, in order to secure the needed teachers, technicians, and janitors, sup- 
plies, new apparatus, and books. The head of each department should have a

  202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
salary, but more important is the need of adequate salaries for those next in 
rank, Even small schools should have at least one man in each department so 
salaried; larger schools would need two or three. Next to these men there is 
need of from two to six well-trained men to carry on teaching, clinical work, 
and research. Below these would come residents and assistant residents, getting 
still lower salaries, and their keep. There should be enough technicians to care 
for the laboratories and to do other routine work. The budget should provide 
for a stenographic force and for new equipment. In developing satisfactory 
clinical staffs it may be necessary to take young men and train them, beginning 
with small salaries, since men of desired experience are difficult to obtain. 
With one exception there is to-day no medical school so financially situated as 
to institute the plan for full-time professorships, however ideal that ee might 
be, and a budget to provide for it would be prohibitive. 
The minimum clinical annual budget for a medical college having a clinical 
class of 100 juniors and 100 seniors should be from $75,000 to $100,000, not in- 
cluding the cost of maintaining the hospital and dispensary. This would pro- 
vide from $30,000 to $40,000 for medicine, $30,000 to $40,000 for surgery, and 
$15,000 to $20,000 for obstetrics and gynecology; and this budget could be 
doubled without extravagant expenditure. The total budget will vary with 
the locality and other conditions. The same amount of money, for example, 
would go much further in Ann Arbor than it would in New York City. 
A suggestive budget to provide for the clinical faculty for the school and 
hospital unit in the department of internal medicine is as follows:

Neurology, head and assistants__ 2, 500— 5, 000   
The organization and disposition of the budget of the surgical and obstetric 
departments would be practically the same, differing only in details. 
UI. THE PLACE TO BEGIN PRESCRIBED CLINICAL INSTRUCTION. 
Two years appear insufficient for the work of the clinical branches, which has 
become increasingly complex. The same is true regarding the laboratory sub- 
jects. Some relief may be had by a careful reorganization of the clinical de- 
partments. With the increased entrance requirements, courses in physical 
diagnosis and in the principles of surgery may well be offered in the latter part 
of the second year. This change seems advisable also because it serves to con- 
nect more closely the preclinical and clinical courses. 
The student should begin in his second year the study of physical signs, on 
normal subjects or with patients from the outpatient service. Textbook work 
in the long-established facts of medicine and surgery, under an instructor, 
would follow in his third year, coincidentally with further practical work in 
the dispensary and in bedside clinics, and with lectures dealing with the most 
recent ideas on medicine and surgery. Instruction in obstetrics and gynecology, 
as well as in ophthalmology, otology, and rhinolaryngology, should begin and be
-P-A-G-E-223
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 203 
finished in the third year, with the exception of certain practical courses usually 
best given early in the fourth year. In his fourth year the student should 
follow the ward service of a teaching hospital. 
If clinical instruction is begun in the sophomore year, students coming from 
medical schools giving only the first two years of the medical course will not be 
enabled to secure the physical diagnosis and the preparatory course in surgery, 
unless a certain amount of dispensary and hospital material may become ayail- 
able at those schools. 
IV, USE OF THE DISPENSARY. 
The outpatient clinical material is one of the most valuable teaching assets 
of the medical college, and should be used for the instruction of undergraduates 
and for the clinical and other researches of the attending staff. It is best used 
for students in the second year for teaching physical diagnosis, and in the 
third and fourth years in internal medicine and in the medical specialties. Its 
greatest and perhaps most neglected use is in the instruction of third-year 
students in history taking and fourth-year students in the therapeutics of the 
lesser medical and surgical ailments. The dispensary service should be inti- 
mately connected with the hospital ward service. The obstetric material should 
be used in the third year for diagnostic purposes only, the practical care of 
the lying-in patients being reserved for the fourth-year students. The 
gynecology dispensary material also is best used in the fourth year. For the 
specialties, such as opthalmology, otology, and rhinolaryngology, outpatient 
clinical material is highly essential, and should be utilized for sections from 
six to ten students, each section in charge of an instructor. 
V. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE HOSPITAL UNIT. 
In the construction of a hospital, the number of beds in each ward should be 
considered. This depends on the number of the beds assigned to each attending 
nurse. For acute cases, 4 beds, and, for chronic cases, 6 beds may be assigned 
to a nurse. This makes 24 beds a convenient ward unit for either chronic or 
acute cases. As many such units may be added as needed, varying with the 
size of the hospital. A minimum-sized teaching hospital can, therefore, be 
divided into eight units of 24 beds each, four units each for the medical and 
surgical service. More satisfactory, however, would be a hospital providing 
six units (144 beds) each for the medical and surgical services. Each service 
could then be divided into three subdivisions of 48 beds each. Taking the 
medical service as an example, the personnel would consist of the professor in 
charge (the director of the service), 8 first assistants, and 6 second assistants. 
Under this nonresident staff there should be a resident staff, to consist of at 
least 3 resident physicians, who should be the direct overseers and instructors 
of the clinical clerk service and of the intern staff. There should be 6 interns, 
serving for one year, in two grades of six months each—junior and senior— 
and 24 clinical clerks, all fourth-year students. Voluntary assistants, serving 
without pay, might be doing research work in the wards and laboratories. 
There should also be a number of extern assistants. i 
The addition of one or more units to the foregoing estimate would necessi- 
tate an entire duplication of a department staff in medicine and surgery, since 
a single director should not be asked to take charge of more than 150 beds. 
The laboratories, research rooms, history rooms, working library, residents’ 
rooms, auditorium and, indeed, every part of a clinical unit should be housed 
under one roof. Cooperation between departments should be encouraged, but a 
hospital unit should constitute a complete workshop, self-sufficient for all 
clinical purposes, and independent of all other departments.

  204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
» VI. THE UTILIZATION OF STUDENTS AS CLINICAL CLERKS. 
The clinical clerk system provides the best training in the clinical branches 
if the work is properly supervised. Experience shows that students may begin 
as clinical clerks in the last trimester of the third year in the divisions of 
medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and complete a trimester in each. In this 
way the student learns by applying the scientific and technical knowledge 
acquired in the first two years and by further instruction in wards, laboratories, 
operating rooms, clinics, and library. 
The utilization of clinical clerks in the obstetric wards is most important. 
The examinations of secretions, the testing of blood pressure, the observation 
and care of the infant, the estimation of the value of the mother’s milk are so 
important that clerks should be in constant attendance, if not in actual resi- 
dence. In the wards devoted to the specialties, on the contrary, such as 
ophthalmology, otology, and rhinolaryngology, students as clinical clerks are 
of very little service. Most of the material in these departments is better used 
in ward class instruction. . 
Before serving as a clerk, even in the wards devoted to medicine and surgery, 
the student should have a sufficient knowledge of the specialties to determine 
the most conspicuous departures from the normal. 
The period of service in each division (medicine, surgery, obstetrics, etc.) 
should be from two to four months. The teaching personnel in each depart- 
ment should consist of a directing officer and instructors. The hospital must 
be large enough so that at least 5, 6, or 8 beds could be assigned to each 
student for at least one-third of the college year. 
VII. UTILIZATION OF SPECIAL AND EXTRAMURAL HOSPITALS. 
A medical school with a 200-bed hospital, an outpatient department, and a 
minimum budget for 200 students in the third and fourth year classes, could 
amplify the clinical instruction, without additional cost, by affiliation with 
other hospitals, and increase their teaching force by volunteer clinical teachers 
on the staffs of those hospitals. When such hospitals are near by, and when 
efficient teachers are connected with them, they may be utilized to good effect. 
Almost every community is served by a large number of general and special 
hospitals. The medical school can often secure in this way an opportunity for 
its students to study the types of diseases which are not usually seen in the 
active general-hospital service. It is possible also to use extramural and spe- 
cial hospitals for ward classes and for clinical clerks, but the school should 
control the appointment of the instructors in charge of that work. 
As many extramural hospitals as possible should be brought into affiliation 
with the medical school to provide for the development of graduate work, 
which now deserves careful consideration. 
VIII. DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION OF TEACHING. 
There is need of a greater coordination between the various clinical depart- 
ments as well as between the clinical and laboratory departments. Too often 
a student feels that he has finished certain branches of his instruction (chemis- 
try, for example), and literally puts them away until he must hurriedly resur- 
rect them prior to a State board examination. This could be voided if there 
was a closer coordination of the laboratory courses with the instruction in the 
clinical departments. 
Combination courses, like those inaugurated at McGill and Harvard, in which 
the professor of medicine and pathology unite to demonstrate antemortem diag- 
nosis and postmortem findings, are recommended. Similar combinations are
-P-A-G-E-225
  MEDICAL EDUCATION, 205 
possible between the departments of surgery and anatomy in the study of 
fractures and dislocations, between the departments of physiology and medicine 
in the study of the heart and circulation, and between the departments of 
general medicine and surgery and those of specialties. 
TX. LIMITING THE PRACTICE OF CLINICAL TEACHERS. 
The committee was unanimous in expressing a sympathetic interest in the 
educational experiment of providing full-time clinical professors in medicine, 
surgery, and pediatrics now being tried out at the Johns Hopkins Medical 
School, an institution having such admirable facilities for it. In fact, the 
principle that the practice of clinical teachers should be restricted has general 
acceptance. In determining to what extent that practice should be limited, 
there are two extremes somewhere between which it is possible to construct a 
rational scheme. On the one side is the whole-time requirement, as adopted at 
Johns Hopkins, and on the other side is the condition in some medical schools 
where clinical teachers are so busy with their private practice that their 
teaching is badly neglected. Opinion is by no means unanimous that the 
whole-time requirement is ideal, but even if it were ideal, such requirement 
could not be advised at the present time, owing to the fact that few of the 
medical schools are adequately financed for it. 
On the other hand, it is. imperative that we get away from the other extreme. 
An extensive, time-consuming private practice, with the minimum of teaching 
responsibility, must give place to the teacher whose chief business is to in- 
struct medical students, who chooses the work because he loves it, and who is 
qualified by education and by personal experience in experimental work to be 
a productive teacher. Given such teachers, the limitation of their practice will 
take care of itself. A matter of the highest importance is to build up a sys- 
tem that will develop for the future the best clinical teachers. Some believe 
that the practice of the clinical teacher should be restricted to hospital consulta- 
tions. Others feel that a certain amount of private practice is essential to 
develop the best clinical teachers. It is believed that some private practice, 
either by the head of the department or by other prominent clinical teachers in 
the department, is essential to keep medical education in sympathetic touch 
with the human side of medical practice. There is a serious danger that the 
placing of all clinical teachers on a full-time basis would result in a gradual 
separation of medical teachers from some of the most vital problems of active 
medical practice. 
HIGHER DEGREES IN MEDICINE. 
At this conference also a symposium was given on the general topic 
of “Higher Degrees in Medicine.” The recent progress in medical 
education makes it essential that physicians concentrate their atten- 
tion to some narrow specialty, thereby developing a higher degree of 
skill in that special line of medical practice. Before being recognized 
as a specialist, however, he should show evidence of special training, 
and medical schools are now providing advanced courses to meet 
these needs. Such courses require at least one year, and usually two 
or three years of special study for which a higher degree is given. 
To avoid a confusion of having too many such degrees was the pur- 
pose of this symposium. Of graduate degrees in medicine we already 
have the doctor of public health (Dr. P. H.), granted after one or
-P-A-G-E-226
  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
two years of special study by eight medical schools.1 The univer- 
sities of Minnesota and New York now offer also courses of three 
years in each of the medical specialties, for which a special 
degree of doctor of science (D. S., followed in parentheses by the 
name of the particular subject—surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, 
etc.—is granted. This is clearly less confusing than to give a special 
degree for each of the multiplicity of medical specialties. The value 
of this doctorate will, of course, depend on the excellence of the 
higher courses on which the degree is based. 
GRADUATE MEDICAL INSTRUCTION. 
The third main topic of the conference was a report of a sub- 
committee of the council on “Graduate Medical Instruction.” The 
committee had just completed an inspection of the various post- 
graduate medical schools of the country and a study of the problems 
of such instruction. The following is a brief abstract of the report: 
A distinction should be made between the advanced courses, which may 
properly be called “ graduate courses,” and the more elementary courses, con- 
stituting the bulk of the work especially designed for practitioners, which may 
well be designated as “ practitioners’ courses.” 
The following definitions for use in connection with the instruction of grad- 
uates in medicine are recommended for general acceptance: 
1. An undergraduate school is understood to mean a regular medical school, 
since the instruction it gives leads to graduation in medicine. 
2. An undergraduate course is one required for the degree of M. D. 
38. A graduate course is one more advanced than an undergraduate course. 
4, A practitioner's course is one of undergraduate grade but intended for 
practitioners. 
5. A graduate department, or a graduate school, is one organized to give 
graduate courses. Such a school may also give practitioners’ courses. 
6. A practitioners’ department, or a practitioners’ school, is one organized to 
give courses for practitioners. Only in exceptional instances should such a 
school attempt to give graduate courses. 
7. A certificate means a document which resembles a diploma in form, is 
suitable for display, and may impress the public. 
The instruction of graduates in medicine is essential in order to furnish 
better doctors to the public. By raising the standards of medical schools the 
proper training of medical students is practically settled. Much remains to 
be done, however, to improve the training of physicians who are already in 
practice and enable them to keep pace with progress in medical knowledge. 
No medical school should attempt to provide graduate teaching unless its 
undergraduate course is satisfactorily developed. Consequently schools in 
classes B and © should not attempt to teach graduates. Even class A schools 
should not attempt to teach graduates unless the instruction for their under- 
graduates is in a complete state of development. The standards for the

-P-A-G-E-227
  
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 207 
instruction of graduates should be just as high as those for the instruction of 
undergraduates, no matter whether the courses are advanced or elementary. 
During the past year the committee inspected the more important post- 
graduate schools of the country—independent schools organized for the pur- 
pose of teaching medical graduates. As a class the independent postgrad- 
uate schools are inferior and unsatisfactory. Few of them can stand com- 
parison with even fairly good medical schools. Not only is the instruction poor 
and the equipment inadequate in many of these schools, but some are clearly 
commercial in type. They can not be depended on for adequate instruction for 
graduates. Good medical schools, therefore, which have adequate facilities, 
should undertake this form of instruction. Good medical schools can readily 
secure the services of competent teachers if the regular force is unable to under- 
take the teaching of graduates. They already have the necessary equipment, 
or they are in position to secure such equipment, if more is needed. It would 
mean a needless waste of money for the postgraduate schools as a body to 
attempt to secure the means which would enable them to secure an equipment 
adequate to meet the demands of the many graduates who wish instruction. 
Herein lies one of the strongest arguments why medical schools should under- 
take this work. 
There are five classes of graduates who need opportunity for further study, 
depending on their desire (1) to undertake research, (2) to enter some spe- 
cialty, (3) to take other advanced instruction, (4) to take the later improved 
studies in the medical school, and (5) to make up deficiencies in previous 
medical training. 
1. Research.—Abundant opportunities for research, sufficient to meet the 
needs of those who wish such work, are already available in the medical 
schools of this country. 
2. Training for specialists ——There is an urgent necessity of establishing 
standards for specialists. Nothing brings greater discredit to the profession 
than the blunders of self-styled specialists who have had an inadequate train- 
ing. The training of specialists should involve a systematic course of instruc- 
tion of at least one year, followed by a year or more of supervised clinical 
experience. This involves the possession of exceptionally good clinical facili- 
ties. It is clear that only the better university medical schools which have 
exceptionally good opportunities should attempt the training of specialists. 
Such a course is worthy of some degree in medicine higher than M. D., and such 
degrees should be granted only by universities. 
83. Advanced instruction other than (1) or (2).—Several of the best medical 
schools are beginning to give serious consideration to the needs of graduates 
who seek opportunities for keeping abreast of the advances in medical knowl- 
edge and practice. Instruction of this type can be given only with the teachers: 
and equipment of the best schools; therefore, it is a duty these schools owe to 
the community to seriously consider how far they can meet the demand for 
such courses. They should not hesitate to take up graduate teaching because 
they could not do so on an extensive scale. It is the quality of the work that 
is important, not the quantity. It is creditable for a school to offer but a single 
course if it is a good one and is useful to the profession. On the other hand, 
it is discreditable for a good school to try to cover more ground than it can 
do well for the sake of making a showing. Only when this form of instruction 
is undertaken on an extensive scale is it desirable to establish a separate 
department or school. Many schools could offer at least a few graduate 
courses at some time in the year which would be attractive to physicians who 
wish advanced instruction. There is an advantage in having centers for teach-
-P-A-G-E-228
  208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
ing graduates distributed over the country for the greater convenience of those 
physicians who are limited as to time or money. 
4, Admission of graduates to undergraduate courses.—Graduates in classes 4 
and 5, those who have become “ rusty ” and wish to “ brush up,” and the gradu- 
ates of poor schools who have had an inadequate training, constitute the bulk 
of those who seek further instruction. They do not need advanced courses, 
and, as a rule, are not qualified to take them. The admission of these graduates 
to undergraduate exercises is permissible, provided it does not interfere with 
the regular teaching. As a rule, undergraduate courses require more time than 
physicians can spare from their professional work. Specially organized prac- 
titioners’ courses are, therefore, desirable. 
Hitherto such courses have been left for the postgraduate schools, which 
vary from good to very bad, and as a class are inferior and unsatisfactory. 
They could be made satisfactory only through extensive improvements, and the 
funds required for such improvements would be expended to better advantage 
in strengthening the regular medical schools. Therefore it is unwise to leave 
the giving of practitioners’ courses to these independent schools. The better 
medical schools, as far as they can, should provide practitioners’ courses as a 
public service. The better the school the greater the advantage for the public. 
Postgraduate schools do not merit universal condemnation, even if as a 
class they are unsatisfactory. They deserve credit because they have attempted 
to meet the demand of graduates for further instruction. Hitherto they have 
been successful because they have had to compete only with poorer schools of 
the same class. If the good medical schools enter this field of teaching, the 
postgraduate schools will face a crisis, which is accentuated by the question 
of standards for such teaching. Hither they must come up to the standards of 
good medical schools or they will lose their best teachers, many of whom have 
become associated with postgraduate schools because these were the only 
ones where such teaching could be done. Now that the question of standards is 
raised, these men will be in demand for the good medical schools which under- 
take this work. The problem of the independent postgraduate schools will 
take care of itself if the good medical schools undertake this kind of teaching. 
The better postgraduate schools will be forced to join the regular schools and 
the poorer ones will find it unprofitable to continue. The number of physicians 
who will patronize poor schools of this type when better instruction is offered 
is very limited. 
Medical schools should understand, however, that courses for practitioners 
must often be different from the regular undergraduate courses. Practitioners, 
as a rule, can leave their practice for only a limited time. Courses should be 
arranged that may be completed in a month or six weeks. This means a greater 
subdivision and a greater variety of subjects than in undergraduate studies; 
it means also that the work should be concentrated and practical. Courses 
should be so arranged that the graduate can occupy himself with studies along 
certain narrow lines throughout the day. If courses can not be offered 
throughout the year, they should be concentrated, so that there will be definite 
periods when the practitioner can have a wide range of choice. 
Admission requirements.—There can be no uniform admission requirements 
of an educational character. Medical graduates need courses which range from 
the elementary to the most advanced. For the benefit of the public, even the 
most poorly trained practitioner, if he is legally entitled to practice medicine, 
should have an opportunity to improve his medical knowledge. He should, of 
course, be admitted only to such courses as he is qualified to take. It is desir- 
able that graduates from poor schools who are not registered should not be
-P-A-G-E-229
  MEDICAL EDUCATION. 209 
able to coach up in these courses and learn just enough to pass the State 
licensing boards. 
Certificates —To offset the evils attendant on the loose regulations about 
granting certificates it is recommended that the minimum time requirement for 
the granting of a certificate be four months of all-day work, taken consecu- 
tively ; that it should be granted only for a systematic course, approved by the 
school, in which attendance and work have been satisfactory; and that the 
student must pass an examination based on this course of study. A school may 
issue for shorter courses an official statement as to the student’s attendance or 
the character of his work, but the form must be such that it does not resemble 
a diploma. 
RULES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF GRADUATE MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
The following rules regarding the classification and indorsement 
of graduate medical schools were recommended by the committee and 
adopted by the council: 
(a) No graduate medical school will be approved by the council which 
accepts as students physicians who are not licensed practitioners, unless they 
are graduates of medical colleges rated in Class A.* 
(b) Certificates, diplomalike in character, should not be granted for less 
than four months of all-day work, taken consecutively ; they should be granted 
only for a systematic course, approved by the school, in which attendance and 
work have been satisfactory, and to secure this certificate the student should 
pass an examination based on the course of study. Only such graduate medi- 
eal schools will be approved which exact these requirements. 
(c) The council, in its discretion, will give its approval to research courses, 
to systematic courses for the training of specialists, and to other graduate 
courses where given in Class A medical colleges. (This does not mean that all 
such courses in Class A medical colleges will be approved, but that no such 
courses will be approved if given in medical colleges graded lower than Class A.) 
(d) In determining the standard of graduate departments of medical col- 
leges, or independent schools giving instruction to graduates, the council will 
be guided by the following outline, grading the various institutions on a civil- 
service basis, on a scale of 1,000 points: 
1. Any evidence obtainable showing the character of the training furnished 
by the graduate medical school. 
2. The observance by the graduate medical school of the rules herein set 
forth regarding the admission of students. 
8. Supervision of the students’ work; character of the records; observance of 
the rules herein set forth regarding the granting of certificates. 
4, Graduate school buildings or quarters: Light, heat, ventilation, cleanliness. 
5. Laboratory facilities and instruction. 
6. Dispensary facilities and instruction. 
7. Hospital facilities and instruction, maternity work, necropsies, specialties. 
8. Faculty: Number and qualification of trained teachers, full-time instruc- 
tors and assistants, organization, research work, etc. 
9. Extent to which the school is conducted for teaching rather than for 
the profit of the faculty directly or indirectly. 
10. Possession and use made of libraries, museums, charts, stereopticons, ete. 
  
1In statements regarding classes of medical colleges reference is made to the classifica- 
tion prepared by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, 
whic divides them, according to their excellence of teachers, equipment, etc., into Classes 
A, B, and C.

  210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Although the council has not attempted as yet to classify graduate 
medical schools, reports indicate that it is collecting data on which 
such a classification can be based. Any graduate school may apply 
for approval, and this is to be granted if the school meets the 
requirements as above set forth, and if, in all departments in which 
instruction is given, it comes up to the standard of a Class A school. 
THE JOINT CONFERENCE.” 
The joint conference of the Association of American Medical Col- 
leges and the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United 
States was held on Wednesday, February 17. Of particular interest 
was a paper presented by Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, president of the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, on “The 
Classification of Medical Colleges,” in which he discussed the work 
of the Council on Medical Education. He showed that the effective- 
ness of the council’s work came from the fact that it was supported 
by the great mass of the organized medical profession of America. 
In speaking of the rule of the council that all medical colleges to be 
rated in Class A should require for admission a year of college work, 
including courses in physics, chemistry, and biology, in addition to a 
four-year high-school education, Dr. Pritchett said: 
I look upon the enforcement of this provision over the whole United States 
as premature. In the South the medical schools were barely upon the high- 
school basis and I fear the effect of this action both upon medical school and 
high school. It will, I fear, work to continue for some years a series of insin- 
cere adjustments, and the progress made in the raising of standards, while 
attractive on paper, is likely to be in part illusory. 
The reply of the council to this was as follows: 
The council has been especially interested in the development of the high 
schools of the South, since it has been and is one of the most important prob- 
lems confronting the medical schools of that section of the country. The rea- 
sons why the council believes the enforcement of the one year of college re- 
quirement in the South should not be delayed are as follows: In the first 
place the council has fixed a standard for the entire country and has tried to 
obliterate any lines between the North and South, or the East and West. A 
second point is that the South, according.to statements made year after year 
at these conferences, no longer desires to have special concessions made for it. 
The colleges of that section desire to be judged on the same basis as those of 
other parts of the country. Third, if the high schools of the South are imperfect, 
is it not all the more reason why those who are going to study medicine should 
be required to take the one year of extra work even though it may not be at 
first as perfect a college year as is desired? e 
As to the requirement itself, many educators throughout the South, college 
presidents, professors of secondary education, and others have stated that the 
effect of the requirement one way or the other depends on the manner in which 
it is administered. In response to the question: “ Would not the requirement 
of a year of college work, with the strict understanding that it be preceded by a 
  
1 Assoc, Amer. Med. Col., Proc. 25th An. Meeting, Feb. 17, 1915, p. i1

MEDICAL EDUCATION. 211 
four-year high-school education, or its actual equivalent, help the high schools - 
in the South?” the answers, with only one exception, were decidedly in the 
affirmative. The chief difficulty found in the inspection of some of the universi- 
ties in the South, as well as of the medical schools, has been the lack of efficient 
methods of administering their entrance requirements. Such faulty methods 
are a positive hindrance to progress both of the high schools and of the colleges. 
If the medical schools verify every credential, and make sure that students ad- 
mitted have the four-year high-school education, before any college work taken 
may be counted as such, it would be a positive aid in the development of the 
high schools. Such requirement will induce the small colleges in the South to 
increase their entrance requirements to at least 14 units of secondary school 
work, or not be recognized by the medical schools. 
President Pritchett also suggested several criteria which he. be- 
lieves should be applied in deciding the classification of medical col- 
leges. These were: 
1. The entrance qualifications demanded of the students admitted. 
2. The quality of the teaching, the ability and devotion of the faculty. 
3. Completeness and availability of the scientific laboratories in chemistry, 
anatomy, physiology, pathology, and associated sciences. 
4, Character of the clinical facilities, including both hospital and dispensary, 
and the use made of them. 
5. Financial income as shown by a detailed statement of receipts and expendi- 
tures. 
MINIMUM EXPENSES FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF AN 
ACCEPTABLE MEDICAL COLLEGE, 
A paper on this subject was presented by Dr. F. C. Waite, secre- 
tary of the Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleve- 
land, Ohio. The following is an abstract of the paper: 
The cost of each of the laboratory departments falls under three general 
heads: Salaries, maintenance, and additions to equipment. Aside from the 
building and fixed furniture, the movable apparatus for each laboratory suffi- 
cient to care for the teaching of 50 students in a class is not far from an average 
of $5,000 per laboratory. The figure of $25,000 for five laboratories is conserva- 
tive. To this should be added at least $10,000 for a working library, and teach- 
ing collections, especially in anatomy and pathology. Such collections represent 
a value of at least $5,000. They can not be purchased; they must be accumu- 
lated. There is, therefore, represented in the equipment of five laboratory de- 
partments at least $40,000. 
The salaries for each department will amount to at least $7,000; library ap- 
propriation, $200; breakage and repairs, $500; material for students, $750. allow- 
ing $15 per student, as an average, for the five laboratories. The sum-total for 
the annual maintenance of the five laboratories would amount to $41,750. The 
minimum salary would be $3,000; the dieners and technicians, of course, receive 
considerably less. An acceptable school must have at the head of its laboratory 
departments men who are not only capable of directing the teaching, but also 
of doing and directing some research. Some men when they start may be 
willing to accept less than $3,000, but as they continue in the work they deserve 
and must receive some increment, so that the average of the five professorial 
salaries is certainly $3,000. The professorial salary scale in many schools is
-P-A-G-E-232
  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
- now $4,000 or above. To teach a class of 50 students there should be at least 
three teachers to each department. In laboratory exercises an instructor can 
not care for over 15 to 20 men and get good results. Of course, all of these men 
should be full-time teachers. Three men to a department, five of these being 
heads of the departments, and eleven subordinates, constitute the full-time 
teaching staff in the laboratory department. The subordinates should not re- 
ceive less than $1,500 a year. Technical assistants are absolutely necessary, 
and may be pair at least $900 a year, in order to make the place attractive as a 
career. To attract and hold capable teachers, library facilities must be provided. 
The initial investment will be about $10,000. The cost of maintenance for a year 
is about $200 per department. This takes no account of overhead charges in 
connection with maintaining the buildings and ground, nor is any taken of gen- 
eral administrative expense. Allowing $6,000 per year for such expense gives a 
minimum total of $50,000 for maintaining the two laboratory years. Income 
from fees is about $150 per student. The difference between the tuition fees 
and the maintenance expense must come from some other source. : 
MININUM EXPENSES FOR MAINTAINING THE CLINICAL DEPARTMENTS. 
This was the subject of a paper presented by Dr. John L. Heffron, 
dean of the College of Medicine of Syracuse University, Syracuse, 
N. Y. The following is an abstract of that paper: 
Data were collected from 23 Class A schools. At Johns Hopkins the total 
expense of the clinical department is $141,742. If interest on money invested in 
buildings and permanent equipment is included, the clinical teaching in Johns 
Hopkins Medical School costs $375,000 a year. Some schools report an annual 
expenditure for this work of considerably more than $150,000. At Syracuse 
University College of Medicine, which does not own a hospital, the clinical 
teaching expense in hospitals is nil, and yet we think it is efficient. There is 
a college dispensary which, with equipment, cost $95,000. The laboratories in 
the dispensary are equipped and supplied by the university. The laboratories 
in the affiliated hospitals are largely supported by the hospitals, the university 
expending not to exceed $200 for this purpose. Each student is required to own 
his own microscope. For the laboratories of clinical diagnosis, clinical pa- 
thology, and clinical bacteriology about $5,000 is expended annually for salaries 
and supplies. If the university should charge interest on $95,000 and the cost 
of upkeep, the total annual expense for clinical teaching would be approximately 
$10,000. 
The cost of clinical teaching varies, depending on whether the college owns 
its own hospital, dispensary, and clinical laboratories, and whether the clinical 
teachers are paid on a part-time or full-time basis. Good clinical teaching can 
be done with a volunteer clinical faculty in affiliated hospitals, but it is not the 
best way or the right way. A medical school should own or use or control and 
use a general hospital and a dispensary, and both should be fully equipped with 
clinical laboratories for students’ use. Clinical teaching can be done efficiently 
by men who are paid enough to permit them to devote sufficient time to the 
study and teaching of their subject and who are permitted to engage in con- 
sulting practice which does not interfere with their duties as teachers and in- 
vestigators. Each major department would require in salaries about $7,500 a 
year, or a total expenditure for medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics 
of $30,000 a year in salaries. In Syracuse the cost per patient per day in the 
hospital we use is $1.75. The city or some responsible party pays $1.50 of this
-P-A-G-E-233
  MEDICAL EDUCATION. 213 
sum, leaving a daily deficit of 25 cents per patient which must be made up 
from the treasury of the university or by subscription. Take as a standard 
hospital one with four units of 24 beds each, and suppose that all the beds 
were occupied for'75 per cent of the time. That would give an annual deficit 
representing the cost to the university or to the public over what had been re- 
ceived of $13,324. Added to the salaries, the total expense would be about 
$45,000. This is so nearly the $50,000 which it had been estimated is necessary 
for the conduct of the clinical department of a first-class medical school that it 
is quite significant. 
REVISED REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
During the February conference on medical education a joint com- 
mittee of the Association of American Medical Colleges and of the 
Council on Medical Education assisted by Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, 
dean of the college of liberal arts and sciences of the University 
of Illinois, formerly specialist in higher education in the United 
States Bureau of Education, was appointed to prepare a statement 
in greater detail in regard to the requirements of admission to medi- 
cal colleges to be enforced during the next few years, including a 
statement of such conditions as were to be allowed for the two follow- 
ing years. A preliminary statement was submitted to 50 or more 
leading authorities on preliminary education for their suggestions 
and criticisms, and on receipt of the replies the following statement 
was adopted: 
I. HIGH-SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS, 
(a) For admission to the preliminary college year, students must have com- 
pleted a 4-year course of at least 14 units in a standard accredited high school 
or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have its equivalent 
as demonstrated by an examination conducted by a duly authorized examiner 
of the college entrance examination board, or by the authorized examiner of 
a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on 
Medical Education, or by an examiner whose certificates are accepted by such 
approved standard colleges or universities. A detailed statement of attend- 
ance at the secondary school, and a transcript of the student’s work should be 
kept on file by the medical school authorities. This evidence of actual attend- 
ance at the secondary school or schools should be obtained for every student 
no matter whether he is admitted to the freshman or to advanced classes. This 
information regarding high-school education should be kept separate from the 
transcript of college work described below.

        1 Two units of Greek or Latin may be substituted for the two required units of French or German. 
2 Credentials of each science course must include evidence of laboratory work. 
A unit is the credit value of at least 36 weeks’ work of 4 or 5 recitation 
periods per week, each recitation period to be of not less than 40 minutes. In 
other words, a unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary 
school constituting approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. A satisfac- 
tory year’s work in any subject can not be accomplished under ordinary circum- 
stances in less than 120 sixty-minute hours or their equivalent. 
Required branches.—Of the 14 units of high-school work it is suggested that 
the subjects in capitals aggregating 7 units be required. Other work to the 
amount of at least 7 units may be made up from any of the other subjects of 
the above schedule. 
I. WORK OF THE PRELIMINARY COLLEGE YEAR. 
(c) The preliminary college year, which is the present minimum requirement 
for admission to medical schools, shall extend through one college session of at 
least 32 weeks of actual instruction, including final examinations. Its purpose
-P-A-G-E-235
  
MEDICAL EDUCATION, 215 
is to provide the student with a training that will enable him to enter more 
intelligently on the study of the fundamental medical sciences. 
(d) In excellence of teaching and in content the work of this preliminary 
college year shall be at least equal to the work done in the freshman year in 
standard colleges and universities which enforce for admission at least 14 units 
of accredited high-school work and exact for graduation at least 120 semester 
hours * of collegiate work. 
(e) This preliminary college year shall consist of at least 830 semester hours,* 
fully completed before the student enters the medical school. This is entirely 
in addition to the 14 units of secondary school work. Each student before being 
admitted to the medical school must have fully completed 14 units of high-school 
work and 30 semester hours of college work. If the college work did not include 
the specified subjects, as shown in (f), the students must be required to remove 
such conditions as are permitted in those subjects by additional college work. 
Additional college credits are necessary also to make up any deficiencies there 
may be in high-school credits. For example, if a student completed only three 
years of high-school work before entering “ college,” then two years of collegiate 
work (60 semester hours) must be required before he is admitted to the medical 
school.

(f) This preliminary college year shall include courses in physics, chemistry, 
and biology, each course to embrace at least 8 semester hours of didactic and 
laboratory work as shown in the accompanying schedule, provided that the 
requirement in biology may be satisfied b ypresenting 6 semester hours of college 
zoology, or by presenting one unit of high school biology, including laboratory 
work, and completing 4 semester hours of college zoology; and provided that 
requirement in biology may be satisfied by presenting 6 semester hours of college 
school physics, including laboratory work, and completing 4 semester hours of 
college physics which continues and does not duplicate the work done in high 
school. Under no arrangement, however, should there be a total of less than 
30 semester hours of college work. It is strongly urged that these include 6 
semester hours of a modern language other than English, preferably French 
or German.’ 
(g) Credits for two or more years of collegiate work can not be considered 
fully acceptable unless courses in physics, chemistry, and biology, as described 
above, have been completed. It is urged that a reading knowledge of French 
or German also be required. 
  
1A semester hour is the measurement of work represented by one class period per week 
for half of the college year. Hach laboratory period to be so valuated must extend over 
at least two hours. 5 
*'The inclusion of French or German is requsred for entrance to institutions which are 
members of the Association of American Medical Colleges.
-P-A-G-E-236
  216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
(h) Medical schools which aim to give a premedical year, including these 
science courses, should admit only those students who have completed at least 
14 units of unconditional high-school work,’ should provide expert full-time 
teachers in the various subjects in addition to the regular staff of the medical 
school; provide standard laboratory equipment; and should provide a training 
in the subjects of the premedical year no less thorough than that giver in 
standard colleges of liberal arts and the total work of this premedical year 
should amount to at least 30 semester hours of nonmedical subjects. 
(i) Postgraduate courses given in high schools can not be considered equal 
to college courses given by college teachers, unless such postgraduate courses 
are definitely organized on a junior college basis, and credits for work done in 
them regularly recognized and accepted by a State university or other university 
of similar rank, approved by the council. 
(j) A year of work in a college of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, or other 
professional college is not considered as an equivalent to the required premedical 
college year. 
Ill. ENTRANCE CONDITIONS UNTIL JAN, 1, 19172 
(i) A student may be admitted with certain subject conditions provided he 
has completed at least one year [30 semester hours, see paragraph (e)] of 
work in an approved college of liberal arts or science, provided no conditions 
may be permitted in the prescribed 8 semester hours of college chemistry. These 
conditions may be either in (1) or (2), but not in both: (1) in one-half (4 
semester hours) of the required course in physics, or (2) in one-half of the 
required course in biology (4 semester hours), or in zoology (3 semester hours). 
These conditions must be removed before the beginning of the work of the 
second medical year, and the credits for these conditions must be in addition 
to the required 30 semester hours. 
(l) A candidate who has completed two or more years of work in an ap- 
proved college of liberal arts, or science, may be admitted conditioned in all of 
the required work in physics, or one-half of the work required in biology, to a 
total not to exceed 8 semester hours. These conditions must be removed before 
the beginning of the second medical year. No condition may be permitted in 
the prescribed 8 semester hours of college chemistry. 
(m) A candidate who holds a-baccalaureat degree from a standard four 
year college or university approved by the Council on Medical Education may be 
admitted, in the fall of 1915 only, conditioned in all the physics or all the 
biology or in one-half of the physics and one-half of the biology, the total condi- 
tion not to exceed 8 semester hours. After 1915 only one-half of the biology (4 
semester hours) and one-half of the physics, or all of the physics, the total 
not to exceed 8 semester hours, may be carried as a condition. These conditions 
must be removed before the beginning of the second medical year. No condition 
may be permitted in the prescribed 8 semester hours of college chemistry. 
(n) Since the medical course demands the full energy of the student, espe- 
cially in the freshman year, all deficiencies should be removed, so far as possible, 
during the summers preceding and following the freshman medical year. 
(o) A medical school having students who were conditioned on entrance in 
1914-15, under the former regulations, are entitled to have the conditions of 
such students brought into conformity with the rulings here announced without 
prejudice to its standing. 
  
1Part courses or uncompleetd courses are not to be accepted. 
2 Deficiencies in preparation should be made up in large part in attendance at a summer 
session of the university, either before or following the freshman medical year.

ENDOWMENTS FOR MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
Prior to 1900 the great majority of medical colleges depended 
entirely on the income from tuition fees. This situation has been 
reversed. Instead of paying dividends, the faculty members of some 
independent medical colleges at the present time are being regularly 
assessed each year to pay deficits. It is now well known that the 
cost of teaching each medical student in the better-equipped medical 
college is two, three, or even several times the sum which he pays 
for tuition. The reason for this change is evident. A great field 
of medical research has been opened by the work of Virchow and 
Pasteur. The establishing of the germ origin of many diseases, the 
development of immunization by vaccines, antitoxins, and serums, 
and the advent of antiseptic surgery have practically revolutionized 
the teaching of medicine and demanded schools having expert, sal- 
aried teachers, extensively equipped laboratories, generous provision 
for medical research, and an abundance of hospital and dispensary 
material.’ It was soon clearly demonstrated that even the most ex- 
orbitant tuition fees would not meet the expense for maintaining 
one of these modern medical schools, and that either State aid or 
private endowment was essential. Philanthropists did not care to 
give money to profit-bearing institutions, but responded nobly to 
the needs of high-grade medical schools. As President Eliot once 
said: “The way to get endowment for medicine is to improve 
medical education.” As medical colleges have adopted better stand- 
ards of admission and shown that they deserved to exist, the needed 
financial aid has been obtained. Generous appropriations have been 
granted to State university medical schools, and endowments of 
hundreds of thousands, or millions, from private sources, have been 
so frequent in recent years as to become almost commonplace. These 
gifts have been so generous for some institutions as to make them 
equal, if not superior, in resources to the leading medical schools 
abroad. Since 1906, when Harvard Medical School, obtained its 
beautiful new buildings, the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, the 
Huntington Cancer Hospital, the State Psychopathic Hospital, and 
other institutions have been built in the immediate vicinity and 
brought into close affiliation, resulting in the development of a great 
medical center. Johns Hopkins Medical School, with its modest 
start in 1896, has since been developed by large additions to its 
endowment, by the increased provision for medical research, and the 
expansion of its hospital, until it, likewise, ranks among the world’s 
great medical schools. There have been marked developments at 
Pennsylvania and Michigan and, more recently, at Minnesota, Co- 
lumbia, and Tulane. New medical buildings at less expense, but pro-

portionally of equal importance, in recent years have been erected 
for the medical schools of the State universities of Georgia, Nebraska, 
and North Carolina and for the Medical College of South Carolina. 
A beautiful new medical library building has been secured for Leland 
Stanford Junior University, and greatly increased hospital connec- 
tions, leading to the development of more compact medical teaching 
plants, have been obtained by Western Reserve University and the 
University of Cincinnati. The medical department of Vanderbilt 
University at Nashville and the Atlanta Medical College, after long 
struggles against competition and adversity, have received liberal 
endowments and are now undergoing a rapid development. Within 
the past year, however, another achievement of great importance has 
been brought about at St. Louis. The Barnes Hospital, the St. Louis 
Children’s Hospital, and the Washington University Medical School 
have built splendid new buildings in immediate proximity, at an 
expense of over $2,500,000. The three institutions, furthermore, 
have endowments amounting to approximately $3,000,000. Of 
greater significance, however, is the fact that these institutions have 
formed a close affiliation by which they can work together to fulfill 
in the best manner possible a threefold function: (a) To furnish the 
best and most enlightened care of the sick in accordance with modern 
medical knowledge; (0) to add to the positive knowledge regarding 
the cause, cure, and prevention of disease through scientific research; 
and (¢) to furnish courses of instruction by which the public will 
be provided with thoroughly trained physicians and nurses. The 
dedication of these new buildings marks the completion of another 
great medical teaching institution in the United States, and places 
the Washington University Medical School on a par with other 
leading medical schools. 
In the light of all these marked achievements in médical educa- 
tion, it is not surprising that as great, or perhaps greater, things are 
being planned in other parts of the country. These recent accom- 
plishments, therefore, give confident expectation that the plans for 
a ten-million dollar medical center at Columbia University will be 
successfully worked out. Surely, no development is more worthy 
of generous support; no investment could bring greater returns in 
the saving of lives, in the prevention of sickness and distress, and in 
promoting the welfare of the public.

THE MAYO FOUNDATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA.* 
Another special incident of the year was the establishing of the 
“Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research” by the 
Mayo brothers, of Rochester, Minn. This was endowed for $1,- 
500,000 and has been placed in affiliation with the University of Min- 
nesota for a trial period of six years. From a small beginning many 
years ago the Mayo clinic developed until it is now recognized the 
world over. It possesses a large amount of material and equipment 
useful in diagnosis and research, and the clinical records of patients 
have been carefully kept and cross indexed, making them of special 
value for statistical study. The taking over by the University of 
Minnesota of the Mayo foundation has greatly aided the development 
in that State of a high type of graduate medical instruction and re- 
search. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION IN CHINA. 
The Rockefeller Foundation has outlined the plan of its proposed 
endowment of medical education in the Republic of China under 
the management of an American resident director, Dr. Roger S. 
Greene. It is the intention of the foundation to establish a system 
of medical colleges and hospitals throughout China by appropria- 
tions to certain existing schools and the establishment of additional 
institutions. Modern surgical and medical methods will be intro- 
duced in all the centers controlled by the foundation.

  CHAPTER IX. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
By Witr1am T. Bawven, 
Specialist in Industrial Hducation, Bureau of Education, 
ConTENTS.—Present tendencies—National aid for vocational education—State systems of 
vocational education—New work in State universities—Training teachers for voca- 
tional education—Organizations interested in vocational education—Investigations 
and surveys—Vocational guidance—Vocational education in the small city—Achieve- 
ments in typical centers—Items of special interest. 
One year is perhaps a brief period within which to expect to note 
progress in some fields, but not so in vocational education at the 
present time. The intensity of popular interest, the increasing num- 
bers of those who seek definite suggestions for specific purposes, the 
eagerness with which information is sought, and the magnitude of 
the physical proportions of the movement, as manifested in legisla- 
tion and in the creation and extension of schools to meet newly con- 
ceived needs—all of these grow steadily and rapidly more impressive. 
A review of the year’s developments within the limits of a few pages 
must of necessity be cursory and fragmentary. It is believed, how- 
ever, that further consideration of the topics dealt with in the fol- 
lowing pages would give the student a grasp of the significant phases 
of the movement. In the preparation of this chapter many of the 
recognized leaders in all parts of the country have materially assisted 
by reports and suggestions. This assistance is here cordially ac- 
knowledged. 
1, PRESENT TENDENCIES. 
(1) Cooperation.—It is always more difficult to interpret contem- 
poraneous events than it is to gauge their importance when seen in 
retrospect. Nevertheless, it seems reasonably clear that there has 
been during the past year no force or principle of action more in- 
fluential than the spirit of cooperation. 
The idea that the factory, the labor union, the commercial estab- 
lishment, the woman’s club, the parent-teacher association, and other 
representative groups, with the public school as an aggressive inter- 
mediary and leader, may and should unite in the study, and the 
ultimate solution, of the problems of vocational education, is causing 
almost a revolution in educational thinking. If this revolution can 
be carried over into educational practice, as now seems probable, 
221
-P-A-G-E-242
  222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
many other departments of school activity besides vocational edu- 
cation may reap the fruits of cooperative effort. 
(2) Trade agreements.—One of the immediate practical and tan- 
gible benefits resulting from cooperation has been the development 
of agreements relative to vocational and continuation school pro- 
grams and apprenticeships. The pioneer work in this field dates 
back four or five years at least, but the developments of the past year 
have been especially noteworthy. Examples and precedents and 
texts of agreements to meet a variety of typical situations are now 
becoming available, and their extension to a large number of cities 
and to new conditions may be expected to be a feature of the new 
year’s work. 
(3) Specific programs.—The belief seems to be growing that there 
is no such thing as general vocational education beyond the ele- 
mentary stages, but that programs and courses of study must have 
specific ends in view. Vocational education has been declared within 
the past year to be a “local and not a general question,” and much 
emphasis has been placed on the necessity of an understanding of 
local conditions in determining methods of procedure. 
(4) Basis of aims and purposes—Because of this evolution of 
opinion with reference to the importance of local conditions there 
has been a disposition to reexamine seriously the basis of supposed 
facts upon which vocational schools and courses have been built. 
A new note has been struck in the recognition of the “ futility of 
training a boy or girl for a place that does not await him.” The new 
point of view is characterized by keen interest in questions of supply 
and demand in the labor market and by intensive study and analysis 
of occupations and a more careful inventory and analysis of existing 
educational facilities. 
(5) The prevocational school.—One of the significant phases of 
the year’s progress is in the further development of a type of 
school or department designed to assist boys and girls of approxi- 
mately the 12 to 16 years old period to a better understanding of 
their own abilities and of the best possible use to be made of such 
abilities from the point of view of the life career. When work with 
this object in view has been undertaken as a form of classroom study 
without special equipment, with or without visits to industrial and 
commercial establishments and individual studies and researches, it 
has been referred to as “ vocational guidance.” 
‘When, however, special equipment has been provided, so that the 
pupil may participate in practical shop and laboratory activities 
on real projects selected from a number of fundamental vocations, 
with a sufficient amount of time assigned to practical work, it has 
been believed that the pupil may be able to form for himself an 
intelligent relative estimate of his fitness for the various types of
-P-A-G-E-243
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 223 
vocation in which he thus engages as the basis for the choice of a 
life career. To such special school or department has been given 
the title of “ prevocational school” or “ prevocational class.” There 
has been some criticism as to the propriety of the term “ prevoca- 
tional” in connection with such work, and it does not yet appear that 
the term will be permanently adopted. 
(6) Raising the age of entrance into industry—The tendency 
toward raising the age at which young people may enter profitable 
employment in the industrial and commercial world is unmistakable. 
The term “blind-alley job” persists in educational discussion, just 
as the thing itself persists in real life, and probably will persist for 
an indefinite period to come. Many kinds of work must be done; all 
kinds of work are not equally interesting or edifying or of equal 
promise for the future. It is coming to be recognized that even the 
“blind-alley job” is not an unmitigated evil, especially if its char- 
acter is clearly understood by the worker and by society. 
Many boys and girls are persuaded to reject opportunities for 
merely casual employment when its true nature and probable effects 
are made clear to them, and necessary sacrifices are willingly made in 
order that more adequate preparation may be made for something 
more worth while. For many others, who must, or who think they 
must, go to work at whatever offers, the “ way out” may be provided 
through continuation and part-time schools. 
The enactment of legislation in the States relating to employer’s 
liability and workmen’s compensation, industrial accident insurance, 
minimum wage, and compulsory education, together with the chang- 
ing public sentiment which has inspired or resulted from this legis- 
lation, are potent causes of the gradual but certain rise in the age 
at which boys and girls permanently discontinue their schooling to 
go to work. 
In an investigation, recently made in Iowa, information was se- 
cured from a group of employers with a total aggregate roll of 
401,130 workers, representing 65 of the leading industries of the 
State. In this total number of employees there were reported only 
249 boys and 76 girls under 16 years of age. The statements from 
the employers indicate a growing conviction that an employee under 
16 years of age is not an industrial asset. Such facts, and the actual 
changing of the status of the young worker, must be regarded as an 
important phase of the movement for vocational education. 
(7) Democracy in education.—V ocational education is an integral 
part of a great national attempt to achieve real democracy in edu- 
cation. It is preeminently an attempt to work through the schools 
and through the industries to minister to the educational needs of 
children who have not been served completely or efficiently by
-P-A-G-E-244
  224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
existing schools. It is an attempt to supplement existing educa- 
tional opportunities, to the end that “all the children of all the 
people” may be adequately prepared for their life work. 
(8) A social as well as educational problem—Of great signifi- 
cance, finally, is the evident tendency to see in vocational education 
something more than a mere special problem of the schools—the 
tendency, that is, to regard it, with all of its ramifications, as a 
great social problem. As such, according to the new point of view, 
it will never be satisfactorily solved until all those forces and 
agencies that are interested in social amelioration and human prog- 
ress can be brought together for a cooperative and concentrated 
attack upon those fundamental evils that are beneath the surface of 
illiteracy, inefficiency, and poverty. 
2. NATIONAL AID FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The bill proposing Federal aid for vocational education, drafted 
in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on 
National Aid to Vocational Education (House bill No. 16952, known 
as the Smith-Hughes Bill), which was introduced in the second ses- 
sion of the Sixty-third Congress, was not acted upon finally before 
adjournment. It is expected that the bill will be brought up for 
further consideration at the next session of Congress. 
A summary of the provisions of the bill was given in the 1914 
report." 
3. STATE SYSTEMS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
No change has taken place since the last report in the number of 
States having systems for organizing and supervising vocational 
schools and for assisting local communities in the maintenance of such 
schools through grants of State aid. These States are Massachu- 
setts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Indiana. 
In each of these States administration is effected through the office 
of a special deputy or expert assistant attached to the staff of the 
State superintendent of public instruction or commissioner of educa- 
tion. 
In Connecticut the law provides for industrial schools under two 
optional plans: (1) Supported and controlled by the State board of 
education; (2) controlled by the local community, with State aid 
under specified conditions. In Maryland annual grants are made for 
the partial support of colored industrial schools. In Vermont, Maine, 
Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and Tennessee 
provision is made for State appropriations to communities or schools 
  
1See Educ. Rept., 1914, vol. 1, p. 239.
-P-A-G-E-245
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 225 
offering approved courses in industrial, manual, or household arts 
subjects. 
Earnest attempts to ‘secure legislation for a State system of voca- 
tional education in Illinois again failed. Three separate bills were 
introduced into the State legislature: (1) The Cooley bill, drafted 
according to the suggestions of Dr. E. G. Cooley, of the Chicago 
Commercial Club, providing for a modified form of dual adminis- 
trative control, involving special industrial education boards ap- 
pointed by the regular boards of school trustees; (2) the so-called 
teachers’ bill, placing the organization and administration of vo- 
cational education in the hands of the regular boards of school 
trustees, otherwise embodying certain of the approved features of 
the Cooley bill; (8) the Hatch bill, providing for unified control, 
providing that State aid may be given only to vocational education 
programs based on preliminary community investigation of needs 
and conditions, definitely recognizing three factors in vocational ad- 
justment, namely, choice of, preparation for, and employment in 
some suitable occupation. 
The committee on education of the assembly held several public 
hearings, but failed to report any one of the bills. Lack of agree- 
ment among the advocates of the new legislation is commonly under- 
stood to be the explanation for the committee’s refusal to recom- 
mend action at this session, 
The following summary, based upon reports received from the 
offices of the State departments of public instruction, constitutes a 
brief review of activities during the past year in the States men- 
tioned. In general, it may be said that this has been a year of quiet, 
consistent growth and progress, of strengthening in the details of 
organization, with little of the spectacular or of the kind of display 
that appeals to the press agent. The year has been marked by 
numerous conferences of selected groups of workers, who have come 
together for the purpose of serious study of common problems and 
for mutual helpfulness. The cordial and reciprocal relations sub- 
sisting between groups of workers in the various States, representing 
different points of view and diverse administrative conceptions, must 
be regarded as one of the very encouraging features in the movement 
for vocational education. 
A list of the members of the staffs of the divisions of vocational 
education in the State departments of public instruction is presented 
herewith. :

MASSACHUSETTS. 
Legislation.—Chapter 106 of the acts of the year 1912 has been 
amended in certain particulars, so that the amended paragraph reads: 
Any city or town may, through its school committee or other board of trustees 
for vocational education, establish and maintain separate day and evening 
classes in household and other practical arts. Such classes shall be known 
as practical art classes. If day classes only, or evening classes only, are estab- 
lished, they shall be open to all women over 16 years of age; if. both day and 
evening classes are established, the day classes shall be open only to women 
over 16 years of age, and the evening classes shall be open only to women 
over 17 years of age who are employed in any capacity during the day. Such 
classes may be established and maintained as approved State-aided practical 
arts classes under the provisions of, and subject to, all the conditions. not in- 
consistent with this act, of chapter 471 of the acts of the year 1911. 
Bulletins.—The seventy-eighth annual report of the State board 
of education, 1913-14, contains details of the progress made in 
vocational education. Reprints of various sections of this report 
have been issued from time to time.

Training prospective teachers —During the year the State board 
of education has cooperated with communities in conducting courses 
for the preparation of teachers for vocational and continuation 
schools. Classes were organized for this purpose in five centers: 
Boston, Worcester, Springfield, Lowell, and New Bedford. Each 
class met for two evening sessions weekly for 20 weeks. The num- 
ber of students in the five classes was 46, representing the following 
trades: Machinists, 13; toolmakers, 4; carpenters, 5; painter and 
decorator, 1; weaver and loom fixer, 1; pattern makers, 5; plumbers, 
3; printers, 2; electricians, 3; bookbinders, 2; stationary engineer, 
1; sheet-metal worker, 1; cabinet maker, 1; baker, 1; not reported, 3. 
Some of the members of these classes had already secured good 
teaching positions before the close of the fiscal year, and there were

good prospects of more desirable openings with the resumption of 
work in the fall. Since membership in the classes was limited to 
skilled mechanics employed at their trades, no hardship is involved 
while waiting for suitable teaching positions. 
Training teachers in service-—The third annual conference of 
teachers in State-aided vocational schools wis held in May, and was 
productive of definitely valuable results. The conference was or- 
ganized in such a way as to serve two main purposes: (1) To pro- 
vide for discussion of the most troublesome teaching problems en- 
countered in vocational schools; (2) to divide the teachers into 
homogeneous groups, for a portion of the time, for the intensive 
consideration of questions that are not of universal interest. 
By arranging for a general session on each day, followed imme- 
diately by a number of round-table discussions, classified according 
to trade groups, held simultaneously in different rooms, it was pos- 
sible to cover a wide range of subject matter within a short. period 
of time. It is reported that 78 papers were read in the boys’ indus- 
trial school section, 39 in the girls’ trade school section, and 25 in the 
homemaking section. These papers represent contributions from 
directors, department heads, and practically all the full-responsi- 
bility teachers in the full-time day industrial schools of the State. 
The papers presented were regarded as of such value to the teachers 
that steps have been taken to publish the entire proceedings of the 
conference. 
The State officials report a constantly growing spirit of self-confi- 
dence, manifested by the entire teaching force in addressing itself to 
the new problems that are constantly coming up. Less than a year’s 
successful teaching experience is sufficient to imbue the beginner 
with enthusiasm and the spirit of cooperation. It is characteristic 
of the teacher in the vocational school to be on the lookout for op- 
portunities for self-improvement, to be eager to receive suggestions 
from others that will aid in the development of his own courses of 
study and methods, and to be always only too glad to pass on to 
others engaged in similar work any new ideas and suggestions that 
may emerge from his own experience. 
Special problems.—The special problem in Massachusetts, in the 
opinion of the deputy commissioner in charge of the work, is to 
utilize to the utmost these favorable conditions for progress as they 
exist, and to make the resources within the school system itself con- 
tribute to mutual development to the highest degree possible. 
To this end, it is proposed to systematize further the conferences 
and group studies of teachers for the coming year. An analysis is 
to be made of the major problems that confront the teacher of voca- 
tional subjects. In the case of each of these problems, some teacher 
who has made definite progress toward its solution will be asked
-P-A-G-E-249
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 229 
to describe his experiences in some detail, in writing. The State de- 
partment will distribute copies of this statement to other teachers 
throughout the State who are engaged in similar lines of work. 
Each such teacher will be asked to criticize the paper, and to return 
it with suggestions. These comments on the paper will be collected 
and edited, and sufficient copies printed to send a complete set of the 
papers to each one contributing to the discussion. The State de- 
partment will add any other suggestions or comment gathered from 
outside the State that may relate to the particular question under 
consideration. 
By this means it is hoped that each important unit of instruction 
in all the various trades or departments may be discussed, and de- 
tailed statements of successful teachers and methods relating to each 
question made available. 
NEW YORK. 
Legislation—tThere has been no new legislation. The official title 
of the division has been changed from “Division of Vocational 
Schools” to “ Division of Agricultural and Industrial Education.” 
- Conferences—An important phase of the year’s work was a 
series of conferences organized for the purpose of developing and 
promoting a spirit of cooperation among the vocational teachers of 
the State and to assist in bringing to their attention the latest con- 
tributions to the solution of the problems of vocational education. 
The State was divided into five districts, and a vocational teachers’ 
association was organized in each—western, southern, central, south- 
eastern, and capital districts. Two conferences, each lasting two days, 
were held in each district. Programs were prepared and mailed to 
teachers 10 days in advance of each conference. The date of the first 
conference was October 16-17, 1914, and of the final one May 7-8, 1915. 
Training of teachers.—In addition to the regular day-school courses 
for the training of special vocational teachers offered in a number of 
institutions in various parts of the State, the State College for Teach- 
ers at Albany offers a two years’ evening course for trade workers 
which fits them to become teachers in vocational schools. ‘Teacher- 
training courses for trade workers are offered also at the State Nor- 
mal School, Buffalo; Teachers College, Columbia University, New 
York, and Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. 
Teachers of agriculture in the high schools of the State have been 
called together for a week of instruction at the State College of Ag- 
riculture. Men actually engaged in the work, as well as those who 
expected to teach during the following year, were in attendance. 
Trade agreements.—Considerable progress has been made during 
the past year in developing cooperative efforts of employers, workers, 
and the public schools. In Rochester, especially, cooperation has   
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
reached a high stage of development, both in spirit and in substance. 
More than two years ago the first agreement was entered into be- 
tween the Rochester Typothetz and the Rochester Shopschool. By 
the terms of this agreement the Typothets agree to provide places 
for a certain number of boys each year who are to be certified by the 
shopschool as having passed the test of a preliminary three months’ 
course designed to eliminate the unfit. A graduated wage scale is 
agreed upon for the apprenticeship period, four years. The first 
two years are spent in alternating weekly between the school and the 
factory, wages being paid for school time as well as for factory time. 
Upon the successful completion of the work of the first two years 
the remaining two years are spent in the factory, but still under the 
supervision of the school. Graduation from the school is not possible 
until the satisfactory completion of the entire four years’ work and 
the passing of efficiency tests. Each successful graduate apprentice 
receives from his employer a bonus of $100. 
The agreement with employers of machinists provides that the 
school shall give to boys, who have been carefully selected by means 
of a preliminary try-out course, “a preparatory course of approxi- 
mately two years, one-half of each day being spent in shop practice 
and the other half in the study of shop nrathematics, mechanical 
drawing, applied science, industrial history, civics, and English.” 
The employers agree to provide places for a certain number of 
graduates of such course for a two years’ apprenticeship with a 
graduated wage scale. One-half day each week, on full pay, is to 
be devoted to further work at the school. The diploma of the school 
is not awarded until after the completion of three months’ satis- 
factory work with the employer. The agreement was adopted by 
representatives of 27 establishments employing machinists and other 
metal workers. 
The director of the Rochester shop school reports that 45 boys are 
receiving training in the machine-shop department on the basis of 
this agreement, of whom 30 will be ready for graduation in 1916, 
and each boy, even at this time, has a place secured for him. * * * The 
boy has not only a definite job ahead of him, but a definite shop and employer ; 
certainly a far call back to the time when a boy left school and roamed the 
streets looking for help-wanted signs. 
Agreements have been entered into with employers of buttonhole 
makers, clothing manufacturers, master painters and decorators, 
and others. 
In Buffalo the public school department has entered into agree- 
ments with Typographical Union No. 9 and with the International 
Association of Machinists, District No. 12, by which students who 
complete specified courses in the public vocational schools will be 
credited with certain deductions from their apprenticeship periods. —

Bulletins —The following bulletins have been published: No. 597, 
Rural Education Series, No. 1. Schools of Agriculture, Mechanic 
Arts, and Homemaking. Five numbers of the Empire State Voca- 
tional Conference Bulletin, containing reports of 5 of the 10 special 
conferences of vocational teachers held during the year. These bul- 
letins were printed by boys in the printing department of the Elm 
Vocational School, Buffalo. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Legislation —The passage by the last general assembly of the Cox 
child-labor law, in which provision is made for continuation schools 
for minors between the ages of 14 and 16, presented some very serious 
problems to the bureau of vocational education, which is charged with 
the organization and supervision of these schools, under the general 
direction of the State board of education. The most difficult of these 
problems was that of insuring a supply of properly trained teachers 
for the work. A brief statement of the summer training schools 
organized for this purpose will be found below. 
The State department of public instruction has in preparation a 
bulletin which will give an analysis of the legislation, and suggestions 
for the organization of continuation schools, courses of study, and 
equipment. The funds made available for distribution under the 
direction of the State board of education for 1915-16 include $325,000 
for vocational work and $1,000,000 for continuation schools. 
The problem—tThe special problem of vocational education in 
Pennsylvania is conceived to be that of adapting the school to the 
community rather than of attempting to adapt the community to the 
school or to a standardized scheme of procedure. For this reason a 
number of different types of school have been developed rather than 
any one particular kind. 
No effort has been made to develop special schools beyond the num- 
ber which can be cared for adequately by the funds available for the 
work. At the close of the school year, July 6, 1914, there had been 
established, in 11 different counties, 2 day industrial schools or de- 
partments, 1 continuation industrial school, 10 evening industrial 
schools, 8 all-day household arts schools or departments, and 8 even- 
ing household arts schools. During the past year these numbers have 
been increased as follows: Counties, 20; day industrial schools or 
departments, 4; continuation industrial schools, 3; evening industrial 
schools, 21; all-day household arts schools or departments, 4; evening 
household arts schools, 14; continuation household arts classes, 3. 
The total enrollment during the past year was approximately 10,000 
persons. 
The work which has seemed to meet with the greatest success dur- 
ing the year has been that done in the evening industrial schools and
-P-A-G-E-252
  232 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the evening household-arts schools. A new type of household-arts 
school has been developed in the form of continuation classes for 
adults. 
Mining schools—The schools for miners have had a very success- 
ful year. That these schools have been of great service to the workers 
in the anthracite and bituminous mines of the State is the general 
testimony of all who have had opportunity to know of the work. 
Mr. J. J. Walsh, mine inspector for the tenth anthracite district, has 
prepared a chart which shows that during the period 1907-1912 
there was one accident by explosion of gases in the tenth anthracite 
district for every 790,000 tons of coal mined; while during the year 
1913, in the same district, there was only one accident by explosion 
of gases for every 2,500,000 tons of coal mined. Mr. Walsh attributes 
this decrease in the number of accidents in large measure to the in- 
fluence of the evening mining schools, a number of which were con- 
ducted in the district. 
The advisory committees appointed by the various school boards 
to assist in the work of the vocational schools have been of great 
assistance during the past year. The success of the schools has been 
due in no small degree to the activities of those who have interested 
themselves in their development. 
An interesting type of school has been developed in the ungraded 
vocational school, or department, in the West Chester High School. 
Boys are admitted to the industrial courses and girls to the home- 
making courses with sixth, seventh, and eighth grade preparation. 
This decision made necessary the organization of the classes in aca- 
demic subjects on an individual-instruction basis. The superintend- 
ent of public schools in West Chester is of the opinion that the ex- 
istence of this school is responsible for a marked reduction in the 
number of applicants for employment certificates during the past 
year. 
Teachers.—The problem of securing teachers with suitable prepara- 
tion for vocational school work becomes more serious each year. In 
the opinion of the State department, neither the teacher who has 
had theoretical training alone, nor the one who has had practical 
training alone has been a great success. Certain districts have been 
able to secure teachers who have had some professional training as 
well as practical experience. The work of these teachers has been 
regarded as successful in most instances. 
Summer training schools.—In the effort to meet this problem, the 
bureau of vocational education formulated a plan for the organiza- 
tion and operation of summer schools for the training of special 
teachers for continuation schools. It was decided to hold these 
schools in selected industrial centers, in order that the prospective 
teachers might have opportunity to study the conditions and prob-
-P-A-G-E-253
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 233 
lems of the manufacturer and of the workers. It was decided also 
to utilize public-school buildings, in order that the teachers might 
familiarize themselves with the conditions in which they will be re- 
quired to work. 
Five schools were opened—in Philadelphia, Reading, Scranton, 
Altoona, and Pittsburgh—and were in session from July 19 to 
August 13, 1915. The number of teachers enrolled in the summer 
schools was as follows: Philadelphia, 82; Reading, 59; Scranton, 
102; Altoona, 13; Pittsburgh, 55; total, 311. Privilege of enrollment 
was limited to teachers holding a teacher’s certificate valid in Penn- 
sylvania and to those who had had at least one year’s experience 
in teaching. The principals and instructors for the summer schools 
were selected from the public school teaching staffs in the various 
cities. 
Instruction was given in English, arithmetic, civics, hygiene, 
geography, drawing, and special methods for continuation schools. 
In addition class visits were made to a number of industrial estab- 
lishments, written reports of which were required. 
The success of the summer schools was such that the State officials 
have recorded their convictions that the experiment should be re- 
peated next year, that the work should be materially enlarged in 
scope, and the advantages offered to others than those who are to be 
teachers in continuation schools. 
Surveys.—The staff of the bureau of vocational education has 
been called upon to assist in a number of surveys of industrial and 
school conditions, with the view to preparing recommendations for 
the establishment of vocational schools. In cooperating in this 
work the effort has been not to make detailed statistical studies, but 
to assist local districts in securing the necessary information for 
use in planning courses of study that will meet the conditions as 
they exist.

struction for the year ending July 6, 1915. 
WISCONSIN. 
Legislation.—The State legislature of 1915 passed five laws affect- 
ing the administration of vocational schools: (1) Increasing the 
number of schools which may receive State aid by removing the 
limit (45 schools heretofore), providing appropriations for State 
aid up to $150,000 annually. (2) A new apprenticeship law, making 
the terms of apprenticeship more flexible and, it is hoped, more 
acceptable. School attendance is required under contract up to 18 
years of age. It is not compulsory thereafter. (3) Requiring young 
persons employed in industry over 16 years of age and under 17 
to attend part-time school not less than five hours per week for six 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  234 EDUQATION REPORT, 1915. 
months in the year. (4) Increasing the period of attendance upon 
part-time schools for young persons employed in industry over 14 
years of age and under 16 from 4 hours per week for 8 months in 
the year to 4 hours per week for 10 months. (5) Requiring attend- 
ance at continuation schools of persons over 14 years of age and under 
16 when employed in domestic service or at home. 
Types of school—Four classes of school have been established 
under the provisions of the law: 
1. Industrial school: This includes day classes for apprentices 
over 16 years of age and also all-day industrial activities for persons 
14 to 21 years of age. 
2. Continuation school: This school is for all persons 14 to 16 
years of age who are employed under labor permits, or persons 14 
to 16 employed in domestic service. 
3. Commercial school: This school is for persons over 16 years of 
age, temporarily unemployed, or for exceptional pupils who wish to 
become efficient salesmen or accountants. 
4, Evening classes: These classes are for persons over 16 years of 
age. 
During the past year 29 cities have maintained one or more of 
these types of school under the supervision of the State department 
of industrial education. Three cities maintained evening schools: 
Marinette, Menomonie, Two Rivers; 2 cities maintained continua- 
tion, commercial, and evening schools: Marshfield, Menasha; South 
Milwaukee maintained industrial, continuation, and commercial 
schools; Beaver Dam and Cudahy maintained continuation and even- 
ing schools; 17 cities maintained industrial, continuation, and even- 
ing schools: Appleton, Beloit, Chippewa Falls, Eau Claire, Fond 
du Lac, Green Bay, Janesville, Kenosha, La Crosse, Manitowoc, 
Neenah, Oshkosh, Sheboygan, Superior, Stevens Point, Wausau, 
West Allis; 4 cities maintained industrial, continuation, commercial, 
and evening schools: Grand Rapids, Madison, Racine, Milwaukee. 
The average rate of tax levy for the year 1914-15 was 0.000413. 
The average expenditure per capita, based on total enrollment for 
all vocational schools, was $13.44. The average attendance in the 
vocational schools is 1 person in 29 of the population of the State. 
The summary of the receipts and expenditures for vocational schools 
in the 29 cities is as follows:

  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 235 
Training teachers in service.—A very important phase of the year’s 
work is the teachers’ conference and institute, extending over a 
period of three days, and bringing together practically all of the 
teachers and directors of the industrial schools, as well as many 
members of the industrial boards and advisory committees. Two 
conferences were held during the year, the first at Milwaukee, Sep- 
tember 2, 3, 4, 1914, and the second at Oshkosh, May 17, 18, 19, 1915. 
Training prospective teachers—In addition to the conferences 
referred to in the preceding paragraph, important plans for the 
training of teachers are administered by the following institutions, 
in cooperation with the State department: University of Wisconsin, 
department of manual arts, at Madison; University of Wisconsin, 
extension division, at Milwaukee; Stout Institute, at Menomonie; 
State Normal School, at Oshkosh. The courses offered at these in- 
stitutions afford excellent opportunities for teachers in neighboring 
schools to extend their training, as well as facilities for training and 
trying out new recruits. 
Bulletins —The following bulletins have been published: 
No. 10. Proceedings of the conference and institute of industrial teachers 
held at Milwaukee, September, 1914, including outlines of courses of study and 
reports of committees, 
No. 11. Proceedings of the conference and institute held at Oshkosh, May, 
1915. 
Report of the State board of industrial education. 
NEW JERSEY. 
Legislation —The term “industrial education” has come into 
more or less general use in New Jersey as referring to certain edu- 
cational activities which have been developed under three laws, each 
of which uses the term. 
Industrial school law.—This law, enacted in 1881, is one of the 
earliest industrial education laws in the United States. As now in 
force, it provides State aid up to a maximum amount of $10,000 
for any one school. Industrial education is not defined in the statute, 
but it is provided that funds contributed by the State— 
shall be applied * * * to the establishment and support of schools for the 
training and education of pupils in industrial pursuits (including agriculture), 
so as to enable them to perfect themselves in the several branches of industry 
which require technical instruction. 
Three schools, each under an independent board of trustees, have 
been organized under the provisions of this act: The Trenton School 
of Industrial Arts, the Newark Technical School, the Hoboken In- 
dustrial School. 
Manual-training law—For more than 10 years New Jersey has 
been granting State aid for manual training in the public schools
-P-A-G-E-256
  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
under a law which provides for “industrial or manual training.” 
The law does not define the term “industrial or manual training,” 
but provides for its definition by the State board of education in 
requiring that the course of study in any district must meet the 
approval of the State board as a condition of a grant of State aid. 
The interpretation given to the law has permitted the giving of 
State aid, under its provisions, to manual training, household arts, 
and work in agricultural subjects in elementary and high schools. 
The State department of public instruction reports that in no in- 
stance has a distinctly vocational school been organized under the 
terms of this law, and only in rare instances are there to be found 
classes or departments that are prevocational in character. 
The amount of State aid for “industrial or manual training” is 
limited to $5,000 for any one district. 
Vocational-school law.—In 1918 the State legislature enacted a 
law for the encouragement and aid of vocational education, in which 
are defined the terms “ vocational education,” “ industrial education,” 
“aericultural education,” and “ home-making education,” with sub- 
stantially the same meanings as those formulated by legislation in 
Massachusetts. Evening classes in industrial or agricultural subjects 
are restricted to persons over 16 years of age, and the instruction must 
deal with the subject matter of the day employment. Evening 
classes in home making are restricted to women and girls over 17 
years of age. 
The law provides for the union of two or more districts or for 
county boards for the organization of schools. State aid is provided 
for equal in amount to that raised in any district for the establish- 
ment of a vocational school, with a maximum of $10,000 in any one 
district. In the case of county organization the maximum amount 
of State aid is $10,000 irrespective of the number of schools estab- 
lished. i 
There are atthe present time, under the joint control of State and 
local school authorities, vocational schools or departments in 13 
districts, with 2 additional districts now formulating plans for 
the establishment of schools at an early date. The occupations for 
which classes have been organized in all-day vocational schools in- 
clude: Printing, mechanical drawing, carpentry, cabinetmaking, 
electrical work, machine shop, agriculture, home making. As is 
pointed out in the report of the assistant commissioner, “ When we 
consider the very large number of vocations, even in the industrial 
field alone, we see at once that we have not gone very far in pro- 
viding vocational schools.” 
New work.—oOne of the most notable developments in vocational 
education in New Jersey has been the organization of county units. 
Most of the school districts in the State, outside of the large cities,
-P-A-G-E-257
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 237 
are unable to establish and maintain vocational schools, but with the - 
county as a unit of organization and with the financial resourses 
that a county board of education can control it will be possible to 
meet some, at least, of the vocational needs of the smaller communi- 
ties. 
The form of administrative control under the county-unit plan is 
somewhat anomalous. So far as their relation to the State depart- 
ment of public instruction is concerned, the organization and man- 
agement of these schools are the same as in the case of any school 
district. Within the county, however, the county vocational school 
board is administratively independent of other public-school juris- 
dictions to the extent of being given authority by law to organize 
and maintain vocational schools. These county boards in all cases 
work in close relations with the local school systems. The county 
superintendent of schools is a member of the county vocational 
school board. 
As an indication of the appeal made by schools of this type the 
following quotation from the published announcement of a county 
vocational school may be noted: 
To those boys who have no prospect of a high-school or college education, 
put who desire to enter the business world on the completion of their grammar- 
school work, the vocational school offers many advantages. 
A two years’ course in this school will give a boy a foundation for his life 
work in any of the various branches of woodwork, drafting, or show-card 
writing, or will qualify him to do, in a workmanlike manner, a great variety 
of repairs to buildings and farm implements, and, in addition, will furnish ade- 
quate instruction in grammar, spelling, penmanship, and practical arithmetic. 
The vocational guidance committee will endeavor to aid boys in the choice of 
a vocation that will prove both congenial and profitable. 
Four counties have now organized vocational schools on the 
county-unit basis: Atlantic, Cape May, Essex, and Middlesex. 
Bulletin—Annual report of the assistant commissioner for voca- 
tional education, in the annual report of the State commissioner of 
education. 
Conferences.—Several conferences of vocational teachers have been 
held during the year in various sections of the State. 
No specific program for the training of teachers has been under- 
taken by the State department. The plan of certification has been 
revised during the year, but for the most part the vocational schools 
must draft their teachers from the trades, depending on such train- 
ing and supervision as can be given by expert directors. 
INDIANA. 
The first annual report on vocational education in Indiana was 
presented to the State board of education December 1, 1914, includ- 
ing the following items: (1) An account of the work of State-aided
-P-A-G-E-258
  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
vocational schools and departments; (2) a statement of the progress 
made in instruction in elementary agriculture, domestic science, and 
industrial arts subjects in the regular public schools; (3) an account 
of the trade-extension work of the county agents of agriculture; (4) 
a report on the work of boys’ and girls’ clubs, and school and home 
gardening. 
Under the present law State aid may be given to three types of vocational 
education: (1) Agricultural education, (2) domestic-science education, (3) 
industrial education, 
“Agricultural education” means that form of vocational education which fits 
for occupations connected with the tillage of the soil, the care of domestic 
animals, forestry, and other wage-earning and productive work on the farm. 
“Domestic-science education” means that form of vocational education 
which fits for the business of home making. 
“Industrial education” means that form of vocational education which fits 
for the trades, crafts, and manufacturing pursuits, including the occupations 
for girls and women carried on in workshops. 
Types of school.—Three types of vocational school have been pro- 
vided for by the Indiana law: (1) The all-day school, designed to 
meet the vocational needs of young people over 14 years of age, and 
preparing for specific vocations; (2) the part-time school, designed 
to help young workers between the ages of 17 and 25 years to greater 
efficiency in the skilled occupations in which they are engaged; (3) the 
evening vocational school, designed to help workers over 17 years of 
age to secure greater efficiency in the skilled occupations in which 
they are engaged. 
CALIFORNIA, 
Legislation —Two measures relating to vocational education were 
passed by both houses of the State legislature, but were vetoed by the 
governor, on the ground that the State is not yet ready to assume 
the financial burden involved. These two measures were known as 
senate bill No. 236, which provided for the “establishment and 
maintenance of vocational courses and schools by local boards of edu- 
cation for the purpose of encouraging agricultural, industrial, trade, 
commercial, and all other practical subjects, and providing State aid 
therefor,” and senate bill No. 237, providing for the “ establishment 
and maintenance of classes for the training of vocational teachers, 
and providing State aid therefor.” 
Of the 41 general education acts passed by the legislature of 1915, 
however, several have a distinct bearing on the progress of vocational 
education. The new legislation places all responsibility for issuing 
certificates to teachers of special subjects in the hands of the State 
board of education. Special provision is made for a vocational 
teacher’s certificate, requiring actual experience in the occupation 
for the teaching of which the applicant seeks certification. Cadet
-P-A-G-E-259
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 239 
teaching is provided for as a part of the training of special vocational 
teachers. 
Vocational training has been included among the statutory studies, 
as provided in section 1665, chapter 467. Section 1750, chapter 597, 
provides that the courses of study in all high schools must be ap- 
proved by the State board of education, thus affording the board an 
excellent opportunity to stimulate vocational education, even without 
State aid, by means of encouragement and suggestion. 
Sections 1750a and 1617d, chapter 90, provide for the establishment 
of intermediate schools, which will enable rural high schools to 
organize as centers for seventh and eighth grade pupils. This 
reorganization will make possible the introduction of agricultural 
courses lower down in the grades than has been practicable heretofore. 
The new county high-school tax provides a minimum of $60 for 
each pupil in average daily attendance in high schools. This amount, 
added to $15 per pupil which is raised by the State tax, automatically 
provides approximately $75 for each pupil in attendance. The effect 
of this law will be to cause local school authorities to introduce 
courses of study that will retain pupils in school, and to produce auto- 
matically almost the entire revenue necessary for their instruction. 
Section 1858, chapter 726, will doubtless encourage the develop- 
ment of vocational classes, by providing that the attendance of 
pupils in part-time day classes, and evening continuation and voca- 
tional classes, may be counted with the attendance in other schools. 
The significance of this provision arises from the fact that approxi- 
mately two-fifths of the funds for elementary schools are raised by 
State tax and two-fifths by county tax, leaving only about one-fifth 
to be raised by the local district. 
According to the opinion of the State commissioner of vocational 
education, the movement is gathering added force daily, and it is 
confidently expected that important progress will be made during the 
next year or two. California experience has apparently been quite 
at variance with that of the eastern experts who, in recommending 
certain legislation for California, reported that it has been “next to 
impossible to get the technical high schools to meet the vocational 
situation.” The response on the part of the high schools is regarded 
as indicating a notable spirit of cooperation, a determination to study 
the needs and conditions, and a readiness to act in accordance with the 
findings. No difficulty is anticipated in getting the authorities of the 
technical high schools to build up strong independent departments 
for vocational education, and to contribute their full share to the 
progress of the movement.

CONNECTICUT. 
Legislation Section 1 of chapter 263, Public Acts of 1915, pro- 
vides that the State board of education may continue to maintain 
schools already established, and may establish in such towns as may 
seem best adapted for the purpose public day and continuation 
schools, part-time schools, and evening schools, for instruction in the 
arts and practices of trades and vocations. The State board may 
make regulations controlling the admission of students to such 
schools, provided that no person under 14 years of age shall be ad- 
mitted to schools established under this law, except during vaca- 
tions. 
Section 2 of the same act gives the State board of education author- 
ity to expend the funds provided, to appoint and remove teachers, to 
make rules for the management of the schools, and to make annual 
financial statements and reports as to the conditions of the schools 
and the acts of the board. The board is also authorized to negotiate 
cooperative arrangements between vocational schools and manufac- 
turing and mechanical establishments. 
Section 8 permits the State board to lease temporary accommoda- 
tions, for a period not to exceed four years, when necessary in estab- 
lishing a school. 
Section 4 authorizes towns or districts to raise by appropriation 
such sums as are necessary for the maintenance and improvement of 
such schools, and for leased buildings. 
The State legislature of 1915 appropriated $250,000 for trade- 
school work for the biennium 1915-1917. A State supervisor of trade 
education was appointed January 6, 1914. 
Any city or town school committee may organize a school of 
trades and apply to the State board of education for State aid. If 
upon investigation the work of the school is found to meet the re- 
quirements, State aid is given to the extent of $60 for each 2,400 
student-hours of instruction. Each school is required to report 
monthly to the State board a detailed statement of students’ actual 
attendance upon blanks furnished for the purpose. 
For the guidance of principals of vocational schools, and inspec- 
tors, a “basis of approval” for State aid has been formulated by the 
State board of education. 
There are at the present time five trade schools operating under 
the rules and regulations of the State board of education: Bridge- 
port, New Britain, Putnam, Torrington, South Manchester. Other 
schools giving vocational instruction include the Boardman appren- 
tice shops, a part of the public-school system of New Haven, referred 
to elsewhere in this chapter; manual training high school, New Lon- 
don, which offers certain vocational work in combination with high-

school manual training courses; continuation schools, Waterbury and 
Hartford; prevocational school, New Britain. 
NEW MEXICO. 
The legislature in 1912 provided for the appointment by the State 
superintendent of public instruction of a State director of industrial 
education who should have general charge of the introduction and 
teaching of industrial education in the public schools of the State. 
On January 1, 1918, Manette A. Myers was appointed to the position. 
The term “industrial subjects” has been interpreted to include 
“domestic science, manual training, and agriculture,” and the activi- 
ties of the new division have consisted chiefly in the promotion of 
these lines of work throughout the State. County institutes of teach- 
ers have been conducted; machinery has been set up for examining 
and certificating special teachers; outlines of courses of study have 
been prepared and distributed; and there has been much visiting of 
schools.

New work.—Special attention has been given to the development of 
evening school courses during the year. The superintendent of 
schools in Santa Fe County is planning to organize evening classes 
for parents in every rural school in the county during the coming 
year. 
Training teachers——The State normal schools have organized spe- 
cial departments for the training of prospective teachers of home 
economics, manual training, and agriculture. The State: university 
also has organized a department for this purpose, and the State agri- 
cultural college has reorganized its courses and added several new 
instructors. 
Teachers’ institutes, giving special instruction to teachers of the 
lines of work indicated above, were held in practically every county 
in the State. Teachers from counties in which no institute was held 
were accommodated in special classes organized at the State normal 
schools.

The special problems before the department in New Mexico are 
the adequate training of teachers for the work, the securing of 
adequate funds, the raising of standards and ideals of vocational 
education, and study of the special needs of the State. 
MAINE. 
Industrial education as it is developing in the State of Maine is 
based upon the theory that suitable preparation for future vocations 
can be’ given without materially changing the existing school system. 
That is, it has been determined that a special system of schools for 
the purposes of a special type of vocational education is unwise and 
unnecessary. It is held that a knowledge of industrial processes, and 
the accompanying participation therein, is a part of a liberal educa- 
tion that ought to be made available for all children. The State, 
therefore, encourages the development of courses of study leading 
toward such liberal education, and including these elements. 
Recent legislation encourages cities and towns in taking the 
initiative in the development of such vocational courses and classes 
as are deemed best adapted to meet local needs, at the same time 
reserving supervisory authority and direction to the State depart- 
ment of public schools. 
Legislation —In general, the State aids the local community to the 
extent of two-thirds of the salaries paid to teachers, with specified 
maximum limits, reserving the right to pass on qualifications of 
teachers, courses of study, and equipment. The lines of work for 
which aid is given include: Manual arts; domestic science; agricul- 
ture; trade, technical, or general industrial schools; evening schools 
in which industrial subjects are offered. The sum of $40,000 is 
appropriated annually for State support of industrial education. 
Chapter 188, Public Laws, 1911, as amended by chapter 37, Public 
Laws, 1918, provided for the establishment of special industrial 
departments in the State normal schools, for the preparation of 
teachers of industrial subjects. An annual appropriation of $6,000 
is made for the establishment and maintenance of these departments, 
of which two are already in operation. The normal school at Gor- 
ham offers special courses in the mechanic arts, and the normal 
school at Farmington in domestic science and arts. 
Section 3 of the same act provides for State aid to public ele- 
mentary schools a sum equal to two-thirds of the total expenditure 
for salaries of teachers of mechanic arts and domestic¢ science, the 
maximum amount to be paid by the State for the employment of any 
one teacher not to exceed $800 in any one year; providing further, 
that the town receiving State aid shall make special appropriations 
for the support of industrial education.
-P-A-G-E-263
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 243 
Section 4 of the act provides for State aid to communities main- 
taining approved courses in agriculture, mechanic arts, and domestic 
science a sum equal to two-thirds of the amount paid for instruction, 
with a maximum payable by the State of $500 for any one course. 
Schools which receive stich aid must maintain an average attendance 
of 12 pupils throughout the year. The equipment, course of study, 
and qualifications of the teachers must meet the approval of the 
State before aid is given. 
Section 6 provides for State aid to communities memecig ap- 
proved courses in evening schools in the mechanic arts, domestic 
science, or free-hand or mechanical drawing a sum equal to two-thirds 
of the amount expended for salaries of teachers of such subjects. 
Section 7 provides for reimbursement by the State of two-thirds 
of the amount paid for instruction by communities maintaining ap- 
proved general industrial schools. The maximum amount payable 
by the State to any one community is $2,000 in,any one year, A 
school, to receive State aid, must maintain an average attendance of 
20 pupils for a period of 36 weeks. The quality of instruction, course 
of study, and qualifications of teachers must meet the approval of 
the State. : 
Types of school—The public schools of Portland have opened 
classes in salesmanship in cooperation with retail dry-goods mer- 
chants. Girls from the department stores report to special classes 
held in a public school building, receiving full pay for the time thus 
spent. The instruction covers a period of one-half day daily, morn- 
ings, for six weeks. Further developments in a more comprehensive 
scheme of cooperation are being outlined. 
The public schools of Westbrook maintain a full-time cooperative 
school, involving local paper mills, silk mills, and machine shops. 
The course of study meets college entrance requirements, and-at the 
same time offers two options—paper making and textile work. In- 
struction is given in the processes of making paper and textiles, study 
of machines, and other mechanical details. Students spend one-half 
day each week in the mills. This practical work is supplemented by 
analytical chemistry, mathematics, history, and physics as applied 
to the industries. Upon graduation students are taken into the mills, 
or may enter the University of Maine. 
Teachers’ conference.—During the fall of 1914 the industrial teach- 
ers of the State were organized into the Maine Manual Arts Club 
for the purpose of discussing problems of mutual interest. The club 
holds three meetings each year. <A portion of the program of the 
State conference of superintendents is devoted to a discussion of in- 
dustrial education.
-P-A-G-E-264
  244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Certification —Teachers of the mechanic arts and domestic science 
are certificated by qualifying under one of the following conditions: 
(1) By graduation from an approved institution for the training of 
teachers; (2) by passing satisfactorily a written and oral examina- 
tion for skilled workmen, giving by the State department; (3) pres- 
entation of credentials showing satisfactory experience in other 
States maintaining equal standards of instruction. 
WASHINGTON. 
In March, 1914, the State legislature authorized the appointment 
by the State superintendent of public instruction of a commission on 
vocational education, which should make a study of conditions in the 
State and report recommendations as to procedure. An advisory 
board of 50 members was appointed, and received the report of the 
commission, which was submitted in December, 1914. At this date 
the commission went out of existence. 
The members of the commission were: Prof. Herbert G. Lull, 
chairman, University of Washington, Seattle; Ben W. Johnson, di- 
rector of industrial education, public schools, Seattle; Prof. F. O. 
Kreager, State College, Pullman; W. M. Kern, superintendent of 
public schools, Walla Walla; Mrs, Lizzie Jones, superintendent of 
public schools, Snohomish County; A. J. Rhodes, merchant, Seattle; 
H. L. Hughes, editor “Labor World,” Spokane. 
A statement from the chairman of the commission indicates that 
such study as it was possible to make of a few selected typical com- 
munities seems to warrant the conclusion that there is real need of a 
State-wide system of vocational education. The commission recom- 
mends State aid for prevocational education, especially for rural 
communities: (1) Because so many pupils leave school before the 
high-school age; (2) because the rural communities will be able to 
establish prevocational instruction much sooner than vocational in- 
struction; (3) the importance of agriculture in Washington, in com- 
parison with commerce and manufactures, makes early as well as 
sound instruction in agriculture essential in vocational education 
and to the prosperity of the State. 
State aid is recommended for the following lines of work: 
1. Prevocational instruction, including industrial, commercial, agricultural, 
home economics. 2 
2. Vocational instruction of less than college grade, including industrial, 
commercial, agricultural, and home economics. 
8. Vocational departments in the public schools, or, in the largest cities, as 
conditions may require, special vocational schools under the public-school 
system. 
4, Full-time vocational instruction. 
5. Part-time vocational instruction. 
6. Evening vocational instruction.
-P-A-G-E-265
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 245 
In the opinion of the commission, the important problems of ad- 
ministration of vocational education are, in the city, the organization 
of the existing school system to meet a variety of industrial and voca- 
tional needs; in the rural community, the organization of the school 
districts in such a way that the proposed developments will be finan- 
cially feasible, and provision for adequate supervision of the pro- 
posed new lines of educational effort. 
The recommendations of the commission included the draft of a 
proposed “act to provide for the encouragement, maintenance, and 
supervision of prevocational, vocational, and trade education in in- 
dustries, agriculture, commerce, and home economics.” 
4. NEW WORK IN STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
MINNESOTA. 
During the past year action has been taken which adds the Univer- 
sity of Minnesota to the list of State universities maintaining de- 
partments for the preparation of special teachers of the manual arts. 
The new department at Minneapolis will be organized at the opening 
of the school year 1915-16 by Ray L. Southworth, of the Minneapolis 
public schools. 
Other State universities that have taken this step are: University 
of Wisconsin, Madison, September, 1910; University of Missouri, 
Columbia, September, 1913; Indiana State University, Bloomington, 
June, 1914. 
INDIANA. 
An instructive experiment was conducted during two weeks in 
July, 1915, by Indiana State University, in a special teachers’ train- 
ing class open only to women workers in the trades. The trades rep- 
resented were cooks, milliners, and dressmakers. In considering 
candidates for admission to the class, school-teachers were rejected, 
even teachers of the special subjects of cooking, millinery, and sewing, 
with the exception of one or two who had had actual trade experience. 
Membership in the class, with these exceptions, was limited strictly 
to those who were employed in the trades, and who gave promise of 
adaptability to the work of teaching. Aside from these considera- 
tions, questions of university credits and entrance requirements were 
minimized, if not neglected. 
The edhe of applicants for admission to the course, 90, suggests 
that there is here a large field of work ready for diploids Of 
these applicants, 18 were selected after careful inquiry and consider- 
able preliminary correspondence. 
The class met for a three-hours session daily, five days per week, 
for two weeks. The work included a limited amount of attention to 
practical activities for the purpose of illustrating examples of 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
methods of dealing with materials and processes in the three trades; 
methods of organizing and presenting teaching material; methods of 
handling administrative details; demonstration lessons, criticism, 
and discussion. It is reported that from the first morning there was 
| an unexpected readiness to ask questions and to participate freely 
in the discussion. 
The course was not given on the university campus, but in Indian- 
apolis, in order to place the opportunity within reach of as large a 
group of trade workers as possible. Through the courtesy of the 
Indianapolis public schools, the necessary rooms and equipment were 
made available at the Shortridge High School. It is especially inter- 
esting to note that this experiment was conducted in an industrial 
city, under the auspices of the school of education of a State univer- 
sity, with the active cooperation of a city board of education. Thus 
does evidence gradually accumulate to show that the public-school 
system can and will deal with the problems of vocational education. 
The course for trade workers and the summer conference on vo- 
cational education in the small city, referred to elsewhere in this 
chapter, were organized as parts of a general program for vocational 
education being developed by the department of industrial edu- 
cation of Indiana State University. The plan for the institute at 
Indianapolis included a similar class for men workers from the 
trades, which had to be abandoned at the last moment because of the 
sudden illness of the instructor. 
Bulletins —Two important bulletins have appeared during the past 
year resulting from the activities of the department of industrial 
education of Indiana State University: 
A Study of the People of Indiana and Their Occupations for Purposes of Vo- 
eational Education, by R. J. Leonard; Indiana University Bulletin, Vol. XII, 
No. 17, February 15, 1915. 
Some Facts Concerning the People, Industries, and Schools of Hammond, 
and a Suggested Program for Elementary Industrial, Prevocational, and Voca- 
» tional Education, by R. J. Leonard; published by the Board of Education, Ham- 
mond, Ind., April 15, 1915. 
WISCONSIN. 
The University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., now offers through 
the university extension division four correspondence-study courses, 
as follows: History and literature of manual and industrial arts; 
teaching and supervision of manual and industrial arts; organization 
of manual and industrial arts; vocational education and vocational 
guidance. 
The aims in offering these courses, which are limited to those not 
requiring extensive shop or other laboratory equipment, are: (1) 
To enable those in teaching positions to extend their general knowl- 
edge of the subject matter and teaching methods, and to give them 
   
-P-A-G-E-267
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 247 
breadth of view through a study of the broader aspects of their pro- 
fessional work; (2) to secure a means by which those contemplating 
a bachelor’s degree in manual arts may do a portion of their work 
in absentia; (3) to provide instruction for systematic reading by 
those who are interested in manual arts and industrial education in 
the home, social settlements, regular public schools, or special voca- 
tional schools. 
CALIFORNIA. 
The university extension division of the University of California, 
Berkeley, Cal., announces that it has effected a plan of cooperation 
with the California State Normal School of Manual Arts and Home 
Economics at Santa Barbara, whereby correspondence-study courses, 
lectures, and demonstrations in home economics are offered to women 
practically engaged in home making. The courses are designed to 
meet the needs of the home, and deal in general and in detail with 
the economic problems of the family. They are planned primarily 
for those who have not made a systematic study of the subject, and 
the purpose is to meet the everyday needs of housewives. 
The courses, as announced, include: Selection of foods; prepara- 
tion of foods; care and preservation of foods; feeding the family; 
feeding of infants; the house; household management; selection and 
maintenance of clothing; general survey of home economics, 
Following the very favorable reception given to the course in vo- 
cational guidance in the summer session of 1915, a seminar course in 
vocational guidance will be offered for the year 1915-16. 
5. TRAINING TEACHERS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The most important events in the training of teachers for voca- 
tional education have been the special measures to insure a more ade- 
quate supply of teachers that have been undertaken in the several 
States, as outlined in the preceding pages. In addition to the institu- 
tions named, the State normal school, Buffalo, N. Y., has organized a 
course for trade workers, designed to give the fundamentals of teach- 
ing methods and the professional point of view. 
There are indications that history is repeating itself in the chang- 
ing attitude toward qualifications of teachers. In the early stages 
of the manual-training movement it was thought that only the prac- 
tical mechanic is capable of teaching the processes of his craft, and 
numerous attempts were made to recruit staffs of shop teachers from 
this source. In the course of time those who were responsible for the 
supervision of the work*of such teachers began to realize that certain 
essential qualities were lacking. Professionally trained teachers were 
then substituted, but on the whole the results were still not entirely 
satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-268
  248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Occasionally the mechanic teacher would realize his need of the 
pedegogical training that would enable him to analyze the technic of 
his trade for teaching purposes, and that would give him some un- 
derstanding of the nature of the processes of development that take 
place in the child and youth, and he would take steps to supply the 
jack. On the other hand, the school-trained teacher, somewhat less 
readily perhaps, came to realize the necessity of a more intimate ac- 
quaintance with industrial materials and processes than can be ob- 
tained ordinarily in a school shop, and he would spend his summer 
vacation, or his Saturdays, in supplementing his school-shop training 
by practical experience in the factory or on actual construction work. 
Similar experiences have been encountered in the vocational-educa- 
tion movement, and, as in the earlier stage, there is still difference of 
opinion as to which procedure produces the more useful teacher. The 
director or supervisor who has been successful in organizing his staff 
of teachers into a continuous-study class, and in inspiring a profes- 
sional attitude and the desire to improve by experience, gradually 
comes to express a preference for the trade-trained teacher. Such a 
director relies upon the professional training that may be secured “ on 
the job” under conditions of careful supervision, and upon his success 
in eliminating from the service those individuals who do not mani- 
fest adaptability to the work. 
There is another point of view that emphasizes the importance of 
correct methods of procedure, especially in the early stages, proper 
habits of work, and a wholesome attitude toward work and its place 
in life. From this point of view breadth of vision and a certain 
idealism are as important as specialized skill in the equipment of 
one, even a shop teacher, who assumes the responsibilities of a teacher 
and leader of youth. An inspired and inspiring outlook upon life 
is not guaranteed to every graduate of an institution of learning, 
but the very fact that a prospective teacher has made the effort to 
prepare himself for his work by suitable professional training cre- 
ates a presumption in his favor. 
Reports from the field suggest a well-defined tendency in the direc- 
tion of increased respect for those qualities in the teacher that are 
the result of or that are measurably enhanced by professional 
training. There seems to be a growing demand for teachers of 
manual arts and vocational subjects who have completed a teachers’ 
course in some standard institution. A teachers’ agency, reviewing 
a number of years’ experience in this field, is quoted as believing 
that in the near future it will be difficult “to place any man in a good 
school unless he has completed a full coursé and holds a degree.”

THE RICHMOND CONFERENCE. 
In view of the evident interest in the subject the Commissioner of 
Education called a conference on the training of teachers for voca- 
tional schools in Richmond, Va., December 11, 1914, in connection 
with the annual convention of the National Society for the Promo- 
tion of Industrial Education. To this conference were invited 
specialists in charge of departments for the training of teachers for 
vocational schools in State universities, normal schools, and other in- 
stitutions, and presidents or directors of such institutions, also State 
officials in charge of the administration of vocational education. 
The general topic before the conference was “ the qualifications of 
teachers for vocational schools,” discussed from the points of view 
of the institution that undertakes to prepare the teachers, the school 
that is to employ the teachers, and the State official who is to in- 
spect the teacher’s work. The formal program was followed by 
an earnest and spirited discussion. A 10-page report of the pro- 
ceedings, prepared by the Bureau of Education, has received a wide 
circulation. 
6. ACTIVITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
Progress in vocational education is due in no small measure to the 
publicity given to the discussion of vital questions on the programs 
of numerous organizations, representing a wide range of interests, 
and to the constructive work done by officers and committees of 
these organizations who have taken their responsibilities seriously. 
No review of the year’s work would approach completeness without 
consideration of the activities of at least the following organizations: 
NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
During the past year representatives of the National Society for 
the Promotion of Industrial Education have taken an important part 
in the work of the vocational education surveys in Richmond, Va., 
and Minneapolis, Minn., referred to elsewhere in this chapter. 
In addition to work done in these two investigations the assistant 
secretary of the society, Cleo Murtland, under the direction of the 
committee on women’s work, has been contributing much valuable 
assistance and special research work in a number of other cities, 
including New York, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Bloomington, 
Ind. 
The resignation of Dr. Prosser as secretary has compelled the 
board of managers to give serious consideration to problems of the 
society’s immediate future. For the present, Alvin E. Dodd, busi- 
ness manager for the past year, has been appointed secretary.

  250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
ANNUAL CONVENTION. i 
The eighth annual convention of the society, held in Richmond, 
Va., December 9-12, 1914, was in several respects the most important 
that the society has held, and perhaps the most important convention 
that the movement for vocational education has seen. 
The convention was unique in that it was preceded by an industrial 
education survey on a more ambitious scale than had ever been pre- 
viously attempted. To the superintendent of the Richmond schools 
and the officers of the society must be credited the conception of a , 
great idea when it was decided to attempt a survey that, in addition 
to pointing the way to the solution of local educational problems, 
might serve other communities as a type or model study, and when, 
still further, it was proposed to have the investigation precede the 
annual convention of the society and to offer its findings and con- 
clusions, as well as its methods, for critical examination and dis- 
cussion at the convention. 
Three entire sessions of the convention dealt with various phases 
of the survey and it received consideration incidentally at still other 
sessions. After the completion of the field work, a number of type 
classes suggested by the survey were organized, and were in opera- 
tion at the time of the convention. Thus the visiting delegates were 
able not only to go over the actual ground that had been surveyed, to 
examine the data that had been collected, and to check up the con- 
clusions and interpretations, but also to inspect the classes which had 
been organized in accordance with the resulting recommendations. 
Those who have not followed the development of the national 
society from its organization in New York City, in November, 1906, 
up to the present time, are hardly prepared to appreciate the prog- 
ress in vocational education that has taken place within this brief 
period nor the important part the society has played in this progress. 
The changes that have taken place within the society itself and its 
own growth in wisdom and breadth of view are evidence of its 
vitality and capacity to adjust itself to changing conditions. The 
following statement from a sympathetic reviewer of the Richmond 
convention summarizes these changes in a significant paragraph: 
Among the more important evidences of growth are, first, its reversal of its 
early unsympathetic attitude toward prevocational work, which it now heartily 
indorses and finds absolutely necessary to a complete or adequate solution of 
the problems involved in democratizing a school system; second, it seeks to 
secure the necessary training through the amplification of the existing school 
system rather than through a system of separate industrial schools, as at first 
advocated; third, the society has learned to depend upon the educational 
authorities for the working out of a part of the problems instead of relying 
mainly upon the so-called “ practical man”; and, finally, the society has come 
to recognize that the local conditions must determine to a considerable extent 
the kind of industrial education needed and the methods of organization and

  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 251 
This brief analysis might very appropriately be offered as an epi- 
tome of the development that has taken place in the entire movement 
for vocational education during the past 10 years. To the foregoing 
should be added one additional factor that the society has been par- 
ticularly active in bringing into prominence—cooperation. 
NATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ASSOCIATION. 
The National: Vocational Guidance Association was organized in 
October, 1918, in Grand Rapids, Mich., and held its second annual 
convention in Richmond, Va., December 7, 8, 9, 1914. The organiza- 
tion meeting was preceded by two national conferences on vocational 
guidance, the-first having been held in Boston in 1910 and the second 
in New York in 1912. 
The general topics discussed at the Richmond convention included : 
Practical phases of vocational guidance; vocational guidance in the 
public-school system; vocational guidance and social welfare. 
A summer meeting was held at Oakland, Cal., August 17-18, 
1915, in connection with the conventions of the National Education 
Association and the International Congress on Education. At this 
meeting the secretary of the association, W. Carson Ryan, jr., sum- 
marized the present status of the vocational guidance movement, as 
follows: 
(a) The preliminary work has been done. The question is no longer as to 
whether there shall be vocational guidance, but as to the best methods of organ- 
ization and procedure. 
(b) A permanent literature of vocational guidance is developing. At least 
three important books in this field have appeared during the past year; special 
attention has been given to vocational guidance in Government reports and in 
the reports of industrial and educational surveys; and there is a constantly 
increasing number of articles in periodicals. 
(c) Trained workers are being developed. University departments of educa- 
tion aré preparing vocational counselors, and teachers in service are receiving 
special training for vocational guidance work. 
(d) There is a visible improvement in the methods of vocational guidance. 
Instructions and schedules for use in vocational guidance work are more intelli- 
gent and practical than formerly. 
(e€) More and more vocational guidance is felt to be the function of the 
school. The vocational aim is permeating all education. The “ six-and-six ” 
plan of school organization, for example, which many believe is destined to 
revolutionize the American public-school system, is essentially a plan of voca- 
tional guidance.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE MIDDLE WEST. 
The first annual convention of the Vocational Education Associa- 
tion of the Middle West was held at the La Salle Hotel, Chicago, Ill. 
February 5-6, 1915. <A spirited program brought together enthu- 
siastic audiences averaging over 600 in attendance. The success of 
the meeting was considered to have been— 
clearly due to the fact that there was one major theme running through all the 
sessions, and this theme was regarded by all as being of great importance. 
Although the topics of the several sessions were ‘“ Vocational Experience of 
Other States,” ‘“ Proposed Legislation,” and “Child Welfare,” the real theme 
was “The Unit versus the Dual System of Administration of Vocational 
Education.” The president, William J. Bogan, principal of the Lane Tech- 
nical High School, who made the program, deserves credit for having acted at 
the psychological moment in selecting his theme, and then for procuring speakers 
who treated it from almost every possible angle. 
One of the activities of the association is to meet as a study class 
for the consideration of measures for the promotion of vocational 
education. All available types of schools, as well as industrial plants, 
are to be visited and studied. The information gathered from these 
visits and from other sources is to be discussed at stated meetings 
of the board of directors, open to all members. These discussions will 
serve to determine the topics to be presented in public at the annual 
convention. 
The first of these meetings of the board of directors was held 
at the Insurance Exchange Building, Chicago, May 8, 1915. At this 
meeting the report of the secretary was presented and discussed, 
followed by an informal address by a representative of the United 
States Bureau of Education. 
The president of the association is Prof. Frank M. Leavitt, Uni- 
versity of Chicago, and the secretary is Albert G. Bauersfeld, Lane 
Technical High School, Chicago. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
Much important work has been accomplished by the special com- 
mittee on vocational education*and vocational guidance, which was 
appointed at the Chicago convention, July, 1912. The personnel of 
the committee remains the same as last year, with Robert J. Fuller, 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 253 
superintendent of schools, North Attleboro, Mass., as chairman. The 
committee expects to publish its report within a few months. 
The amount of attention given to vocational education subjects on 
the programs of the regular sessions, both of the Department of 
Superintendence and the association proper, indicates a continued 
recognition of the importance of this phase of education. Numerous 
valuable contributions have been made by these discussions. 
THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. 
No report on the activities of organizations interested in vocational 
education would be complete without reference to the American 
Federation of Labor. The federation was one of the earliest national 
bodies to issue an official pronouncement on this subject and to begin 
a serious study of the problem in all its bearings through the work 
of its committees. The first of these committees was appointed at 
the annual convention of the federation in Boston, in 1903, and its 
successors have been at work assiduously ever since. 
The most important statement made by officers of the federation 
during the past year was the address of President Samuel Gompers at 
the Richmond convention of the National Society for the Promotion 
of Industrial Education, December 10, 1914. The public generally, 
and schoolmen in particular, have not been fully aware either of the 
interest taken by organized labor in educational problems or of the 
nature of the tentative conclusions that have been reached as the 
result of deliberate study. For this reason Mr. Gompers’s address 
attracted wide attention. 
Mr. Gompers assured his audience that organized labor, far from 
being opposed to vocational education, has been for years “ active in 
its efforts to make the public schools do precisely that which some 
misinformed people even think labor opposes.” According to Mr. 
Gompers, workingmen are not disposed to obstruct the effort to 
modify the curriculum of the public schools so that the needs of 
workingmen and their children shall be served more fully. Such 
opposition as organized labor has manifested toward specific pro- 
posals, or in the case of particular schools, has been directed, not 
toward the fundamental principles of vocational education, but 
toward those features that are regarded as evils. The control of voca- 
tional education under private auspices, actuated by other motives 
than the highest interests of the pupil and the welfare of society, as 
well as attempts to deceive young people into the belief that there 
are “short cuts” to industrial efficiency, and any program that might 
result in curtailing or limiting in any way individual opportunities 
for further education and advancement—these are regarded as objec- 
tionable from the point of view of public policy.

  254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Organized labor is “eager to cooperate actively in instituting in- 
dustrial education in our public schools,” and welcomes the develop- 
ment of plans for such work when based upon careful preliminary 
surveys of actual conditions and needs, as was the case in Richmond. 
Considering the problem in its larger social and economic aspects, 
President Gompers concluded his address as follows: 
The period is almost past when the United States can depend upon cheap raw 
materials obtained with comparatively little labor from its mines and virgin 
fields. It is entering upon a period when it must depend upon the qualities of 
human labor. Under these conditions industrial decline is the only alternative 
to industrial education. Do you think that organized labor is going to advocate 
a policy of industrial decline—a policy of competing on a basis of cheap labor, 
instead of trained and efficient labor? Do you think it is going to advocate 
the adoption of Chinese methods in its competition with Europe? I can assure 
you that the American workingman will not accept any such solution of the 
problem. He will insist that competition shall be upon the basis not of cheap 
brute labor, but of intelligent efficient skilled labor, which means that he will 
in the future, as he has done in the past, insist that the instruction in our 
public schools be made democratic; in a word, that the public schools generally 
shall institute industrial education, and that that education shall be based upon 
an exhaustive study of the industries to determine what sort of industrial train- 
ing is required and is most conducive to the physical, mental, material, and social 
welfare of the workers, the community, and that which holds out the best hope 
for America’s workers, her citizenship, the perpetuity of our Republic, and 
fulfillment of its mission as the leader in the humanitarianism of the world. 
DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES. 
A declaration of the attitude of organized labor, with reference to 
the development of a system of vocational education in the public 
schools of New York City, was adopted April 20, 1915, at a confer- 
ence of delegated representatives of organizations whose members 
aggregate approximately 500,000 wage earners. 
Organized labor in New York City indorses industrial education in the pub- 
lie schools and believes that this sort of education, when organized with refer- 
ence to the industrial character of the community in which it is given, is for 
the best interests of labor, but organized labor may fairly demand that the 
training given to the children of wage earners in the public schools shall be 
such as will insure their economic well-being to the fullest extent possible. 
This can be achieved only by systematic organization. * * * 
We, therefore, condemn and wish to abolish every sort of industrial training 
which is not based upon, and continually modified with reference to, the indus- 
trial character of the community. 
Without attempting to outline a course of industrial education, 
which is recognized as a piece of work calling for expert service the 
report demands that a systematic and general survey be made of 
the city, its industries, and its schools. The essential thesis of the 
declaration is a demand that— 
industrial education in the public schools shall train the youth not for some 
industrial employment, but in the case of each youth so far as possible for 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
i 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 255 — 
that employment where the demand for labor is, relatively to the demand in 
other employments, greatest. 
Opposition to any system of training which will increase labor’s 
efliciency and wage-earning power is characterized as “ foolish,” but 
it is submitted that wisdom demands a system of education that shall 
bring about this increase in efficiency without the reaction of an arti- 
ficial and systematically stimulated oversupply of labor in certain 
pursuits. It is held that the wisdom necessary to insure such or- 
ganization comes only from accurate, extensive, and detailed knowl- 
edge of conditions. In general, this knowledge is not yet available; 
hence the necessity for careful scrutiny of proposals. 
At a meeting held in Washington, D. C., in September, 1915, the 
declaration of principles and: policies with reference to industrial 
education in New York City, referred to in the preceding paragraphs, 
was indorsed in principle by the executive council of the federation. 
Mention should be made also, by way of record, of the report of 
the committee on industrial education of the American Federation 
of Labor, which was introduced into the United States Senate on 
August 17, 1912, and printed as Senate Document No. 936, of the 
second session of the Sixty-second Congress. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATION SCHOOLS. 
The National Association of Corporation Schools was organized 
in New York, N. Y., January 24, 1913, with delegates present repre- 
senting 31 corporations. The third annual convention was held in 
Worcester, Mass., June 8-11, 1915, at which time the committee on 
membership reported 72 corporation members. In addition to cor- 
poration members, class A, the constitution of the association’ pro- 
vides for class B members, who are persons connected directly with 
the schools conducted by the corporations, and class C members, 
who include other persons in sympathy with the objects of the asso- 
ciation who are not eligible to membership in either class A or 
class B. 
The spirit of the organization, and of the convention, seems to be 
well represented in the following excerpts from the address of the 
president, Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, General Electric Co., Schenec- 
tady, N. Y. The problem of the supply of skilled workmen, which 
confronts every large employer, is analyzed and its two main causes 
pointed out: (1) The very nature of modern industry on a large 
scale, with its necessary subdivision and increasing specialization 
of work, offers almost no opportunity for a young man to learn a 
trade and become a skilled workman; (2) European countries no 
longer send us the supply of skilled workmen formerly available. 
But vocational education is not only a serious problem of American 
industry; its importance is realized even more outside of the cor- 
poration by the general public.

256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
There it appears as a problem of the parents to find a suitable occupation 
for their children, as a problem of the young men and women to find work 
without getting into a blind-alley occupation. Increasingly the general pub- 
lic thus makes the demand on the public schools to provide the vocational 
training which the industry gave in former times, but which it now, in its 
corporate form, fails to give. So far, the output of the apprentice courses of 
corporations is still very small compared with the industrial demand. 
The trade apprenticeship courses of corporations and the industrial educa- 
tion of the public schools at first appear to be in competition with each other, 
but in reality the problem of the trade apprenticeship can be solved only by 
the cooperation of the corporation and the public school, as was proven by 
the experience in the professions. * * * Applying this experience to the 
trades we see that the practical trade training must be given in the industry 
by the corporation apprentice course, but the public schools must do the 
preparatory work. 
The field of the corporation school is the industrial training of those fitted 
for the industry. The field of the public schools is the general education; that 
is, to supply that minimum-amount of knowledge which every intelligent citizen 
must have before he can specialize in trade or profession, or at least that part 
of general education which is difficult to acquire afterwards. 
With increasing civilization the requirements of general education also have 
increased. With increasing population density, and the growth of cities, 
physical development, hygiene, and medical supervision become essential parts 
of public education; and familiarity with the use of the most common indus- 
trial tools, such as hammer, saw, ete., which formerly was acquired in the 
home, has to be taught by manual training in the schools. This increasing 
general educational demand on the schools precludes the possibility of indus- 
trial training—that is, of teaching a trade—within the limited time of manda- 
tory school attendance, and industrial or vocational training thus must be con- 
tinuation school work, while manual training, giving a general familiarity 
with the common tools of industry such as every man should possess, belongs 
in the grades as a mandatory subject. * * * 
The new field of the public school is to establish an intelligent system of 
vocational guidance based on the teather’s familiarity with the pupil’s char- 
acteristics, and especially on the adaptability and interest shown in manual 
training, so as to lead the pupils into those trades and professions for which 
they are adapted and in which they can find the satisfaction resulting from 
success. 
After discussing other serious problems confronting the corpora- 
tion, the address concludes with a reply to the objection commonly 
urged that the large corporation destroys individual development, on 
which all progress in invention and scientific research is based, and 
that therefore it is hostile to civilization: 
It is true that in the early days of the new country, when unlimited natural 
resources gave everybody a good chance for success, individualistic effort was 
most efficient for progress; but these times have long passed, and in the world 
to-day the fight for existence has become so intense that the individual’s energy 
is wasted in the mere earning of a living, without much chance of development, 
and it is only in the comparative safety of the industrial corporation or the 
educational corporation—the university—that the conditions are favorable for 
such development of individualism as leads to the world’s progress. It is 
significant that to-day practically all scientific research, most of the inventive
-P-A-G-E-277
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 257 
and development work, is done within the industrial corporations or the educa- 
tional institutions, and very little by the unattached individual, showing that 
in the corporation is found also the most efficient means of making individual 
development possible in our present state of civilization. 
The report of the committee on policy and finance recommended as 
one of the immediate requirements of the association the organization 
of a department which should make the necessary preliminary stud- 
ies and formulate courses of study for the schools which, “ while 
individualizing and specializing, will at the same time provide for 
that more general education which will be most useful and helpful to 
the employees and to their employers.” 
The executive committee understands the work of the association 
and of the schools maintained by the member companies, as “ in- 
tended to supplement all other forms of education,” and not to take 
the place of or to duplicate the work now being efficiently done else- 
where, or the work that appropriately belongs to other institutions. 
The committee on public education has been specifically instructed 
to study and report at the next annual convention the extent to 
which teachers in the public schools are going into the industries with 
their students during the time that the latter are spending in indus- 
trial study, and the extent to which arrangements have been per- 
fected by which corporations are taking students from public schools, 
at graduation, directly into the industries. 
The 1916 convention of the association will be held in Pittsburgh, 
Pa., May 30 to June 2. The president is Mr. John McLeod, Carnegie 
Steel Co., Pittsburgh, Pa. A series of monthly bulletins is published 
and distributed from the office of the executive secretary, F. C. Hen- 
derschott, New York Edison Co., Irving Place and Fifteenth Street, 
New York, N. Y. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS. 
For several years the National Association of Manufacturers has 
had a committee studying the problems of industrial education, and 
its reports have had a large circulation. As in the case of the Na- 
tional Association of Corporation Schools, the officers of this or- 
ganization have felt the necessity of defending its policy from what 
is held to be unnecessary and unjustifiable misunderstanding on the 
part of the public. At the eighteenth annual convention of the asso- 
ciation, Detroit, May 21, 1918, the report of the committee on indus- 
trial education contained the following paragraphs: 
Incredible as it seems, it has been alleged that employers want to exploit the 
youth by this education, and merely to get better mechanics for their shops. 
The working people and employers are a thousand times more alive to this 
situation than others, because they see most clearly the necessity of it. Had 
they kept still, the school-teachers might never have come to consider it im- 
portant that half the children intrusted to them are never educated. 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——17
-P-A-G-E-278
  258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The employers and the employees desires to save this half of the citizenship 
for its own sake. They want it educated first of all in the fundamentals of 
citizenship, wisely informed as to its rights, and how to secure them; as to its 
obligations and how to observe them, 
Educated and efficient mechanics, farmers, salespeople, homemakers are 
wanted for the Nation’s sake, for the sake of each and all of us) * *. * 
Employers can make money with any grade of help. Employers, after all, 
are only middlemen, and must sell a given product for its real worth. Whether 
it brings a high price or a low one depends upon the intelligence put into it. 
Neither employer nor laborer can get more out of anything than they put into 
it. Labor’s reward will be great in proportion as its efficiency and skill are 
great. 
The position taken in this report was reaffirmed at the 1915 conven- 
tion in New York, when on May 25 the committee opened its report 
with the statement that “vocational education is not teaching for 
an occupation only; it is the making of men and women.” 
In adopting the report of the committee, the National Association 
of Manufacturers went on record in favor of a system of vocational 
schools, including continuation schools, composite trade schools, 
special trade schools, and corporation schools that will be not en- 
tirely separate from the present public school, but collateral and 
supplementary to it. 
Special commendation is given to the work of the continuation 
school and the plan by which the worker is released for a short 
period each week during working hours, without loss of pay, in order 
to go to school. The committee believes that it is possible so to 
plan the five hours per week of instruction, and so to relate the ip- 
struction to the work of the other 48 hours of employment that 
together they shall constitute 48 hours of schooling that shall be 
profitable alike to workers, employers, and society in general. 
The association favors the development of plans for vocational 
education in the organization and administration of which em- 
ployers, employees, and educators shall participate on equal terms. 
Special emphasis is given to the necessity for vocational education 
for the thousands of boys and girls, young men, and young women 
who can not avail themselves of the opportunities afforded for higher 
education of the types which have prevailed in the past. A reorgani- 
zation of the public elementary schools “as respects the attitude and 
the desires of all children toward work” is regarded as probable. 
An important feature of the 1915 convention was an extensive ex- 
hibit designed to show the progress and possibilities of industrial 
education. In addition to displays of finished product, several 
trades schools from New York and neighboring cities installed par- 
tial equipments, and presented classes of students at work upon 
regular school projects.

7. INVESTIGATIONS AND SURVEYS. 
In the two previous reports the special investigations which have 
been made in a number of cities claimed a considerable part of the 
discussion. As pointed: out elesewhere, the work of investigation 
shows no signs of abatement, and a number of important contribu- 
tions have been made during the past year. Space can be given at 
this time to brief statements from only three of these cities: Rich- 
mond, Va.; Minneapolis, Minn.; New Orleans, La.t 
THE RICHMOND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION SURVEY. 
Beginning about the 1st of May, 1914, and ending about the mid- 
dle of October, the city of Richmond, Va., made a comprehensive 
survey of its schools and industries for the purpose of formulating 
plans for vocational education. The city school board took the 
initiative in making the investigation, supported by the Richmond 
Chamber of Commerce, the Business Men’s Club, the Rotary Club, 
the trustees of the Virginia Mechanics Institute, the central trades 
and labor council, the metal trades council, and other local organi- 
zations. From the outside, advice and assistance were rendered by 
representatives of the National Society for the Promotion of In- 
dustrial Education, the Russell Sage Foundation, the United States 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation. 
Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, of the Russell Sage Foundation, was direc- 
tor of the school survey. By means of an inquiry conducted through 
the children in the schools information was obtained as to the range 
of occupations engaged in by the young people of the city, and a 
study of the schools themselves was made to show to what extent 
preparation is made for these occupations. The facts as brought out 
seem to indicate that, in general— 
employers are unwilling to hire immature boys and girls, and that the best in- 
vestment that a boy or girl can make from 14 to 18 is to secure the training 
which will enable him or her to do the best work and to earn the largest wages 
after the age of 18. 
Boys and girls of 18 and 14 years of age were found scattered 
through the schools in all grades from the first year in the elementary 
school to the third year in the high school. Since boys and girls at 
these ages drop out of school rapidly, and since more than half of 
them are in the sixth grade or below, the facts indicate that in Rich- 
mond many of these children— 
may be expected to leave school soon and go to work with an educational 
preparation so inadequate as to hamper them in their vocations and seriously 
to reduce their value to the community. One of the important problems in the

-P-A-G-E-280
  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
progress of vocational education in Richmond is the increasing of the amount 
of common schooling secured by the average boy and girl. 
Mr. Charles H. Winslow, of the United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, was director of the industrial survey. This part of the 
survey included a special study of the John Marshall Night High 
School and the Virginia Mechanics Institute to determine in detail 
what was being done in vocational education and what facilities ex- 
isted that might be utilized in future developments. 
The study of the industries included analyses of the four chief 
mechanical industries of Richmond—the printing trades, 26 occupa- 
tions; the building trades, 35 occupations; the metal trades, 30 occu- 
pations; the tobacco industry, 17 occupations. In addition, the de- 
partment stores were considered in the study of women’s occupations. 
The information was obtained through two types of schedule: (1) 
An establishment schedule, analyzing the situation from the point of 
view of the employer; the schedules taken represented concerns em- 
ploying more than 15,000 workers; (2) an individual schedule, of 
which more than 700 were obtained, analyzing the individual histories 
and experiences of workers representing all the important occupa- 
tions noted above. 
Bulletins—Two preliminary bulletins were issued for distribution 
in December, 1914, by the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education: Synopsis of the Findings of the Richmond 
Vocational Education Survey; Synopsis of the Recommendations 
for Vocational Education for Richmond. . Both of these bulletins 
are already out of print, but all of the material will be republished in 
the full report of the survey, which is to appear as Bulletin No. 162 
of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Important features—The important features of the Richmond 
vocational education survey may be enumerated briefly, as follows: 
(1) This was the first attempt on a large scale to base a program for 
vocational education in a public-school system on the results of an 
intensive study of the schools and the industries of the city. (2) 
It was the first attempt to study the needs and aspirations of indi- 
vidual workers in large numbers for the purpose of determining 
desirable modifications in the public schools. (8) Groups of work- 
ers from the same, or closely allied occupations, having indicated a 
desire for more education, were gathered together and organized into 
classes, and the first steps in courses of study designed to meet ex- 
pressed desires were developed through conferences with the workers. 
Afterwards, teachers were sought who could meet the specific con- 
ditions which were thus disclosed. This is a radical departure from 
the accepted plan of preparing a course of study in the office of the 
director of a school, and then offering it to prospective students, wha 
may “take it or leave it.” (4) The city school board took the initia-
-P-A-G-E-281
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 261 
tive in the organization and control of the investigation, and as- 
sumed the responsibility for determining what measures should be 
taken in view of the findings and recommendations. (5) The sur- 
vey presented a remarkable situation of cooperation, involving © 
local, State, and national agencies, both public and private. 
THE MINNEAPOLIS VOCATIONAL EDUCATION SURVEY. 
By the will of the late William Hood Dunwoody, of Minneapolis, 
a trust fund of more than three million dollars was created for the 
purpose of giving free instruction in the industrial and mechanical 
arts to the youth of Minneapolis and the State of Minnesota gen- 
erally. -Before undertaking to put into effect the provisions of the 
will in any comprehensive way, the trustees of the fund desired 
complete information as to the kind of vocational education most 
needed by the city and advice as to the best ways in which the 
school could cooperate with the other educational agencies and in- 
stitutions of the city and State. Various recent events and local 
conditions led directly to the present survey, for which this gift 
furnished the necessary funds to meet a part at least of the expense 
for industrial education, and made necessary a study which should 
define the activities of the public schools and of the Dunwoody In- 
stitute. 
The superintendent of schools, together with the board of educa- 
tion and the trustees of the Dunwoody Institute, secured the co- 
operation of various local agencies in bringing the National Society 
for the Promotion of Industrial Education to Minneapolis to make 
this survey and hold its annual convention. 
Many different agencies are cooperating with the national society 
in making the survey. The expense, which will be about $8,000, is: 
being met by the board of education, the William Hood Dunwoody 
Institute, the University of Minnesota, and the Woman’s Club. In 
various ways, service whose total value is not less than an additional 
$8,000 is being contributed without cost by the board of education, 
the Dunwoody Institute, the University of Minnesota, the Minne- 
sota department of labor, and the Minneapolis Public Library. 
Business men, social workers, workingmen, and educators are giving 
freely of their time and their knowledge. Especially valuable have 
been the contributions of employers and employees, meeting in trade 
conferences to talk over the. content and detail of their common 
interests. 
The survey follows, in general, two lines: First, an investigation 
of public and private schools, in order to ascertain what vocational 
training is already being given, and how effectively it is meeting the 
needs of the pupils; second, an investigation of a number of selected 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
industries for men in which the major portion of the working popula- 
tion is employed, and certain industries for women, in order to ascer- 
tain the teachable content of these industries and how best that could 
be taught. 
Important featwres—A. more complete statement of the work of 
the Minneapolis survey must be reserved for the next report. The 
work of the survey is based in many respects directly upon the ex- 
perience gained in the Richmond survey. It is of interest to note the 
features in which progress is being made because of this fact. (1) 
The conditions as they exist in Minneapolis are thought to be typical 
of those to be found in a larger number of cities than was the case in 
Richmond. Consequently the results of the study will probably be 
applicable to a wider field of effort. (2) The wealth of data assem- 
bled through the use of schedules in the Richmond investigation is 
available for use, and to whatever extent the conclusions based on 
these findings are valid elsewhere the work does not need to be done 
again. The study of individuals, therefore, and the schedule methods, 
are somewhat less in evidence in the Minneapolis survey. (3) The 
practical benefits and results of cooperation between employer and 
employee are being secured to a much greater degree in Minneapolis 
than was possible in Richmond. Trade agreements have been entered 
into, involving the trades, the public schools, and Dunwoody Insti- 
tute, in accordance with which boys are guaranteed two years of 
schocling, a specified status in the trade for a year, after which a 
school diploma is to be granted. (4) The study of the industries is 
carried further in that outlines of courses of study are developed for 
the guidance of proposed classes to be organized for each industry 
investigated. These courses of study are the outcome of a series of 
conferences, which included representatives of the survey staff, em- 
ployers, and workers. 
A full report of the survey will be published by the National 
Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education. 
SURVEY OF INDUSTRIES AND MECHANICAL OCCUPATIONS IN NEW ORLEANS. 
To the division of educational research of the public school de- 
partment was assigned the task of making a vocational survey in 
advance of the establishment of a central trades school, which has 
been made possible by the bequest to the city by Mr. Isaac Delgado 
of approximately one million dollars. The following are the ques- 
tions which guided the inquiry: 
What are the numbers, present advantages and disadvantages, processes, 
health aspects, and future prospects of the mechanical occupations of boys and 
men in New Orleans? What provision in the schools is made for preparation 
for such occupations? What does first-hand study disclose of prevailing types 
of industrial and trades schools in other cities? Having determined upon the

courses of study required to meet ascertained needs, what provision must be 
made for teachers, rooms, shops, buildings, and equipment in order to execute 
the program thus deduced? What are the criteria for the choice of a site 
suited for the program and buildings as planned? What conclusions may be 
reached regarding finance? 
Three numbers in a projected series of bulletins have been pub- 
. lished:

8. VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
Probably no phase of the movement for vocational education ex- 
hibits clearer evidence of the rapid evolution in thought and practice 
that is taking place than vocational guidance. Only a few short 
months ago vocational guidance was conceived of chiefly as a matter 
of giving to boys and girls advice in the choosing of a life work 
and assisting in the securing of positions. In view of the ambitious 
attempts made in a few quarters along these lines, and especially the 
claims of a few concerns that have investigated the commercial possi- 
bilities of vocational guidance, extravagant expectations have been 
raised in the popular mind that have not been realized. 
This conception is rapidly passing, however, and among the leaders 
of the vocational guidance movement the chief function of their work 
  
1¥or additional surveys see Ch. XVIII.
-P-A-G-E-284
  
  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
is now regarded as the study of vocational conditions and opportuni- 
ties, and the making of the resulting information available to boys 
and girls. 
The most important service that can be rendered the individual 
youth, under the name of vocational guidance, is to set him to think- 
ing, at the proper time, about the problem of choosing a life work as 
a problem to be seriously faced and prepared for—to make him fully 
conscious of its existence as a problem to be solved, and aware of the 
sources of data having any bearing on its solution. 
Expectations concerning the contribution of psychology to voca- 
tional-guidance formulas and prescriptions are undergoing a complete 
revision. The following paragraphs from a thoughtful study of the 
subject + reflect the newer point of view: 
A careful examination of the prevailing notion about vocational guidance 
shows that it is open to serious objections, which must be pointed out and over- 
come if real progress is to be made. In the first place, much misunderstanding 
about the use of psychological tests will have to be corrected. Popular fancy 
regards a single one-hour test as probably sufficient to indicate vocational 
aptitude. Any plan, however, that involves single measurements of mental 
capacity is bound to meet with difficulties. Power of achievement varies from 
day to day according to changes in weather, physiological and emotional con- 
ditions. This fact vitiates the reliability of single measurements, and any sys- 
tem of psychological tests that claims validity must make allowance for it. It 
does not constitute an insurmountable obstacle, however, as with sufficient re- 
search it will probably be possible to devise a method whereby this can be 
allowed for. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind as a possible source of 
erpons 85. 85% 
Aside from the technical difficulties involved in the current notion of voca- 
tional guidance, there are considerations of philosophical import that demand 
its revision. It holds the fatalistic implication that in the grand cosmic scheme 
there is but one task that can be satisfactorily accomplished by a single person. 
It further implies that the failures made by “ misfits” are due solely to the fact 
that they did not find the right avenue for their talents. This theory, while em- 
bracing the conception of a beautifully well-ordered and harmonious universe, 
leaves out of account the factor of personal volition. It tacitly assumes that if 
the methods of science be sufficiently refined, one will be able to foretell with 
practical certainty what will be the destiny of an individual. Such a program 
is feasible in astronomy, where the course of fixed and soulless stars is con- 
cerned, but in the realm of human endeavor it is not likely to be of much 
value as a working hypothesis. * * * 
In view of the serious objections to which the current doctrine of vocational 
guidance is subject, it seems wise to seek an amendment—some aim that is 
possible of attainment and that does not depend for serviceableness upon a 
supervision of facts. At this early stage of development, discretion dictates 
that the work of vocational guidance be regarded as of purely monitory value. 
That is, it should pretend to do nothing further than to marshall facts and to 
point out possibilities of attainment in giving advice. * * * 
In the light of the conclusions that follow upon the premises of the current 
conception of vocational guidance, its untenability is readily apparent. This

Training and Vocational Education, Jan., 1915, pp. 265-270.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 265 
does not mean, however, that educators and others should lessen their zeal in 
this direction. Instead, the adoption of this monitory conception should accel- 
erate the progress of true vocational guidance. It is thoroughly in accord with 
the requirements of scientific method and entirely within the realm of possi- 
bilities. Positively stated, monitory vocational guidance has for its ideal the 
granting to every individual of the chance to attain his highest efficiency 
under the best conditions it is humanly possible to provide. Education can 
have no worthier aim, and the best efforts of the future can accomplish no 
more than this. 
Vocational guidance in its application to college and university 
students has been receiving its share of attention. In this field, ac- 
cording to the report of a committee of the faculty of Leland Stan- 
ford University, California, vocational guidance is the dissemination 
among students of information regarding the various vocations and 
professions open to college graduates and of advice regarding the 
nature of the aptitude and training required for success in each. 
The report refers to the fact that the high degree of specialization 
and complexity found in modern industry is characteristic of the 
vocations which are entered by college graduates as much as any 
others. It is pointed out that even the professions have become al- 
lied groups of specialties, and Prof. Charters is quoted as having said 
that it would be easy to mention 50 lines of work, all requiring more 
or less specialized training, that might be entered by a graduate in 
electrical engineering. The committee records its conviction that: 
Sooner or later a closer correlation will have to be worked out between the 
college course and the life of the community for which students are educated. 
There was a time not long since when this problem of correlation seemed to 
center in the enlargement of the curriculum. It is now apparent, however, 
that the mere multiplication of courses does not necessarily result in giving 
the students the kind of equipment they need. 
Probably the most serious obstacle to progress in vocational guid- 
ance is the aloofness of the school-teacher, under ordinary conditions, 
from much of the world’s work, and the practical difficulties in the 
way of his knowing very much about certain vastly important 
phases of it through actual participation, or even through close 
contact. 
Important events during the past year include the offering of a 
college course for vocational counsellors by Boston University in 
cooperation with the Vocation Bureau, Boston, Mass., and the an- 
nouncement by the Tuck School of Finance and Business Adminis- 
tration, at Dartmouth, of a new course for employment managers, to 
consider the problems arising in connection with the examination, 
employment, and training of a staff of employees.

9. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN THE SMALL CITY. 
The special problems of the smaller cities are gradually coming to 
receive more attention. They are still, however, far from being as 
well understood, or as efficiently dealt with, as those of certain of the 
more progressive large cities. Up to the present time most of the 
discussion of vocational education, aside from agricultural phases, 
has had to do with conditions characteristic only, or chiefly, of large 
cities. In many cases the measures proposed could be carried out only 
in populous districts, and not always therein. 
There are a few cities in the United States that have been able to 
employ expert assistants to make investigations from time to time 
and to work out the details of educational procedure to meet ascer- 
tained needs. In most communities, however, the superintendent of 
public schools is not supplied with adequate help to keep the regular 
school machinery running properly, and there is seldom any provi- 
sion for coping with wholly new problems as they arise. Especially 
in the smaller city is the superintendent confronted with very serious 
physical difficulties in attempting to deal with a program for voca- 
tional education. 
THE CINCINNATI CONFERENCE, 
Realizing the importance of the interests involved, the Commis- 
sioner of Education made arrangements for a conference to consider 
these special problems, to which were invited “superintendents of 
public schools in cities having a population of 10,000 to 25,000.” The 
conference was held in Cincinnati, Ohio, February 24, 1915, during 
the week of the convention of the Department of Superintendence of 
the National Education Association, and was well attended. In ad- 
dressing the conference the Commissioner of Education said, in part: 
One respect in which the vocational problem is simpler in the smaller city is 
that here occupations are still carried on more nearly as wholes. They have not 
become, as in the big city, merely series of processes, 
The problem is to be solved in the small city not so much by the establish- 
ment of trade schools as by better adaptation of the work in school. The part- 
time plan is commendable, if care is taken that the shop part is educational as 
well as useful. The trade school is impracticable for the small city because the 
demand for skilled mechanics in any one line is limited, whereas there is a real 
need for workers trained in a considerable variety of lines. : 
We must study the industries with a view to discovering those principles and 
processes that are common and fundamental to the largest number of occupa- 
tions. These should be arranged and grouped for instructional purposes, and so 
taught as to develop general adaptability. The importance of part-time ar- 
rangements with the industries in connection with this work is clearly evident. 
The trend of the discussion seemed to indicate the belief that prac- 
tical and efiicient work in the manual arts and home-making courses 
constitutes the first step toward vocational education. After these 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 267 
departments have been well established they can be used as a basis 
upon which to develop subsequent and more specialized courses as the 
needs become clearly defined. 
While the difficulties in the way of giving efficient vocational edu- 
cation in the small city are recognized as formidable, the speakers 
at the conference expressed the conviction that the demand is real 
and must be met. As one superintendent said: “ Vocational training 
must be given, and in the present public schools, or these schools 
will be given less money by the amount that is taken out for voca- 
tional training elsewhere.” 
Specific suggestions resulting from the discussion included the 
following: (1) We can take care of vocational education in the public 
schools by establishing continuation schools. Employers are ready 
and willing to cooperate as soon as we show that we are ready to 
give the real thing. (2) We can make an effort to secure employ- 
ment for our older students, under conditions that will enable them 
to pursue their school work, on a part-time basis, if necessary. 
(3) By more efficient handling of the placing of graduates of our 
high schools we can convince many more boys and girls that more 
education is worth while. (4) We can give more real, live problems 
in our school work, and thus connect the school more closely with 
the life of the community. (5) We can teach at least the elements 
of practical agriculture, sending out students to spray fruit trees, to 
test the productivity of dairy cows, and to meet other practical con- 
ditions. (6) We can beautify school, public, and private grounds 
by the planting and cultivation of trees, shrubbery, and flowers. 
INDIANA STATE UNIVERSITY. 
A State conference on problems of vocational education for the 
small city was held at Indiana State University, Bloomington, Ind., 
during the opening week of the summer season, June 29 to July 3, 
1915. The conference was addressed by representatives of the uni- 
versity faculty, the State department of public instruction, the 
National Society for the Promotion of Iudustrial Education, city 
superintendents of public schools, and the United States Bureau of 
Education. 
Two sessions of the conference were held daily, and the following 
topics were considered: The organization of community forces; how 
to determine the needs of a community; reports of surveys and 
analyses of typical industries; prevocational education; vocational 
guidance; organization of special classes; training and supervision 
of teachers.

to. ACHIEVEMENTS IN TYPICAL CENTERS. 
In the following paragraphs it is proposed to complete the review 
of the year’s progress in vocational education by directing attention 
to certain specific and suggestive examples. It should be expressly 
understood that there are numerous other experiments that ought 
to be described, if space permitted. 
NEW YORK, N. Y. 
In October, 1914, the New York City Board of Education employed 
Dean Herman Schneider, of the University of Cincinnati, and Wil- 
liam Wirt, superintendent of public schools, Gary, Ind., to formulate 
plans for vocational education for the city school system. 
Mr. Wirt submitted a report recommending that at least six schools 
representing different types of facilities be organized on “the dupli- 
cate school” plan, which has been developed in Gary, as a step in 
the direction of meeting two serious problems in the New York 
schools—lack of accommodations and provisions for prevocational 
and vocational classes.* 
During the past year Mr. Wirt has given a portion of his time to 
the supervision of the experiment of transforming a few selected 
schools in accordance with his recommendations. 
Dean Schneider presented a report on continuation and coopera- 
tive courses in vocational education. The following excerpts suggest 
the basis of the recommendations made: 
Just what measure of autonomy is possible under the present laws is a satter 
for the corporation counsel to outline; after this is done, the character of such 
legislation as may be desirable can be determined. I am convinced, however, 
that the new department of school cooperation should not be made a part of 
the organization under which the present school system is operated. This is a 
new and distinct type of educational work, the basic idea of which is coopera- 
tion; and cooperation is not possible unless both agents are equally free to 
adjust their systems into a combined working unit * * *. 
I therefore recommend : 
That a bureau of school cooperation, practically autonomous in its operation, 
be established with a director in charge, and that a managerial system of or- 
ganization subject to basic legal requirements be adopted. 
That the rules governing the details of operation of the present school system 
shall not apply to the bureau of school cooperation, so that the new bureau may 
be free to devise operating mechanism to meet its special needs. 
A portion of the year has been spent by Dean Schneider in study- 
ing the situation and in perfecting an organization for the adminis- 
tration of a number of experimental classcs. 
These experiments have attracted the attention of the entire coun- 
try, and the outcome is awaited with keen interest.

Another trade school has been opened during the past year, so that 
there are now four such schools in operation. In addition a great 
part of the evening school work is devoted to trade instruction in 
eight evening trade schools. Prevocational classes have been con- 
ducted on an experimental basis in six day schools. 
CHICAGO, ILL. 
In few cities of the United States is there to be found so extensive 
a development of continuation courses for young workers as in 
Chicago, and quite certainly in no city outside of those States which 
provide specific State aid for vocational education. In October, 1913, 
the district superintendent in charge of this work, W. M. Roberts, 
reported as follows concerning the development at that date of the 
special classes for apprentices, the first of which was opened in 
January, 1901: 
About 600 apprentices employed in four different trades are attending the 
Chicago public schools and are studying subjects which have a direct bearing 
on the work of their trades. They include 275 carpenters’ apprentices, 160 
plumbers’ helpers, 140 electrical workers’ apprentices, and 80 machinists’ ap- 
prentices. ‘The carpenters attend every school day for three months in the 
year, and the others attend one-half day each week throughout the school year, 
from 8 o’clock in the morning until 11.30. 
Since this date these apprentice classes have been growing, and 
new classes have been organized for pharmacists’ apprentices, print- 
ers’ apprentices, and sheet-metal workers’ apprentices. 
Special forms of cooperative agreements or contracts are entered 
into, involving associations of contractors or employers, labor organ- 
izations; and the board of education. In consideration of the instruc- 
tion furnished by the public school, the employers and the unions    
-P-A-G-E-290
    270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
agree to require attendance on the part of the apprentice, and to 
recognize school attendance as a definite part of the apprenticeship. 
The agreement also includes a stipulation concerning the amount of 
wage to be paid for the time spent by the apprentice in schcol. 
Representatives of the labor organizations and of the employers 
assist the school authorities by advising with reference to the courses 
of study and selection of teachers, and by visiting and criticizing the 
work of the classes from time to time. 
PITTSBURGH, PA. ° 
In October, 1914, the superintendent of public schools recom- 
mended the organization of part-time day continuation schools, in 
which instruction should be given by teachers appointed and paid 
by the board of education, in case any employer applies for such 
instruction for a class of at least 20 workers of 14 to 18 years of age, 
the board of education to furnish the teacher and the necessary text- 
books, and the employer to agree to excuse the workers, without 
loss of pay for two hours twice a week, and to furnish and equip 
a room suitable for the sessions of the class. It was recommended, 
further, that the board of education furnish the room also in case 
two or more employers, unable to furnish a suitable room, or a full 
class of 20, join in an application and agree to meet the other 
conditions. : 
The board of education approved the recommendation, and appro- 
priated a fund of $8,000 for the inauguration of the work, beginning 
early in the calendar year 1915. 
The work in the evening schools has been developed during the 
year by the addition of continuation courses for journeymen me- 
chanics employed during the day. Two classes have been organized 
for bricklayers, who work at their trade during the day and in the 
evening classes study the theory of their work in blue-print reading, 
estimating, taking off quantities, mechanical drawing, and mathe- 
matics. The instructor is a practical bricklayer, who has been a 
teacher of the subject in a trade school for several years. A similar 
class has been organized for plumbers. 
The following paragraph from the annual report of the director 
of industrial training is of special interest: 
One thing badly needed for the development of these schools is the chance to 
do more practical work for the public schools, if we are to train boys to go out 
into the industries better prepared to take their places. We must do work under 
conditions more nearly like the conditions they will find when they leave school 
and go to work. Other cities that have schools very similar to our North In- 
dustrial and Irwin Avenue Industrial are doing a great amount of repair work 
for the schools, and the boys are also making articles for school use such, for 
example, as work benches for the school shops, tablet arm chairs, ete. Cincin- 
nati is making about 300 of these benches and chairs for the extension of its 
work. We should do similar work.
-P-A-G-E-291
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. OVE 
The department of vocational guidance reports interviews during 
the year with 2,111 children of 14 to 16 years of age and with their 
parents. Of these children, 1,862 had gone into permanent employ- 
ment. The reasons given for leaving school includes: (1) Necessity, 
by 858 boys and 662 girls; (2) desire to go to work, lack of interest 
in school, ete., by 455 boys and 148 girls. There were 791 boys and 
419 girls who expressed an intention to go on with evening or other 
continuation school work. 
ST. LOUIS, MO. 
Vocational training for workers in the trades, industries, and com- 
mercial occuptaions is offered in numerous classes in evening schools 
in St. Louis. A new class for electroplaters has been added during 
the past year, which meets on Saturday afternoons. A request for a 
class for painters’ and decorators’ apprentices has been received, and 
a special class is being organized to open in September, 1915. 
During the year a large number of short-unit courses in various 
subjects has been offered. In most cases these courses have been pro- 
vided by reorganization of work already offered in the evening 
schools. The shorter courses have made it possible for workers to 
get in a short time specific training which they probably would not 
seek if it were necessary for them to attend a full length course in 
order to get it. 
Special classes for apprentices in printing and in automobile and 
carriage body designing have been offered for two years past. 
The great majority of the courses offered in the evening schools 
are distinctly vocational in character. Training in commercial 
branches, in shopwork, and in occupations of the home has been con- 
tinued with ever increasing attendance. 
NEW HAVEN, CONN. 
During the past year a prize scholarship of the annual value of 
$10) has been established through the generosity of a member of the 
advisory board of the Boardman Apprentice Shops. A competitive 
examination is to be held annually, open to candidates for admission 
to the course in painting and decorating in this institution. There are 
now five prizes open to students who enroll in this course: 
No. 1, Paint and Oil Club Scholarship, $100, New Haven. 
No. 2, National Lead Co. Scholarship, $100, New York City. 
No, 3, Master Painters’ Scholarship, $100, New Haven. 
No. 4, The R. P. Rowe Scholarship, $100, New York City. 
No. 5, The E. M. Walsh Scholarship, $100, New Haven. 
It is the purpose of these prizes to assist boys in paying their ex- 
penses while at school, the $100 representing approximately one-half 
of what a boy would be able to earn were he at work in the usual  
-P-A-G-E-292
  272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
occupations open to him during this period. Upon completing the 
training, positions are guaranteed by the master painters of the city 
of New Haven, who agree to pay to the graduate upon the completion 
of his time $2 to $3 per day with steady employment, and to give him 
an opportunity to progress in the trade. 
A marked contrast is noted in the number of hours spent by the 
students here in comparison with those spent under ordinary public- 
school conditions. The Boardman Apprentice Shops are a part of 
the public-school system of New Haven, but are in operation 8 hours 
per day, 54 days per week, and 50 weeks per year. The amount of 
instruction offered in the trade in-which the student specializes is 
4,800 hours in the 2-year courses. Approximately one-fourth of 
this time is devoted to related academic subjects, and the remaining 
three-fourths to actual trade practice with skilled mechanics as in- 
structors. The output of the productive shops makes a considerable 
contribution toward the maintenance of the school. 
A cooperative arrangement has been entered into between the 
school and the White Adding Machine Co., by which boys alternate 
in pairs between the trade school and the factory. In the factory 
a systematic apprenticeship has been established which divides the 
plant into a number of departments, to each of which the appren- 
tice is assigned for a definite period of time. The board of educa- 
tion, through the trade school, exercises a certain control over the 
conditions under which the apprentice works in the factory. 
Before entering the factory the apprentice must have completed 
2,400 hours of instruction in the trade school. This provision serves 
to eliminate those who, after a trial, decide that they do not care to 
continue in the trade and insures to the factory a productive worker 
who has at least passed the elementary stages of preparation. The 
apprenticeship plan provides a wage scale of 7 cents an hour for 
boys who have completed 2,400 hours or more of instruction in the 
trade school and 7} cents per hour for those who have completed 
8,600 hours or more. Boys who complete the trade-school course, 
4,800 hours, receive not less than the minimum rate of 20 cents per 
hour. 
One feature of this plan is that the time the apprentice spends 
in school is reported to the factory weekly and counted in the pay 
envelope at the regular factory rate. This prevents a boy from 
feeling that one week he goes from “ work to school” and the next 
week from “school to work.” 
Boys are not admitted to the courses that are preliminary to the 
apprenticeship who are under 14 years of age. The cooperative 
plan, therefore, is an attempt to substitute a permanently beneficial 
training for the aimless drifting and consequent deterioration that

are all too often the experience of boys between the age of 14, when 
rigid public supervision begins to relax, and 16, before which the 
entrance to many desirable occupations is practically closed. The 
amount earned by the boy while in the school and in the factory is 
an offset, in part at least, to what might otherwise be earned in those 
casual and usually undesirable employments which alone are open 
to him during these years. Sometimes the earnings are the decid- 
ing factor in keeping the boy in school. 
DETROIT, MICH. 
Suggestive of a very difficult problem confronting the superintend- 
ent of schools in many cities is the following statement from the 
annual report of the superintendent of the Detroit schools: 
The requirement that an applicant for working papers must have completed 
the fourth grade is altogether insufficient. This is resulting in our permitting 
each year hundreds of children, 14 years of age, to leave school permanently 
with the most inadequate preparation for life. The presence in Detroit of 
thousands of families of foreign birth whose ideals are not as yet adjusted to 
American standards makes this low academic requirement peculiarly unfortu- 
nate. Harnest effort should be given to the securing of an amendment to the 
statute governing compulsory education which will require applicants to have 
completed the sixth grade. In view of the commonly accepted theory that 
elementary as distinguished from secondary education properly ends with the 
eompletion of the sixth grade, this proposed universal requirement of a 
minimum of six years’ training seems particularly pertinent. 
The development of two junior high schools makes possible the 
offering of distinctly vocational training in the following lines: 
(1) For boys—cabinetmaking, carpentry, pattern making, wood 
turning, sheet-metal work, electrical work, mechanical drawing; (2) 
for girls—dressmaking, millinery, home making; (3) for both boys 
and girls—bookkeeping, stenography. At present one-half the 
pupil’s time is devoted to vocational subjects and one-half to aca- 
demic subjects. Questions as to the degree of specialization to be 
allowed and the grade in which such specialization shall begin are 
still being carefully studied. The courses in the junior high schools 
cover the seventh, eighth, and ninth years. 
Special forms of agreement have been entered into involving the 
public-school department, employers, and individual workers, in 
accordance with which the Cass Technical High School has organized 
special continuation classes for apprentices and journeymen me- 
chanics in various trades. It is reported that one of the most en- 
couraging features of the work is “the large number of older work- 
ers who are asking for the privilege of coming to school.”

  274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
LOS ANGELES, CAL, 
The annual report of the superintendent of city schools includes a 
“Vocational Bulletin,” which analyzes the occupations for which 
direct or indirect preparation is given in the courses offered in the 
Los Angeles schools specified. The occupations are grouped under 
the following heads: Art work, agricultural occupations, commercial, 
domestic science and domestic art, marine vocations, technical and 
semitechnical vocations (trades). 
The schools offering courses relating to the various groups of occu- 
pations are indicated and each occupation is considered under the 
following topics: Nature of occupation, preparation necessary, de- 
mand for, opportunity for advancement, money returns, other con- 
ditions affecting desirability, professional outlook with college course. 
The committee on vocational high-school courses, which prepared 
the chart, testified to a noticeable “lack of trustworthy, systemati- 
cally arranged information, available to actual or prospective high- 
school students on which to base a tentative choice of vocation,” and 
of suitable vocational studies in the high schools. The attitude of 
the committee is suggested by the following: 
Your committee wishes to report its conviction that just so far as possible 
a pupil should plan his high-school course with his life work in mind. While 
specialization in our high-school courses is not narrow and it is entirely possi- 
ble for a student to revise a premature choice of vocation, yet adolescence is 
preeminently the time for acquiring the mental slant—the modes of thought— 
essential for success in specialized callings or group of callings. 
LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Developments referred to in the latest report of the superintendent 
of public schools include the following: Establishment of a continua- 
tion school for girls, the addition of a two-years’ vocational course 
to the curriculum of the manual training high school, the establish- 
ment of a prevocational school. 
It is worthy of note that although the original idea was to make 
the work of the prevocational school especially a preparation for 
business and industrial occupations, the board of education has de- 
cided that satisfactory completion of the-course shall admit pupils 
to the city high schools. The course of study in academic subjects 
parallels the regular courses of the seventh and eighth grades. 
The regular school day, from 8.30 to 1.30, is divided into three 14-hour 
periods. The program is arranged for each pupil to choose two lines of in- 
dustrial work, a major and a minor course. The major course covers four, 
or in some cases five, 14-hour periods per week, and the minor, three 14-hour 
periods. The remainder of the time is devoted to the academic classes. This 
- arrangement divides the academic and shop time equally.

The industrial work includes printing, woodworking, and electri- 
cal work, for boys, and trade sewing, printing, and bookbinding, for 
girls. 
11. ITEMS OF SPECIAL INTEREST. 
Appointment of Dr. Prosser—One of the most important events 
of the year was the appointment, in May, 1915, of Dr. Charles A. 
Prosser as director of the William Hood Dunwoody Industrial In- 
stitute, Minneapolis, Minn., to take effect September 1. As secre- 
tary of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Edu- 
cation since 1912, Dr. Prosser had become the recognized leader in 
the promotion of State and Federal legislation for vocational edu- 
cation. 
By the will of the late Mr. Dunwoody a fund of approximately 
three million dollars has been established for the foundation of a 
school which is to give instruction in “industrial and mechanical 
arts, including as of special importance the art of milling and the 
construction of milling machinery.” Instruction is to be “given 
free to the youth of Minneapolis and the State of Minnesota,” and 
to have as its object the provision of opportunities for young people 
to “learn the different handicrafts and useful trades, and thereby 
fit themselves for the better performance of life’s duties.” The 
management of the fund and the school is vested in a board of trus- 
tees, consisting of men who had been business associates of Mr. Dun- 
woody, who are endeavoring to make the institution a vital factor in 
the educational system of the State. 
Education for salesmanship has been receiving an increasing 
amount of attention. For more than a year the Department Store 
Education Association, New York City, has been at work develop- 
ing an organization under the direction of Miss Beulah Kennard, 
former president of the Pittsburgh playground association. A  pre- 
liminary study was made to determine what may properly be de- 
manded of the selling force in a department store, what are the con- 
ditions affecting the success of the individual salesperson or of a 
department, and what are the conditions favorable to an increase in 
efficiency. 
A beginning was made with experimental classes in seven repre- 
sentative departments in the new establishment of Lord & Taylor. 
The aim of the work has been to avoid emphasis upon mere details 
of salesmanship, and to give attention to the broader aspects of physi- 
cal and mental efficiency. At first the classes were limited to sales- 
people, since the office force, stenographers, and bookkeepers gen- 
erally received specific training for their work before entering em- 
ployment.  
-P-A-G-E-296
  276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Later, the cooperation of other department stores was secured, and 
classes organized. On May 26, 1915, the first class was graduated, 
and on July 17 the second class, at which time 50 graduates re- 
ceived their certificates. With the cooperation of Stern Bros.’ de- 
partment store, the association has offered courses during the past 
year in studies of stock in each department, in commercial ethics, 
and in scientific salesmanship. The girls were also given talks on 
health and hygiene. The aim of the association is to make of sales- 
manship a skilled occupation, by improved methods, scientific stand- 
ards, and a trained personnel. 
The pioneer in the work of training for salesmanship is Mrs. 
Lucinda W. Prince, who established the Boston School of Salesman- 
ship in 1905, under the auspices of the Women’s Educational and 
Industrial Union. In 1918 a cooperative arrangement for the train- 
ing of teachers of salesmanship was made with Simmons College. 
The classes for saleswomen are held each morning except Monday 
from 8.30 to 11.80 o’clock at the Women’s Educational and Indus- 
trial Union. Members of the class come from five of the largest 
department stores in Boston, being permitted to give this amount 
of time to the school work without reduction in wages. Each class 
meets fora period of 12 weeks, three classes being held during the 
year. 
Salesmanship is studied through (1) informal discussions of daily 
problems arising in the store work; (2) lessons on special topics, 
such as “ Care of stock;” (3) demonstration sales; (4) lectures from 
store officials, explaining the work of various departments and their 
interrelation. 
Other subjects in the course include textiles, color and design, 
mathematics applied to store problems, personal hygiene, and lec- 
tures on miscellaneous subjects dealing with elementary social and 
economic problems. 
Graduates of the Boston School of Salesmanship are holding posi- 
tions in more than 20 department stores in cities from Portland, Me., 
to Los Angeles, Cal. They are also teaching salesmanship in a num- 
ber of cities. The basis of the work of the school, and the explanation 
of its success, in large measure, has been cooperation between the 
school and the business world.t 
The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of 
Labor, Washington, D. C., has published two bulletins during the 
year of interest to students of vocational education: 
Bulletin No. 147. Wages and Regularity of Employment in the Cloak, Suit, 
and Skirt Industry ; containing a study of occupations, plans for apprenticeship 
for cutters, and for education of workers in the industry. 
Bulletin No. 159. Short Unit Courses for Wage-Earners in Part-Time and 
Evening Schools, and A Factory-School Experiment.

Cooperative courses of a somewhat novel type are being developed 
in Putnam, Conn. The cooperating units are the public high school 
and the State trade school. The high school offers four-year courses 
of four types. During the first and second years the courses are: 
(1) General; designed particularly for those who are not going to 
college, also for those who plan to enter a State normal school; (2) 
college preparatory; (3) cooperative; designed to prepare pupils for 
responsible positions in the fields covered and for advanced work in 
technical colleges. During the third and fourth years the courses are: 
(1) General; (2) college preparatory; (3) commercial; designed to 
prepare for office positions. There are four sections of the coopera- 
tive course, requiring the following specified numbers of hours of 
shop or laboratory work during the two years: (1) Machine shop, 
1,500 hours; (2) electricity, 2,100 hours; (3) woodworking, 1,800 
hours; (4) textiles, 1,800 hours. A cooperative arrangement also 
provides accommodations for classes of boys from the seventh and 
eighth grades of the public schools in the woodworking department 
of the State trade school. 
A new course in business methods for engineers is offered by the 
school of applied science of New York University, New York City, 
designed to prepare men for the business side of engineering. The 
students will receive training in the fundamentals of engineering, 
but in place of the more advanced technical work they will be given 
fundamental courses in accounting, economics, industrial history, 
statistics and cost finding, business organization, factory organiza- 
tion, and engineering economics or shop management. The special 
fields for which it is expected the graduates will be prepared include 
management of engineering and industrial enterprises, salesmanship 
of engineering products, manufacture of materials, machines, and 
machine products; management of transportation and construction 
work. 
The Pullman Free School for Manual Training, at Pullman, II1., 
opened in September, 1915. The school is to be in session 8 hours 
per day, 53 days per week, and 48 weeks per year, with a short vaca- 
tion at the end of each of four quarters. The time of the pupils will 
be divided by assignments to work in the shops, laboratories, class- 
rooms, athletic field, and gymnasium. Boys from the higher classes 
will be given an opportunity to secure practical experience in the 
shops of the Pullman Company. The plan of the school is to offer 
to the pupils definite assistance in preparation for selected occupa- 
tions. 
Recommending for positions—In Rochester, N. Y., the public- 
school department has induced a large number of employers to pre- 
sent to the young applicant for a position a printed card stating that 
the firm is at present employing workers under 18 years of age only

when recommended by the department of public instruction, and re- 
ferring the applicant to the office of the director of industrial educa- 
tion. The department reports that as a result of this experiment 
over 100 young people have presented themselves at the offices of the 
department of education to find out how they may get in line for a 
position; 77 boys and girls who had left school, expecting never to re- 
turn, have been induced to reenter school. 
Wanted.—Nearly a score of young people were brought into a cer- 
tain eastern trade schools by a single insertion in a daly paper of a 
“Want ad” calling for “ Boys and girls out of work to take courses 
in the trade school until positions are secured for them.” Positions 
for some were found promptly, others became interested in the work 
of the school and remained to complete a year’s work. 
The public schools of Boston, Mass., now have 21 prevocational 
centers, 8 of which opened for the first time in September, 1915.

  CHAPTER X. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
By F. V. THompson, 
Assistant Superintendent of Schools, Boston, Mass. 
IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
The importance of commercial education, measured in numbers of 
commercial students, is little realized. The Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education, 1914, Volume I, gives the number of com- 
mercial students in public and private high schools and in private 
commercial colleges as 346,770 for the year 1914. The number is not 
complete, however, since, as the report states, of the 1,300 private 
commercial schools, but 704 institutions made returns, with a number 
of students totaling 168,063.1_ According to the same statistics, there 
are 34,367 students in agricultural high schools, 79,240 students pur- 
suing domestic arts, 95,286 students in public normal schools, and 
214,493 students in colleges, technological schools, and universities. 
The total number of high-school pupils in public and private high 
schools is given as 1,373,661. Commercial pupils consequently con- 
stitute at least one-fourth of all high-school pupils, ten times as many 
as there are agricultural students, five times as many as there are 
students of domestic arts, and nearly twice as many as are found 
in all our higher educational institutions. 
Considering the numbers involved, it is astonishing that there is 
so little educational literature upon the subject of commercial edu- 
cation. Among the few books upon commercial education is the 
dicussion of Edmund J. James, entitled “The Education of the 
Business Man,” published in 1898. This volume consists chiefly of a 
description of European practices respecting provisions for commer- 
cial education, with suggestions for appropriate plans to be laid for 
similar work in our own country. The book was intended particu- 
larly to persuade higher educational institutions to make provision 
for professional commercial training. A book written by Cheesman 
A. Herrick, entitled “Meaning and Practice of Commercial Educa- 
tion,” published in 1904, is largely a plea for the establishment in 
this country of special secondary schools of commercial education. 
With the exception of these two volumes, there are found (up to the 
  
1 The report of the Commission on National Aid to Vocational Education estimates that 
50,000 to 100,000 students were in private commercial schools who were not tabulated in 
the returns to the Commissioner of Education.

    280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
current year) practically no other books upon the subject of com- 
mercial education.? 
Up to the current year there has appeared no literature of a criti- 
cal character upon the subject of commercial education. Those 
reports or discussions which are available in print are either de- 
scriptive, hortative, or statistical. The prevailing notion concerning 
commercial education may be seen in the printed proceedings of the 
National Education Association, 1911 (pp. 827 to 868). 
The important papers in the proceedings have the following titles: 
“Bookkeeping Fundamentals,” “ Teaching Typewriting for the Best 
Results,” “ Business English,” “Commercial Economic Geography,” 
“Shorthand, Its Educational and Practical Value.” Nowhere in the 
discussions does there appear the realization of the importance of 
fundamental principles. No one seemed interested in the matter of 
whether or not commercial education is pointing in the right direc- 
tion, to say nothing of whether or not it is hitting the mark. 
In an educational period wherein vocational education is being 
promoted, discussed, analyzed, and defined, we are paying little heed 
to the major branch of vocational education, namely, commercial 
education. A logical classification of commercial education locates 
it under vocational education, yet few educational administrators 
conceive the subject in such a category. The report of the Commis- 
sion on National Aid to Vocational Education classifies commercial 
education as vocational, but does not recommend the subject for 
national aid, since private and public enterprise, it is assumed, is 
making adequate provision for its effective continuance and 
expansion. 
Commercial education has needed no extraneous stimulus to hasten 
its growth. Without subsidy, without propaganda, and, indeed, 
without active encouragement in many sections of the country, it has 
grown to be the colossus of our secondary school system. To-day it 
possesses no literature and lacks an appraiser as well as an historian. 
All other branches of study in our secondary schools have been the 
object of investigation, of controversy, and of agreement; not so 
commercial subjects. , 
The deliberations of the Committee of Ten and the Committee of 
Fifteen did not touch the subject. No association or society of 
prominence is in existence to-day which devotes exclusive attention 
to the questions concerning and growing out of commercial educa- 
  
17The author of this chapter, F. V. Thompson, has published a book on commercial 
education, entitled ‘‘ Commercial Hducation in Public Secondary Schools”: World Book 
Co., Yonkers, N. Y., 1915. There is an English publication on the subject of commercial 
education, the authors of which are Cooper and Graham. This volume is mainly descrip- 
tive of continental practices with regard to commercial education. Another book 
(American) published in 1914 by Farrington, entitled ‘‘ Commercial Education in Ger- 
many,” contains a descriptive account of German practices in commercial education.
-P-A-G-E-301
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 281 
tion.t Serial publications on commercial education are chiefly “com- 
mercial” and not professional, and “commercial” literature is inter- 
ested in maintaining the status quo, not in changing it. 
In a period characterized by richness of material in the way of 
investigations, experiments, and conclusions on practically all school 
subjects, the exceptional situation found with regard to commercial 
education is anomalous indeed. In considering the matter one may 
suspect that either of two conditions explains the situation; namely, 
commercial education at present is so efficient and prosperous as not 
to require questioning, or else commercial education by some accident 
has escaped the critical eye which has surveyed every other educa- 
tional activity. Commercial education to-day might not be numeri- 
cally so important had it been subjected to the criticism devoted to 
other school enterprises, but it would probably be in a stronger posi- 
tion to face the analysis, appraisal, and judgment which it must 
inevitably confront. 
Commercial education to-day needs to be roused to a clearer recog- 
nition of new duties and expanding demands. Too many schools are 
satisfied to go on as in the past, paying little heed to changing com- 
mercial demands. Commercial education to-day needs an awakening 
to new ideas and a recognition of new conditions to bring about a 
realization of the need of adjustment. Manual training has recently 
been greatly stimulated and vivified by the competition of industrial 
education; in fact, much of manual training is being made over into 
industrial training. The vision and revelation which have come to 
manual training are lacking in large part for commercial education. 
There is in promise no outside force to spur and arouse commer- 
cial education which will be compelled to remodel itself without the 
example of an educational competitor. The failure of State and 
National commissions on vocational education to consider commercial 
education as a fit object of approval and subsidy leaves the subject 
without a powerful agency for the reconstruction which it needs. In 
justice it ought to be said that commercial education has never 
lapsed into the dissociated-from-life attitude that in certain portions 
of the country has been so generally characteristic of manual train- 
ing. Commercial education has never made the extravagant claims 
of general culture or of psychological influence in the way of men- 
tal discipline by which the adherents of manual training have en- 
deavored to maintain their cause. Commercial education, within the 
limits of a restricted vision, has always sought to keep close to its 
objective field. It has aimed to prepare for a job, to enable the indi- 
vidual pursuing the work to fit into economic society and to benefit

himself by meeting an evident demand for his talent. Commercial 
education, however, must be criticized for seeing its field narrowly, 
- for failing to recognize the newer demands which a rapidly expand- 
ing business world is forced to make, and for ignoring the com- 
plexities of modern commerce which have created a whole new army 
of commercial functions. A recent book (The Worker and the 
State) calls attention to the fact that in industry 25 per cent of the 
industrial occupations of to-day did not exist a generation ago. A 
similar condition is found in commerce, but commercial education 
has shown no parallel adjustment to changed conditions. 
This situation is in part explained by the process through which 
commercial education came into the public schools and by the in- 
fluences which have continually surrounded it. Commercial educa- 
tion was perhaps the first subject to be generally adepted by the high 
school as a concession to the desire that the school should furnish 
preparation for vocations. No trained teachers were available a 
generation ago, hence through necessity many untrained and incom- 
petent instructors were brought into the schools. In spite of this, 
commercial education has made a praiseworthy struggle against 
initial school prejudice and other obstacles and to-day finds itself 
in a relatively strong position, compared with other school enterprises. 
The names “commercial teacher,” “commercial course,” and “ ccm- 
mercial pupil” are no longer terms of school reproach, as was true 
a decade or so ago. Commercial education has been busy establishing 
its position in the school world, where it has felt the spur and the 
whip, and has paid little heed to the business world, where it has 
found mainly neglect and indifference. Business consequently is in 
no small degree responsible for the chasm between the school and 
business, and for several reasons. The business world has paid but 
little heed to commercial education, to the character of courses of 
study, to the efficiency of teachers, and to the encouragement and de- 
velopment of the idea of commercial training. This assertion can 
not be made of business men of certain progressive foreign countries, 
but it is particularly true of the United States and of England. Mr. 
Herrick (Meaning and Practice of Commercial Education) points 
out as an exception the example of the London Chamber of Com- 
merce, which has been largely instrumental in creating and fostering 
commercial education in England, and by an examination method 
has created a system of awards to commercially trained persons. The 
Chambers of Commerce of Boston and New York have recently 
shown an active interest in the subject and have appointed committees 
to cooperate with school authorities in matters of improvement re- 
specting commercial education. Instances of this cooperation, how- 
ever, have been rare and have not as yet vitally affected the policies 
of commercial education, which, left so largely to its own devices, 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION, 283 
has felt that it owes its allegiance first to the school system and only 
remotely to business. Again, no definite formulation of business 
standards and demands has been obtainable by the schools. The 
schools manifestly could not train for important needs of which the 
business man himself was uncertain. Only the clerical demands of 
business have for some time been fairly definite and standardized, 
and these needs the schools have seen and met with a reasonable 
degree of success. 
ESSENTIALS OF COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
In a study made by the author (New York School Inquiry) con- 
siderable evidence was secured showing the disagreement among 
business men respecting the essentials of commercial education. There 
has been in the past no widespread faith in commercial education on 
the part of business men. True it is that the business man who needs 
a stenographer or a bookkeeper will apply to a business school for 
such an employee; but when he wants a real apprentice, a young man 
to learn the business, he commonly has far more faith in native en- 
dowment than in any amount of specialized training. This last state- 
ment is not intended to be a criticism. It may very probably be that 
the business man has been right in his instincts and impressions, but 
with the increasing application of scientific principles to business, 
as in all other pursuits, the importance of training must needs become 
increasingly apparent. Native endowment not supplemented with 
training will eventually be as unprofitable in business as it recogniz- 
ably is in the many other occupations which have already progressed 
to a stage of development beyond that attained by business. 
The result of this separation of method and interest between com- 
mercial education and actual business puts commercial education at 
a disadvantage when compared with industrial education. There is 
a curious dissimilarity between the methods and general character- 
istics of the two forms of applied education, whereas seemingly there 
is every reason for close similarity. Industrial education has been 
fortunate in the causes and conditions to which it owes its inception. 
The enterprise sprang from cooperation between the two interested 
parties, the factory and the school. Industrial education has insisted 
upon freedom from scholastic traditions and customs. 
Commercial education has become firmly rooted in our school sys- 
tems under very different conditions. It didnot begin asa cooperative 
movement—business sharing the burden with the school. It was a 
school enterprise in the beginning and is the same largely to-day. 
The problem of improved commercial education is beset with par- 
ticular and burdensome difficulties. In the main, the problem is to 
reconstruct the edifice. It would be far easier and simpler perhaps to 
erect a new structure, but this is not practicable. An investment is

284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
made, the building is erected, and great numbers of workers, con- 
scientious and deserving, have given their lives to the task in a serv- 
ice as honest as any could be, and as efficient perhaps as conditions 
made possible. As a general principle, in improving an established 
educational system the factory custom of “ scrapping ” is not possible. 
Education, like government, has been obliged to proceed by the 
method of adaptation and adjustment. 
Commercial education, however, must recognize the need of 
adjustment. Though the excuses for the present state of affairs are 
many and good, they explain only the past and do not justify a con- 
tinuation of the present situation. The business man has his obliga- 
tion no less than the schoolmaster. He can not continue to criticize 
and complain; he must take hold and lift. It is fortunate that the 
competitive conditions of business to-day aid in urging such coopera- 
tion. The corporation school or something akin to it is becoming 
more and more common, because a higher degree of service is de- 
manded. The business house can not make the best and most per- 
manent achievement with “an actual school in the business house” 
any more than the school has been able to succeed with the plan of 
“an actual business in the school.” We should adopt the sounder 
principle of industrial education, which might be stated as follows: 
“Actual education in the shop and in the school.” 
It is evident that a strict analogy between industrial and commer- 
cial education is ‘at present impossible. The reason is, presumably, 
inherent in the nature of the two economic processes, production 
and distribution. Of the two, the distributive process (business) 
seems to be more complex and to require for effective administra- 
tion a larger number of different types of individuals. Industry 
deals primarily with the modification of inanimate material, while 
commerce involves more generally human adjustments. The result- 
ing. educational provisions are different, and the reasons for the 
greater complexities of commercial education become clearer. There 
will need to be more English, modern languages, and esthetic studies. 
These subjects are found universally in commercial school programs, 
but we have made the mistake of not teaching these liberalizing 
subjects with a vocational objective. We have too uniformly taught 
English, the modern languages, and the art of college preparatory 
schools, and failed to teach these subjects from the point of view of 
use in commerce. 
The above discussion of commercial education may seem in no 
way to justify the title superscribed, but discerning friends of com- 
mercial education must recognize that it is constructive criticism, 
rather than complacency, which is more needed if real progress is 
to be assured. Evidences of real progress in commercial education, 
especially within the past five years, are by no means lacking. While
-P-A-G-E-305

not yet permeating the mass, these signs undoubtedly point out the 
way that improved commercial education must take. We are begin- 
ning to seek a fact basis for commercial education, instead of blindly 
adhering to conventional courses. As an instance of a progressive 
and receptive attitude on the part of commercial teachers may be 
adduced the procedure of the Massachusetts State committee on 
business education at its first meeting on June 14, 1913, best illus- 
trated by the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted 
and assigned to a committee for appropriate action: 
It is the sense of this meeting that commercial courses should be founded 
primarily upon the basis of business needs, as far as such needs are discernible. 
This committee seeks the facts concerning those business needs which affect 
commercial education, and welcomes opinions of business bodies, and wishes 
to encourage all investigations that may shed light upon this important matter. 
Much evidence concerning business needs was secured from inves- 
tigations inspired by and resulting from the quoted resolution. 
These important investigations into the needs of commercial educa- 
tion were conducted in and about Boston during the school year 
1913-14. They were conducted by the following organizations, re- 
spectively : 
The Women’s Educational and Industrial Union, Department of 
Research: “The Public Schools and Women in Office Service.” 
The Boston Chamber of Commerce: “ Report on Commercial Edu- 
cation to the Committee on Education.” 
Committee of teachers (Massachusetts State Board of Education) : 
“Records in Business of Graduates of Public Schools.” 
From the foregoing investigations several important conclusions 
are evident, showing that both the school and organized business 
need to make adjustments and to incorporate changes looking toward 
improvement. These conclusions may be summarized as follows: 
1. The schools need to adjust courses and methods to correspond 
more closely to business practice. This means that most school com- 
mercial courses should be modernized to meet the new standards 
established by large organization and specialization of occupation. 
Bookkeeping courses at present are taught largely on the supposi- 
tion that boys and girls will occupy positions as head bookkeepers. 
In view of the kind of service demanded, it will be manifestly wiser 
to train pupils by giving due attention to skill, speed, and accuracy 
in the unit processes in which the student will find business openings. 
New equipment in the way of special machines, such as adding ma- 
chines, billing machines, card-filing devices, and the like, must be 
added to our present meager furnishings. 
2. The schools must attempt and achieve more in the way of de- 
veloping the personal qualities needed for successful participation 
in business. It is apparent that business men assign great importance  
-P-A-G-E-306
  286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to personal qualities, even more than to efficiency in technique. Our 
schools have always sought to develop the moral qualities of their 
pupils, but, in addition to this, commercial schools should try to de- 
velop the personal qualities of pupils with a specific view of their 
business importance. We should make this training concrete, show- 
ing. the relation between personal qualities and success in business. 
Pupils who lack fortunate examples in their home environment 
should find in the school the specific information and models needed 
for inspiration and imitation. The schools should feel as much con- 
cern for the success of their graduates, with respect to personal 
relations in business, as for the quality of their technical instruction. 
3. Part-time and cooperative plans will probably furnish the only 
adequate method of guaranteeing the achievement of satisfactory 
results in producing more competent commercial graduates. By 
such methods only can the pupil be. checked, judged, and improved 
while under training. These plans render it possible to measure 
practice against theory. No form of applied education has been able 
to succeed without the adoption of the plan of testing the novice in 
the practical operations of his art and of criticizing and correcting 
mistakes which could not be foreseen in purely theoretical training. 
The cooperation and understanding of business men are also impor- 
tant advantages to be gained by the adoption of part-time and coop- 
erative plans of commercial training. 
4. Guidance, placement, and follow-up work are essential features 
of a well-ordered, comprehensive, and effective plan of commercial 
training. Pupils are not at present guided to suitable commercial 
positions or placed in them. Much waste, discouragement, and 
failure are assignable to this condition. At the present time the 
schools are not furnished with the resources, funds, and expert serv- 
ice necessary to undertake these additional functions; but commu- 
nities seeking to increase substantially the efficiency of commercial 
education must soon recognize and meet the deficiency. 
5. Commercial education must expand its scope to include training 
for commercial occupations other than clerical. The investigations 
show that while stenography is the best-paid commercial vocation 
for a girl, for a boy salesmanship is better than all other commercial 
occupations, because stenography as an occupation for men is gradu- 
ally decreasing in importance. Commercial courses, consequently, 
must be recast to furnish training for commercial opportunities 
discoverable in actual business. 
6. Business men must do more than find fault with the schools; 
they must participate in the training process. It is important now 
that business men should aid the schools in the honest. and serious 
effort to improve their work. Business.is no longer merely business,
-P-A-G-E-307
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION, 287 
nor are schools merely educational institutions. The interconnec- 
tions which characterize all the more perfect organisms are taking 
form throughout the social structure; the schools must become in 
part business, and business must become in part schools. 
7. The time has probably come when State and National authori- 
ties should undertake and carry on further inquiries. No subject 
within the range of secondary public instruction has larger interests 
or involves more pupils and more extensive investment of public 
money than commercial education. In the efforts to bring about 
more effective educational achievements it is important that the 
already-established courses in commercial education should receive 
the advantage of expert advice similar to that available for the 
newer school endeavors represented by the recently founded indus- 
trial and trade schools. 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
The city of Boston has begun to experiment vigorously with coop- 
erative commercial education.t. The Boston High School of Com- 
merce has conducted cooperative work since its foundation in 1906. 
Since 1913 courses in salesmanship, with cooperative features, have 
been established in the Girls’ High School (Boston) and in the Dor- 
chester High School. In January, 1914, a marked extension of 
cooperative education was undertaken by school authorities. A 
director of practice work in salesmanship? was appointed to coordi- 
nate commercial courses in general high schools throughout the city 
with practical work in a group of some six or seven cooperating stores. 
The new cooperative courses are optional with the schools, but the 
desire tc undertake the experiment is apparently strong. The fol- 
lowing district high schools, in addition to those mentioned above, 
have adopted the plan of cooperative salesmanship courses, namely, 
Roxbury, South Boston, West Roxbury, East Boston, Brighton. 
The work of the director of practice is an important feature in the 
hoped-for success of the undertaking. Unbearable confusion to 
business managers would be the result if each individual school 
sought to arrange practice periods with the stores. The director of 
practice learns the possibilities of practice in the different stores 
and is at the same time familiar with the general conditions of the 
schools. Thus she is able to coordinate the work between the store 
and the school so that the minimum confusion may result. The 
director of practice has authority also to deal with the technical 
salesmanship courses attempted in the schools, has supervisory func-   
1 Also the city of Cincinnati.

tion over the teachers of salesmanship, and possesses familiarity with 
the moral, physical, and business conditions of the store where 
the pupils are sent. She brings to the store the knowledge of the 
limitations and possibilities of the school and to the school the de- 
mands and difficulties of the stores. 
The above plan is designed to bring about effective methods of 
teaching salesmanship. Girls in high school are almost exclusively 
concerned with the experiment. The High School of Commerce, 
attended only by boys, operates a plan of longer duration, designed 
to meet the different conditions which boys find in business. Consid- 
erable freedom regarding the character of the courses in salesman- 
ship is allowed. One desirable requirement is made, viz, that teach- 
ers of salesmanship shall be those only who are qualified by business 
experience and training to give the technical instruction. At the 
present time no careful attempt is made to relate the general instruc- 
tion to salesmanship. The suggestive program given below may be 
analyzed roughly as made up of general unrelated academic work, 
such as English and modern languages; related technical work, such 
as commercial geography, economics, and textiles; and purely techni- 
cal or vocational work, such as shorthand, bookkeeping, and sales- 
manship. The tendency is toward a closer connection between the 
academic and vocational elements of the course.

A new school in Boston, known as the Clerical School (established 
in 1914), is designed to round out a system of commercial education 
which already comprises commercial courses for boys and girls in 
general high schools and a special high school of commerce for boys. 
The new school serves primarily the needs of girls by offering special- 
ized and intensified training in clerical vocations. Three courses are 
offered; first, a course for office service, available for girls who have 
successfully completed two years of high-school work, not necessarily 
  
1 Pupils may elect salesmanship, subject to approval of teacher in charge.
-P-A-G-E-309

commercial in character; second, a course for stenographers and 
high-grade clerks, available for girls who have successfully com- 
pleted three years of high-school work, without designation of kind; 
third, a course for bookkeepers and accountants, and a course for 
secretaries, who must be either high-school or college graduates. The 
Boston Clerical School will attempt no liberal training whatsoever. 
The applicants for the various courses will come with an academic 
equipment which presumably constitutes the essential elements of 
general education necessary for successful entrance into the special- 
ized work in the vocations sought. No specified length of time for 
the course will be assigned; some students with preliminary commer- 
cial training in other courses may be expected to complete the work 
in half a year; others of slower rate of achievement may take a year 
or even longer. The methods to be used are designed to be primarily 
individual, while the standards of achievement are planned to pre- 
pare for successful entrance into the specialized commercial occupa- 
tions arrived at. 
Following are the unit courses of study offered in the Clerical 
School of Boston: 
Course preparing for office service. 
This course is available for girls who have completed two years of high- 
school work, and consists of the following subjects: Bookkeeping, office prac- 
tice, commercial arithmetic, commercial law, penmanship, and business English. 
Course preparing for stenographic and higher clerical work. 
This course is available for girls who have completed three years of high- 
school work, and consists of the following subjects: Shorthand, typewriting, 
penmanship, business arithmetic, English, bookkeeping, political geography, and 
office practice. 
Course preparing for secretarial work and bookkeeping. 
This course is available for young men and women who are high-school and 
college graduates and consists of the following subjects: (@) (for secretaries) 
Stenography, typewriting, business correspondence, office practice, commercial 
procedure; (b) (for bookkeepers) bookkeeping, use of office machinery, filing 
devices, commercial arithmetic, commercial law. 
Students in each of the above courses are advanced as rapidly as their prog- 
ress will permit, and they are given certificates when they have satisfactorily 
completed the courses, without regard to the length of time required for com- 
pletion. 
The creation of high schools of commerce in the large cities of the 
country shows a realization of the need of improved institutions for 
commercial training. Unfortunately, these schools, as a rule, have 
not broken away from the clerical traditions which have obsessed 
commercial education. Following is presented a suggestive course of 
study for a boys’ commercial school.

The above course of study is not offered as a finality, but as one that is 
practicable under present conditions and promises a possibility of develop- 
ment away from the clerical instruction of the past toward training for the 
larger aspects of business activity. In the course of time the group (fourth 
year) named “ lectures, etc.,” should grow to a more defined subject given the 
full time during the fourth year. This course of study does not compel ex-
-P-A-G-E-311
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION, 291 
clusive attention to clerical subjects, though there is opportunity by means of 
electives for boys to get as good clerical training as has been offered in the past. 
The general tendency of the course is to direct the boys’ attention toward the 
active, competitive side of business. By means of electives in the fourth year 
opportunity is given to specialize in one of the three major functions of busi- 
ness, viz, merchandising, accounting, and secretarial work. Along with the pur- 
suit of the above-outlined course all students should undertake apprenticeship 
work in stores; they should be employed on Saturdays, Mondays, during holi- 
days, or by means of some other part-time arrangement. Theory without 
practice is unprofitable. 
SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS AND TESTS. 
The application of scientific standards to business achievements is 
beginning to appear. Within the past three years a number of busi- 
ness houses, notably the Curtis Publishing Co., the Metropolitan 
Life Insurance Co., and the National Cloak & Suit Co., have used a 
variety of tests of speed and accuracy in the performance of common 
operations in the business office and examinations on matters of 
general fundamental education as a partial basis for the appointment 
of applicants to positions and for promotions with the result that 
they believe they have raised the quality of the personnel of their 
staffs very materially. Other houses are seriously considering follow- 
ing their example. 
For example, one stenographer might be able to write shorthand 
at the rate of 100 words a minute and transcribe letters on the type- 
writer at the rate of 25 words a minute and would make an average 
of five minor errors to the hundred words, while another would write 
shorthand at the rate of 100 words a minute, but in transcribing 
would write at the rate of 35 words a minute and would make one 
error on the average to the hundred words. The latter would be 
worth at least 25 per cent more to the house. But without accurate, 
scientific measurements of speed and accuracy a business man might 
be just as likely to choose the poorer stenographer. 
Progressive schools are eager to know the actual standards of the 
business office, so that they may measure their pupils and know how 
they compare with what the business men require on each of the 
various points that are essential. In order to bring about coopera- 
tion between business men and schools and scientifically to discover 
and establish national standards and methods of measurement, an 
association was incorporated in 1913 as “The National Associated 
Schools of Scientific Business,” and its board of trustees is made up 
two-thirds of business men and one-third of educators, with Gov. 
Ferris as president. A series of 20 tests was prepared and given 
experimentally to employees of a list of well-known business houses. 
On the basis of the results obtained a second series of tests was pre- 
pared with the approval of the employment managers of the firms 
and distributed in conjunction with a report sent out by the Bureau
-P-A-G-E-312
  292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of Education as Vocational Letter No. 5. The next step was to have 
these tests given in representative commercial high schools and busi- 
ness colleges and a practical system of grading devised with the 
assistance of Dr. George D. Strayer, of the Teachers’ College, Colum- 
bia University. When the improved tests have been given in a still 
larger number of business houses to selected employees representative 
of six standard classes of employees, namely, beginners (office boys 
and girls), general clerks, beginning stenographers, secretarial ste- 
nographers, bookkeeping clerks, and correspondents, a set of averages 
according to the standard system of grading will have been obtained 
which will be the starting point for a series of national standards 
useful alike to business houses and commercial schools. 
An excellent starting point for such tests in commercial schools is 
to be found in the Courtis tests in speed and accuracy in addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers which 
have been so widely given in elementary schools in Boston, New 
York, and many other cities over the country, and have also been 
found useful in business houses, though no extensive tests of business 
employees have yet been made. These have been adopted by the 
authors of the National Business Ability Tests in order that ad- 
vantage may be taken of progress in other fields. 
A report made in 1913 by a joint committee of the Chicago Asso- 
ciation of Commerce and the Chicago Board of Education particu- 
larly emphasized the need for prevocational training in the seventh 
and eighth grades, consisting of a narrow, intensive drill on speed 
and accuracy in handling figures, spelling the vocabulary of business 
letters, simple punctuation, and correct English expression, as the 
necessary fundamental education without which even an office boy 
can not hope to attain future usefulness. The requirements for the 
business office are in this respect recognized to be considerably higher 
than the educational requirements for industrial positions. The 
progress that is being made in the matter of tests on these points for 
eighth-grade graduates must be recognized as tending to lay a 
sound basis for tests and standards in strictly commercial education. 
The promoters of the National Business Ability Tests have not 
been able to secure any agreement between business men and educa- 
tors for a standard test on bookkeeping—that is, anything higher 
than the fundamental requirements for bookkeeping clerks; nor on 
tests for salespersons. These two subjects are now occupying the 
attention of investigators in the field of commercial education. 
Commercial education has made a substantial development and 
improvement since its adoption into the schools. Better accommoda- 
tions have been provided, more adequate equipment and apparatus 
furnished, teachers better trained and paid have been employed. 
In this advance, however, commercial education has progressed only
-P-A-G-E-313
ee ee ee 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION, 293 
with the general improvement of the school system. The people 
have grown in faith in the worth of education, more money has been 
spent, and more opportunities demanded in the schools. Commer- 
cial education has advanced with the development of the school 
system, but has not kept pace with the growth of business; it has 
progressed with the schools; it has studied the trend of the school, 
but not the trend of business; its leadership has been scholastic, not 
commercial. To-day, commercial education finds itself largely of 
the school, schoolish, and not of the business house, businesslike. 
It should be stated, however, as a broad summary that commercial 
education is in a receptive mood to-day. Hopeful experiment and 
earnest readjustment are found in numerous communities. Commer- 
cial education in a considerable portion is willing to learn, is not 
restive under criticism, has no blind adherence to past traditions. 
Instances of the willingness of communities to experiment in im- 
proved forms of commercial education are seen in the establishment’ 
of special high schools of commerce. Boston, for example, main- 
tained for years clerical commercial education in general high schools 
which furnished sufficient provision for all pupils desiring this kind 
of work. A special high school of commerce in Boston was estab- 
lished in 1906 to furnish a different kind of commercial instruction, 
to experiment with a new idea of commercial training. This idea 
was mainly to furnish to young men a preparation for commercial 
opportunities other than clerical. Other cities which show similar 
progressive tendencies of like intent deserve enumeration and they all 
illustrate, as far as they go, the hopeful attitude of American com- 
munities toward the problem of placing commercial education upon 
a more efficient and adequate basis.

AGRICULTURE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
Agriculture is now required by State legislation as a subject of 
instruction in all public rural elementary schools in 21 States. The 
States are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Indi- 
ana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, 
West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In many of these it is 
required in rural high schools, and in probably one-half in urban 
elementary schools as well. It is required also in a few other States 
in all rural high schools, for instance, in Utah, Pennsylvania, and 
Idaho. 
Legislative enactment for compulsory agriculture in secondary 
schools has not had strong support in the majority of States where 
proposed. Educational authorities have feared that the agriculture 
taught under such ccmpulsion would be of the bookish kind, and 
have, therefore, favored a slower introduction, with adequate super- 
vision by State authorities. They have favored its introduction 
when assisted by State financial aid, so that administration and 
teaching may be under definite regulations and have funds enough 
to secure qualified agricultural instructors. Many States are now 
giving such financial aid to assist agricultural instruction in high 
schecls, particularly for vocational courses. As a rule the State 
departments of education are charged with the administration of 
the funds and are given direct control. Many of the States which 
provide such aid provide also for the employment of an expert in 
agricultural teaching in the State department of education, to whom 
is given the immediate supervision of the agricultural instruction. 
In other States supervision is given by law to the State college of 
295 
   
-P-A-G-E-316
  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
agriculture, or by cooperative agreement with the State department 
of education it has been assumed by the college. 
Among the States employing experts in agricultural teaching in 
the State departments of education as supervisors of vocational in- 
struction in agriculture in secondary schools are New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
and Indiana. States where the supervisor is an employee of the 
State agricultural college include Vermont, Michigan, Maryland, 
West Virginia, California, Louisiana, and Mississippi. In several 
States where special State aid to vocational agricultural instruction 
is given and no expert in agricultural teaching is employed ap- 
proval of the schools must be given at regular intervals by some rep- 
resentative of the State department. In several States, as in Iowa 
and Minnesota, this approval is by the State rural school inspector. 
While there seems to be unanimity of opinion in regard to the 
inadvisability of State legislation requiring agriculture in all high 
schools, there seems to be no great amount of objection raised to 
legislation requiring its inclusion in all elementary rural schools. 
This is probably because it is felt that elementary school agriculture 
need not be so distinctively vocational as secondary school agricul- 
ture ought to be, and that worth-while results may be obtained 
even with teachers who have comparatively little agricultural edu- 
cation, since the elementary school agricultural work is usually a 
study of a textbook of information about agriculture, or a course 
in agricultural nature study, or one of practical work through the 
boys’ and girls’ agricultural club organizations. In any of these 
three forms of instruction an untrained teacher may secure good 
results. 
The statement is often made, as an argument against such legisla- 
tive enactment, that to force elementary teachers to teach agriculture 
regardless of whether they have had any special preparation is non- 
sensical. Experience is proving, however, that much good is coming 
from such laws. In Iowa the law requiring agriculture in all rural 
elementary schools was passed by the legislature in 1913 and went 
into effect in August, 1915. One of the results of its passage has 
been a very large attendance in courses in agriculture in summer 
schools during the past two years. Another is the changed attitude 
of the teachers toward the law and the subject. In regard to this, 
Prof. G. M. Wilson, head of the department of agricultural educa- 
tion of the Iowa State Agricultural College, says: 
Possibly the most notable progress in Iowa has been the change in sentiment 
of the teachers. At first after the law had been passed there was a distinctly 
hostile attitude. Since that time teachers have been reading books, working over 
courses of study, attending summer schools, and in various ways finding out that 
agriculture lends itself admirably to teaching through simple exercises in such 
a way as to make it one of the most interesting subjects in the school course.
-P-A-G-E-317
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 297 
One point ef satisfaction in the character of the instruction in 
agriculture in the elementary rural schools in the States where such 
instruction is mandatory is the development away from the textbook 
study about agriculture toward the performance (and study) of prac- 
tical projects by each child, either in school or home gardens or in 
other home farm activities. Reference is made to this in the follow- 
ing pages, particularly in the report on the introduction of agricul- 
ture in the schools of Indiana. The particular form of organization 
for carrying out the project instruction has been the organization of 
agricultural clubs, corn, cotton, potato, poultry, pig, ete. A report 
on the activities in agricultural club work of the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture is given later in this chapter. It refers, 
however, only to the work carried out by the Department or the 
Department and the State colleges of agriculture in cooperation. 
Much similar work is also done under the supervision of the State 
departments of education, and there is a growing tendency for co- 
operation in the conduct of such work between the State departments 
and the State agricultural colleges. 
In Oregon, for instance, the State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion has two assistants who spend all their time in organizing agri- 
cultural clubs and helping county superintendents in local institutes. 
As soon as a club is organized the names of all members are sent to 
the State Agricultural College. The college sends to the children 
instructions for carrying on their agricultural project, with scientific 
information relative to it. The State department of education is 
responsible for the administration, the college for the technical in- 
struction. During the past year 12,000 boys and girls were enrolled 
in the various clubs; there were held 110 local fairs, with exhibits 
of the products of their work, and the prize winners were all ex- 
hibitors at the State fair. As the work is done under the immediate 
direction of the State department of education as a definite part of 
the school work, correlation between it and other school work is 
certain. 
In Washington State there is also close cooperation of the club 
work with the regular school. Agriculture is a required subject iv 
all schools, and its administration is in the hands of the State de- 
partment. Each eighth-grade pupil in the public schools must take 
either agriculture, domestic science, or manual training before receiv 
ing his diploma admitting him to high school. To connect this 
course of study work with the club and fair movement, the State 
department allows pupils 50 per cent of their final mark in agricul- 
ture on home-project work, reports being made on the regular 
federated club blanks. 
The Indiana vocational education law, passed in 1918, included 
the law for the mandatory teaching of agriculture in rural schools.

  298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The subject is taught in the seventh and eighth grades of the elemen- 
tary schools and in the high schools. A State supervisor of agricul- 
tural education has been secured under whose direction the instruc- 
tion is given. A course of study has been outlined and published by 
the State which teachers are required to follow. The seventh and 
eighth grade pupils may be included in one class. Two periods per 
week must be given to the subject. The State supervisor recommends 
that textbooks be used for reference only and that instruction be 
carried out in connection with home-project work. 
In order that the home-project work of the pupils may be properly 
supervised during the summer, the department is urging the employ- 
ment of agricultural teachers for these months. Twenty-one were 
employed during the past summer; they were paid in part by the ex- 
tension service of the State college of agriculture. 
The State supervisor of agricultural education reports that during 
the past year 7,600 rural teachers taught agriculture in their schools. 
Much of the teaching was not practical, but every possible means is 
taken to make it so. The State department has issued bulletins of 
instruction; the State supervisor and three assistants furnished by 
the agricultural college have given instruction to a large body of 
teachers; the county agricultural agents have given part of their time 
to assisting the teachers; and 34 special supervisors of agriculture 
have been employed in local districts by local funds. Of this num- 
ber 12 were county. supervisors; the others were township or union 
district supervisors with districts composed of two or more town- 
os AGRICULTURE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Progress in the development of agricultural instruction in second- 
ary schools is indicated by the following reports from several States. 
It is worthy of note that the great majority of teachers in these 
schools reported are agricultural-college graduates, that the use of 
land for instructional purposes is increasing, and that a very in- 
creased number of schools are now teaching through the home- 
project method: 
California.—Agriculture is now taught in 64 high schools. Of these, 21 give 
a one-year course, 24 give a two-year course, 8 give a three-year course, and 11 
give a four-year course. Thirty-one of the teachers of agriculture in these 64 
high schools are graduates of agricultural colleges, 9 others have had college 
courses in agriculture. Fifty-six of the teachers have had farm experience 
ranging from 1 to 25 years. Salaries paid agricultural teachers range from 
$1,000 to $2,160. 
Of the 64 high schools teaching agriculture, 54 own or rent land for 
agricultural instruction, varying from one-fourth of an acre to 29 acres. At 24 
of the schools all of the work done on the land is done by agricultural students ; 
on the larger plats a small amount of labor is employed. A greenhouse, lath 
house, or both, is used by 26 schools in connection with their agricultural 
instruction.

  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 299 
Louisiana.—Six additional agricultural schools, making a total of 42, were 
established during the year, all under immediate supervision of the State 
department of education and receiving special State aid. The State department 
employs in conjunction with the State agricultural college a supervisor who 
has charge of the agricultural work of these schools. 
Maine——Organized work in agriculture in the secondary schools was first 
undertaken in consequence of legislative action in 1909 granting special aid to 
incorporated academies. The next legislature extended the same aid to public 
high schools, the act becoming operative July 1, 1911. Since 1909 there has 
been a steady, though not rapid, gain both in schools offering approved courses 
and in the number of students enrolled. The gain in interest on the part of the 
students and of the communities immediately affected in most every instance 
has been marked. While the work is still in the experimental stage, it is note- 
worthy that none of the schools have given up the course as a failure, and 
there is evidence of considerable extension in the near future. In 1910 there 
were four schools offering courses in agriculture, maintained under the approval 
of the State educational department, with 23 students enrolled; five years later 
there were 14 such schools, with 329 enrolled in agriculture. 
Massachusetts——Your separately organized agricultural schools are now re- 
ceiving State aid, also 14 agricultural departments in selected high schools. 
Three of the separate schools and two of the departments have land for in- 
structional purposes, the others depend entirely upon the farms of the pupils. 
The instruction is carried out through the home-project method, each project 
being approved and supervised by the instructor in agriculture of the school. 
All instructors are graduates of approved agricultural colleges. A consider- 
able number of other high schools are giving brief courses in agriculture, but. 
receive no State aid and are not under the supervision of the State department 
of education. 
Michigan—The total number of public high schools giving agricultural 
courses during the past year was 43. In 41 of these the instruction was given 
by a graduate of an agricultural college. The course covers four years and 
consists of a unit of work in each of the four years. Fifteen hundred students 
have been taking the courses in these 43 schools. Twelve of the schools have 
Jand for agricultural purposes, ranging from one-fourth of an acre to 18 acres. 
Part of this land, at most schools, is given over to demonstration work and a 
part to the production of garden and field crops. Practically all of the young 
men in these courses are required to do home-project work in agriculture, 
consisting of the growing of corn, potatoes, beans, sugar beets, alfalfa, and 
vegetable gardens, also in the care of dairy herds and in orcharding. This 
project work is supervised by the high-school inspector in agriculture, who, 
in addition, renders whatever service is possible to the farmers of the com- 
munity. 
Nebraska.—The legislature of 1912 passed what is known as the Shumway 
Act, providing State aid for high schools maintaining approved departments of 
agriculture, manual training, and home economics. The law required schools 
to be supplied with suitable laboratories and equipment, with 5 acres of land 
for agricultural purposes, and that they should employ teachers approved by 
the dean of the college of agriculture. State aid to the amount of $1,250 is 
paid to approved schools. Twenty schools were recognized the first year, 11 
of which secured instructors who were graduates of four-year courses in agri- 
cultural colleges; the remaining 9 employed teachers with from one to three 
years’ training in agriculture. Teachers will not be recognized in the future 
who have not had a full agricultural-college course. 
The course of study in these agricultural schools was prepared by a com- 
mittee of public school superintendents in cooperation with the State college
-P-A-G-E-320
  300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
of agriculture. During the past year the 20 schools continued their work in 
agriculture and two additional schools were approved. 
New Hampshire——Of the approximately 100 high schools in the State of all 
kinds, 21 during the past year offered courses in agriculture. As a rule, in 
each school five double periods per week are devoted to distinctively agri- 
cultural subjects. The balance of the course is taken up with subjects in- 
cluded in the classical or college preparatory course, the agricultural subjects 
merely replacing Latin and ancient history. In the 21 there were enrolled in 
the agricultural courses 150 freshman boys in the general subject of agronomy, 
25 sophomores in horticulture, and 75 juniors in animal husbandry, making 
250 enrolled in the courses. It should be remembered that the majority of the 
courses have been running only one or two years. Four or five of the schools 
have farms where school projects are carried on, but in every instance each boy 
taking the agricultural course is required to have a home project in field 
crops, horticuiture, or animal husbandry. In the freshman work in agronomy 
home projects are being carried out with potatoes, corn, oats, grass, and 
market gardening. In animal husbandry, projects carried out include dairying, 
beef production, poultry and swine raising. The teachers in agriculture 
are all agricultural college graduates, most of them employed for 12 months 
and devoting all or a large part of the summer to supervision of the home- 
project work. 
New York.—During the five years that the State has given special aid for 
vocational instruction, there has been a steady growth in the number of high 
schools teaching agriculture, the number increasing from 1 to 64. In these 
64 schools, supervised by a special expert in agriculture from the State depart- 
ment of education, the home-project method of instruction is emphasized. In 
1914-15 the students of the 64 schools carried out 881 individual projects, 
involving 1,251 acres of land, 361 dairy and beef animals, and 21,000 poultry. 
There has been established during the year two intermediate schools of agri- 
culture, one at Westford and one at King Ferry. A four-year course is given 
both in agriculture and home-making to pupils who have completed the sixth 
grade, the first two years of the course being equivalent to the seventh and 
eighth grades and the last two years equivalent to the first two years of high- 
school work. The course of study in agriculture is as follows:

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 801 
A difficulty in New York State, as in other States, in carrying out satis- 
factorily the high-school agricultural courses, is the shortage of prepared 
teachers. The State College of Agriculture at Cornell University in July, 1914, 
organized a department of rural education, giving a four-year course for persons 
preparing to teach agriculture in high schools. In the last year of this course 
students are placed as assistant teachers for one-half the year in some of the 
best schools of agriculture in the State where they are supervised both by the 
department of rural education of the college and by the State department of 
education. The establishment of this department of rural education is a result 
of the close cooperation of the agricultural college with the division of agricul- 
tural and industrial education of the State education department. 
North Dakota—The 1911 legislature enacted a law authorizing counties to 
establish and maintain county agricultural schools to which the State would 
contribute $3,000 annually. Up to date two such schools have been established, 
one in Walsh County, opened in 1913, and one in Benson County, opened in the 
fall of 1914. In the State there are five high schools designated as high schools 
of agriculture, manual training, and domestic science, each receiving from the 
State a subsidy for this work of $2,500 annually. These schools follow a course 
of study prepared by the State department of education. 
Texas—The State is encouraging agricultural instruction in public high 
schools through a special State appropriation of $50,000 annually. The first 
of these appropriations, made in 1913, was for two years. The 1915 legislature 
continued the appropriation for two additional years. 
Vermont.—During the year ended June 30, 1915, nine high schools employed 
special teachers of agriculture, graduates of agricultural colleges, and before 
the end of the year seven additional schools had engaged similar teachers for 
the present year. In addition to these schools giving four-year courses are 
many other high schools with one or two year courses taught by regular teach- 
ers. The 1915 legislature, in revising the educational laws of the State, has 
provided for junior high schools to be maintained in the smaller towns where 
there are not enough of secondary school pupils to warrant maintaining a 
senior high school. These junior high schools will give a four-year course to 
graduates of the sixth grade, their work covering the years ordinarily covered 
by the seventh and eighth grades of the elementary school and the first two 
years of the regular high school. The course of study must include vocational 
work approved by the State board of education, who are authorized to provide 
and supervise all vocational courses. The State bears part of the expense of 
maintaining such courses. The vocational courses in most of the junior high 
schools will be agriculture and domestic arts. 
The State now helps to support two State agricultural schools in addition to 
the State college of agriculture at the State university. These are the Theodore 
N. Vail School, at Lyndon, known as the Lyndonville Agricultural Schools, 
and the Randolph Agricultural School. By act of the legislature of 1915 these 
schools are under the management and control of a board of trustees composed 
of the State commissioner of agriculture, the dean of the State college of agri- 
culture, and three trustees appointed by the governor. 
West Virginia—During the year courses in agriculture have been added to 
approximately 25 high schools. The work in these schools is supervised by a 
superintendent of agricultural education in the State department of educa- 
tion, who is also professor of agricultural education in the State university. 
Wisconsin.—The number of high schools offering more than one year of agri- 
cultural work increased, at the beginning of the past school year, to 78. 
The grade of work accomplished is improving. In 1913-14, 10 schools only 
reported the use of land in connection with their agricultural instruction; in
-P-A-G-E-322
  302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
1914-15, 40 of the 79 schools had land for use in agricultural instruction, the 
amount varying from a half acre to 14 acres. In 1913-14 six instructors were 
employed for a full year; in the last year 24 were employed for the full year. 
In 19138, 23 of the schools did home-project work; in 1915 all of the schools 
adopted the home-project method. . 
Another county school of agriculture and domestic economy was organized 
during the year, located in Wood County. There are now eight of these county 
schools of agriculture. Considerable emphasis has been placed on short courses 
by them the last year or two. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AT MEETINGS OF THE YEAR. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. 
At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science, in 1914, a section for agriculture was estab- 
lished. In this step the American association followed the lead of 
its sister organization, the British association, which some 10 years 
ago provided a subsection for agriculture and also carried out the 
plan of the corresponding association for natural science and medi- 
cine in Germany, which for some years has provided for agriculture 
in its program. 
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, president of the association, presided at 
the opening of the first meeting of the section and in a brief address 
referred to the teaching of agriculture as an opportunity for fur- 
thering a reform clearly needed in American education, namely the 
devotion of much more time to the teaching of the natural sciences 
in the school. 
Prof. L. -H. Bailey’s vice-presidential address was essentially a 
plea for a democracy approached. from the standpoint of the public 
service institutions for agriculture and especially from that of the 
new national work of agricultural extension. He defined the coun- 
try life movement as “ the expression of a rapidly crystallizing desire 
to make rural life all that it is capable of becoming and to under- 
stand and to realize in the best way all the natural products of the 
earth.” In the prosecution of the movement for better country life 
he urged that the first principles of democracy should not be lost 
sight of, “which is to let the control of policies and affairs rest 
directly back on the people.” This paper was of unusual interest, 
especially at this time, and may be summarized in these closing sen- 
tences: 
Agriculture is the foundation of the political, economic, and social structure. 
If we can not develop starting power in the background people, we can not 
maintain it elsewhere. The greatness of all this rural work is to lie in the 
results and not in the methods that absorb so much of our energy. If agricul- 
ture can not be democratic, then there is no democracy.

AMERICAN FARM MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. 
D. H. Otis, in his presidential address before the fifth annual meet- 
ing of this association held in Washington, D. C., November 9-10, 
1914, held that work in farm management should aim at the coordina- 
tion of all forces connected with agriculture for the farmer’s finan- 
cial gain, and that courses in farm management should develop in 
the student executive and business ability. 
The report of the standing committee on teaching farm manage- 
ment showed that of 40 colleges reporting, 38 offered farm manage- 
ment as a separate study in 1913-14, an average of four hours’ credit 
being allowed, exclusive of advanced and seminar courses. The 
association looked with disfavor upon the operation of separate farm- 
management farms to demonstrate business methods. The coopera- 
tion of institutions in the exchange of illustrative material was 
advocated. 
SECOND PAN AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS. 
Preliminary programs were issued by the State Department for 
this congress, which will hold its next session in Washington, D. C., 
from. December 27, 1915, to January 8, 1916. One section of the con- 
gress will be devoted to agricultural science as it affects the conserva- 
tion of (a) forests, (b) animal industry, and (c) plant industry, and 
to discussions of the agricultural phases of irrigation and the market- 
ing and distribution of agricultural products. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE EDITORS. 
The third conference of this association was held at the College of 
Agriculture, University of Wisconsin, June 24-25, with representa- 
tives and visitors from 19 institutions in 18 States and the United 
States Department of Agriculture. 
Dean H. L. Russell stated that, in his opinion, one of the most 
important things for the consideration of the association is the matter 
of popularizing technical bulletins for the use of the farming com- 
munity at large, and that, inasmuch as the farm paper is more widely 
read, many more people can be reached through that medium. 
“Getting information to the people who can use it” was the title 
of a paper read by G. W. Wharton, of the United States Department 
of Agriculture. Among the obstacles to the successful dissemination 
of agricultural information, the following were mentioned: (1) At- 
tempts to mix both popular and technical matter in the same bul- 
letin; (2) tradition of form, size, type, etc.; and (3) overtechnical 
statements.

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 
AFRICA. 
Under a law of December 3, 1913, providing for a readjustment of 
the annual appropriation of $400,000 for agricultural and other de- 
velopmental work in Algeria, plans are being put into effect for car- 
rying on this work. Under these plans, $20,000 will be used for 
cooperative agricultural credit societies and $40,000 for long-term 
agricultural credit institutions. The remainder will be available for 
grants to building and marketing associations, to mutual agricul- 
tural insurance societies, for instruction, experimental, and exten- 
sion work in agriculture, and for a number of nonagricultural pur- 
poses. 
The administration of the law is intrusted to a commission of 
which the Governor General of Algeria is president and the director 
of agriculture, commerce, and colonization vice president. This 
commission is to organize an instruction, experimental, and extension 
service and a superior board of advisers to assist this service in the 
direction and coordination of its work. The various existing agen- 
cies will be reorganized under this plan. Branches are contemplated 
in meteorology, agrogeology, agronomy, botany, and animal pests, 
special attention being given for the present to cereals, grapes, for- 
age crops, and tree fruits. There will be a number of experiment 
stations, as well as a system of extension work through meetings, 
publications, model farms, and the like, and a corps of itinerant 
agents or instructors. The experiment-station system is expected 
to include for the present a reorganization of the experimental gar- 
den at Hamma, a new station at Habra for the special study of irri- 
gation and dry-farming problems, and experimental fields at Sidi- 
bel-Abbes, Setif, Serson, and Batna for forage crops, at Orleansville 
for tree fruits, at Guelma for forage crops, olives, etc., at Tlemcen for 
fruit growing, and at Kabylie for figs and olives. Dr. Charles 
Brunel has been appointed director of agriculture under the new 
system. 
Plans have been prepared for a reorganization of the agricultural 
work in Mozambique, Portuguese East Africa. A central department 
is contemplated, with headquarters at Lourenco Marquez, and di- 
vided into bureaus of agriculture and forestry and animal husbandry. 
The staff of the bureau of agriculture and forestry is to include a 
botanical explorer, a silvicultural engineer, an entomologist, an in- 
spector of fruits and plants, and an agricultural engineer with an 
agricultural expert in charge of the agricultural station at Inhamus- 
sua, and assistants. The staff of the animal husbandry bureau is to 
include a corps of veterinarians as chief and assistant chief, and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-325

charge of divisions of animal sanitation, tropical veterinary pathol- 
ogy and zootechny, and their assistants. 
A royal decree of March 3, 1914, provides for the establishment of 
the agrarian office of Tripolitania, the direction of which has been 
intrusted to Prof. Emanuel Cillis, of the Royal High School of 
Agriculture at Portici. Grounds have been secured in the city of 
Tripoli, and the director is engaged in formulating working plans, 
the activities of the office being divided into experimental, adminis- 
trative, and miscellaneous services. The experimental division will 
be located on Government land surrounding the old Turkish agri- 
cultural school in the oasis, a short distance from Tripoli. The work 
of the office will include study and research in cultivation by irriga- 
tion and dry-farming methods; the conduct of small farming units 
for better ascertaining the entire economic value of a given equip- 
ment; animal industry with particular reference to the improvement 
of native species, such as the camel, donkey, sheep, goat, cow, and 
horse, and to the increase of grazing land and provender; problems 
relating to brackish water, farm chemistry, vegetable biology, and 
pathology, meteorology, rural engineering (particularly hydraulic 
problems), etc. A depository for farm implements and tools will be 
established not only for the needs of the station, but also for loan or 
hire for private trials. 
AUSTRALIA, 
The Child Emigration Society of England has established a farm 
school at Pinjarra, Western Australia, as an experiment in child 
emigration. There are 33 boys from England, Scotland, and Wales 
at the farm, from 7 to 12 years of age. Until 14 years of age the 
boys are subject to the elementary education of the State, after which 
they receive two or three years of definite agricultural instruction 
before they are given positions with reputable farmers. Each boy 
is given a garden plat and is also taught the elements of pruning 
fruit trees, packing apples, caring for pigs and poultry, and milking 
cows. All are employed in turn in house duties. The quarterly cost 
of supervision, clothing, and maintenance of one boy has been $126 
a year, which it is hoped to reduce to $97. 
The newly established university at Perth, Western Australia, 
announces a two-year diploma course in agriculture and a three-year 
course leading to the degree of B. S. in Agr., and candidates may be 
required to pass an additional year at practical work on an approved 
farm. Two short courses for farmers were offered at the university 
from June 8 to July 8, 1914, including instruction in cultivation and 
cropping, elementary inorganic chemistry, elementary botany, and 
veterinary science by means of illustrated lectures, laboratory work, 
120384°—xp 1915—vor. 1—20
-P-A-G-E-326
  806 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
demonstrations, etc. Single lectures or short courses of three lectures 
are also given at country centers by the university agricultural staff, 
when time permits, in the following subjects: Principles of agricul- 
ture, how crops grow, soil and its management, factors in wheat 
growing, soil moisture and dry farming, crop rotations and forage 
crops, fertilizers, milk and its management, breeds and management 
of sheep, principles of breeding, breeds and care of the horse, and 
parasites of interest to the farmer. 
CANADA. 
The increased appropriation under the agricultural instruction act 
has enabled the Government of Prince Edward Island to make prog- 
ress in organizing a complete system of agricultural education cor- 
related with the general system. The Province has been divided into 
10 districts, in each of which an inspector has been given charge of 
the educational work. These inspectors will be assisted by the county 
representatives of the department of agriculture and by the super- 
visors of women’s institutes. Provision has been made for short 
courses in household science in Prince of Wales College, long and 
short courses in agriculture, practical instruction in agriculture for 
those qualifying for teachers of the public schools, a science course 
for teachers now in charge of schools, and women’s institutes. 
In the Province of Alberta the second summer school for teachers 
was held at the university, under the direction of the department of 
education, and was attended by 165 teachers, as compared with 80 
in the previous year. The instruction included first and second year 
work in agriculture, nature study, etc., and first-year work in do- 
mestic science, household arts, and physical training. A special 
course for the provincial inspectors’of schools was given for the first 
time. 
In British Columbia the department of agriculture conducted 25 
five-day schools for practical instruction in the pruning of tree and 
bush fruits; apple-packing contests were held at 10 fairs; and the 
pupils of 24 fruit-packing schools made exhibits at 18 different fairs. 
A boys’ and girls’ crop competition was also held in connection with 
the farmers’ institutes in British Columbia for the first time, upward 
of 175 entries being received. Each competitor was required to send 
a 20-pound exhibit from his plat to the Dominion exhibition held in 
Victoria and also keep a crop and financial statement. The boy and 
girl securing the highest total scores received, respectively, from the 
department of agriculture a pure-bred heifer calf and a high-grade 
sewing machine. 
The department of agriculture of Manitoba is preparing to en- 
large its extension work by introducing a system of field or district 
specialists in agriculture located in different parts of the Province.

Special instruction was given at the Manitoba Agricultural College 
during the winter for the purpose of fitting these men for their work. 
It is expected that they will not only provide technical assistance in 
extending approved methods of cultivation and farm management, 
but will also assist in improving the marketing facilities, administer 
the noxious weeds act, and by keeping in close touch with the 14 
demonstration farms already established, and others to be established, 
will be able to advise in regard to the approved methods of land 
clearing. 
The boys’ and girls’ clubs, organized in Manitoba, have this year 
increased more than threefold in number. 
A second school of agriculture in the Province of New Brunswick, 
to be known as the Sussex Agricultural Institute, has been completed 
at an estimated cost of $28,500. 
The summer rural science school for teachers, held for the first 
time under the supervision of the director of elementary agricultural 
education at Woodstock, N. B., in 1914, was attended by 68 teachers, 
6 inspectors, and 1 normal-school instructor. Instruction was given 
in nature study, horticulture, agriculture, physical nature, farm 
mechanics, and rural domestic science, supplemented by a series of 
lectures on insects, field crops, soil improvement, and practical in- 
struction in milk testing. 
A feature of the Nova Scotia rural science school, held in Truro 
in July, 1914, was a model school fair, for which the teachers pro- 
vided and arranged the exhibits. The latter included collections of 
grasses, weeds, and wild flowers, mounted insects, samples of chemi- 
cal elements necessary to plant growth, a home canning outfit, sam- 
ples of butter from the agricultural college, dairy apparatus, various 
fibers, samples of sugars, etc. 
In the Province of Saskatchewan $6,500 of the grant under the 
agricultural instruction act is expended by the department of edu- 
cation for the introduction of agricultural and domestic-science 
courses into high schools and collegiate institutions and the training 
of teachers in agriculture at the provincial normal schools. The 
remainder of the money is about equally divided between the college 
of agriculture at Saskatoon and the provincial department of agri- 
culture at Regina. The university will spend its grant almost wholly 
in salaries of instructors in research, teaching, and extension, the 
appointments made amounting during this year to $16,400. Instruc- 
tion was given to 101 students in the regular course of the college 
of agriculture, to 12 men in the degree course, and to 10 registered 
in agriculture from other colleges of the university. 
The department of education of the Province of Saskatchewan is 
arranging for the appointment of agricultural instructors at each 
of the normal schools, a part of whose duties will be the training
-P-A-G-E-328
  808 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915,’ 
of teachers in school gardening. Experimental and permanent plats 
will be established in connection with each normal school. At: the 
Provincial Normal School, Regina, approximately 10 acres have been 
set aside for a model rural school garden. 
GREECE. 
During 1914 the ministry of national economy of Greece-expended 
more than $16,000 for repairing and equipping the model farm of 
Saloniki, which is to be designated the principal agricultural school 
in new Greece. This school, which was established 20 years ago 
under the Turkish régime, has three buildings for scholastic purposes 
(one of which contains a museum and also a chemical laboratory), a 
station for breeding purposes, etc. The Greek Government expects 
to complete the construction of a large new school building which 
was started before the Balkan wars. The farm is devoted to the 
growing of cotton, tobacco, sesame, sorghum, barley, oats, beets, and 
other plants and vegetables, and there is also a modern dairy and 
cheese house. Modern agricultural machinery and chemical ferti- 
lizers are used, and a nursery with about 100,000 trees of various 
kinds, including a large number of fruit trees, is expected to be of 
service in replanting the deforested sections of Macedonia. Im- 
proved methods of silk culture have given very satisfactory results 
during the past year. A farm viticulturist visits the various villages 
to give advice to vine growers. “ 
The daily consular and trade reports announce that the Greek 
Government has established eight agricultural experiment stations, 
which are under the control of the ministry of agriculture, one of 
these being near Athens; an agricultural school known as Cassa- 
vetios, at Halmyrios, with 3 professors and about 35 pupils; and 
two model farms, one at Astros and the other at Trichonis. 
LATIN AMERICA. 
The establishment of a National Institute’ of Agriculture and 
Veterinary Science at Bogota, Colombia, with an experiment farm 
attached and an auxiliary school of agriculture and animal hus- 
bandry to be located elsewhere, was authorized in December, 1914. 
Besides the regular four-year course the institute will offer special 
normal courses in technical instruction and courses in horticulture, 
floriculture, arboriculture, and the cultivation and manufacture of 
raw materials for textiles. One scholarship will be granted by the 
Government to each department of the Republic and six scholarships 
at large will be awarded by the minister of agriculture and commerce. 
The government of Cundinamarca, Colombia, has contracted with 
H. Charton, proprietor of vineyards of the municipality of Tocaima,
-P-A-G-E-329
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 809 
to establish an agricultural institute on his property. The school 
will begin operations with 12 pupils selected from the municipality. 
Marcel Berthaul, of Paris, has been appointed professor of agronomy 
in the University of Narino. The Colombian Government has also 
authorized the employment of four instructors of tropical agriculture 
and two veterinarians. : 
The Elidoro Villazon National Agronomic and Veterinary Insti- 
tute at Cochabamba, Bolivia, is now well equipped with experimental 
grounds, laboratories, library, machinery, and apparatus and fur- 
nishes a four-year course of theoretical and practical instruction in 
agronomy and veterinary science. The scholastic year begins in 
March. A number of scholarships are available to needy students. 
Pedro Charuli is acting director of the school and a number of the 
professors are specialists from abroad. 
Dr. Moises S. Bertoni, an experienced agronomist and botanist 
and director of the agricultural station at Asuncion, Paraguay, has 
been appointed chief of the bureau of agriculture of the Government 
of Paraguay. An agricultural school is being established at 
Ypacarai, with two instructors who have been educated abroad in 
charge of the several courses. 
A three-year theoretical and practical course in agriculture is now 
being offered in the Peruvian National College of San Luis Gon- 
zaga, at Ica. A viticultural experiment station has been in opera- 
tion in the Moquegua valley, under the direction of Julio Solano. 
A new school is also to be established at Puno, the Peruvian port 
on Lake Titicaca, for native boys from 6 to 14 years of age. The in- 
struction will be elementary and practical, with the aim of develop- 
ing mining, agriculture, and other industries in this section. 
ISLAND OF MAURITIUS. 
A scheme for teaching nature study and manual training in the 
elementary schools of the island of Mauritius, together with the estab- 
lishment of school gardens and workshops, has been formulated by 
the department of agriculture in conjunction with the director of 
public instruction. 
Arrangements have also been made for the training of a limited 
number, not to exceed six, of young men in agricultural science, with 
special reference to the sugar industry, in the laboratories of the 
department of agriculture. They must agree to pursue for three 
years a course of study in the general principles of agriculture, agri- 
cultural botany and biology, agricultural chemistry, agricultural ento- 
mology, and meteorology. A diploma will be awarded and a research 
scholarship will be available once in every three years.

NEW ZEALAND. 
The minister of agriculture has recently announced that it has 
been decided to establish a board of agriculture for New Zealand 
to consist of 12 members. Its duties will be to advise the minister of 
agriculture on any matters affecting agriculture that he may refer to 
it for consideration; to appoint special committees of agricultural 
experts to inspect the work of departmental institutions, such as the 
experimental farms and State agricultural colleges, and also to in- 
quire into and report upon any urgent agricultural problems of the 
day; and to consider the policy of the department in regard to 
such matters as the collection of agricultural statistics, the dissemi- 
nation of agricultural information, the control of noxious weeds, 
the prevention of stock diseases, the fostering of fruit growing and 
forestry, recommendations from agricultural conferences, rural edu- 
cation, better means of communication, and other measures intended 
to make rural industry more efficient and rural life more desirable. 
SPAIN. 
A Spanish railway in the Province of Soria, to improve agricul- 
tural: conditions, has provided its stations with small agricultural 
museums supplied with various kinds of useful information, such as 
formulas for fertilizers and their use; methods of buying fertilizing 
material; addresses of houses selling machinery, seeds, plants, live 
stock, etc.; directions for organizing agricultural societies; the man- 
ner of soliciting appropriations from the Central Government; con- 
struction of district roads; and details of different industries which 
might be introduced with success in the Province. Experiment 
fields showing how to use fertilizers have been established near the 
different stations by the central experiment station service of Madrid 
and lectures given on their proper use. Demonstrations of agricul- 
tural machinery have been made by local agents of manufacturers. 
Aga result Soria has been making noteworthy progress in agriculture. 
WEST INDIES. 
A school of agriculture has been started at Artemisa, Cuba, where 
pupils from the district schools will receive preparatory instruction 
in modern scientific farming. The ground, which has been donated 
to the school for agricultural uses, will be apportioned in small lots 
to individual students, and seeds and fertilizers will be furnished. 
The department of agriculture proposes to found similar schools at 
different places throughout the Republic. A tract of 100 acres near 
Camaguey has recently been.purchased. 
An agricultural school for boys over 12 years of age has been 
established at Las Mercedes plantation, near the city of San Jose,
-P-A-G-E-331
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 311 
Costa Rica, with the object of training practical farmers. It is 
under the direction of Prof. Gustavo L. Michaud, an experienced 
Costa Rican agronomist and educator. The instruction will be 
theoretical and practical, the latter including the use of agricultural 
machinery, elementary carpentering, blacksmithing, and_ brick- 
laying. 
EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE. 
In recent years the higher agricultural institutions in Europe have 
been made more strictly and fundamentally institutions of real uni- 
versity grade, through the improvement of their equipment and 
facilities, an increase in the size of farms, the assembling of collec- 
tions of farm machinery, enlarging the scope and extent of the curric- 
ulum, with a more definite application to practical agriculture, and 
increasing the faculty. There is not in Europe entire unanimity as 
to the desirability of making the agricultural colleges departments 
of the universities. 
As regards secondary agricultural schools a number of countries 
have a much more complete system than exists in the United States, 
and the tendency is to increase the number of schools and make them 
more efficient. They are still, however, largely for the peasant 
classes. In a general way these schools may* be divided into two 
classes: (1) Those in which great stress is laid on theoretical instruc- 
tion; and (2) those in which the emphasis is laid on practical instruc- 
tion. 
One of the developments along the line of.elementary instruction 
in agriculture, to which much attention is now being given in Euro- 
pean countries, is the continuation classes which are held on Satur- 
days or in the evenings. Attendance on these can to some extent be 
made compulsory by village authorities in Germany. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF, 
AGRICULTURE. 
In accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress of March 
4, 1915, making appropriations for the Department of Agriculture, 
the Secretary of Agriculture in a memorandum dated June 8 said: 
I hereby establish a States Relations Service in this department, which shall 
represent the Secretary of Agriculture in his relations with the State agri- 
cultural colleges and experiment stations under the acts of Congress of July 
2, 1862, August 30, 1890, March 2, 1887, March 16, 1906, May 8, 1914, and acts 
supplementary thereto, and in carrying out the provision. of acts of Congress 
making appropriations to this department for farmers’ cooperative demonstra- 
tion work, investigations relating to agricultural schools, farmers’ institutes, 
the relative utility and economy of agricultural products used for food, clothing, 
and other uses in the home, and the maintenance of agricultural experiment 
stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and Guam, and in such other matters 
as the Secretary of Agriculture shall designate from time to time.  
-P-A-G-E-332
  812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The States Relation Service shall include the following offices: (1) The office 
of the director of the service, which shall include those officers and employees 
engaged in the general work and administration of the service; (2) the Office 
of Experiment Stations, including the work of the service relating to agricul- 
tural experiment stations; (3) the office of extension work in the South, in- 
cluding the farmers’ cooperative demonstration work and the Smith-Lever 
agricultural extension work in 15 Southern States; (4) the office of extension 
work in the North and West, including the farmers’ cooperative demonstration 
work and the Smith-Lever agricultural extension work in 83 Northern and 
Western States; and (5) the office of home economics, including investigations 
relative to foods, clothing, and household equipment and management. 
The work of the service relating to agricultural instruction and to farmers’ 
institutes and similar organizations shall be under the immediate direction of 
the director, and the work relating to farmers’ institutes and similar organiza- 
tions shall be carried on in close cooperation with the oflices of extension work. 
The States Relations Service will take under consideration matters relating to 
all the extension work carried on by the several bureaus and offices of the 
department and those connected with the administration of the Smith-Lever 
extension act. All plans for demonstration and extension work originating in 
any bureau or in any State should first be submitted to the States Relations 
Service, which will make recommendations regarding them to the secretary. 
Approved plans for demonstration and extension work by any bureau should 
not be put into operation in any State until they have been brought to the 
attention of the director of the States relations service and an opportunity 
has been given for arranging with the extension directors of the agricultural 
colleges regarding the execution of these plans in the States concerned. 
The Chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry reports that the boys’ 
and girls’ clubs or junior extension in agriculture and home economics 
in the Northern and Western States has made marked progress 
during the past fiscal year. The enrollment of boys and girls in the 
various club projects has increased from 110,077 at the close of 1914 
to 151,194 on June 30,1915. Twenty-six of the 33 Northern and 
Western States are now conducting club work, cooperating with this 
department. Each of these States has a State leader cooperatively 
employed. Fifteen of the States have assistants in boys’ and girls’ 
club work who devote their entire time to handling instructions, 
visitations, and looking after the details of organization and follow- 
up work of the projects in the field. 
Out of 330 county agents in the Northern and Western States, 225 
have given definite time to the work in cooperation with the county 
superintendents and the educational forces of the county, and in every 
case county agents testify to the fact that the boys’ and girls’ club 
work is one of the important activities in the county and helps mate- 
rially in getting the benefits of the colleges of agriculture and the 
department out to the adult farmers and farmers’ wives. During the 
year 1,557 club members attended the midwinter short courses at the 
colleges of agriculture, and out of this number 968 had their expenses 
paid by the local people, institutions, or organizations as a recognition 
of their championships or achievements in club work.
-P-A-G-E-333
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 813 
All club members who have become champions in their States, dis- 
tricts, or counties having reached the standards of achievement set 
by State and Federal supervising officers are recognized as National 
All-Star members. Out of the 38 All-Star members reporting, 27 of 
them have been club members for two or three years or from the time 
of the organization of cooperative extension work with the boys and 
girls. Thirty-one of the 88 are in attendance at high schools, agri- 
cultural colleges, or other colleges. The following list will indicate 
some of the activities conducted during the year: Corn clubs, potato 
clubs, poultry clubs, garden and canning clubs, mother-daughter 
clubs, pork and crop clubs, cooking and bread-making clubs, and sew- 
ing clubs. 
Altogether 7,909 clubs were conducted during the year. In the 
corn-club work 20 club members produced yields in excess of 120 
bushels, 91 produced yields in excess of 100 bushels, 384 in excess of 
80 bushels, and 863 in excess of 60 bushels out of a total of 1,974. 
The object of the home demonstration work, including girl’s club 
work in 15 Southern States, is to organize and conduct extension 
work for women and girls by employing and directing the work of 
women county agents for the purpose of disseminating information 
and conducting demonstrations in the homes in the rural sections 
of the South and instructing girls in home economics and kindred 
subjects. They conduct demonstrations in home gardens and 
poultry, organize women’s clubs for demonstration and study, and 
give general instruction in home economics. They also organize 
girl’s clubs in the teaching of gardening and canning and other sub- 
jects, and carry on the general work of extension in home economics. 
The girls’ demonstration work began with the canning clubs in 
1910, when four counties in two States were organized. The enroll- 
ment for 1914 was 33,173. Of these club members 7,793 put up 
6,091,237 pounds of tomatoes and other vegetables from their tenth- 
acre gardens—1,918,024 cans, jars, and other containers. They are 
estimated to be worth $284,880.81, and nearly $200,000 of this is 
profit.’ The average profit per member was $23.30. Special work 
has been done with peaches, berries, figs, seuppernongs, May haws, 
ajeritas, oranges, kumquats, and many other fruits of the South. 
Nearly 3,000 girls now belong to poultry clubs, and several hundred 
have been doing fine work in bread clubs. Many of the best-trained 
club members are succeeding now with their winter gardens. Club 
members have madé uniform caps, aprons, and dresses, and thus have 
had good sewing lessons. In all of these activities the women on 
the farms have given active help. 
The chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry reports that the ob- 
ject of the organization of boys’ pig clubs is to stimulate an interest 
in swine production and to teach boys improved methods of raising,
-P-A-G-E-334
  814 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
fattening, and marketing hogs; to instill in the boys, while young, a 
love of animals which will result in their taking more interest in 
life upon the farm; and to furnish them at the same time with some 
work which will, in a practical way, give an insight into the business 
side of farm life. 
This work is carried on in connection with the county demonstra- 
tion agents in the States which desire such cooperation. Wherever 
possible the representative of this department gains the assistance 
of the county superintendent of schools, the teachers, and those per- 
sons who are in direct contact with boys and other young people. 
During the calendar year of 1914 there were enrolled the following 
number of members in each of the States named: Louisiana, 3,500; 
Alabama, 1,900; and Georgia, 981. An exhibit of 185 hogs belong- 
ing to pig-club members was made at the State fair at Shreveport, 
La. This exhibit caused much comment because of its excellence. 
Exhibits were made at the two Georgia State fairs. A good exhibit 
of meat products made by ham and bacon club members was seen at 
these fairs. Pig-club work was started also in North Carolina, 
Kentucky, Indiana, and Nebraska. 
The Forest Service has continued its direct assistance given 
teachers, educational institutions, and associations through the loan 
of photograph exhibits, lantern slides, and wood exhibits, and 
through the distribution of publications, maps, and wood samples, 
while most of the work of the section has been the planning and 
preparation of exhibits for expositions and fairs. Two new photo- 
graph exhibits were prepared and 1,326 lantern slides were added 
to those already available for educational use. Seven exhibits, con- 
sisting of 70 samples of commercially important woods with maps 
of their ranges and short statements of their characteristics and 
principal uses, with maps and charts showing regions supplying the 
principal wood products, etc., were prepared during the year and 
have since been in constant use by schools and libraries. 
The Weather Bureau has been engaged in educational work with a 
number of institutions of learning throughout the country, and this 
work is assuming increasing importance. While the number of insti- 
tutions at which this educational work is carried on has not been 
greatly augmented in recent years, there has nevertheless been steady 
growth in the number of students availing themselves of instruction 
in meteorology. The instruction given is usually in the form of lec- 
tures. The bureau is constantly in receipt of requests for cloud charts 
and copies of weather maps, which are employed by teachers in di- 
recting the attention of their pupils to the simpler and more evident 
weather phenomena.

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT 
STATIONS. 
During the year 1914-15 the Office of Experiment Stations contin- 
ued to follow and record the progress of agricultural education 
throughout the world. Abstracts of important textbooks, manuals, 
and other publications relating to agricultural education, together 
with notes on the agricultural colleges and schools in this and other 
countries, were published monthly in the Experiment Station Record. 
In cooperation with the State agricultural colleges, experiment sta- 
tions, and State departments of education, the office began the prep- 
aration of a series of bulletins on Elementary Agriculture for Rural 
Schools. Such bulletins have already been prepared for the schools 
of Alabama, Maryland, and Wisconsin. Other publications com- 
pleted during the year dealt with “ Correlating Agriculture with the 
Public School Subjects in the Northern and in the Southern States; ” 
“Exercises with Plants and Animals for Southern Rural Schools; ” 
“Lessons on Cotton for the Rural Common Schools;” “ School 
Credit for Home Work in Agriculture;” “Home Projects in Sec- 
ondary Agriculture; ” and “ Judging Draft Horses and Dairy Cows 
as Subjects of Instruction in the Secondary Schools.” 
Beginning with January, 1915, five numbers of volume 1 of the 
Agricultural Education Monthly were issued. The monthly contains 
items of general interest pertaining to methods of teaching agricul- 
ture in the secondary schools and furnishes references and suggestions 
upon timely topics suitable for subject matter. 
The teaching of vocational agriculture is limited at the present 
time by the number of teachers prepared to give such instruction. 
The need for teachers who can show how to farm as well as to direct 
a study of books and station literature is making a new demand upon 
land-grant colleges. The demand for county extension workers is 
also emphasized in the need for practical work in connection with 
the college course in agriculture. This matter is receiving the atten- 
- tion of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Ex- 
periment Stations, which is working upon this problem with the aid 
of the office. 
The problem of making the teaching of agriculture in the high 
schools more practical has resolved itself largely in the problems 
connected with the use of land. This subject has been investigated 
by the office working in cooperation with a standing committee of 
the American Association for the Advancement of Agricultural 
Teaching. 
Although emphasis has been placed upon practical work out of 
doors, the need for better methods in classroom instruction and labo- 
ratory methods has not been overlooked. There has been a demand 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
for suggestions regarding the use of illustrative material and other 
means of visualizing lessons in agriculture. 
The office has prepared a large number of lantern slides especially 
for the use of teachers and extension workers. 
One of the outgrowths of the more practical teaching of agricul- 
ture is the extension of the scope of the rural high school. The 
progressive teacher of agriculture no longer considers his work con- 
fined to the classroom, or limited to the students registered. In 
many schools the local extension service is organized in such a defi- 
nite way that the high school stands in the same relation to the local 
community that the agricultural college does to the State. The com- 
mittee on agriculture of the commission on the reorganization of 
secondary education of the National Education Association has 
assigned to the office the problem of working out the aims, methods, 
and materials to be, utilized in high-school extension in agriculture. 
During the past two years there has been a remarkable increase 
in the number of texts and references relating to agriculture. The 
quality of the publications has increased greatly as well, when viewed 
from the standpoint of the teacher. Much of the data published 
formerly in technical form by the agricultural experiment stations 
and the United States Department of Agriculture has never been 
published in a simple expository form suitable for the use of younger 
students as well as farmers. The office has undertaken the publishing 
of such material as may be of direct value for subject matter, at the 
same time suggesting methods of instruction. 
For the convenience of agricultural colleges and other institutions 
seeking trained teachers and investigators, the office maintains a 
card directory of American teachers and investigators in agriculture.

  INTRODUCTION. 
The most marked line of advancement in the teaching of home 
economics has been in the direction of careful and practical instruc- 
tion in the administration of the affairs of the household. There has 
not been less thorough instruction in food preparation and related 
subjects, nor have the various phases of sewing and textile study been 
neglected, but the management of the entire household is now receiv- 
ing thoughtful consideration. 
Home economics departments are not all so fortunate as to have 
residences in which to instruct in home management and in house- 
wifery. There has been some hesitancy among school officers because 
of the initial expense of a practice house. But as it is recognized 
that these houses are quite as necessary as are good laboratories and 
that the maintenance costs are not excessive, more departments are 
being thus supplied. These houses offer opportunities for experi- 
mental studies in household administration, make practice in home 
furnishing possible, and afford excellent places for studies in nutri- 
tion. 
The practice house is as distinctly a legitimate part of the equip- 
ment for teaching home economics as the sewing machine, ironing 
board, or individual desk with its cooking utensils.

  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
GOVERNMENT BULLETINS. ON HOME ECONOMICS. 
The most valuable contribution to home-economics literature dur- 
ing the year came from Prof. Benjamin F. Andrews, of Teachers 
College, Columbia University, New York. Dr. Andrews prepared 
for the Bureau of Education a series of four bulletins on “ Education 
for the Home,” which cover the entire field of recent progress in 
home economics. The first number of the series contains an intro- 
ductory survey of the history, development, and present status of 
education for the home. A full discussion is given regarding the 
most desirable name to be given to the group of subjects relating 
to education for the home, of which the following is a portion: 
The qualifying words “home,” “ domestic,” “house,” “ household,” have all = 
been used with various general terms as “science,” “art,” “ economy,” “ eco- 
nomics,” “arts,” ‘“ technology,” ‘ engineering,” “management,” ete. Of the 
qualifying words the choice seems to lie between “ home” and “ household.” 
Home emphasizes the social and personal elements more and lays less stress 
on the mechanical, technical, and administrative side. Household seems a more 
appropriate scientific term than home. Home making and household manage- 
ment indicate at bottom the vocational distinction between the services, 
position, responsibilities of the unpaid housewife or other member of the family 
and those of the employed manager of a household. Doubtless there is great 
need of accurate vocational terms, and home maker and household manager 
are two such terms. As to the general terms used—science, art, economy, 
economics, art, technology, engineering, management, and administration— 
some are academic names for knowledge to be imparted and some emphasize 
knowledge in use in a profession. The traditions of the schools favor academic 
words like science. The demand for vocational training properly asks for 
generic words that mean the vocation or profession, not the study, and pro- 
fessional terms will be used ultimately in higher technical schools. 
The practical suggestions are these: To use the common general term 
“home economics” for the whole field of instruction, at least until a better 
one is found; discard the ambiguous terms “ domestic science” and “ domestic 
art”; use “household arts” in elementary schools and possibly in secondary 
schools—though in the latter a more vocational term, home making or house- 
hold management, is more accurate; in academic high schools the term house- 
hold science may temporarily be useful until the vocation of the girl who does 
not go to college is adequately recognized ; in academic colleges home economics 
is probably the most useful term, although at present collegiate instruction 
in this field is often given in special courses, such as the economics of con- 
sumption, the economic position of women, the home as a social institution, food 
chemistry, sanitary chemistry; and in colleges the possibility of ‘‘ euthenics ” 
as a term is to be taken into account; in technical colleges and professional 
schools, the professional terms household management or administration, home 
making, household arts, technology, or engineering will be increasingly used 
as indicating the field of service, while terms like foods, shelter or housing, 
clothing, management, service, marketing, accounts, child care, house care, 
laundering, domestic relations, will ultimately indicate divisions of instruction, 
terms taken from the concrete situation in the household itself. 
The aims of education for the home, methods of instruction, and 
cost of equipment are all fully discussed, and make available for 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
HOME ECONOMICS. 319 
the first time material which heretofore has been scattered through 
many bulletins, pamphlets, and books. In Part IT the laws of the 
States as they touch home economics education are brought to- 
gether. The introductory statement for this material was as follow: 
Authorization and requirement of education for the home in public schools.— 
Edueation for the home is specifically authorized as a subject of instruction 
in the schools of approximately three-fourths of the States. All of the New 
England States; all of the Middle States except Delaware; all of the Southern 
States except West Virginia, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama; all of the Central 
States except Missouri and South Dakota, and all of the Mountain and Pacific _ 
States except Wyoming and Colorado have in one way or another authorized 
the teaching of household subjects in their elementary school or high school 
or in both. Thirty States have authorized the teaching in elementary schools 
and 33 States in secondary schools. Formal recognition by the State govern-. 
ment of household arts as a suitable subject of instruction has therefore taken 
place very generally throughout the whole country save in a block of adjoin- 
ing Southern States, a similar block of Mountain States, and a few other 
scattering Commonwealths. 
At the conclusion of Dr. Andrews’s survey of legislation, this ex- 
cellent program of education for the home is suggested : 
There is presented herewith, in summary, a brief statement of points com- 
prising a State program of education for the home as they may, with advan- 
tage, be expressed in its school legislation: 
1. A requirement that household arts be taught in every elementary school, 
city and rural. 
2. State supervision of household-arts education by an expert inspector, pref- 
erably an assistant attached to the office of the State superintendent of schools, 
who can give direction to the development of a progressive program, 
8. Home economics included as a part of the normal-school preparation of 
every grade teacher and as a part of the course in all training classes for 
teachers, city and rural, so that household-arts teaching may be included in 
the grade work of the regular teacher. 
4. A certificate for special teachers of household arts requiring not less than 
two years of professional training beyond the high school, and for supervisory 
teachers a three-year or, preferably, a full four-year course. 
5, A State grant toward the salary of special teachers of household arts and 
supervisors of household arts, that is, of teachers with the specified preparation 
who devote full time to household teaching. 
6. A system of supervision of household-arts teaching in rural schools, through 
a visiting teacher who gives special instruction and who aids the regular teacher 
in this special field; by a system of consolidation of rural schools; or by the 
Minnesota system of associating rural schools with a central school. 
7. In secondary education encouragement of household-science teaching in all 
public high schools; first by State grants toward teachers’ salaries, and ulti- 
mately by a requirement that the subject be offered at least as an elective. 
8. The recognition of household arts and home making in the new program 
of vocational education by giving these subjects a place coordinate with training 
for industry, commerce, and agriculture. 
9. Prevocational classes of the seventh and eighth grades in household arts 
and in other fields to hold pupils who now leave school, but not to encroach on 
fundamental education of a general character.
-P-A-G-E-340
  320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
10. On the secondary level, distinct vocational training in household arts and in 
other fields—by day schools, by part-time continuation schools at daytime hours, 
or by evening classes to be done away with as soon as the part-time continuation 
school at daytime hours can be introduced. This vocational training will be 
given in special schools such as are illustrated by the county schools of agricul- 
ture and domestic economy in Wisconsin and elsewhere, the Garland School of 
Home Making in Boston, and the distinctly vocational courses in household arts 
in public high schools; but especially will practical vocational training be given 
in continuation classes in household arts and home making, in connection with 
the public schools, to reach three definite groups: (a) The housewife, home 
maker, and young woman living at home; (b) the wage-earning houseworker 
or “servant”; and (c) the wage-earning young woman in other employments 
who desires to improve her skill in home making; these classes will treat unit 
subjects, will meet at daytime hours, and for the wage earner will provide op- 
portunity for such study on the employer’s time. 
11. Higher institutions, normal schools, technical institutes, and colleges will 
provide vocational instruction upon a higher level. 
12. The program of extension education to reach the home makers of the pres- 
ent generation to be carried out both in city and country. In the city this in- 
volves lectures, day and evening classes under the public schools, and instruc- 
tion by settlements, philanthropic societies, churches, and other agencies through 
classes, visiting housekeepers, home schools, or model flats, and other means. 
In the country the prime need is for movable schools of home making, and 
visiting advisory teachers of housekeeping, whose work as consultants may be 
developed in connection with the farm demonstration work in agriculture. 
Meanwhile women’s institutes, home-making clubs, correspondence courses, 
housewives’ bulletins, and similar agencies are utilized increasingly by agri- 
cultural colleges and local schools to reach the rural home. 
There are many agencies contributing to the education for the 
home that are outside of school organizations. Some of these are the 
Young Women’s Christian Association, Farmers’ Institutes, the 
Grange county agents and county demonstrators, settlements, domes- 
tic education (otherwise known as visiting housekeepers), nurses, as- 
sociations, and industrial organizations. A brief statement of the 
work undertaken by each of these may be found in the Andrews’ 
bulletins, together with a summary of investigations undertaken by 
many other organizations interested in home betterment. 
Later in this chapter mention will be made of the “ home-teacher ” 
law recently enacted in California. What had been done by chari- 
table and philanthropic organizations is thus described in its bureau 
bulletins: 
There was introduced a few years ago by the Society for Improving the Con- 
dition of the Poor in New York a type of home teaching in needy families 
which consists of sending to the home a trained dietitian to give instruction 
on food values and practical cookery when failure in household management 
seems to be the source of the difficulty. The plan has now been adopted in 
many communities and undertaken by different organizations. The Young 
Women’s Christian Association of Cleveland, Ohio; the Associated Charities 
of Detroit; the North American Civic League for Emigrants, Buffalo; and cer- 
tain philanthropic societies in Chicago and in Cambridge, Roxbury, and Bos- 
ton, Mass., have undertaken similar work. From the original teaching of
-P-A-G-E-341
  HOME ECONOMICS. 821 
practical food management, the work has broadened out until it covers the 
whole field of household management, including child care, sanitation, making 
of clothing, household expenditures and accounts; in fact, remedial instruc- 
tion in every field of the household. The advantages of such work are obvious. 
It reaches the present generation without waiting for the children to get instruc- 
tion in the schools. It reaches the needy families. It is eminently practical. 
Measured by results in terms of cost, it seems to be more than justifying itself. 
The following prefatory note explains the plan and purpose of 
the third number of the Andrews series, which relates to home 
economic instruction in colleges and universities: 
In this portion of the report there are presented statements showing how 
instruction in home economics is organized in various colleges and universities, 
such as the University of Chicago, with its department of household adminis- 
tration as a division of the university, and, in addition, in its school of edu- 
cation a department of home economics and household arts; the University of 
Missouri, with its department of home economics a part of its school of edu- 
cation, but offering work also for the degrees of A. B. and B. S. in agricul- 
ture; Elmira College, one of the early women’s colleges, which now offers a 
vocational degree in the household field and accepts certain courses for the 
A. B. degrec ; the University of Wisconsin, in which the department is adminis- 
tratively related to the college of agriculture; Simmons College, Boston, an 
academic vocational college with household economics as one of its six voca- 
tional departments; Teachers College, Columbia University, which not only 
trains teachers of household arts, but in its technical “ school of practical arts ” 
trains household and institution managers, dietitians, and similar professional 
workers related to the household. The college course in home economics 
recommended by a committee of the agricultural colleges is also presented. 
Outlines of typical individual courses, as given in different colleges and 
universities, are next presented under the following groupings: The home- 
economics movement, economic and social-science courses related to the house- 
hold; natural science courses related to the household ; courses in foods ; courses 
in clothing, suelter, household management, and related courses. There are 
further presented data regarding college instruction in household arts received 
through a schedule of inquiry. The facts are assembled first by individual 
colleges; they are then discussed as to the conclusions, with explanatory illus- 
trations, under such headings as the dates of introducing college instruction, 
degrees, courses, registration, summer courses, extension education, equipment, 
and other subjects. 
The fourth bulletin of the series comprises complete lists of books 
and bulletins relating to home economics anda list of towns and 
cities where this subject is taught. 
The following pages of this annual review of progress in home 
economics will be devoted in the main to a statement of the more 
recent developments that have occurred since the publication of this 
series of bulletins and the chapter by Prof. Andrews in the 1914 
report.

HOME ECONOMICS IN STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
Home economics is now a recognized course of study in all agricul- 
tural colleges to which women are admitted. Thirty-one State uni- 
versities offer regular courses in home economics, and most of the 
private and denominational colleges and universities now offer simi- 
lar instruction. 
The University of Iowa, which established home-economics courses 
but two years ago, reports that the enrollment in the department 
reached 150 during the second year of its existence. 
Indiana University has had a course in home economics for two 
years. Two hundred students are enrolled, and seniors have an op- 
portunity for practice teaching in the Bloomington (Ind.) public 
schools. 
The University of Minnesota maintains a practice house for senior 
students in which each young woman resides nine weeks, assuming 
during that time the various duties incident to the operation of a 
household. 
The junior students in the University of Wisconsin have similar 
practice in a residence. 
The University of Nebraska reports that— 
The course in home administration was strengthened last year by our oppor- 
tunity to use a 10-room house on the campus. We had no money assigned to us 
and therefore had to operate with the furniture that could be spared from the 
dormitory and money derived from the fees and rent from three rooms. 
The home-economics division of Ohio State University has been 
given the funds for a new building, which is now under construction. 
The following is a quotation received in a report from the above-men- 
tioned division: 
In connection with the State agricultural commission, home-economics con- 
tests were conducted fér girls over the State, and instructors were furnished 
for the judging of products prepared by contestants. One of the prizes offered 
was a week’s instruction to be given by the department at Ohio State University 
the first week in November. Ninety-four girls were in attendance. Instruction 
and entertainment were provided by the members of the instructional force and 
students in the department. * * * An effort will be made to supply sugges- 
tive lessons and demonstrations to rural and village schools having no work in 
home economics and to encourage and standardize home work to be done by the 
pupils. 
Home economics in the University of New Mexico is newly estab- 
lished, and the first class is now ready for work. 
The course in the University of South Dakota reports: 
The department was organized just two years ago, and in that time has made 
a wonderful progress. * * * The following new courses have been added 
this year: Costume designing, millinery, and a course of demonstration lectures. 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  HOME ECONOMICS. 323 
The commons at the University of Washington has afforded the 
students in food preparation an unusual opportunity to practice 
cooking in quantities. “All who have food work spend their practice 
time three and one-half days a week at the commons to get the con- 
nection between laboratory work and actual commercial work.” Tea- 
room management is also offered. The woman’s dormitory is under 
the direction of the home economics department. This will give an 
additional opportunity for training in institutional management. © 
The same connection with actual conditions in clothing work has been 
arranged. Graduate courses in home economics were offered last 
year for the first time. : 
The University of Missouri has instituted a course in household 
problems and placed their clothing work on the same academic basis 
as the food has been in the past and still is. 
Milwaukee-Downer College has added three new courses: Institu- 
tional management, evolution of the home, and a survey course in 
food study. The first two courses are open to home economics stu- 
dents only. The latter course is intended for students in the college 
of letters and science. The institution is also offering a home-maker’s 
course for nonresident and mature persons. 
The University of California has no home economics department 
or division, but offers in the various departments almost all the lines 
of work necessary to a course in home economics. The work is par- 
ticularly strong in the chemistry of foods, nutrition, and dietetics. 
That which is usually known as domestic art does not find a place in 
the regular courses of the University of California, but noncredit 
courses are offered in the summer school maintained by the uni- 
versity. 
The Kansas State Agricultural College organized within the past 
year an excellent course in “ Problems of child welfare,” and added 
a course in costume and design. A new venture for 1915-16 is a 
cafeteria, which is not only to feed students, but is to be used as a 
laboratory for those enrolling in the course in institutional cookery 
and institutional management. 
In the North Dakota Agricultural College a purely theoretical 
course has been improved by making use of the dormitory and its 
dining room.and kitchen as practice places for the students in institu- 
tional management. 
The Oregon State Agricultural College gave a course in tea-room 
management, and used a dining room and kitchen in the Oregon 
building at the Panama-Pacific Exposition as a practice place. 
During the past year the school of home economics of Simmons 
College has been affiliated with the Instructive District Nursing Asso- 
ciation of Boston, and offers to members of the association courses in 
economical cookery and dietetics.
-P-A-G-E-344
  324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The Woman’s College of Delaware was opened in the fall of 1914. 
A home economics course of four years’ length was arranged, and 37 
per cent of the students registered in this course. 
The establishment of a junior college at Pocatello, Idaho, made 
advanced course in home economics possible in a region heretofore far 
removed from State institutions for higher education. 
The newly established Woman’s College at New London, Conn., 
has a course in nutrition which is planned to give work of college 
grade. 
Not only have new courses been added in almost all State colleges 
and universities, but there has been greatly increased student enroll- 
ment in previously established courses. There is a marked tendency 
to inaugurate courses in institutional management and cafeteria man- 
agement. Many teachers of home economics have been prepared 
within recent years, and there now appears to be a need of providing 
instruction for those who wish to enter other fields of employment 
allied to home economics. One or two universities are offering 
courses in journalism for home economics students. That women 
trained in home economics are needed in the field of journalism is 
most apparent, and many who might have drifted into the profession 
of teaching may now find a much more congenial occupation in 
writing. ; 
The salaries of home economics teachers in colleges and universities 
are excellent, and the maintenance of these departments by the insti- 
tions has been most liberal in the past years. Added teachers, new 
rooms, and new buildings all testify to the encouragement given to 
home economics instruction. 
A few universities have made one year of high-school sewing and 
one year of food preparation prerequisites to the entrance into home 
economics courses. This is a tendency in the right direction, and 
doubtless will be followed by all leading schools within a few years. 
The lifting of the course resulting from a changed entrance require- 
ment will make possible better class work and open up opportunities 
for inserting strong courses in economics, sociology, and political 
science, which are not less important than are well-developed courses 
in chemistry and biology. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In addition to the State normal schools giving courses in home 
economics listed in 1914, courses are also offered in the State normal 
schools at East Radford, Va.; Shepherd College, Shepherdstown, 
W. Va.; Flagstaff, Ariz.; Weatherford, Okla.; Minot, N. Dak.; and 
Oswego, N. Y. This makes a total of 160 Sate normals offering 
courses in home economics. In September, 1914, the new course of
-P-A-G-E-345
  HOME ECONOMICS. 825 
home economics in the State Normal School at Willimantic, Conn., 
began with a good attendance, and interest has grown throughout the 
year. A course of one term in sewing is required of all women 
students. The two years’ normal course is elective. This marks the 
beginning of normal] training for special teachers of home economics 
in the State of Connecticut. 
The normal schools of Alabama are requiring general courses in 
home economics of all students. In the State Normal School at 
Florence, Ala., one term in addition to the general course is devoted 
to normal training. 
In the Temple Normal School of Arizona a special two years’ 
course for the training of teachers is offered. In the Northern Ari- 
zona Normal School at Flagstaff a general course running through 
three years has been established. 
The Arkansas State Normal School requires courses in cooking and — 
sewing in the preparation of all elementary teachers. 
The State Normal School at San Jose, Cal., offers two distinct 
diplomas to the young women who are preparing to become home- 
economics teachers, an elementary and a secondary diploma. For 
the elementary diploma the fundamental courses in cooking, sewing, 
household chemistry, nutrition, household science, laundering, cos- 
tume design, and education are required. For the secondary diploma 
the additional subjects are those which will give a broader viewpoint 
to the future high-school teacher, namely, experimental and institu- 
tional cookery, nutrition, home nursing, house decoration, millinery, 
sewing, textiles, social economics, and education. 
All the normal schools of Maine give enough work in industrial 
education to enable their graduates to teach in elementary and rural 
schools. Only one normal school prepares special teachers. Home- 
economics teaching has received a great impetus during the past few 
years. Probably 80 per cent of the schools of the State are now giv- 
ing some work in home economics. A bulletin on school lunches was 
recently published by the State supervisor. Three of the normal 
schools of Maine are carrying on school luncheons to meet the needs 
of the practice school and to supplement the practical training of the 
normal students. 
The extension department of the State normal school at North 
Adams, Mass., sends out an excellent correspondence course in cook- 
ing and sewing for the use of the rural school teachers. Many of 
the rural teachers are taking advantage of this course. 
The State normal school at Plymouth, N. H., has a very simple and 
inexpensive equipment for use in teaching home economics. It can 
be easily duplicated by a rural school with limited means. At the 
noon hour this equipment is put at the disposal of the students for 
use in the preparation of their lunches, and out of school hours it can
-P-A-G-E-346
  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
be used for other purposes. Thus it serves as a means for furthering 
the use of the school as a social center. 
Three of the five State normals of Illinois are training special 
teachers of home economics for the schools of the State. 
At least 18 normal schools are requiring one or two courses of 
home economics in the training of the rural school teachers. Some 
of these courses are specifically designated as “adapted to the needs 
of the rural school.” As stated in the catalogue of the First District 
Normal School of Missouri, household arts for rural schools is “a 
course presenting simple problems in cookery, sewing, laundering, 
and cleaning that might be taught in a rural school. The prepara- 
tion of noon lunches will be part of the work in this course.” The 
course of household arts has been introduced into the State Normal 
School in Athens, Ga., because of the “ increasing demand for teach- 
ers of domestic science and art and for leaders in canning clubs, sew- 
ing and cooking clubs, and other kinds of community work.” 
At the same time that short courses especially adapted to the needs 
of rural teachers are introduced in many of the normals, at least 
eight normal schools or State colleges for teachers are offering op- 
portunities for advanced study leading to a degree to those who 
enter a four years’ college course, or who add two years to their 
normal training. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
The Bureau of Education received announcements from 192 schools 
that were offering courses in home economics during the summer 
of 1914. In 1915 the number reporting had increased to 230. This 
serves to show the growing effort that is being made to awaken an 
interest in education for the home in the minds of young women 
who have not.the opportunity or the time to pursue courses of study 
during the regular school year. 
Especially commendable are those courses w hich are planned to 
meet the needs of the rural teacher. Several of the normal schools 
and a few of the larger colleges and universities have offered such 
courses during the year 1915. The summer schools have awakened 
to the splendid opportunity they have to help the rural teachers who 
wish or who are required to give courses in home economics. 
Simmons College in Boston, Mass., while offering no specific course 
for rural teachers, included among its course of free lectures during 
the summer term a series covering the following subjects: “The 
demand for rural extension; the qualifications and preparation of 
rural workers; canning clubs; commercial packing; the importance 
of quality and standards; the financial side of canning; the com- 
munity worker and her opportunities.”
-P-A-G-E-347
  - HOME ECONOMICS. 827 
In the summer school at Amherst, Mass., a course of five lectures 
and three demonstrations a week for four weeks was given. The 
course was entitled “ Home Economics for Rural and Small Village 
Schools.” The report of the attendance is interesting: 
There were nine who took the course at Amherst regularly, with three visi- 
tors in attendance at the lectures. All of the nine, with one exception, were 
from very small villages or the country. Six were teachers. The teachers 
would use their special home economics training in connection with their other 
work. All took the course with the idea of making the application wherever 
possible and when opportunity offered. In every recitation the thought was 
kept in mind that young girls were being taught who had not the opportunity 
of specialized training. Suggestions were made along correlation lines. Much 
emphasis was placed on the direct application to home work, so that each girl 
would realize it was a real part of her life, the point being made that all work 
that was accomplished at school should be repeated in the home, and visits 
made to that home by the teacher, to get in touch with the home conditions, 
to stimulate interest on the part of the parents, to encourage the girl to con- 
tinue the work even under adverse circumstances. 
A rural school exhibit, which was prepared by the teachers of the 
department, showing what may be obtained for less than $25, was 
discussed and its use practically demonstrated. 
At Teachers College, Columbia University, New York City, one 
of the courses offered in the summer school was entitled, “ Teaching 
and supervision of household arts in rural schools.” A class of 25 
reported for this work and was made up of those who were interested 
in the consolidated rural high school, in the one-room school and its 
problems, and in the supervision of rural schools, extension work, 
etc. The subjects discussed during the course extended beyond the 
teaching of home economics in the rural school and became a con- 
sideration of household arts for farmers’ wives and daughters, open- 
ing up a splendid field for study and discussion. 
A course entitled “Cooking for Rural Schools” was given -at 
George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tenn., during the 
summer quarter, 1915. The term’s work ran through five and one- 
half weeks, the class meeting five times a week for a period of two 
hours. 
Teachers in rural schools and in consolidated county schools, 
together with young women not yet experienced in teaching, made up 
the class. 
The study covered: 
1. Cooking lessons with simple dishes, using especially those which can or 
should be easily procured in the country. Each lesson included a number of 
different ways of using or preparing the food, as we had time for only one 
lesson on eggs, meats, fruits, etc. The underlying principles of their prepara- 
tion were studied with each. 
2. A brief study of the general principles of teaching, especially as applied 
to household arts.
-P-A-G-E-348
  328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. - 
3. Discussion and application of the subject to rural communities, consider- 
ing (1) means of supplying the materials by (@) donation from family of 
pupils, (6) in part from schools gardens, (¢) bought by money earned by sales, 
or a daily luncheon sold to scholars, (d@) sum supplied by school board, or as- 
sessment; (2) equipment—(qa) use of some home kitchen, (b) portable equip- 
ment for several neighboring schools, (¢c) simple equipments ranging from $5 
to $15 and up; (8) correlation with work in home and school. 
The rural school of activities, conducted in connection with Pea- 
body summer session, offered opportunity for observation. Here the 
class saw lessons in cooking conducted in the ungraded school. 
STATE SUPERVISION. 
Special State supervision of home-economics teaching is reported 
in 15 States. In five States a specially appointed home-economics 
supervisor or specialist has this in charge. In two States the work 
is looked after by the regular high-school inspector, while in one 
State it is in charge of the normal-training inspector. In two States 
the work is in charge of the commissioner or supervisor of vocational 
and industrial education. Four States report that the work is in 
charge of the State superintendent of public instruction without 
reference to the particular system of supervision. 
The State superintendent of public instruction of Arkansas reports 
a supervisor in charge of the home economics of the negro schools of 
16 counties. Sixteen negro county agents work under the supervisor. 
A course of study has been outlined and is followed closely. 
STATE COURSES OF STUDY. 
Twenty-three States report an outline of lessons in home economics 
for use in the State. A State manual of study for the public ele- 
mentary schools of Alabama contains an outline for lessons in cook- 
ing and suggestions for the teaching of sewing in the grades, with 
lists of equipment and references for domestic science teachers in 
the grades. In California each county or city board of education 
prescribes its own course of study in home economics. An outline 
for a course of lessons in home economics has been prepared for the 
common schools of Illinois. This is made use of particularly in the 
rural schools. The domestic science section of the high-school con- 
ference of Illinois has completed its work on a comprehensive cut- 
line for lessons in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, thus 
taking a step in helping to unify the courses offered in home econo- 
mics below the high school, as their work of previous years has 
tended to unify the home-economics courses in the high schools of 
the State. 
The course of study published for the State of Indiana is partic- 
ularly full and complete. It covers three distinct lines of work,
-P-A-G-E-349
  HOME ECONOMICS. 329 
namely, (1) cooking and the study of foods, (2) sewing and the 
study of textiles, and (3) planning, care, furnishing, and upkeep of 
the house. In providing these three lines of work it is the intent of 
the department that the respective county superintendents shall co- 
operate with their teachers in the selection of one line of work to be 
given in the seventh and eighth grades of any particular school, 
township, or county, and this line of work followed throughout the 
year. Lessons are outlined by months and weeks and are issued in 
the form of bimonthly bulletins. 
In Iowa 160 high schools give normal training in home eco- 
nomics. An outline of lessons is provided and a normal-training 
inspector supervises the courses. 
A manual for the normal and industrial training courses in the 
Kansas high schools contains courses of study for both domestic 
science and art that are particularly helpful to the teacher, as equip- 
ment, list of dealers, bibliography, and various suggestions for work 
are given. 
An interesting State course of study for the State elementary 
schools has been issued in Kentucky. The household arts are given 
a place on the program of every one of the eight grades. A plan for 
introducing cooking into country schools is also submitted. 
Louisiana issued an outline on home economics for the public 
schools of the State September, 1914. This outline gives the rules for 
State aid and the organization of the department, outlines the quali- 
fications and duties of the teacher, and a course of study for ap- 
proved departments. The course includes cooking, sewing, and 
household management. A course of study for the four-room schools 
of the State is also given. Equipment, books, bulletins, magazines 
for reference and supplementary reading, and educational exhibits 
are listed. 
Mississippi has a course of study worked out by the State home 
economics association now ready for publication. North Carolina 
reports a course in process of preparation. North Dakota has had 
syllabi of courses in domestic science and art compiled by a special 
committee. The teachers of the State can secure these from the high- 
school examiner. Two courses in both domestic science and art are 
outlined. Five double periods per week for 36 weeks constitute a 
credit. 
Oklahoma has issued a new outline in home economics designed to 
meet the requirements of the rural schools and the schools in villages 
and small towns. The new law which permits the State superin- 
tendent to issue teachers’ certificates to graduates of certain high 
schools requires that these schools maintain departments in home 
economics in order to qualify as normal-training high schools.
-P-A-G-E-350
  330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
A State course of study outlining a course in home economics has 
just been published in Oregon. The South Carolina Home Economics 
Association has been working on plans for home economics courses 
for the schools of the State and is looking forward to securing a 
State supervisor of home economics. 
The course of study for Wisconsin places special emphasis on the 
reporting of home work. A weekly lesson in hygiene is included in 
the home economics outline. Wyoming includes a course in sanita- 
tion in its outline for teaching home economics in the rural schools. 
A course of study for use in the elementary schools of the island 
of Porto Rico has been prepared by the supervisor of home economics 
under the guidance and direction of the Commissioner of Education. 
It has been prepared as a “ working text” for the teachers of home 
economics, and contains recipes, directions for sewing, and lists of 
reference books on both sewing and cooking. Supplementary bulle- 
tins are sent out during the year. Because of the peculiar needs.of 
the homes of the island, the suggestions in the course of study and the 
bulletins are especially helpful to the new teacher unacquainted with 
conditions. They are also designed to aid the Porto Rican teacher — 
who has had but limited training. Interesting reports from the 
students express their appreciation of what they have learned that 
enables them to help their mothers at home, to serve as housekeepers, 
to earn money by sewing, to prepare food for the sick of their 
family, and to distribute their income wisely. 
TEXTBOOKS FOR HOME-ECONOMICS TEACHING. 
In addition to the printed outlines and bulletins on home economics 
subjects published by the departments of education or the State insti- 
tutions of the various States, there has been an increase in the 
number of helpful textbooks prepared for use in home-economics 
teaching. At the present time the market can supply very satisfac- 
tory textbooks for the study of foods (their history, kinds, manufac- 
ture, chemistry, cooking, and serving), sewing, dressmaking, textiles, 
household physics, home sanitation, care of the house, house fur- 
nishing, and laundering. The use of prepared outlines and texts 
tends toward improved conditions for teaching and the abolition of 
the tedious method of note-taking that obtained in the early days 
of home-economics courses from the university down through the 
common schools. 
HOME ECONOMICS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The teaching of home economics in public schools has extended 
so rapidly that it has become necessary to have special supervisors 
in cities to superintend this type of instruction. An approved method
-P-A-G-E-351
  HOME ECONOMICS. _ 831 
of supervision is one in which one supervisor has the responsibility 
of all home-economics instruction in the grades and also in the high 
schools, and if the size of the city makes it necessary, special assistant 
supervisors are delegated to superintend different phases of the work, 
such as sewing, cooking, and housekeeping. When such supervision 
does not exist the quality of the work varies directly with the personal 
qualifications of the individual.teacher and no uniformity can be 
expected. A smoother working organization is attained if one super- 
visor has charge over all phases of home-economics instruction. 
In large cities with a mixed population, it does not seem to be 
desirable that all students receive exactly the same lessons. The 
effort to adjust home-economics instruction to the actual needs of 
the particular student or group of students is marked. 
An interesting venture in home education for girls of secondary- 
school grade was established in San Francisco during the year under 
the name of the Lux School. The preparation for home making 
dominates all work given in the Lux School. The school is limited 
to 250 students. Instruction is given in housekeeping, food prepa- 
ration, sewing, laundering, English, art, mathematics, and history. 
This school is a vocational school where home making is the vocation 
for which the students are prepared. It is just as free as any city 
public school and is open to students from San Francisco and near-by 
cities. é 
Food preparation was introduced for the first time in the Port. 
land (Oreg.) grammar schools in the fall of 1914. Several experi- 
ments in methods of teaching this subject and also that of house- 
wifery were started. One of these is known as the Vernon Home. 
The Vernon Home for home economics teaching is a residence of 
about the type used in the community. It is furnished inexpensively, 
and the selection of furniture and other household equipment af- 
forded unusual opportunities for practical lessons. The care of the 
home from cellar to attic has rested upon the students. Daily 
luncheons are served, food is prepared for sale, and the care of a 
small garden is an aid in teaching thrift. 
The Minneapolis new trade school for girls started in February, 
1915. One-half day is spent in trade’and one-half day in academic 
work. <A store is maintained, which disposes of the sewing, milli- 
nery, and some of the food products. A course in salesmanship is 
taught and the store becomes a practice place. The school maintains 
a cafeteria, and the classes have special training in this work. Meals 
are served, special dinners are planned and served either in the school 
or at private residences, and food is cooked in quantity upon special 
orders. A tea room, also, is operated by the girls. Besides the 
special courses in sewing, millinery, salesmanship, and cafeteria 
management, there is a general course in home making.- All except

the latter are expected to prepare the students for wage-earning posi- 
tions. These students are selected by the principals in the different 
parts of the city according to their need for this type of work and 
may come in at the request of the parents. The school owns a small 
store with rooms above and these rooms are to be converted next year 
into an apartment. General housekeeping: will be taught in these 
rooms and one will be equipped for a day nursery, that the care of 
children may be a part of the training. 
Significant of the progress of home economics as a recognized voca- 
tional subject. is the report from Pennsylvania. The bureau of voca- 
tional education in Pennsylvania has adopted the policy of preparing 
“the girl for the activities of the home on a sound pedagogic and eco- 
nomic principle,” and because the endeavor is made to adapt the 
school to the community, several types of work have been developed. 
The three all-day household-arts schools or departments and eight 
evening household-arts schools that had been established prior to 
July 6, 1914, have been increased to four all-day household-arts 
schools or departments, 14 evening household-arts schools, and three 
continuation household-arts classes. The last-named was a new type 
of household-arts school for adults developed during the year. An- 
other interesting feature of the work was the employment by the 
mining institutes of Nanticoke of a supervisor to visit homes and 
render assistance to housewives. 
In Altoona over 500 girls were enrolled in the dressmaking and 
millinery courses, and the entire Central Grammar School was given 
over to the work. More applied for cooking than could be accommo- 
dated. There were 12 teachers in charge. The teaching force was 
recruited from teachers employed during the day and practical seam- 
stresses, milliners, and shopmen (for the boys) resident in Altoona. 
The expense of installation of a new equipment in the high school 
at Middlebury, Vt., was reduced by the practical lessons in house- 
wifery given the girls. The work included the finishing of the 
wooden tops and sides of the desks and cupboards with a stain and 
enameling the gas pipes. 
USE OF APARTMENTS OR HOUSES IN PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHING. 
The increasing use of a house or apartment for teaching practical 
home-making is emphasized in the many reports reaching the bureau. 
To make the conditions under which home economics instruction is 
given as nearly like the conditions ideal for a home as possible is the 
dominating motive in these departments. It marks a new spirit in 
teaching and one that promises to be of inestimable value to the 
future homes in these communities.

In Erie a residence was remodeled for the use of the household- 
arts department. The kitchen, sewing room, and laundry were lo- 
cated on the first floor, and on the second are rooms that are to be 
used for housekeeping purposes. The old Erie Academy was used as 
a center for industrial and household-arts work, with shops on the 
first floor, cooking department on the second, and sewing and draw- 
ing on the third. 
One double period of housekeeping is required of every fourth- 
grade girl in the “neighborhood schools” of Los Angeles, and of 
every fifth-grade girl in the ordinary schools. This housekeeping 
consists of the care of a house when a cottage is connected with the 
schools, the washing of windows, cleaning floors, making beds, and 
cleaning woodwork; caring for household linen, i. e., laundering; and 
similar tasks. Where no dwelling is supplied certain rooms are 
cared for in the regular buildings. These may be the cooking-class 
room, the small diningroom, and the principal’s office. 
In the Borough of the Bronx, New York City, Public School No. 4 
is making use of a small flat or model apartment for the teaching of 
realistic home making to girls who have finished the seventh and 
eighth grades in school. This is a new venture in New York City 
public-school work. 
In Washington, D. C., classrooms have been divided by partial 
partitions and “apartments” made for practice housekeeping, and 
in these small rooms the girls will cook and sew and carry on all 
household operations. 
Lyndon Institute, Lyndon Center, Vt., offers a special one-year 
course in home economies designed chiefly as a preparation for home 
making. It is open to girls having one year of work beyond grammar 
school. Lessons are given in cooking, sewing, laundering, home 
nursing, and housewifery, One term each of household chemistry 
and English are included in the course. The students taking the 
course have full charge of the work in the “ Home Cottage” in which 
they live. This work is under the direct supervision of two in- 
structors. 
A teachers’ cottage is used for the lessons in housewifery in the 
State Normal School at Keene, N. H. 
In the prevocational school of New Britain, Conn., seventh and 
eighth grade girls are given a practical arts course designed to pre- 
pare them for the duties of home making and housekeeping and at 
the same time to prepare them for the home-making course or the 
trade course in the vocational high school. A suite of model living 
rooms is maintained as an object lesson in furnishing and care.

CAFETERIAS AS PRACTICE PLACES FOR HOME ECONOMICS TEACHING. 
There is a growing tendency to place the cafeterias in public schools 
under the direction of the home economics supervisor and use these 
as part of the equipment for practical food studies. There has been 
a discontent among teachers of food preparation with the small- 
quantity cookery, yet larger quantities could not be used because of 
the excessive cost incurred. The cafeteria and the noon lunch for 
teachers make possible the handling of foods in quantities, and by 
these means speed and efficiency may be acquired by the students. 
All cafeterias in the schools of Tacoma, Wash., are in charge of the 
home economics supervisor, and in these cafeterias every third-term 
high-school girl has three weeks of practice in large-quantity cook- 
ery. Each girl also has three weeks’ experience in preparing noon 
lunches for the teachers, 
Quantity cooking is taught in the eighth grade of the Los Angeles 
schools. After five months of practice three girls take in charge the 
luncheon for six teachers. They prepare these repeatedly until they 
become expert; the price of the luncheon must not exceed 15 cents. 
The rest of the class prepare and serve cafeteria foods in quantities 
for from 20 to 70 persons. 
Oakland, Cal., school cafeterias are under the direction of the home 
economics supervisor, but not connected with domestic science class 
work. It is expected that they will articulate later. 
In Philadelphia the board of education has recently made provi- 
sion to try out a plan to establish lunch rooms that are to. be self- 
supporting in not to exceed 25 elementary schools. This action has 
taken place in response to recommendations made by the school-lunch 
committee of the Home and School League. As a result of work 
begun five years ago the Home and School League has been carrying 
on penny lunches in nine elementary schools. In addition to the 
recess lunches, noon lunches costing 3 and 5 cents and a 9.30 breakfast 
have been served in some of the schools. The cost per child of these 
lunches had decreased from 2.46 cents per child in 1912-13 to less 
than 1 cent per child in 1914-15, 
While the penny lunch in Philadelphia has not been connected 
with the home-economics department in the public schools, those in 
charge of the work have given it careful supervision to insure its 
educational value by giving children the right ideas about food and 
its care. In a majority of the schools the cooperation of the school 
has been sought by securing a teacher to aid in the supervision of the 
work and children to help in selling the foods. 
Home-economics students in the normal department of Drexel In- 
stitute have worked out food value of recipes for the penny lunch. as 
part of their prescribed work and, along with students of the house- 
 
-P-A-G-E-355

keepers’ section, have done volunteer work in the schools. This has 
‘been counted as regular practice field work in the course. The chem- 
istry department of the institute has cooperated by making analysis 
of the lunch products. 
An intensely interesting part of the work in the Lucy Flower 
School of Chicago is that which is done in connection with the cafe- 
teria and adjoining lunch room. The cafeteria is operated by a 
group of girls who purchase the materials, plan and oversee the 
preparation and service of the food, and keep all records connected 
with this service. At the end of the term the operations must show 
a slight profit; this profit is then invested in some labor-saving device 
for the kitchen. The girl in charge for a certain week purchases all 
materials in the market in whatever part of town she wishes to trade. 
This experience in marketing is of great value. A second lunch 
_room is maintained for the children of the seventh and eighth 
grades, and here also the responsibility rests upon one of the girls 
in training. 
In December, 1914, a term in school-lunch preparation was intro- 
duced into the senior year of the high-school home economics course 
in the training school of the Illinois State Normal University at 
Normal, Ill. A class of seven girls, in charge of two student teachers, 
prepared a lunch daily for from 60 to 90 people. The lesson period 
covered an hour and three-quarters, at the end of which time the 
lunch was served in cafeteria style. The work of washing dishes 
was taken care of by students who were paid by the hour, but all 
of the preliminary work of planning, cooking, and serving was taken 
care of by the members of the class. 
THE RURAL SCHOOL. 
Methods of teaching home economics in the rural schools have 
been receiving more attention than formerly. The State courses 
of study have covered this problem in some cases. In many States 
separate bulletins on the question of home economics in the rural 
school have been issued by other agencies, i. e., the State agricul- 
tural college, the State normal school, or the State university. 
Examples of excellent correspondence courses on detailed lessons 
are those that have been issued by the University of Minnesota, the 
University of West Virginia, and the State Normal School at North 
Adams, Mass. 
Alabama reports that home economics occurs daily throughout the 
week on the programs of the teachers’ institutes held during the sum- 
mer in every county. The manual for county institute instructors 
contains a series of four lessons outlining work in foods, cookery, 
canning, and sewing that could be used in the rural schools. 
   
-P-A-G-E-356
    336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Iowa is meeting the situation by inaugurating a correspondence 
course for rural teachers. Indiana held summer schools at various 
colleges and universities in order that rural teachers should be pre- 
pared for the work. 
Kansas State Agricultural College has arranged to give a course 
for rural teachers at teachers’ institutes desiring such work. Five 
lectures are to be provided to give instruction in the preparation 
and serving of hot lunches, elementary cooking, and sewing. 
In Webster County, Ky., an experiment is being tried to solve the 
difficult problem of teaching domestic science in rural schools that 
are without trained teachers. A wagon containing a complete 
kitchen and dining room outfit has been built and equipped to travel 
from school to school. An expert teacher is in charge to give les- 
sons and lectures to the pupils and their mothers and older sisters. 
Twelve schools were visited during the spring, the wagon remaining 
from one to three weeks at each school. 
In Georgia an extension worker has been employed to visit the 
rural schools for the purpose of helping to install home economics 
courses, to aid in the introduction of a hot dish for lunch, to organize 
mothers’ clubs, to teach home economics at county institutes, and to 
conduct work of any sort that may lead to community betterment. 
There is an apparent desire among teachers of home economics to 
establish closer relationships with the pupils’ homes. Realizing that 
without a knowledge of home conditions they can not best serve 
their community, they are taking various means of acquiring this 
knowledge. One common and easy method is that of inviting the 
mothers to luncheons prepared by the girls, and another is by offer- 
ing special courses for the mothers. 
Home and school cooperation has been established by unusual 
methods in Seattle, Wash. Every girl is entered in a contest which 
extends through many weeks. Her work is done at home, and all 
honors gained belong to the school, not to her. As a result of this 
work, 6,000 garments were made by the girls of the eighth grade 
and 50,000 loaves of bread were baked during the month of April. 
Of more value than the garments or the loaves was the interest 
aroused in the children and their school work throughout the city. 
RURAL SCHOOL LUNCHEONS AND LESSONS IN FOOD PREPARATION. 
One of the most effective methods of instructing in food prepara- 
tion in rural schools is by means of a hot noonday lunch. Little 
equipment is needed; most of the practice and instruction may be 
given during the morning recess period; the necessary cleaning up 
can be done at noon, and the lunch itself is not only good for the chil- 
dren but aids in training in courtesy and good manners.
-P-A-G-E-357
  
HOME ECONOMICS. 837 
This noonday lunch was prepared and served by some country 
teachers as long ago as 1880, but only recently has its possibilities 
been realized. In district No. 65, Texas Ridge, Idaho, a rural teacher 
converted a square tin oil can into a stovepipe oven, and with this 
and the flat top of the heating stove succeeded in preparing and serv- 
ing hot lunches for the small school. In another district the teacher’s 
desk became the cooking table, and the dish washing was done on 
the tops of the school desks, while in yet another rural school in 
Idaho. a small addition to the schoolhouse was built. In this was 
placed an oil stove, and planks upon a rough frame became the 
kitchen table. 
Sewing has been taught at recess and noontime in one Oregon 
school, and the children went to the home of the teacher for instruc- 
tion in the use of the machine. 
The teachers’ houses which are being provided in many regions 
of Tennessee and of the State of Washington offer further possibili- 
ties for practical teaching of home economics in the rural schools. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS AND HOME ECONOMICS FOR ADULT WOMEN. 
As a result of the summer schools held in Pennsylvania for the 
training of teachers for continuation schools, the director of indus- 
trial education concludes that the summer schools should be con- 
tinued, and that the scope should be extended to include professional 
work for manual-training and domestic-science teachers. 
Pittsburgh, Pa., started a course of training for housemaids in 
July. This is directed by the supervisor of home economics in the 
public schools and of the nature of a continuation school. 
Brazil, Ind., “ dedicated its new home-making school in September, 
1914. This consists of a 10-room house especially fitted up for the 
vocational home-making work.” 
Worcester (Mass.) Trade School inaugurated a course in cooking 
in 1914. This is distinctly a trade course and does not displace the 
three-hour course in food preparation which had been required as a 
part of the general training for all girls. : 
Kenosha, Wis., has a most successful continuation school where 
all working girls under 16 years of age are required to attend one- 
half day each week. The instruction consists of the most practical 
lessons in cooking and sewing and in the service of meals. 
During. the past summer classes in vocational training for girls just 
out of the grammar school have been carried on at the Elizabeth 
Peabody House, Boston, under the direction of the woman’s depart- 
ment of the New England section of the National Civic Federation. 
The training consisted of household and laundry work, cleaning, 
cooking, sewing and mending, chamber work, the preparation and

serving of meals, color and design, and business ethics. The com- 
mittee reports that nearly all the girls in the various classes are 
going back to school in September, some to the high school and 
others to trade schools, where they may be fitted for specific lines of 
work. 
Nasson Institute, located at Springvale, Me., is a vocational school 
for young women offering to high-school graduates a full 2-year 
program in home economics or secretarial studies. It has just com- 
pleted its fourth year of work, and statistics show a steady increase 
in its attendance. The home-economics course is planned with spe- 
cial reference to the needs of high-school graduates who wish to un- 
dertake the teaching of cooking and sewing in public schools, or to 
intelligently plan their own homes. The course is also regarded as 
preliminary training for those who wish to enter hospitals, lunch 
rooms, tea rooms, and related lines of work. The technical work in- 
cludes courses in cooking, sewing, household administration, and 
household science. Certain academic subjects, as English, hygiene, 
history, education, and art, are also included in the course. High 
standards are maintained in the execution of the technical work. 
In Ellsworth, Pa., a continuation school has been conducted for 
foreign mothers, and weekly instruction has been given in English, 
cooking, sewing, and care of infants. 
Indiana State University offered a special teacher’s training 
course, beginning July 5, 1915, for women cooks, milliners, and 
dressmakers. Through the courtesy of the Indianapolis public 
schools, rooms and equipment were made available at the Short- 
ridge High School, the work being given in Indianapolis in order 
to place the opportunity within the reach of as large a group of 
trade workers as possible. The class met for 3-hour sessions daily, 
five days per week for two weeks. The work included a limited 
amount of attention to practical activities; methods of organizing 
and presenting teaching material; methods of handling administra- 
tive details; demonstration lessons, criticism, discussion. "The course 
formed a part of the general program for vocationai education, be- 
ing developed by Prof. Robert J. Leonard, head of the department 
of industrial education of the university faculty. 
Kansas City, Mo., enrolled in the Hamilton Vacation School 50 
girls and women in classes in sewing. This was the first time the 
work was offered and was under the direction of the instructor of 
domestic science. 
The following report tells of the work that has been done in the 
evening schools in Rochester, N. Y.: 
During the past year the enrollment in the home-economics courses was 1,825. 
We are also conducting afternoon health courses. These “Live a Little 
Longer ” health courses, as they are called, have been given in five different 
schools. The enrollment for this year was 112 and the average attendance 94.
-P-A-G-E-359
HOME ECONOMICS. 339 
We also have continuation agreements with some of the factories by which 
girls who are under 16 and who are employed are required to attend school the 
forenoons of every other week for instruction in the household arts. Thirty 
of these girls have been placed with the German American Button Co. 
Adult education in home economics is being encouraged in many 
ways in the State of California and especially in Los Angeles. A 
unique method of instructing is practiced in several schools of this 
latter city. Many poor mothers have inadequate laundry facilities 
in their own homes; so the laundry equipment at the school is placed 
at their disposal. When they accept this offer they obligate them- 
selves to do the work in the manner taught. The Lux School in San 
Francisco uses one-half of its large income in the maintenance of 
night schools and afternoon settlement classes. 
In Portland, Oreg., 175 women enrolled in night classes the fall 
semester of 1914, and 75 others entered classes at mid year. After- 
noon classes have proved most satisfactory in this city and are 
managed without fees. These classes are organized for courses of 
10 lessons on some particular food problem, and each series of lessons 
is complete in itself. In some instances the women bring the materi- 
als; in others the school furnishes the materials and the women pur- 
chase the articles after cooking. The recipes are prepared in family 
size and contribute to the actual meal at home, at the same time form- 
ing the basis of the lesson. 
Many of the cotton mills of the South employ women to visit the 
homes of their employees and give instruction in food preparation, 
sanitation, and general housekeeping. The mill owners find that 
workmen from good homes render better service, with fewer days of 
illness, than those who come from ill-kept and insanitary houses. 
The Iowa agricultural college maintains a course in home making 
for women who can not enter regular collegiate classes. In a similar 
course in the University of Minnesota 300 were enrolled in the winter 
of 1914-15; while 170 women, all over 20 years of age, attended a 
home-making one-year course in the Kansas agricultural college. 
Similar courses are meeting with favor in North Dakota and Oregon. 
A particularly interesting piece of work for adult women was done 
in West Virginia. The teacher in home economics reports her work 
as follows: 
Harly in the fall term I succeeded in finding three groups of women who were 
interested in the work I wished to give them. Two of the groups were at 
points so situated that they could be visited on the same day, thus making it 
possible for me to meet a group at one point at 10 in the morning and at the 
other point at 2 in the afternoon. I visited these points every two weeks, going 
to the third point on the intervening Friday. For the spring term two new 
points have been selected, and work is given there every Thursday afternoon 
and every Friday of each week. This was necessary in order to give the women _ 
the course of 11 lessons I had planned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
At one of the points visited during the fall and winter terms, the club met on 
the Fridays intervening between my visits to them. They emphasized the social 
side then and discussed various topics. A few I now recall are: ‘“ Some places 
where one could buy cheapest,” “An exchange of ideas in Christmas gift mak- 
ing.” One day all had their knitting or crocheting, and those who did not know 
how were supposed to learn that day. On another day each woman had to tell 
how she used up left-over material, and I suppose my work came in for its 
share of discussion. On these days light refreshments were served by the lady 
entertaining. 
To meet the women in their homes makes the work very informal, and I felt 
I got better acquainted with the women in this way. Then, too, it meets a 
social need in the rural community which can not be found in the hall or public- 
school building. 
This movement for instituting classes for women is becoming gen- 
eral. At the present time a majority of the towns in which home 
economics is taught in the schools offer opportunities to women for 
the study of food problems. 
The operation of the Smith-Lever law has brought home-economics 
instruction within the reach of most rural women either by corre- 
spondence or by short courses. The act has made possible the pro- 
viding of much valuable material for free distribution. 
Boys and men are being given courses in camp cookery in public 
schools and in colleges. The instruction does not end with mere 
recipes and directions. Food talks lead to others on camp sanitation, 
and these are but the entering wedges for further instruction in home 
betterment and improved conditions of living. In a Minneapolis 
grammar school 100 boys have attended food-preparation classes 
throughout the winter, while in many other cities special classes have 
been organized for the Boy Scouts. 
In the Oregon Agricultural College all men in forestry and agri- 
culture may and do elect camp cookery, which carries with it one 
college credit. Laboratory instruction and practice is first given, 
and afterwards the work is done in the open, and camp sanitation 
and fire building are taught. Lectures on food values are given 
throughout the course. 
HOME-ECONOMICS EDUCATION FOR COLORED STUDENTS. 
In 18 land-grant colleges for colored students either cooking or 
sewing is taught. Usually the equipment is good and instruction 
quite up to the average of such teaching. If the instruction in food 
preparation could be given under more nearly ideal home conditions, 
the benefit would be much greater. At present the laboratories are 
so entirely different, in every respect, from the kitchens with which 
the students are familiar that it is difficult for the students to apply 
the methods learned. 
In some cases the food-preparation lessons do not tend to improve 
the food conditions in the dormitory. This criticism can be made   
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  HOME ECONOMICS. 841 
concerning food service in many other schools besides those for the 
colored and is one that should not be merited. The real test of the 
efficiency of home-economics instruction is the effect that such teach- 
ing has upon the personal character and home life of the pupil. 
Sewing is often better taught in colored schools than is food prepa- 
ration. This is in part due to the fact that the making of garments 
appeals to the natural craving of the student for improved personal 
appearance, and partly because many colored schools have little 
money for teaching and must of necessity limit their lines of instruc- 
tion. In some of the stronger schools for the colored youth the 
instruction in food preparation is both thorough and practical, and 
the dormitories are used as practice houses in lessons for good house- 
keeping. 
Home economics often appears in the programs of denominational 
schools for the colored, but sometimes when there is but a limited 
fund for the employment of teachers this type of instruction is sac- 
rificed for Greek or Latin.’ There is a great need for colored teachers 
who are trained in home economics and who also thoroughly under- 
stand the home life of the rural Negro of the Southern States and 
are willing to teach these subjects in a practical and effective manner. 
LAWS AFFECTING HOME-ECONOMICS INSTRUCTION, 
The operation of the Smith-Lever law has greatly affected instruc- 
tion in home economics for adults and for girls in rural districts. 
It has also created a demand for well-trained home-economics teach- 
ers of a somewhat different type than that demanded for public- 
school positions. There is a need for courses in colleges arranged 
with especial reference to the peeuer qualifications requisite for 
extension teaching. 
The possibility of the passage of the Smith-Hughes bill has created 
much discussion among teachers and those interested in home eco- 
nomics, and, with few exceptions, the passage of such a measure is 
anticipated with approval. The greatest problems that have arisen 
concerning the teaching of home economics have been those resulting 
from laws which made the teaching of domestic science obligatory 
in the seventh and eigth grades of all schools in the State. As inter- 
preted this law in Indiana necessitated teaching some phase of home 
economics in every one of 6,000 one-room schools. The instruction 
must of necessity be given by 6,000 teachers almost wholly unac- 
quainted with the subject. To give these teachers the requisite in- 
formation is one of the insistent demands now being made upon 
departments of home economics in normals, colleges, and universities. 
Idaho requires that home economics be taught in all rural high 
schools, and four such schools have already complied with this law.  
-P-A-G-E-362
  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Louisiana grants $400 State aid annually to each approved depart- 
ment of home economics. Not less than $100 of this money must be 
expended for supplies, and the home-economics library must be in- 
creased by the purchase of $15 worth of books each year. 
California enacted a law at the last session of the legislature 
authorizing the employment of “home teachers” not exceeding 1 
for every 500 students in daily attendance at school. Among other 
duties devolving upon this home teacher will be “to instruct in the 
sanitation, purchase, preparation, and use of food and clothing.” 
California changed the mode of certification of teachers of home 
economics. Such authority is now vested in a State board connected 
with the office of State superintendent of schools. 
Nebraska enacted a law providing for a two-years’ course in home 
economics in the State normal schools, this course to be arranged 
with special reference to the needs of rural teachers. 
HOME-ECONOMICS ASSOCIATIONS, 
State associations of home-economics teachers are reported in 18 
States. Most of these are independent organizations. A few are 
sectional divisions of larger State teachers’ associations. A tendency 
to direct attention to specific problems is apparent in the programs 
of the associations. In many States the associations have already 
established their places as educational factors. The formation of 
each new State association may be interpreted as the result of a 
wide-awake interest in the State and a desire on the part of home- 
economics teachers to unite in an effort to secure better conditions in 
the schools. 
A home economics section has been organized in the Central As- 
sociation of Science and Mathematics Teachers, and held its first 
meeting November 27 in Chicago, with an attendance of 200. Dis- 
cussion of subject matter to be included in home economics courses 
and methods of teaching occupied the time of the two sessions. Ex- 
hibits of interest had been installed by the local committee. 
The seventh annual meeting of the American Association of Home 
Economics held in Cleveland June 30 to July 3, 1914, was marked 
by the adoption of a new constitution and the appointment of a paid 
secretary. Three meetings for the summer of 1915 were held, as 
follows: The institution economics section at Lake Placid in June; 
the annual meeting of the association at the University of Seattle in 
Washington, August 18-21; and a second meeting in connection with 
the National Education Association a week later. During the winter 
and early spring of 1915 the executive secretary of the association 
made a three months’ trip, covering nearly 10,000 miles and visiting 
40 schools in 17 States. Lectures and demonstrations formed the 
chief features of her visit.

HOME ECONOMICS. 843 
TENDENCIES AND DEVELOPMENTS IN HOME ECONOMICS. 
With the more adequate instruction now being administered in 
high schools, most young women entering college have had an oppor- 
tunity to pursue one or more courses in home economics. Some spe- 
cial provision has had to be made for these students. In many insti- 
tutions the high-school training has exempted them from certain 
college work; in other schools the courses carried in high school were 
ignored, and those who had studied home economics began all over 
again with those who had received no training. Neither of these 
arrangements has proved satisfactory. If high-school work may be 
substituted for college work then the college work is not above high- 
school grade. This is too often true. On the other hand, if the girl 
who has had training is no better prepared than the one who has not 
studied home economics in the high school, then the high-school 
work is valueless, and the colleges and universities where the high- 
school teachers have been trained have failed in the preparation 
given these teachers. Therefore there is a decided movement favor- 
ing the establishment of certain high-school courses in home econom- 
ics as prerequisites for college credit in that subject. 
The use of the cottage or apartment as a place for teaching home 
economics is generally approved and the question of initial expense is 
the chief retarding factor to the extension of this type of equipment. 
Many normal schools are requiring a minimum course of home 
economics for all students because of the rapid growth of this sub- 
ject in the rural-school programs. 
The penny lunch for children in the poorer city districts, the hot 
lunch for rural schools, the cafeteria for high-school students, and the 
teachers’ luncheons are all being used as means of teaching more 
eflicient food preparation. 
The development of trade courses in the industries allied to those 
.of the home has been rapid, and the paralleling of these courses with 
those of home making, in order that the wage-earning woman may 
be able also to administer her own household, is of particular interest. 
In colleges and universities more encouragement is now given to 
the young woman who wishes preparation in wage-earning occupa- 
tions other than that of teaching, with the result that courses are 
offered in tea-room management, cafeteria management, hospital 
dietetics, and institutional management. 
_ A better class of popular material on home-economics subjects will 
be available for magazines and newspapers with the further develop- 
ment of courses in journalism for students in home-economics depart- 
ments. 
The cooperation of the National Federation of Women’s Clubs and 
similar organizations in progressive movements for education for the 
home gives assurance of continued encouragement and support.

CHAPTER XITI. 
EDUCATION FOR SOCIAL WORK. 
By Epirn Axsort, of Hull House, Chicago, 
Associate Director of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy. 
The most recently organized professional schools are those that 
prepare for what is somewhat vaguely called “social work.” No 
attempt will be made here to enter upon a discussion of the vexed 
that prepare for what is somewhat vaguely called “social work.” 
No attempt will be made here to enter upon a discussion of the vexed 
question of whether or not “social work” is a profession.2 The 
schools of philanthropy are organized on the assumption that social 
work is a profession for which the necessary training can best be 
given in a specially organized school of professional character. 
Social workers, however, have pointed out that the organization of 
professional schools is an almost necessary factor in determining the 
professional character of their work. Thus, in 1897, Miss Mary E. 
Richmond said, in urging upon the National Conference of Charities 
and Correction the establishment of a “ Training School in Applied 
Philanthropy”: “Some will think that a training school is imprac- 
ticable until we have acquired a professional standard. Others will 
think that we can never acquire a professional standard until we 
have the school. The latter is my own view.”*® And, more recently, 
at the National Conference of Charities, which met in Baltimore in 
May, 1915, the report of the chairman of the committee on education 
for social work contained the following significant statement: 
No organized activity can claim professional standing until it rests upon 
scientific knowledge and has developed definite methods of using that knowledge 
to reach its goal. When technical processes within a profession have become 
established, those who seek to enter it must not only work toward its particular 
goal of achievement; they must master these processes first. These processes 
change continually in any profession. The treatment of the sick to-day in many 
  
1In the preparation of this report the author is indebted to an unpublished report on 
the organization of professional schools for training social workers, prepared for a com- 
mittee of the trustees of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy by Dr. Sophonisba 
P. Breckinridge, dean of the school. 
2A most important discussion of this subject will be found in the forthcoming report of 
the Baltimore sessions of the National Conference of Charities and Correction. The report 
will include papers by Mr. Porter Lee, of the New York School of Philanthropy, chair- 
man of the conference committee on education for social work, and by Mr. Abraham Flex- 
ner, of New York, and Prof. Felix Frankfurter, of the Harvard Law School.

respects has little in common with the treatment of 100 years ago. From day to 
day and from year to year, however, the change is slight, and it is through the 
mastery of established processes first that the development of new processes be- 
comes possible. In other words the technical skill of the practitioner, as Dr. 
Flexner has pointed out, is one of the bases of any profession. 
The committee respectfully suggests that the development of training methods 
which will give it this technical basis is the chief problem facing social work. 
This report is designed to emphasize the importance of this technical basis and 
to indicate iis nature.' 
An account of recent progress in the training of social workers 
means in effect an account of the history of the professional training 
schools for social workers in this country, since the oldest of these 
schools has a history of little more than a decade. This is not because 
social work, or social service, has been recently developed. Social 
work is new only in its professional aspects. Agencies, public and 
private, for the service of the destitute go back many hundred years 
in the history of England, and in this country they are as old as the 
colonies that were planted by Englishmen on the New England coast. 
But in the last decade of the nineteenth century the great increase in 
the number of permanent salaried positions in social work for prop- 
erly qualified young men and women has given to such service a pro- 
fessional character that was lacking in the old days of more or less 
casual volunteer work. With the multiplication of agencies to serve 
the dependent groups in the community, the destitute, unemployed, 
sick, aged, the various groups mentally and physically defective, 
and with the increase in the number of organizations designed to pro- 
mote social and civic reforms there has come a pressing demand for 
persons properly equipped to carry on this work. 
As social work came to be regarded as a profession, a discussion of 
the best methods of preparing those who were about to enter it be- 
came inevitable. It is interesting that the idea of special schools 
for training social workers came not from members of the educa- 
tional group, but from intelligent and far-seeing persons already 
engaged in work in the social field. As early as 1893 a special sec- 
tion of the International Congress of Charities, which met in Chicago 
during the World’s Fair, was devoted to the subject of instruction

Attention should also be called to the following statement from the last yearbook of 
the New York School of Philanthropy : 
“ Within recent years social work has come to be a profession, in the sense of an occu- 
pation, with certain standards, requirements, technique, history—even certain traditions 
and ethics—and one in which a well-prepared person may earn a livelihood. 
“The profession of social work has a history; it has certain standards, requirements, 
and technique, and it has certain traditions and ethics. Its history has yet to be ade- 
quately recorded ; its standards and requirements are constantly advancing and expand- 
ing; its technique has been formulated at only a few points; its traditions are largely 
neglected, and its ethics unconscious. In other words, it is a profession still in the 
making, with stimulating possibilities. At the same time there is a background of 
experience, a foundation of thoughtful observation and painstaking practice, from which 
to go forward.”
-P-A-G-E-367
  EDUCATION FOR SOCIAL WORK. 847 
in “social science.”? At this meeting, in a most significant paper on 
“The Need of Training Schools for a New Profession,” Miss Dawes, 
of Massachusetts, explained the fact that the difficulty of securing 
trained workers was a “ difficulty inseparable from the growth and 
extension of the method of scientific charity,” and she pointed out 
the need of a new course of study “in some established institution 
or in an institution by itself or by the old-fashioned method never 
yet improved upon for actual development, the method of experi- 
mental training as the personal assistant of some skilled worker,” 
in which it should be possible for those who wished to take up 
charitable work “to find some place of studying it as a profession.” 
It is important to note that Miss Dawes did not have in mind merely 
training by means of study classes and lecture courses; she pointed 
out that “some more immediately practical experience of the work 
likely to be required should also be given, some laboratory practice 
in the science of charity, if we may so speak.” Reference has already 
been made to the more definite statement of the pressing need of 
such schools made in 1897 by Miss Mary E. Richmond, the present 
director of the charity organization department of the Russell Sage 
Foundation, in a paper read at the National Conference of Charities 
and Correction, which met that year in Toronto. 
In the following year the first venture in the new field was made. 
In the summer of 1898 a training class was organized by the New 
York Charity Organization Society, which became, in 1901, the Sum- 
mer School for Philanthropic Workers and, in 1904, the New York 
School of Philanthropy. Thus the first suggestion of such a school 
came not from the colleges or universities, but from the members of 
the International and the National Conference of Charities, and the 
first professional classes were organized, not by an educational in- 
stitution, but by the directors and staff of a private charitable agency. 
It has seemed worth while to emphasize the fact that, whatever the 
future relations between the professional schools of philanthropy and 
the universities may be, the schools owe their existence to the scientific 
interest of the social workers in their own profession and the schools 
were really organized to meet the needs of the social field by the 
active workers in the field, who knew the urgency of its demands. 
A valuable account of these first suggestions and experiments that 
led the way toward the establishment of training schools for the new 
profession was prepared in 1903 by Dr. Jeffrey R. Brackett for his 
little book on “Supervision and Education in Charity.” Two ad- 
mirable chapters of this book? deal not only with the work done by

for Work.” Dr. Brackett was president of the department of charities and correction of 
Baltimore, and became the first director of the Boston School for Social Workers.

colleges and universities in the organization of courses covering the 
field of charities and correction, but also with the work done by the 
social agencies themselves in training their new workers and the 
initial purposes and experiments of the pioneer school. The Boston 
Associated Charities, for example, under the leadership of Miss 
Zilpha D. Smith, who became associate director of the Boston School 
for Social Workers upon its organization, had established the “ re- 
quirement of a certain period of instruction and training by the 
general secretary and an experienced agent” for those who wished 
positions with the organization.t 
Before the organization of the professional school the social worker 
was either trained through the system of apprenticeship alone or he 
Jearned from his own mistakes. Thus the training of social workers 
resembled the early methods of education in the older professions of 
law and medicine. Like social workers, “ doctors,” we are told, “have 
after a fashion been made by experience, i. e., their patients paid the 
price.” Mr. Abraham Flexner shudders at the cost of early medical 
education, for, he says: “'The early patients of the rapidly made doc- 
tors must have played an unduly large part in their training.” In 
much the same way the poor upon whom the social workers learned 
“what not to do” often paid heavy costs in suffering or demoraliza- 
tion. 
Eleven years have passed since the first professional school of phi- 
lanthropy completed its first full year of training. These years have 
been marked by growth in many ways. There are now five of these 
schools, three of which offer two years of work. The history of their 
organization can be briefly stated. The example of New York in 
founding the first school for social workers was quickly followed by 
Chicago and Boston. In Chicago the settlements took the lead in this 
work, as the Charity Organization Society had done in New York 
City. In 1903 Dr. Graham Taylor, of Chicago Commons, and Miss 
Julia C. Lathrop, of Hull House, in cooperation with the exten- 
sion department of the University of Chicago, organized lecture 
courses in practical work, which became in the following year the 
Chicago Institute of Social Science, and in 1907 the Chicago School 
of Civics and Philanthropy. In 1904 the Boston School for Social 
Workers was organized, under the joint auspices of Harvard Uni- 
versity and Simmons College. In St. Louis a School of Social Econ- 
omy, which originated as a series of round-table meetings for local 
social workers, was organized in 1905; it was affiliated at one time 
with the University of Missouri and later with Washington Uni- 
versity. Similarly, in Philadelphia, courses of lectures on the prac- 
tical aspects of social work became in 1910 a fully organized training 
school, which is now called the Pennsylvania School for Social   
1See Brackett, op. cit., p. 192.

  EDUCATION FOR SOCIAL WORK. 349 
Service.t During the academic year 1913-14 there were, in round 
numbers, 900 students registered at these schools and 167 students 
received certificates of graduation. 
These years of growth have been marked also by great improve- 
ments in the organization of the courses within the schools. In the 
beginning the lectures were given by persons engaged in practical 
social work; to-day the five schools all have staff lecturers giving all 
their time and thought to the work of teaching and to the problems 
of school organization. In this respect again, the lines of develop- 
ment have resembled those of the older professional schools of law 
and medicine in which the teachers were in the beginning successful 
practicing lawyers and doctors. In the newer, as in the older pro- 
fessional school, the organization of a real faculty group has been one 
of the great steps forward. 
Two events that have had much to do with the successful growth of 
these schools should be noted. The first is the series of grants of 
money made by the Russell Sage Foundation, which was organized 
and endowed for “the improvement of social and living conditions 
in the United States.” In the autumn of 1907 the trustees of the 
Sage Foundation made what might be called substantial “grants in 
aid” to the four professional schools of philanthropy then organ- 
ized—those in New York, Chicago, Boston, and St. Louis. The 
grants to the schools were in the first instance specifically given for 
organizing departments of social investigation, no doubt in the be- 
lief that the work of investigating and studying adverse social con- 
ditions might be in some measure delegated by the foundation to the 
schools of philanthropy. The Russell Sage Foundation “ grants” 
meant for all the schools the appointment of additional members of 
the faculty, and through the facilities for granting studentships, 
fellowships, or scholarships to promising university-trained men and 
women, an improvement in the quality of the student body. 
Another fact of importance in the recent growth of the schools was 
the generous endowment of the New York School of Philanthropy 
during the year 1909-10 by the will of the late John S. Kennedy, of 
New York, by which the school was assured of an income from a 
sum which will ultimately amount to more than a million dollars. 
The endowment of one of the professional schools, giving it an as- 
sured position of permanency and growth, has been of assistance to 
all the other schools in sustaining the growing public confidence in 
the importance of their work and the necessity for providing them 
with the equipment needed to do that work well. In general, it may   
1 No mention is made here of at least two sectarian institutions which should perhaps be 
regarded as training schools. The School of Sociology of the Loyola University (Cath- 
olic) in Chicago is not included because it still seems to belong rather with work of the 
universities referred to on p. —, and the Training School for Jewish Workers in New 
York is not mentioned because it is still in the formative stage.  
-P-A-G-E-370
  850 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
be said that whatever has made it possible for any one of the schools 
to improve the character of its work has reacted favorably upon all 
the schools by setting a new and higher standard to which the level 
of work in each school must be raised. 
Notable progress has been made, too, in the past decade in the or- 
ganization of the curriculum of the professional schools of phi- 
lanthropy. Since the purpose of all these schocls is identical, viz, to 
provide instruction and training for those who wish to enter the pro- 
fession of social work, the curriculum is much the same in all the 
schools. It consists in general of lecture courses and class work, 
inspection visits to social institutions in or near the various cities 
in which the schools are located, and most important of all, field- 
work or practice work with some social agency. The lecture courses 
and classes of the schools differ from the courses in applied soci- 
ology offered in many of the universities in that the courses in the 
professional schools deal with practice rather than with theory; they 
are courses in social treatment rather than courses describing social 
conditions. Students who have had, in the college or university, 
courses dealing with the causes of poverty or with social politics or 
similar subjects may have learned why social work is being done. 
The courses in the school of philanthropy endeavor to teach how it 
is done or how it ought to be done. In discussing whether or not 
there had been evolved such a body of technique in the field of social 
treatment as to give content to such courses as are offered at the 
schools, Mr. Porter Lee made the following statement at the Balti- 
more conference: 
Technical processes are always derived from experience. Standard methods 
in any form of work were experiments at one time. Repeated over and over, 
now unconsciously, now consciously, their universal validity is finally recog- 
nized. By studying their experience, case workers dealing with the socially 
disabled have established some elementary principles. They have learned that 
there are certain methods which are more likely than others to yield the in- 
formation necessary to an understanding of the disabilities of their clients. 
They have learned also that, given this knowledge, certain combinations 
of education, medical treatment, personal influence, opportunities for self- 
maintenance, restraint, or relief are likely to lead to the removal of those 
disabilities to a greater or less degree. ‘They are learning that certain of 
their clients can never be improved by any of the methods now known to us. 
Dr. Brackett, of the Boston School for Social Workers, in dis- 
cussing “The Curriculum of the Professional School of Social 
Work” at the recent meeting of the National Conference of Chari- 
ties and Correction' stated that “while teaching many facts,” the 
object of the professional school was “rather to teach methods, to 
put tools into the students’ hands;” the student, as a result of his

and Correction, 1915 Meeting at Baltimore, “ The Curriculum of the Professional School 
of Social Work,” by Jeffrey R. Brackett, director, School for Social Workers, Boston.

school work, should be able “to appreciate the value of technique in 
‘case work,’ in any part of the field, with its necessary relation to 
measures for improving general conditions and advancing useful 
knowledge. That means to understand the scientific method of 
work, the getting of principles from thoughtful practice; where 
the test of usefulness of laws or of little acts, one man with another, 
is in the needs and possibilities of human beings concerned.” 
Finally, the student should be enabled during the year “to get some 
definite training both in work with needy families and in group 
organization and neighborhood activities.” 
The most characteristic feature of the school curriculum, the 
feature that has most sharply differentiated the work of the school 
of philanthropy from that of the department of sociology in the 
university, has been the organization of field work, and-upon this 
a growing emphasis has been laid. Field work in this sense has 
come to mean a system of social apprenticeship. From the first, the 
professional schools have realized that social work could not be 
undertaken without actual practice work in the office of a good 
social agency; that students could learn how to do only by doing 
under expert supervision. Comparison may be made between the 
field work of the school of philanthropy and the clinical experience 
furnished by the good medical school. Certainly the stress laid 
upon clinical practice for the medical student resembles the em- 
phasis upon field work in the training of the social worker. Indeed, 
the analogy with the training of the medical student is in some 
respects a very interesting one. Dr. Cabot is quoted as having said: 
Learning medicine is not fundamentally different from learning anything else. 
If one had 100 hours in which to learn to ride a horse or to speak in public, 
one might spend, perhaps, 1 hour (in divided doses) in being told how to do it, 
4 hours in watching a teacher do it, and the remaining 95 hours in practice, at 
first with close supervision, later under general oversight." 
Without field work our schools would be in much the same position 
as the medical schools in the earlier stage described by Mr. Abraham 
Flexner in his admirable and frequently quoted report on Medical 
Education in The United States. At one time “medical education 
consisted largely in getting by heart a prearranged system of corre- 
spondences, an array of symptoms so set off against a parallel array 
of doses that if the student noticed the one, he had only to write down 
the other.” Now, in contrast to this more primitive condition, we 
are told that: 
On the pedagogic side, modern medicine, like all scientific teaching, is char- 
acterized by activity. The student no longer merely watches, listens, memor- 
izes; he does. His own activities in the laboratory and in the clinic are the

the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (New York, 1910).

  352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
main factors in his instruction and discipline. An education in medicine now- 
adays involves both learning and learning how; the student can not effectively 
know, unless he knows how.* 
One additional quotation from Mr. Flexner’s report serves to em- 
phasize the necessity for practice work in connection with the train- 
ing of the social worker by analogy with the training of the medical 
ident. Mr. Flexner points out: 
There comes a time in a physician’s development when any opportunity to 
look on is helpful; but only after he is trained; his training he can not get by 
looking on. That he gets by doing—in the medical school, if he can, otherwise 
in his early practice, which in that case furnishes his clinical schooling with- 
out a teacher to keep the beginner straight and to safeguard the welfare of 
the patient.’ 
In attempting to explain more concretely what has come to be 
Imown as field work in the curriculum of the professional school, 
it must be understood that as the term “social work” is used 
to describe widely varying activities, so the term “ field work” has 
come to describe widely different kinds of practice work. The most 
important of these is the apprenticeship with case-work agencies, 
since the technique of case treatment is fundamentally necessary for 
almost every social worker; but other kinds of field work that are 
essential as training for more specialized work are (1) work with 
some governmental or quasi governmental agency, such as an efli- 
ciency bureau or a bureau of sanitary inspection, for those who wish 
to enter more specifically civic work; (2) participation in the recrea- 
tional work of settlements or other neighborhood centers; (3) investi- 
gational work for those who wish the necessary technical training in 
methods of social inquiry. 
Mr. Flexner’s account of the interrelation between the medical 
school and the good clinic serves to illustrate the ideals which the 
schools of philanthropy and the social agencies of their respective 
cities have in mind in arranging “ field work” for students. The 
student in these medical clinics, in the words of Mr. Flexner, “ gets 
by assignment a succession of cases, for a full report upon each of 
which he is responsible; he must take the history, conduct the physi- 
cal examination, do the microscopical and other clinical laboratory 
work, propound a diagnosis, suggest the treatment.” That is: 
The student is a physician practicing the technique, which, it is to be hoped, 
may become his fixed professional habit; learning through experience, as in- 
deed he will continue to learn long after he has left school—a controlled, 
systematized, criticized experience, however, not the blundering helpless 
“experience” upon which the student hitherto relied for a slow and costly 
initiation into the art of medicine.

EDUCATION FOR SOCIAL WORK.. 353 
The numerous difficulties in the way of providing the necessary 
field work should not be overlooked.t| The medical schools overcame 
the difficulties in the way of providing proper hospital facilities by 
establishing hospital stations of their own. It may be that the time 
will come when we shall find social agencies connected with the 
schools of philanthropy designed on the one hand to render social 
service in the community and on the other hand to provide “ clini- 
cal” facilities for the students of the school with which they are 
connected. And, as a matter of fact, facilities for investigational 
practice work are organized and supervised by at least one of the 
schools at the present time. 
_ If the importance of “field work” in the curriculum is accepted, 
there would seem to be a definite limit to the number of schools 
that can be properly organized, a limit that would be determined by 
the number of cities in which good field work could be found. Pro- 
fessional training schools for social work should be established only 
in cities where good social work is done. The establishment of such 
schools will in all probability be confined, of necessity, to a few large 
cities, and will probably make impossible the development of such 
schools in connection with universities or colleges situated in the 
country or ‘in small towns. As a way out of this difficulty, it has 
been proposed to have the student proceed to a term of nonresident 
work which is to be devoted to field work in some city after the 
classroom work has been completed in the university—a plan of 
more than doubtful value, since the importance of correlation be- - 
tween field work and class work is regarded as essential, if the stu- 
dent is to derive proper training from either.” 
Of the third feature of the curriculum of these schools, the so- 
called inspection visits, little need be said. Such visits should not 
be confused with field work. They are purely observational and in- 
formational, and from them the student gains none of the actual 
experience in doing under expert supervision, which is the invaluable 
asset of properly organized field work. 
In connection with the general subject of the curriculum in the 
professional schools, attention should be called to the very recent 
organization of special courses to meet the needs of highly specialized 
groups of workers. This is especially significant since it is due in 
part to the efforts to define the term “ social work” with greater ac-   
1¥or a discussion of these difficulties and other aspects of the field work of the schools, 
see papers by Miss Zilpha Smith and by the present writer in reports of the National 
Conference of Charities and Correction (Baltimore, 1915). 
2Attention may be called to somewhat similar arguments against the establishment of 
medical schools where proper clinical facilities are not available. ‘The argument ad- 
vanced for the retention of medical schools in places where good clinical instruction is 
impossible,” says Dr. Henry 8S. Pritchett, ‘‘is directly against the public interest.” Intro-

curacy, to differentiate the various types of service included under 
a rather nebulous title. Thus the New York school has a special 
training course for nurses in connection with one of the New York 
hospitals, the Chicago school has a special course for public-health 
nurses which provides for field work with the various public-health 
nursing agencies in that city, and the Chicago school has also under- . 
taken to meet the needs of its large recreation centers by providing a 
special training course for playground workers, offering not only 
lecture courses at the school but technical classes in gymnastics, 
games, and folk dancing at the Hull House Gymnasium and practice 
work in the various settlements and public recreation centers. An- 
other special course formerly offered both in the Chicago and New 
York schools was the training course for attendants in institutions 
for the insane—an attempt to instruct attendants in the modern 
methods of reeducating the insane and to raise the standards of care 
in public. institutions. This course has been temporarily discon- 
tiued in both schools, but it is expected that it will be offered again . 
in Chicago in the summer term of 1916 in cooperation with the 
Illinois Society for Mental Hygiene. What is perhaps a more im- 
portant attempt at specialization is carried on both in the New York 
and Boston schools in a second-year course open only to students 
who have already had a year of work in some one of the professional 
schools. During this second year the student already equipped with 
a general knowledge of the social problem may concentrate on the 
work that he has decided to enter, such as charity-organization work, 
work for children, hospital social-service work, etc. 
Other recent lines of development of the work of the professional 
schools that should not be overlooked are the extension courses 
offered in the evenings or late afternoons to those already engaged in 
social work. These courses have been most largely developed by the 
New York and Chicago schools, both of which also offer courses 
during the summer. The summer work of the New York school has 
recently taken the form of a series of “institutes” for those already 
engaged in social work, while the Chicago school offers a summer 
session with credit courses and field work that has been largely 
patronized not only by social workers but by teachers and others who 
are unable to attend the regular school sessions. 
No attempt will be made in this report to discuss the progress that 
has been made in universities and colleges in increasing the number of 
courses in applied sociology. It may be noted that in general such 
courses are not professional in character. Two of the professional- 
training schools under discussion have university affiliation, the New 
York School of Philanthropy with Columbia, and the Boston School 
of Social Workers with Harvard University and Simmons College. 
In both cases, however, the “ affiliation” is of such character that the

schools retain entire control over their owni work. Two other 
schools, those of Chicago and St. Louis, which were at one time affil- 
iated with neighboring universities, have withdrawn from this re- 
lationship. Prof. Felix Frankfurter, of the Harvard Law School, in 
discussing this subject at the last National Conference of Charities, 
stated emphatically his belief in the necessity of bringing all the 
schools into some kind of university relationship. While the future 
development of the schools in this direction can not easily be fore- 
seen, certain differences between the work that the schools are doing 
now and the work that is done by the universities may be noted. In 
general the schools of philanthropy are professional schools of gradu- 
ate rank.t. The percentage of students who already hold college or 
university degrees has steadily risen in all the schools, until in some 
of them approximately two-thirds of the students belong in this 
group. The courses in applied sociology developed by the universities 
are designed almost exclusively for undergraduates, and the question 
must be faced, both by the schools and the universities, as to whether 
training of the kind developed in the schools is suitable for under- 
graduate students. For many kinds of social work a degree of ma- 
turity greater than that possessed by the vast majority of recent col- 
lege graduates is requisite. With regard to the relationship between 
the professional schools and the graduate schools of the university, it 
may be pointed out that there are difficulties, grave but perhaps not 
insuperable, in the way of adjusting the curriculum of the profes- 
sional school to the requirements, for example, for a master of arts   
1The Yearbook of the New York School of Philanthropy for 1914-15, for example, 
makes the following statement : 
“The School of Philanthropy is primarily a professional training school of graduate 
rank for civic and social work.” 
The catalogue of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy for the year 1914-15 
contains a somewhat detailed statement of the status of the school in relation to the 
work done in the universities : 
“The Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy is not identified with any university. 
Representatives of several university faculties are trustees of the school. The work done 
is often recognized by various universities and credit given on application; the standard 
maintained is, however, rather that of the professional than of the graduate department, 
and the methods attempted are those applied in courses of law and medicine rather than 
in the theoretical and general work in economics and sociology. These methods, as has 
been shown, involve the combined use of the lecture upon methods of work, the class- 
room discussion of special problems, and practical work under the direction of efficient 
social agencies. 
“Our social exchange, however, is frequently embarrassed by applications for positions 
in social work from students who believe they have had training for such work through 
graduate courses in economics and sociology. Such students may have had courses or 
seminars which deal with the causes of poverty, the labor movement, phases of modern 
industry, or theories of social reform. They have not had, however, any experience either 
in the field or in the office. They may have learned why social work is being done; they 
have not learned how to do it; and it is therefore impossible to recommend them for 
positions which require the skilled and delicate treatment of difficult situations when 
their fitness for such work has never been tested. Obviously, the distinction should be 
carefully drawn by the college student who anticipates entering the field of social service 
between graduate study leading to the advanced degree on the one hand and the pro- 
fessional school of philanthropy with its carefully arranged system of social apprentice- 
ship on the other.”

degree. The question of credit for field work in its present somewhat 
unstandardized condition is perhaps the greatest difficulty. At pres- 
ent, it may be said, the schools of philanthropy are rendering a unique 
service. They are not duplicating university courses in their class- 
rooms, and in their attempt to organize and standardize the practice 
work that is called “field work” they are engaged in experimental 
work which can best be carried on outside of the more rigid and 
formal requirements demanded by a system of university credits for 
university degrees. 
An account of recent progress in education for social work would 
be seriously incomplete without some notice of the fact that the 
movement toward the organization of training schools for social 
work has not been confined to America.t Schools of this kind are, 
in fact, quite as numerous in Great Britain as in the United States. 
As early as 1903 the Charity Organization Society of London, to- 
gether with the Women’s University Settlement in the same city, 
started a scheme of training which afterwards developed into the 
London School of Sociology, with headquarters at Denison House, 
where the offices of the Charity Organization Society are located. 
This “School of sociology” has since been incorporated with the 
London School of Economics, which is a branch of the University of 
London. A recent bulletin on “Training for social work,” issued by 
the London School of Economics, contains the following statement 
of the reasons for the establishment of the school: 
The present century has witnessed a remarkable change in the whole field of 
social work and administration. First, and most obviously, there has been a 
very great increase in the number and variety of appointments requiring spe- 
cialized administrators to fill them; and this has been accompanied by an 
equally rapid rise in the standard of efficiency called for on the part of the 
administrators. New forms of government service have risen, involving direct 
personal dealing with large numbers of individuals, the value of which is en- 
tirely dependent upon the understanding, knowledge, and judgment of the re- 
administrators. New forms of government service have arisen, involving direct 
increase the well-being of employees; here, too, especially qualified superin- 
tendents are found to be necessary in order to insure success. Meanwhile old 
departments of philanthropic or charitable effort are revising their methods and 
increasing their effectiveness by making their work far more thorough and con- 
sistent, and this again is found to necessitate the employment of trained organ- 
izers or assistants. 
In the second place, the workers themselves are now recognizing the impor- 
tance of attaining and preserving a high standard of competence. They desire 
to be qualified for their admittedly difficult work by education, training, and ex- 
perience. In some cases groups of specialized administrators have already 
formed themselves into associations, similar to those existing in the older pro- 
fessions, for the maintenance of a high standard in their work. The Hospital 
Almoners and the Welfare Secretaries in factories are examples of this new 
  
1It has not been possible, unfortunately, to give an account of the Canadian experi- 
ments in establishing professional schools, notably those in connection with the Uni- 
versity of Toronto and the University of Winnipeg.
-P-A-G-E-377
EDUCATION FOR SOCIAL WORK. 357 
movement. In other cases the individual workers now devote part of their 
spare time to increasing their knowledge by attendance at lectures and con- 
ferences. But the most marked sign of the new demand for training is the 
fact that a very large number of would-be social workers now realize that a 
definite preparation is needed before they can be qualified to begin work. 
They ask for opportunities of training; and they are prepared to devote one or 
more years to their special education. This demand is by no means confined to 
those who aim at becoming salaried officers; it is equally marked on the part 
of many volunteer workers who recognize that their standard of work must be 
equally high. 
In 1905 a similar enterprise was instituted in Liverpool under the 
auspices of the Charity Organization Society, the Victoria Settle- 
ment, and the University of Liverpool. The example of Liverpool 
was followed in Birmingham, where the University of Birmingham 
cooperates with the Women’s University Settlement and the warden 
of the settlement supervises the practice work and the so-called 
“visits of observation.” More recently, similar schools of social 
study have been organized in Glasgow, Leeds, and Bristol, all joint 
undertakings of the universities and the settlements in these cities. 
These schools differ in their relation to the respective universities 
and in their methods of work, but their general aim is described by 
Miss E. Macadam, director of studies in the Liverpool School of 
Training, as threefold:* 
1. They train workers for voluntary or salaried social workers and grant a 
diploma to those candidates who reach a certain degree of proficiency. 
2. They provide instruction in social questions for those who, in the course 
of their profession or as voluntary workers for charities or merely as inter- 
ested citizens, come into contact with the problems of poverty. 
8. They act as centers for investigation into social conditions in towns where 
this need is not otherwise provided for. 
In general the English training schools for social work differ 
from the American schools in the close relation that exists between 
the English schools and the universities. The difference seems to 
be due to the fact that the American schools demand a university 
degree or its equivalent as a condition of admission, whereas the 
students in the English schools seem to be largely undergraduates 
who are carrying university courses in economics, industrial history, 
and similar subjects along with the more specialized technical 
courses. 
A few attempts to establish similar schools have been made on the 
Continent of Europe. One of the oldest of these is a School of 
Social Work (School voor Maatschappelijk Werk), which was 
opened in Amsterdam in 1899. This school was compelled by lack 
of resources to suspend operations during the year 1903-4, but re- 
opened in 1904 and now occupies an attractive and dignified building

erected for its especial use and adapted to its needs. The work of 
this school, however, does not seem to be of university grade, and 
the students seem to be very young and less mature certainly than 
even the undergraduate students in American universities. This 
Dutch school is a school exclusively for women, as are the schools 
for social work that have been established in Germany, a circum- 
stance which is perhaps due to the greater difficulties in the way of 
university training for women in these countries than in the United 
States or Great Britain. 
The most important of the German schools is the “ Soziale Frauen- 
schule,” of Berlin, organized in 1908, with Friulein Dr. Alice Salo- . 
man, well known in America through her connection with the Inter- 
national Council of Women, a’ its “ Direktorin.” Similar “ Soziale 
Frauenschulen ” have been established in Hanover (Christlich Sozi- 
ales Frauenseminar), in Heidelberg (Katholische Soziale Frauen- 
schule), in Augsburg (Christliches Frauenseminar fiir Soziale 
Berufsarbeit), in Frankfort on the Main (Frauen Seminar fiir 
Sociale Berufsarbeit), and a second school has been established in 
Berlin (Frauenschule der Innern Mission). The names of the 
schools indicate their sectarian affiliations in many cases. In gen- 
eral the German schools seem not to be connected with the univer- 
sities, as are the schools in England, and they seem to be much more 
elementary in character than the American schools. 
In conclusion, a brief summary may be made of the most important 
indications of progress in education for social work within the past 
decade. The number of professional training schools for such work 
in the United States has increased from three to five; all the schools 
have improved greatly in material equipment; some of them now have 
excellent libraries, and two of the schools are housed in buildings ex- 
clusively devoted:to school purposes; one of the schools is already pro- 
vided with a large endowment, and the budgets of the other schools 
have become more adequate to their needs. More important signs of 
progress are the improvements in school organization and adminis- 
tration, the increase in the number of permanent staff lecturers, the 
solidifying of the curriculum, the gradual standardization of the 
requirements for field work. Largely as a result of the increased 
resources of the schools, there has been a great increase in the number 
quirements for field work. Largely as a result of the improved 
facilities of the school, there has been a great increase in the number 
of students and a still greater improvement in the “ grade” of student 
as evidenced by the rising standards of entrance requirements in most 
if not all of the schools. A further indication of progress is to be 
found in the contributions that have been made by the schools to 
the literature of social work and social investigation. Several of the 
publications of the Russell Sage Foundation have come from the
-P-A-G-E-379
EDUCATION FOR SOCIAL WORK. 359 
schools, and some of the schools have themselves undertaken the pub- 
lication of studies in the social field. There remain to be noted the 
lengthening of the school curriculum from one to two years in three 
of the schools and the development of special courses to meet the 
needs of special and highly differentiated groups of social workers. 
As to that hoped-for result of the training schools for social work 
forecast so long ago by Miss Richmond in her paper at the Toronto 
conference (the progressive reaction of the improved professional 
standards of the schools upon the work of social service), it is as yet 
too early to speak. It is, however, obvious that, asa result not only of 
the training given in the schools, but through the process of selection 
that is exercised through the agency of the schools, the selection of 
new workers who have met the tests provided during the year’s period 
of training, there will be a gradual improvement in the character and 
quality of social work. Any improvement, however gradual in the 
body of social workers, must in the long run improve the character 
of social work. Speaking at the last National Conference of Chari- 
ties, Mr. Porter R. Lee, whose rare experience combines that of super- 
intendent of a large charity organization society and of staff lecturer 
in the New York School of Philanthropy, presented an admirable 
statement of this fact: 
It may not be amiss to point out that it rests largely with social workers 
themselves whether their calling shall rise to the plane of a profession or sink 
to the level of a trade * * *, The collection and interpretation of facts in 
a large body of knowledge is the foundation of any profession * * *, Social 
work will still grow from an occupation to a profession just as rapidly as its 
practitioners develop this body of knowledge out of their experience and acquire 
the power to apply it. When this committee? considers on the one hand how 
easily social workers assume the mantle of expertness, and on the other how 
long and how painstaking is the process by which the older professions have 
come to authoritative leadership, they could wish for social workers of this gen- 
eration, as part of their endowment, nothing more earnestly than the spirit of 
humility in the face of their unparalleled opportunity. 
  
1See the report of the committee on “ Securing and Training Social Workers,” pre- 
sented at the Boston meeting of the National Conference of Charities, in which Miss 
Breckinridge, of Chicago, as chairman of the committee, made the following statement : 
“There is, too, reasonable unanimity as to one function which these schools may 
serve—that of selection. The ‘conscientious elimination of the incompetent and the 
unfit’ is a task of no mean importance when the object of our service may so easily 
become the victim of our blunders.”

  CHAPTER XIV. 
HOME EDUCATION. 
By Etten C. Lomparp, 
Secretary, Home Education Division, Bureau of Hducation. 
CoNnTENTS.—The problems—Home making promoted by the Government—Home education 
in the Territories and dependencies—Home education promoted by organizations. 
THE PROBLEMS, 
A survey of the field of home education reveals evidences of signi- 
ficant progress. While for many years various agencies outside of 
schools have been at work creating public sentiment in the interest 
of conscious and intelligent home making, it is particularly during 
the past year that more concerted and organized effort has been made. 
According to the Census of 1910 more than 9,400,000 women over 
15 years of age, or nearly one-tenth of the whole population of the 
United States, are home makers in the rural districts or open country. 
With the growing consciousness that the home is the most im- 
portant factor in the life of the Nation comes the realization of 
the necessity for promoting the highest ideals in home making. The 
interest of the people has been noticeably quickened with a desire 
for more knowledge of home making, which includes not only build- 
ing, furnishing, sanitation, cooking, and the inner activities of the 
home, but also the more important office of parenthood and child 
nurture. Some of the factors creating this interest are the various 
agencies engaged in studying the real conditions and the human 
needs of the people. For years forces have been at work in the 
interest of the home in towns and cities where there are good roads, 
material conveniences and comforts, and where there is adequate op- 
portunity for social life, recreation and entertainment, church life, 
good schools for children, and access to libraries. Until recently, 
however, little attention has been paid to the homes in small rural 
districts and in the open country. 
There are at present two great problems in home education de- 
manding the attention of every educational and philanthropic agency. 
The problem which has claimed especial attention is that of ex- 
tending the interests, opportunities, and educational advantages of 
361
-P-A-G-E-382
  362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the farmers’ wives who live in remote localities under conditions of 
hardship and privation. These women have been for the most part 
uncomplaining. The constant flow of population from the rural 
districts into the large towns and cities in order to secure greater 
social, educational, and recreational advantages has, however, com- 
pelled attention to the actual conditions of life in the open country. 
Efforts are being made to release women from the drudgery inci- 
dent to most farm life by the introduction of labor and time-saving 
devices into the homes and making the water supply more available. 
Even with these advantages there must be some provision made for 
the social, recreational, and cultural life of the women to occupy the 
extra time secured by the release from so much drudgery. In order 
to secure such opportunities, the cooperation of every educational 
and philanthrophic agency outside of schools in large centers is 
imperative. 
The second great problem in home education, and one of no less 
importance, concerns the immigrants who have poured into the 
United States seeking to make homes and to becomes citizens. 
During the past five years 506,026 married women have come from 
foreign countries to make their homes here. As it is partly to these 
women that the country will turn for its strength in future genera- 
tions, every agency must be enlisted in developing in them as rapidly 
as possible the highest ideals of womanhood and manhood, the love 
of home and home making, and the conservation of child life through 
better knowledge of how to train and care for children. This process 
of development will be slow, since it must first overcome superstitions 
and traditions which have been an active force for centuries. The 
schools are doing much through the children, but the women must 
look to outside agencies for their help. The Bureau of Immigration 
is working on this problem and interest has been aroused during 
the year. 
HOME MAKING PROMOTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT, BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
Through the home education division of the Bureau of Education, 
in cooperation with the National Congress of Mothers, the Depart- 
ment of the Interior has succeeded in reaching thousands of homes 
during the year. Mothers of little children have received Dr. L. 
Emmett Holt’s pamphlet “Save the Babies,” which deals in simple 
language with the care and feeding of both mother and child. These 
pamphlets were secured through the cooperation of the American 
Medical Association. The Public Health Service has cooperated 
by furnishing thousands of pamphlets on “The Care of the Baby” 
for distribution. Many circulars have been distributed on “The
-P-A-G-E-383
  HOME EDUCATION. 363 
Care of the Baby in Hot Weather,” as well as a pamphlet on the 
“Duty of Parents to Children in Regard to Sex” and a pamphlet on 
“How to Organize,” which were supplied by the National Congress 
of Mothers. These pamphlets have reached largely the women in 
the rural districts. 
One important phase of the work is the organization of women into 
clubs in the interest of child welfare and home making. For this 
work the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tions has given practical aid through its National and State officers, 
who work in close cooperation by means of field workers and through 
literature. A pamphlet entitled “1,000 Good Books for Children” 
has been issued to assist parents in the selection of children’s reading. 
The National Reading Circle was formed for the purpose of stimu- 
lating a desire for good reading and to further home education. 
During the year 2,000 men and women, boys, and girls have been 
enrolled. In order to make the books on the lists of the reading 
courses available to readers, libraries have placed additional sets of 
such volumes on their shelves and some of the State library com- 
missions have agreed to enter into a cooperative arrangement to 
place these sets of books in some of the small communities. 
BUREAU OF MINES. 
The department is working in the interest of the home through 
its Bureau of Mines in its campaign for health and its work of life 
saving. Several hundred women have been trained to give first aid 
to the injured. During the past year attention has been given to the 
sanitation of the homes, to elimination of smoke, and the right way 
to burn coal in order to secure the best results. 
RECLAMATION SERVICE. 
Success has attended the efforts of the Department of the Interior, 
through its Reclamation Service, to reach the homes and help the 
women on the projects to work for improved conditions in the homes 
and to inaugurate clubs for study. Clubs have been formed in South 
Dakota, Idaho, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Nebraska, 
Washington, California, Utah, and Nevada. The feclamation 
Record, the organ of the Reclamation Service, has been an important 
factor in reaching these people. One section of this periodical is 
devoted to project women and their interests. The women are en- 
couraged to send inquiries and a statement of their needs, or any 
matter of interest to all, for publication. The Record acts as a clear- 
ing house for information. 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  864 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS. 
It is well demonstrated that the “Indian home must be the real 
basis for the civilization of the American Indian.” Four distinct 
activities are carried on by the department through its Indian Office 
in the promotion of bettering home conditions. First, through the 
children who are in school; second, through the farmer on the farm; 
third, through the medical service; fourth, through the work of the 
field matron. 
The field matron comes into closest contact with the mothers. She 
instructs them to care for themselves and their little children; to 
give the children proper food. She teaches them how to care for 
their houses and the value of ventilation, sunshine, and cleanliness. 
She exerts a definite moral influence in advising the mothers. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
A significant movement was inaugurated by the Department of 
Agriculture during the year, when it sent out an inquiry to about 
55,000 farm women asking how the department could best meet their 
needs. The answers have been classified and published under four 
heads: Domestic, educational, economic, and social and labor needs of 
farm women. 
In The American Farm Woman as She Sees Herself, a circular 
of the Department of Agriculture, Edward B. Mitchell says: 
What the farm women want for their children they want for themselves as 
well, but since they can no longer go to school they ask that the school be 
brought to them, * * * The farmers look to educational extension not only 
to help them in their work, but to aid them in finding pleasure outside of their 
work. Courses of reading have been planned by the Government with circu- 
lating libraries to render the necessary books accessible to all. In general, 
there can be no doubt of the sincerity and prevalence of the yearning for a 
. culture that will open their eyes to the beauty and joy of life. 
The Smith-Lever bill has made it possible for an extension of work 
into rural homes. The assignment for this work for 1915 was 
$542,000. 
The department, through its States Relation Service, has formed 
mother-daughter home canning clubs for the purpose of cultivating 
closer cooperation between mother and daughter in home interests 
and activities. The department has sent field workers into the homes, 
where they have assisted in the construction of labor and time-saving 
appliances for the housewives, as well as forming groups for consid- 
eration of topics in interest of the home.
-P-A-G-E-385
  HOME EDUCATION. 865 
DEPARTMENT. OF LABOR. 
Through its Children’s Bureau the department is working for the 
education of mothers and the health of children. 
Bulletins have been published on prenatal care and infant care; 
phases of community effort to protect the lives and rights of chil- 
dren; mothers’ pensions; the New Zealand Society for the Health of 
Women and Children; birth registration; baby-saving campaigns; 
and child-welfare exhibits. 
The bureau has conducted at the Panama-Pacific Exposition a 
children’s health conference, to which parents bring their children 
for physical examination and advice upon hygiene and general care. 
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. 
The circular on “ Measurements for the Household,” just issued by 
the Department of Commerce through its Bureau of Standards, is 
a valuable contribution to the work of home education. It deals in 
a practical way with household measuring, appliances, their use, 
State laws, measuring in purchasing commodities, methods of check- 
ing certain commodities, household thermometers and their use, re- 
frigeration, heat in the household, light, electricity, gas, humidity 
and atmospheric pressure, density of liquids, time, and kitchen. 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 
Through its Public Health Service the department has contributed 
much to the well-being of the home. Investigation to discover and 
exterminate menaces to the health of the people have been carried on. 
Extermination of infected rats and squirrels and the elimination of 
breeding places for mosquitoes are among the important activities 
that have characterized the work of the service in the direction of 
home betterment. Recent supplements to the Public Health Reports 
of particular interest to home makers include “Shower Baths for 
Country Houses,” by Carroll Fox; “The Care of the Baby” and 
“Summer Care of Infants,” by W. C. Rucker and C. C. Pierce. 
HOME EDUCATION IN THE TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES. 
Another problem with which this country has yet to deal is its terri- 
torial responsibility in regard to home education. Some of these 
problems have already been touched upon by the Government through 
its educational, medical, and military representatives and their co- 
workers. There are still islands needing a careful study of living ~ 
conditions and some plan of work for home education. Considerable 
work has been done in Alaska by the Department of the Interior and 
in the Philippine Islands by the Department of War. Steps have 
been taken to get in touch with the needs of Porto Rico.
-P-A-G-E-386
  366 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
ALASKA, 
Despite unfavorable conditions under which the natives of Alaska 
live and their migratory habits, the“homes are receiving attention. 
Throughout the Alaska School Service of the Bureau of Education 
every teacher is a social worker, who, in addition to performing the 
routine work of the schoolroom, strives in every possible way to pro- 
mote the physical, moral, and industrial welfare of the natives, adults 
as well as children. In the native villages the teachers and nurses 
endeavor to establish proper sanitary conditions by inspecting the 
houses, by insisting upon the proper disposal of garbage, and by 
giving instruction in sanitary methods of living. Natives are encour- 
aged to replace their filthy huts by neat, well-ventilated houses. In 
some sections the natives have been taught to raise vegetables, which 
are a healthful addition to their usual diet of fish and meat. 
At Hydaburg, mothers have been taught to care for their children 
properly. The homes of the Bristol Bay Eskimos, who are primitive 
people, are overcrowded and have no ventilation. The insanitary 
conditions induce disease. The lack of timber for houses makes 
building impossible. 
Instructions have been given at Nulato in bread making and soup 
making and suggestions for scrubbing, cleaning, and placing of dis- 
infectants. 
Children play school at home in Atka Island. It is-their favorite 
pastime. They are taught sewing and the mothers are shown how 
to use more care in finishing garments. They are also taught to use 
buttons and to cut by pattern. They make excellent yeast bread, 
cake, pies, and cookies. Efforts have been made to get them to use 
more rice and beans, and to teach them several ways of cooking each 
food. Natives have just learned to cook with milk. Washing and 
scrubbing floors is an everyday occurrence. The houses are aired 
each day, and some of the natives sleep with open windows. 
Boys and girls learn sewing and assist in daily home duties, cook- 
ing and washing clothes as well as cleaning. Sewing and the mak- 
ing of patterns for fur coats are taught at Deering. Laundry work 
is difficult on account of the lack of fuel and soap. 
The women of Eagle all use sewing machines and depend upon cut- 
ting and making their own clothing. They keep their cabins clean 
and use disinfectants on floors. The homes all have vents in the 
roofs which are screened, and they keep their windows open. 
At Hoonah women have learned to can fruit in glass jars. The 
houses are clean, and cleanliness is increasing. 
At Metlakahtla the teacher visited homes, encouraging the people 
to make their houses sanitary and cozy. A Mothers’ Sewing Circle, 
organized by the teacher, possesses clubrooms, where members could 
meet to sew or for social pleasure and discussion of ways and means
-P-A-G-E-387

of improving their homes. There is marked improvement in clean- 
liness of houses. 
At Noatak nearly all the women have sewing machines. 
At Sinuk the houses are not dirty. There is perceptible progress 
in housekeeping. Ventilation and cleanliness are improving. 
Most of the Indian housewives at Fort Yukon make it a business 
to scrub floors and keep cabins clean. They know how to wash 
clothes and some keep their children clean. 
At Kotzebue a woman’s club meets, and the women are taught care 
of the baby, etc. Requests are made by mothers for baths and clean 
clothes. The teachers and doctors work in the homes as well as in 
the schools. 
PORTO RICO. 
The need of home education in Porto Rico is evidenced by a 
survey of home conditions recently made by a special investigator 
for the Bureau of Education. She reports insanitary conditions in 
housing, inadequate space in the one-room shacks where families 
must live, disease, and immorality, due to crowded conditions in the 
poorer sections of the towns. Mothers are often called upon to sup- 
port their children by washing, cooking, working in factories and 
tobacco fields, picking coffee, lace making, and hat making. This 
gives the women little time for home making, even for housekeeping, 
and no time to train and care for their children. The need of simple 
instruction in selection and preparation of proper food, especially 
for the babies, is evidenced by the unhealthy condition of the chil- 
dren. The death rate of children under 1 year in 1914 was 28.7 
per cent. Steps have already been taken to bring the women to- 
gether in small groups. This will have to be directed largely by the 
teachers. 
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 
Government agencies in the Philippines, such as the bureau of 
education, the bureau of health, and the bureau of agriculture, 
have been actively engaged in improving and building up home life. 
There is the closest relation between the home and the school. The 
bureau of education, cooperating with the bureau of agriculture, 
has been instrumental in the: establishment and supervision of 
thousands of home gardens. The bureau of health has placed cir- 
culars in the homes of the people regarding diseases and epidemics. 
A bulletin on “ Housekeeping,” by Alice M. Fuller, has just been 
published. In addition to housekeeping activities this bulletin con- 
tains interesting and valuable chapters on hygiene, home sanitation, 
the care of the baby, marriage, and home life.

HOME EDUCATION PROMOTED BY ORGANIZATIONS, 
NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERS AND PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS. 
During the year the National Congress of Mothers has been inter- 
ested in the advocacy of sane and practical labor laws for children 
and for the rational guidance of erring children. The problem of 
the erring child has been discussed at many of the conferences. 
The promotion of organizations in small communities has been 
extended through cooperation with the Home Education Division 
of the Bureau of Education. 'The home and school have become 
more closely associated through the organization of parents and 
teachers. 
In its work for home education the National Congress of Mothers 
has held important conferences. The Cincinnati conference was 
held in February in connection with the Department of Superinten- 
dence of the National Education Association, at which the United 
States Commissioner of Education presided. This meeting was at- 
tended by an enthusiastic body of workers. Another conference was 
held in February in Erie, Pa. 
Several conferences were held in connection with the Mothers 
Crusade, a transcontinental tour which took place during May 
and June. The crusade was under the leadership of the president 
of the congress, who is also director of the Home Education Division 
of the Bureau of Education. Meetings were held at Kenosha, Wis., 
Chicago, St. Paul, Bismarck, N. Dak., Butte, Mont., Seattle, Wash., 
Portland, Oreg., San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, 
Ariz., Albuqueque, N. Mex., Pueblo, Colo, Mitchell, S. Dak. State 
conferences have been held during the year. 
A section of the Mothers’ Congress was presided over by the Com- 
missioner of Education at the annual meeting of the National Edu- 
cation Association in Oakland., Cal., in August. Home education, 
closer cooperation between the home and the school, and the problem 
of the erring child were characteristic topics for discussion at these 
conferences. 
The activities of State and local organizations include child wel- 
fare, exhibits, and baby-saving campaigns. Special progress in child 
welfare and home making is reported in Maryland, Montana, North 
Dakota, South Dakota, and New Mexico. The development of child- 
welfare circles has been noteworthy. During the year 53 circles 
have been organized in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, with 
about 2,500 members. These circles are composed of women who 
are interested in child study and the organization of mothers, and 
the work is carried on primarily for the purpose of developing 
leaders. The circles take part in community activities such as: ?

Directing a summer playground and gardens for children, establish- 
ing manual-training classes, establishing and furnishing kinder- 
gartens, etc. 
GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMEN’S CLUBS. 
Through its department of household economics, the Federation of 
Women’s Clubs promotes home education. The purpose of the de- 
partment is to emphasize the truth “ that the women’s club movement 
is not blazing and beating a path that leads away from the home, 
but is steadily giving to the home better knowledge and higher 
ideals.” 
The department of legislation, in furthering the interests of the 
home, has been active in promoting reforms in the property rights of 
women. Efforts have been made to secure legislation regarding the 
custody of children, uniform marriage and divorce laws, etc. 
Much work has been accomplished by churches, settlements, hos- 
pitals, the Young Women’s Christian Association, and other organi- 
zations in promoting home education.

  CHAPTER XV. 
ART EDUCATION. 
By Cuartes Fasens Ketiry, 
Professor of Art, Ohio State University. 
ConTENTS.—Present condition of art education in the United States—Professional art 
schools—Public schools—Colleges and universities—Special events of the year. 
PRESENT CONDITION OF ART EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
Viewing the situation as a whole and comparing results with those 
obtained in European countries, there seems to be little cause for’ 
congratulation on the present condition of art education in the 
United States. Certain features, to be sure, are admirable, but art 
education in its development has lagged conspicuously behind other 
subjects of universal interest. Evidently there does not exist a 
consensus of opinion as to what constitutes art teaching in schools, 
colleges, and universities. 
PROFESSIONAL ART SCHOOLS.” 
The curricula of the professional art schools have varied little 
in a number of years, except for the introduction of crafts work. 
All offer courses in drawing, painting in water color and oils, de- 
sign, a course in perspective and artistic anatomy, and most of them 
courses in crafts work and illustration. The statements of their 
catalogues do not vary to any great extent; nor does the appearance 
of the reproductions of students’ work generally contained in these 
publications. 
Although many of the academic art schools exist in connection 
with art museums, there is too little attempt to familiarize the stu- 
dents, in any systematic way, with the contents of the museums in 
which they work, and intelligent study of the history and develop- 
ment of art is too often conspicuous by its absence. As these schools, 
though of course founded for idealistic reasons, are commercial in- 
stitutions, it is necessary for them to have low entrance requirements, 
  
1The discussion will be limited to the study of drawing, painting, design, and the his- 
tory and appreciation of the fine arts. Professional schools of architecture will not be 
included, nor will curricula offered under the captions of “ manual arts” or “ practical 
arts.” 
2See Rep. of Commr. of Educ., 1914, vol. 1, p. 375.

or even, in some cases, none at all. The catalogues of these schools 
make a feature of the individual attention given to each student. 
In the heterogeneous mass of students found in the ordinary art 
school, proficient ones will probably receive a fair amount of personal 
supervision, but it is impossible to give individual attention to large 
numbers of students, particularly when the faculties are not larger 
than those announced in the bulletins. There seems to be no ma- 
chinery for eliminating the incompetent, who often do themselves 
permanent injury by persisting in a course unsuited to their needs 
and ability. The continued presence of such students is also a great 
drawback to the advancement of others. 
Some of the universities of the country claim to conduct regular 
“academic” art schools, but they will be discussed under the caption 
of colleges and universities. 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Nearly all public schools attempt to teach some form of the fine 
arts. In many cases the teaching is restricted to drawing, but fre- 
quently very highly specialized and diversified work is found. 
Broadly speaking, a relatively higher efficiency is maintained in 
the public schools than in the colleges and universities. This is 
true in spite of the fact that training usually considered entirely 
inadequate for the teaching of such subjects as English, history, 
geography, etc., is often considered quite sufficient for equipping a 
first-rate teacher of drawing. It is therefore not the fault of the 
teacher that bad work in drawing and kindred branches persists, 
but rather the absence of any standards of true value. 
The greater degree of systematization necessitated by the employ- 
ment of “unskilled labor” has given results, in exhibitions at least, 
that compare favorably with the work of more highly trained teach- 
ers who lack such definite schedules. This explains why several 
series of rather well-prepared drawing books are directly responsible 
for a large part of the art work in the public schools of the United 
States. 
Wherever special teachers of drawing do not give all the instruc- 
tion, the success of the work depends almost entirely upon the ability 
of the supervisors of drawing and the degree in which they are able 
to enlist the support of their subordinates. The very lack of special 
training on the part of drawing teachers in the elementary grades 
makes it necessary that they have carefully worked-out syllabi to 
follow, and it is therefore impossible to secure much flexibility of 
treatment. 
In the high schools there are generally special teachers of draw- 
ing, some of whom teach another subject also, and they are usually 
better equipped.
-P-A-G-E-393
  _ ART EDUCATION. 873 
The schools have analyzed the difficulty and are correcting it as 
fast as circumstances permit, and already in many large cities the 
training requirements for teachers of art are as rigorous as they 
would be for any other department of education. 
Drawing, color work and design, as well as a certain amount of 
history and appreciation of art, are taught successfully and con- 
scientiously in the public schools of many cities of the United States, 
and the standards are usually high, so far as the secondary schools 
are concerned. In many cases the fact, first grasped by the adver- 
tising experts, that beauty has a commercial value, has been directly 
responsible for the amount of support these art courses have received. 
The enthusiasm with which students have generally followed such 
courses has also contributed largely to their popularity. There is 
always a great deal to show at the end of the year and tangible evi- 
dences of the student’s progress are constantly available. It is to 
be feared that this is one of the great weaknesses of the system, 
wherever results have been overemphasized, though such over- 
emphasis is insidious. The desire to make pretty things which have 
been designed in art courses, and to carry them away as gifts, is an 
element which has entered largely into the development of many of 
our supposedly most successful art courses, to their great detriment. 
There has unfortunately been a marked impatience with any except 
firial processes, and preliminary steps were hurried through to the 
lasting handicap of the student. The teacher, through a not entirely 
unpraiseworthy desire to have her class make a creditable showing, 
has often done a large part of the educationally most important work 
for the student, with the result that the finished products are not 
really representative of the student’s power and ability. 
Courses treating of art in the home, given in high schools in con- 
nection with home economics or domestic art, have developed wide 
differences in content and scope. Some seem to aim to give a grasp 
of the underlying principles of the fine arts while others confine their 
attention to fancy needlework and tooled leather. Whatever the 
content of these courses, they have been a wholesome stimulus in 
arousing in the pupil the desire to obtain some understanding of 
the beautiful, most conspicuous by its absence in many households. 
In some schools the study of pictures is carried on in connection 
with language work, thus serving a double purpose. The principal 
difficulty encountered here is that in many cases the teaching and dis- 
cussion are conducted by the teacher of English, who lays too great 
an emphasis upon the literary value of a picture (not often com- 
mensurate with its artistic merits) since she has not had the training 
necessary for the perception and explanation of matters of greater 
interest and importance.
-P-A-G-E-394
874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
A really great informing influence might be made of the practice 
of decorating school buildings with casts and pictures of high stand- 
» ard. Too often these pictures and casts are placed in position and 
then allowed to accumulate the dust of neglect by a faculty which 
might be using them advantageously in the regular school work. In 
the past 25 years the average school building has become an object of 
some beauty and interest in marked contrast to the earlier buildings. 
This greater attention now paid to appearances can not fail to react 
favorably upon the children, giving them a more vital interest in the 
application of general art principles. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, 
Although art courses in the schools vary widely with the locality, 
there is not nearly the great divergency in curricula that is so con- 
spicuous in all the institutions of higher learning. It may not be an 
exaggeration to say that, in so far as the institutions which claim to 
have distinct art departments are concerned, no two of the larger 
colleges and universities regard art in the same light. 
Several universities announce regular art schools in which students 
may work with more or less freedom from the too severe mental dis- 
cipline imposed upon those registered in other courses. The two most 
highly developed schools of this nature seem to be at Yale and Syra- 
cuse. Both state in their catalogues that the purpose of the school is 
that of a regular school of fine arts, but there are very distinct differ- 
ences in the way the courses have been worked out. 
At Yale there are no entrance requirements except that the appli- 
cant must be 16 years of age or over and have a certain amount of 
proficiency in drawing. Preparatory classes in drawing are main- 
tained for those who do not possess the requisite proficiency. 
The Yale catalogue says: 
The department of fine arts of Yale University occupies a position in many 
ways unique among the art schools of America. It offers, by reason of its 
relations with the other departments of the university, extraordinary advan- 
tages, both to professional students and to the undergraduates; and is enabled, 
by its position, to influence the university life and thought through the lectures 
and courses open to students in other departments, while at the same time 
opening to the student of art the possibility of finding himself part of a larger 
cultivation to which his own activities may be intelligently related. 
Yale possesses one of the finest collections of Italian primitives in 
America, and this, with other collections and objects of interest, is 
open to the art student. 
Tt is noteworthy that the art student at Yale is not required to take 
any courses outside of the art school, and the school offers no regular 
instruction in the history and appreciation of the fine arts. A 
student may conceivably graduate from the school of fine arts with
-P-A-G-E-395
  ART EDUCATION. 375 
honors, without ever having studied the subject of art history, or 
taken any course outside the academic art work. A course of 30 or 
more lectures on the history of the fine arts, extending over a period 
of three years, and given by various authorities on the subject, was 
started in 1913-14, but no university credit is given for this course, 
and the students are not required to take it. At the end of three 
years a certificate is given. 
The school also offers a fourth, the senior year, in which work of a more pro- 
fessional nature is undertaken, and desires to emphasize the extraordinary 
value of this fourth year work, offering as it does a possibility for training and 
a preparation for the full professional career rarely, if ever before, given to 
students of art. 
Even the completion of this course does not lead to a degree, but 
upon its “successful completion” a special certificate is given. It— 
is open only to those who by reason of the high standard of their work are 
fitted in the judgment of the faculty to avail themselves of its special privi- 
leges. * * * The degree of bachelor of fine arts is conferred by Yale Uni- 
versity, on the recommendation of the faculty of the school of fine arts, upon 
students of each of the three departments of the school, namely: Painting, 
sculpture, and architecture, and is awarded at the university commencement 
to candidates for this distinction who show exceptional merit in the work pre- 
sented and in the thesis offered for the judgment of the faculty. 
Candidates are required to submit representative work * * * together 
with a thesis on some subject relative to the fine arts, and acceptable to the 
faculty. 
Five years of work or its equivalent are necessary for candidates 
for this degree. 
The Syracuse statement of admission requirements follows:* 
Candidates * * * are required to show by examinations or by certifi- 
cates from prevaratory institutions of recognized standing that they have 
studied with satisfactory proficiency the following subjects, viz: English gram- 
mar, geography, arithmetic, American history, together with a minimum of two 
years of high-school work. In addition to the above, a year of systematic study 
in drawing is required. 
The introduction to the bulletin says: 
The incorporation of a full university course in painting offers a unique oppor- 
tunity for the broadest foundation in art, for along with the practical work 
of training the eye and hand, the intellectual side of the student is stimulated 
by the study of languages, history, history of art, and esthetics, resulting in a 
breadth of view which renders him capable of the highest efforts in his chosen 
line. 
In addition to the technical courses the student is required to take, 
in the four-year painting course, 2 hours of English, 12 hours of 
French, 2 hours of ancient history, 2 hours of modern history, 5 
hours of art history, and 1 hour of esthetics. After a four-year 
1 Bulletin of Syracuse University, Vol. XV, No. 5, p. 155.  
-P-A-G-E-396
  376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
painting course such as outlined, the student is given a degree of 
bachelor of painting (B. P.). A course in design is also offered, 
which lasts for three years and is almost entirely technical in nature. 
The student is required to take four courses in the history of art, 
but all his other courses are technical. A certificate is given at the 
end of three years, but no diploma. 
A course in normal art is offered in the teacher’s college by a 
separate faculty, its object being to train teachers in drawing and 
manual arts for elementary schools. At the end of three years a 
certificate is given, and at the end of four years a degree of bachelor 
of pedagogy in art. 
The schools at Syracuse and Yale are accorded perhaps more 
recognition in their own universities than are schools with avowedly 
similar objects and ideals in other educational institutions of the 
country. For this reason they have been discussed in some detail, 
since they represent two quite different ways of solving the same 
problem. 
Other schools of art in various colleges and universities are con- 
ducted in a somewhat similar way, though without the same financial 
support. . 
Elsewhere the situation is different. Drake University, Iowa, has 
an “Institute of Fine Arts,” consisting of a conservatory of music, 
a school of dramatic art, and a school of drawing and painting. In 
this school a general art course is offered, a normal art course, an 
arts and crafts course, and a china-painting course. Students who 
enter the course in normal art (which extends over two years) must 
have had a high-school education or its equivalent. Students may 
enter the other courses at any time, and the “advancement depends 
entirely upon the ability of the student.” In the normal course, 
English composition, Biblical literature, psychology, and the history 
of education are required, but no nontechnical work is required of 
the students in the other courses. The faculty consists of one assist- 
ant professor and an instructor. 
The University of Nebraska has a school of fine arts and offers 
» degree of bachelor of fine arts in drawing and painting. Regular 
university students in the college of arts and sciences are permitted 
to elect the fine arts as the major for their degree of B. A. Students 
registered in the fine arts course are required to take 4 hours of 
rhetoric, 20 hours of a foreign language (for which, by permission 
of the director, history or literature may be substituted), 6 hours of 
art history, 10 hours of esthetics, 6 hours of zoology, and 4 hours of 
physical education. 
Newcomb Memorial College for Women, of the Tulane University 
of Lousiana, has an art school which in many ways is unique and has 
become a real influence in the development of art industry in New
-P-A-G-E-397

Orleans. The Newcomb art school offers courses in drawing, paint- 
ing, and design, with rather more of the history of art than is ordi- _ 
narily found in professional art schools.1 The special emphasis. 
seems, however, to be laid upon the crafts; these are prosecuted more 
successfully here than in other art schools under university super- 
vision. The crafts have been deliberately emphasized in an effort to 
enlist the sympathies of New Orleans people in productive art indus- 
tries and to enable the students to earn a living upon leaving the 
school without being compelled to teach unless they should desire to 
specialize in the pedagogic side of art work. The bulletin says: “The 
aim of the school is to furnish opportunity for professional study in 
pictorial and decorative art and to prepare teachers of art.” For 
entrance to all the courses a four-year high-school course or its equiv- 
alent is required. The courses of study are as follows: 
Regular course leading to a diploma in art. 
Regular course leading to the degree of bachelor of arts in education. 
Regular course leading to degree of bachelor of arts in education, in which 
the art elective is shared by the elective in music. 
Regular course elective in the college, counting toward the degree of bachelor 
of arts. 
Regular course required of students in household economy. 
Special courses in studio work. 
The only nontechnical courses required of the candidates for the art 
diploma are English, French, or German and the history of art. 
The crafts work must necessarily be mentioned in some detail here, 
since it has given the school its reputation. It is highly specialized 
in pottery, needlework, and metal work. The students of the school 
maintain a salesroom in one of the school buildings, as all the work 
done in the crafts courses is intended to be sold. The results of this 
business venture have been most successful, and the school is now 
advertising commercially the products of its students. 
Although there are many schools in the country under private aus- 
pices devoted to the training of commercial designers in one field or 
another, the Newcomb plant is practically unique as a university 
enterprise. It has successfully solved a difficult problem. 
The San Francisco Institute of Art maintains a regular art school 
under the direction of the San Francisco Art Association, which, in 
turn, is affiliated with the University of California, and, consequently, 
the name of the president of the university appears at the head of the 
faculty list of the art association. Students of the institute who pass 
satisfactory examinations in painting, drawing, modeling, composi- 
tion, perspective, and anatomy are given a certificate of proficiency 
by the university. The school has no entrance requirements.”

878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The St. Louis School of Fine Arts is conducted under the charter 
of Washington University, but the university has separate depart- 
ments of drawing and the history of art, in no way connected with 
the school, and seems to consider that there is no duplication of 
effort.t 
The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kans., has a school of fine 
arts offering courses in drawing ad painting. It gives a teacher’s 
certificate at the end of a two years’ course, but requires four years 
for the degree of bachelor of painting? 
This is characteristic of many of the art departments in colleges 
and universities throughout the country. “The instructors in the 
school of fine arts receive compensation from the State only for the 
work of the last year.” The tuition fees of the students pay the re- 
mainder. 
Brown University, Providence, R. I., has an arrangement. with 
the Rhode Island School of Design whereby students take two 
courses in free-hand drawing at the design school, for which they re- 
ceive university credit.. All courses in the history of art are offered 
by the art department of the university. 
The University of Cincinnati has an arrangement with the Art 
Academy of Cincinnati by which— 
students from the university may elect the courses stated in the catalogue in 
drawing, modeling, and carving, not more than 6 hours’ work in any one semester, 
and receive credit therefor on the books of the university, provided these courses 
have been duly entered on the election blank and the proper certificate from 
the director of the school is presented on their satisfactory completion. Not 
more than 12 hours’ work in the art academy will be credited for the degree 
of bachelor of arts.* 
In its teachers’ college the university also offers special courses for 
teachers of art, most of which are given at one of the city high schools. 
The catalogue says: 
The purpose of this course is to prepare students for positions as teachers of 
art or supervisors of art instruction in public or private schools. Admission 
presupposes (a@) the satisfactory completion of an approved curriculum in a 
secondary school, and (b) an amount of work in art of approved quality equiva- 
lent to that represented by two years of study in the Art Academy of Concin- 
nati * * *, The course is two years in length, during which the student’s 
time is divided about equally between the professional program of the college 
for teachers and studies in art at the Art Academy of Cincinnati. 
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, offers a five-year 
course in connection with the Cleveland School of Fine Arts, which 
leads to a degree of A. B.*

Students of the Cleveland School of Art who fulfill the requirements for the 
diploma of the Cleveland School of Art and who complete as much as one full 
year of work in the college for women may receive a certificate to that effect 
from the college for women. 
The degree of bachelor of science and the diploma of the Cleveland School 
of Art will be granted to students who have completed three years’ work in the 
college for women and three years’ work in the Cleveland School of Art. 
Regular students, girls, of the Cleveland School of Art, may take up work 
for which they are prepared at the college for women under an exchange ar- 
rangement. 
It will be seen that a considerable number of colleges and univer- 
sities believe in allowing credit for a certain amount of “ art-school ” 
work, done under their own auspices or those of affiliated organiza- 
tions. Where the art work in colleges and universities is given in a 
department of fine arts rather than in the more professional and 
separate school, one might expect to find a greater unanimity of pur- 
pose and some consensus of opinion as to its function, at least as defi- 
nite as would be held by a group of English departments, or depart- 
ments of economics or history. Such, however, is far from being the 
real state of affairs. 
Ten years ago a much greater divergence of opinion as to the scope 
and functions of art departments existed than does to-day, and, al- 
though considerable progress has been made, it is yet difficult to see the 
principle behind the individual case. There are two extremes—on the 
one hand, it is contended that no technical work should be credited 
toward a B. A. degree; on the other hand, it is claimed that work 
should be almost entirely technical and should all be counted for a 
degree. The question really is, therefore, whether any art work is 
worthy of recognition with other cultural subjects as counting toward 
a B. A. degree. If so, what sort of courses should be allowed for 
credit? and if not, whether such courses should be offered by the uni- 
yersity and the students allowed to take them without credit. In the 
discussion of these and kindred topics the colleges and universities 
have lagged far behind the public schools, which in the Eastern Art 
and Manual Training Teachers’ Association and the Western Drawing 
and Manual Training Association have done a vast amount of good. 
Enterprising book firms with drawing and “applied arts” books on 
their lists have in some cases even conducted summer schools for 
teachers, and at any large gathering of teachers, noticeably at the 
meetings of the eastern and western drawing and manual-training 
teachers’ associations, they have had energetic representatives. Even 
this commercial cohesion has been lacking among the colleges and 
universities, and until the past two or three years there has seemed 
to be little disposition on the part of the majority of college art 
departments to “ get together.” The single means to this end is the 
College Art Association.

380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The College Art Association of America was started as a com- 
mittee of the Western Drawing and Manual Training Association in 
1910. In 1911 it became a separate organization and adopted a con- 
stitution. Its aim has-been to supply the cohesion between college 
art departments that had beer so sadly lacking, and it is rapidly be- 
coming representative, influential, and helpful. In 1915 it adopted 
“Art and Archeology” as its official publication. The association 
now includes over 50 of the best-known institutions of the country 
on its membership list, though even yet there are some very con- 
spicuous absences. In many cases the secretary has been unable to 
elicit any response to personal letters, though the institution is ad- 
mittedly the only thing of its kind in the country and is conceded 
to be doing a very necessary and heretofore neglected work. For 
this neglect there are perhaps several reasons. One is that university 
ideals, so far as art departments are concerned, are in a comparatively 
undeveloped state. Again, much loose thinking about art and corre- 
lated subjects has been tolerated by American educators, and the sub- 
ject has suffered as much from misplaced enthusiasm as it has from 
neglect. In some institutions the art department receives a dollar - 
for dollar consideration with other departments, but in others, among 
them the largest institutions in the country, where courses offered by 
the art department are required for students majoring in other de- 
partments, the art department is frequently the last to receive recog- 
nition in the budget. 
A conspicuous exception is the University of Montana, which 
offers five undergraduate courses in the history of art, and two gradu- 
ate courses—a course in appreciation and a course in esthetic prin- 
ciples; ten technical courses in drawing and painting, with two 
teachers’ courses; four courses in design and two in crafts work. 
Students may elect the fine arts as a major, taking 35 hours dis- 
tributed over the three branches of history, representation, and de- 
sign. There is no attempt to teach the subject professionally, as in 
a regular art school, but it is offered as are the courses in language 
and literature, and receives the same recognition. 
This is in decided contrast to the situation at the University of 
Illinois, where a student may count but 12 hours of work in the art 
department for a degree, and the possibility of majoring in the fine 
arts is remote. 
In some institutions drawing and water color were introduced sev- 
eral years ago, because it was thought that a knowledge of the proc- 
esses would be of value to students of engineering, zoology, and 
botany who were occasionally called upon to make graphic repre- 
sentations of their work, and when these courses were added they 
were usually announced in the catalogue under the heading of “Art

  ART EDUCATION. 381 
Department.” Those in charge of such courses attempted to give 
the students some insight into the spiritualizing qualities of the fine 
arts, but without much success under the cireumstances. 
With the rise and rapid growth of departments of domestic science 
there has come a demand, insistent, though formless, for the “ hu- 
manizing influence” of art. Students of household affairs are fre- 
quently required to take two or three art courses before they receive 
their diplomas. Often the courses consist of learning embroidery 
patterns and fancy stitches. In other cases no attempt is made to 
show the student why she is registered in such courses, and the work 
is done in bewilderment, without a pretense of cooperation on the 
part either of the instructor or the student. 
It will not be too harsh to say that wherever an art department 
has been founded without an earnest desire for something beside the 
most grossly tangible results, it has not yet recovered from the severe 
handicap. There are many such departments. 
Many times public-spirited members of the faculties of institu- 
tions without art departments have prepared lecture courses on the 
cultural side of the fine arts, and the college or university has pub- 
lished these in its bulletins as “ Courses in the fine arts” under a 
separate caption. It is doubtful if any of these instructors have 
received financial recognition for such work, though reference to it 
is frequently found among the cultural influences of university and 
college life. The best that can generally be said about such courses 
is that they are prompted by a worthy enthusiasm. Many of such 
“art” courses are offered by professors of Greek or Latin, who have 
become interested in the subject through their studies in philology 
and archeology, but have had no special training in art criticism. 
In regular college art departments the faculties of Harvard and 
Princeton have perhaps taken the lead in the matter of according 
full recognition to the fine arts. The Harvard courses are carefully 
balanced between the technical and nontechnical; students are re- 
quired to take both when majoring in the fine arts. Princeton is 
strongly archeological in its tendencies, so strongly so in fact as 
to question vigorously in public discussions the propriety of allow- 
ing the undergraduate to obtain any technical knowledge from his 
alma mater. 
If the academic art school under university care is considered as 
one extreme, Princeton represents the other, and Harvard occupies 
almost middle ground. It may therefore be profitable to consider 
the Harvard and Princeton courses more in detail.t 
Each member of the Princeton faculty is professor or assistant 
professor (as the case may be) in “art and archeology.” No at-

detail since it has not been taken up in this paper. See Harvard and Princeton bulletins.

tempt is made to differentiate the two subjects. One of the courses 
is announced as follows: 
801. Ancient Art. A general outline of the history of ancient sculpture, 
painting, and the minor arts. Lectures and required reading. In this course 
the preceptorial reading consists of Maspero, Art in Egypt; Babelon, Man- 
ual of Oriental Antiquities; Fowler and Wheeler, Greek Archeology; Perrot 
and Chipiez, Histoire de VArt dans lV Antiquité, Vols. VI-IX. A thesis is re- 
quired of candidates for final special honors on one of the following subjects: 
Minoan and Mycenran painting; Minoan and Mycenran metal work; vase 
paintings, with scenes from epic story; the work of Praxiteles; types of Greek 
coins; comparative study of Greek and Roman portraits; 3 hours a week, one 
term, 
Other courses described in the same fashion are: Medieval art, 
ancient architecture, medieval architecture, Italian sculpture, Greek 
sculpture, the revival of painting in Italy, northern painting, and 
elements of architecture. Some of these are also listed as graduate 
courses. The graduate announcement of titles of courses is: 
For 1914-15, Italian sculpture from the fourth to the eleventh century, 
Italian sculpture from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, two courses on 
Christian architecture, renaissance architecture, Giotto and his associates; 
Giorgione, Palma Vecchio, and Titian; early Christian archeology, Romanesque 
and Gothic sculpture, Greek archeology, art commentary on Greek literature. 
For the years 1915-16 and 1916-17 other courses will be substituted as occa- 
sion requires according to the following provisional schedule: 
Given in 1915-16.—Italian sculpture of the fifteenth century, Italian sculpture 
of the sixteenth century, two courses on Christian architecture, Sienese painters 
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Leonardo da Vinci, Christian sym- 
bolism and iconography, classical numismatics, Etruscan art; Olympia, Delphi, 
Epidaurus. 
Given in 1916-17.—Theories of art, Christian architecture, renaissance archi- 
tecture, Masaccio and the Florentine realists, early Flemish painting, mediseval 
illumination, Byzantine art, Greek archeology, Greek painting. 
It is not expected that all these courses will be elected ; consequently 
the courses given depend, in the graduate school, upon the choice of 
the student from the list offered, though this does not appear in the 
catalogue. 
The schools of architecture, landscape architecture, and the depart- 
ment of fine arts are organized at Harvard into a “division of fine 
arts,” an executive body, one of whose members acts as chairman. 
Though the school of architecture at Cambridge is a graduate school, 
all the announcements of courses in the schools and departments 
named appear together in one bulletin, excepting technical -courses in 
architecture, although two of the elementary courses are included. 
All the courses appearing in the fine arts bulletin, technical and non- 
technical, are counted toward the A. B. degree. This is explained in 
the introduction to the bulletin: 
The instruction provided by the division of fine arts is intended to afford a 
basis for a comprehensive knowledge of the history and principles of the fine
-P-A-G-E-403
  
ART EDUCATION. 383 
arts from ancient times to the present day, to provide a certain amount of 
training in drawing and painting, and to offer to students who intend to enter 
the schools of architecture and landscape architecture an opportunity to begin 
their training as undergraduates. For this reason several courses which are an- 
nounced by the faculties of these two schools are also listed as courses in fine 
arts. Most of these courses are not highly technical in character, and may 
profitably be taken by students who do not look forward to a professional 
career. 
The first course announced as “ primarily for undergraduates” is 
as follows: 
Fine arts 1a. Principles of drawing and painting, with elementary practice.— 
This is a general introductory course in drawing and painting; it is required for 
admission to more advanced courses in drawing and painting. 
The course aims to give an understanding of the general principles of draw- 
ing and painting, together with some training in their practice, the language of 
drawing and painting being considered on the one hand as a useful means of ex- 
pression in many different pursuits, and its practice, on the other, as almost in- 
dispensable for an understanding and appreciation of nature and of works of 
art. The exercises performed by each student are planned to give training in 
the observation of form and of tone relations in nature, as well as practice in 
the methods of drawing and of water-color painting. These exercises include 
delineation, form drawing, color-value drawing, and complete painting from 
objects, and also copying examples of figure and landscape drawing by the great 
masters. The characteristics of the chief schools of painting are briefly con- 
sidered. The course consists of lectures with supplementary exercises. 
There are two lectures a week, attendance being required; also two 
regular hours each week for drawing, in addition to work in outside 
hours. The course lasts through the year. 
There is also offered a half course in drawing for students who 
wish only an elementary training in the subject and do not intend to 
take the more advanced courses. This meets five hours a week for 
the half year. 
Two half courses of a general introductory nature are offered in 
the history of art, with two lectures and a section meeting each week. 
One is given in the first and the other in the second half year, so 
that at the end of the year the student has some acquaintance with 
the art development of the world, though necessarily not a very inti- 
“mate one. With the courses just mentioned as introductory, there 
are then offered the following: 
Principles of landscape architecture; free-hand drawing (first and second 
courses) ; advanced drawing and painting; perspective, technical, and historical 
development of the ancient and early mediaeval styles of architecture; history 
of Greek sculpture; technical and historical development of the Gothic styles 
of architecture ; technical and historical development of renaissance and modern 
architecture; history of mediaeval sculpture; history of renaissance sculpture; 
the central Italian painters of the renaissance; Venetian painting; the history 
of the printed book; the history and principles of engraving; the methods and 
processes of Italian painting; history of Florentine painting; history and prin- 
ciples of landscape painting; history of Flemish painting; the history of
-P-A-G-E-404
  384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Japanese art, with some consideration of the art of China; the theory of de- 
sign; advanced practice in drawing and painting; the art and culture of Italy 
in the Middles Ages and the Renaissance; the art and culture of Spain; and two 
technical courses—principles of architectural design and their application and 
elementary architectural design. There are also offered by the German depart- 
ment, primarily for graduates, two courses—German religious sculpture in the 
Middle Ages and the conflict between mysticism and naturalism in Flemish and 
German painting from the Van Eycks to Diirer. 
Although no special graduate announcement is made, the follow- 
ing notice appears in the bulletin: 
Courses of special study. In addition to these courses competent graduate 
students are afforded opportunities for advanced study in special fields as fol- 
lows: History of engraving, advanced practice in drawing and painting, history 
of architecture, history of Greek art, history of Italian art, history of painting, 
history of Spanish art. 
The bulletin also calls the attention of students to a number of 
courses in archeology which, it is said, may be of interest, but they 
are apparently not considered as a legitimate part of the curriculum 
of the division of fine arts. 
While in one way Harvard seems to occupy middle ground between 
the Princeton attitude and the professional art school, in another way 
she is directly opposed to the Princeton point of view, since she 
claims that some technical knowledge is absolutely essential to the 
understanding of the fine arts, and Princeton maintains with equal 
sincerity that such knowledge is nonessential. 
The only institution of high reputation which is following in 
Princeton’s footsteps is Johns Hopkins. A number of institutions 
are adopting the Harvard plan, though none of them have as yet 
developed it in such detail. The breadth of scope of Harvard’s 
courses may be accounted for in some measure by the proximity of 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and also to the fact that Harvard 
herself possesses a very good small museum and some excellent col- 
lections. 
The respect with which the departments are treated at Princeton 
and Harvard may be gathered from the fact that most of the faculty 
are of professorial rank in both places. Elsewhere, as already noted, 
the situation of the art departments is not so secure. It may be inter- 
esting to note in this connection that, according to a statement of the 
chairman of the division of fine arts at Cambridge, there has never 
been the slightest disposition on the part of the university faculty 
to question the advisability of allowing credit for all courses, tech- 
nical or nontechnical, that have been offered in the art department. 
The size or the resources of an institution are no criteria of the 
number or character of the art courses offered, and so far as the 
character is concerned this is particularly true of the courses in the
-P-A-G-E-405

history of art. A few examples will make this clear. Wisconsin 
has no art department, but a professor of Greek offers one course in 
the history of art.1_ The University of Rochester, Rochester, N. Y., 
has a regularly constituted department of the history of art, with a 
professor who offers four courses.?, The University of Iowa an- 
nounces a department of the history of art, the faculty of which con- 
sists of a, professor of “Greek and archeology,” who offers three 
courses in the history of art. At Western Reserve University, 
Cleveland, Ohio, a professor of Greek offers five courses in art his- 
tory.t At Leland Stanford Junior University, California, though 
there is a department of graphic art, the history courses are offered 
by a professor of Latin.» At Amherst College, Amherst, Mass., 
the professor of Greek offers one course in Greek art. At Oberlin 
College the professor of Greek literature and archeology offers four 
courses in the history of art, covering late as well as early periods.’ 
At Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, it is stated that there are “two 
strong art departments.” One of these is the Normal Art Depart- 
ment, with three instructors, offering eight courses, three of which 
are in handwork. The other “Department of drawing and paint- 
ing” has one instructor and (in the catalogue) no definitely formu- 
lated course.* 
This necessarily slight statement of courses found here and there 
under all sorts of conditions will be sufficient to indicate that, in 
the opinion of the vast majority of college art teachers, there are 
no regularly established traditions regarding the functions of art 
departments or the training and scope of work of instructors offer- 
ing courses in art. 
Equally illuminating are the statements of many drawing depart- 
ments that are divided between mechanical representation and free- 
hand drawing and water color. In most cases in such departments 
all members of professorial rank are those offering the mechanical 
work, while the more artistic branches are consigned to instructors 
and assistants. It is obviously impossible to expect work of high 
standard in any line where academic recognition is not equally 
accorded. 
Equally various are the offerings of the women’s colleges. Among 
some of the smaller ones the art departments show a decided leaning 
toward china painting, but this is generally among institutions

whose diplomas would not admit to the graduate courses in a first- 
class university. In the larger and better known some exceptionally 
good work is done. 
At Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N. Y., the art department offers 
six courses, all nontechnical and as rigidly archeological as are the 
Princeton courses. The institution is fortunate in having recently 
acquired a very expensive and finely-equipped memorial building 
for the exclusive use of the art department. 
Wellesley College, Wellesley, Mass., has made an effort to train 
assistants for art museums, and has done some efficient work in this 
line for the past few years, though no announcement of such courses 
appears in the present catalogue. It is to be hoped that the work 
will not be discontinued. All students in the art department are 
encouraged to take representation as well as history courses, though 
no design is offered.? 
Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts, has a department of art 
and archeology, but in the announcement of courses a clear distinc- 
tion is made between the two types. All the archeological courses 
are announced as such. In the history courses a unique practice 
exists. The students are allowed an option of studying the subject 
from the critical or the technical standpoint, enabling them to follow 
their peculiar bent. Two courses, “Masterpieces of ancient art” 
and “ Masterpieces of medieval and renaissance art,” are offered for 
seniors who have taken no other courses in the department. Courses 
of such nature would be a valuable addition to the curriculum of 
any art department.* 
At Smith College, Northampton, Mass., the work is well balanced 
between technical and nontechnical courses, although the catalogue 
makes a rather puzzling distinction by classing them as “ practical” 
and “theoretical and historical” courses.* Another instance of the 
same sort may be found at the University of Illinois, where a de- 
partment exists under the title of “Art and design.” 
So far as can be learned, the University of Indiana is the only 
institution that offers a correspondence course in the history of art. 
This course is announced by the extension division as follows: 
The department of fine arts offers the following course in the development 
of painting. The aim of this course is to familiarize the student with the 
general development and the trend of the art of painting, and to acquaint 
him with a small number of the greatest artists through the study and examina- 
tion of a small group of the works of each. It is in no sense meant to cover the 
whole history of art or to treat completely the work of any individual artist.

Wherever extension courses are given, such courses as that just 
outlined should be included.* 
Almost all the summer schools of colleges and universities offer 
art work, in many cases without prerequisites. A good many teach- 
ers take these courses as a sort of minor subject, so that they may 
apply for positions where they might be forced to teach drawing as 
a side issue. 
In considering broadly the art education of the country, it appears 
that there is little cause for congratulation. Its possibilities are 
great, but nothing will be gained by refusing not only to face the 
situation squarely, but to admit facts that are set down in black and 
white in multitudes of catalogues and announcements. The stand- 
ards of art education in America are lower than the standards of 
the majority of other subjects. This does not mean that all the art 
work done is of negligible quality, but rather that the average is low, 
and this is all the more a cause for regret when the excellent quality 
of the work of some institutions is taken into account. 
What is particularly needed by the teachers in grade schools is 
more specific training in drawing, if they are to teach that subject, 
and some latitude in the way they handle their courses. In many 
cases all enthusiasm is eliminated by the overconscientious supervisor 
who feels that he must direct every slightest effort of the teacher 
along artistic lines, instead of defining the principles clearly and 
allowing her to develop them with some degree of spontaneity. Of 
course, when dealing with teachers who have had very little training, 
this is a difficult proposition. 
The higher things connected with art require greater emphasis to 
counteract the persistent effort to drag everything down to a com- 
mercial basis. It will therefore be well to do more systematic work 
along the lines of understanding and appreciation of the masterpieces 
of art than to relate all the courses to something that can be sold, 
or given away, or shown with pride as one’s own creation. In spite 
of evident weaknesses, the drawing and art work in the lower schools 
has much more unanimity of purpose than in higher institutions. 
Colleges and universities have the greatest reforms to accomplish 
where art interests are concerned. All that is necessary is to decide 
squarely that the fine arts, if taught in any institution, shall be con- 
sidered of equal importance with the other subjects offered. In the 
1It might be well in this connection to mention the advertisements of schools which 
make extravagant claims of teaching cartooning and sometimes other branches of art by mail. Some of the institutions thus advertising have been successfully prosecuted by the 
Government as having used the mails in a scheme to defraud. 
 
-P-A-G-E-408

388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
majority of cases at present this is emphatically not so. Many uni- 
versities have not given the attention to art that they have to other 
subjects. Distance from art museums deprives them, to be sure, of 
a source of great inspiration and assistance, but this is not a sufli- 
cient excuse for the atrophied condition of art departments in many 
places. 
Another weakness is the fact that art is not considered important 
except for its bearing on other subjects. It is recognized that the 
college student must have some knowledge and control of English 
in order to use it intelligently in the pursuit of other branches, but 
it is likewise conceded that English literature has a value of its own. 
Tt perhaps will not be too great a lowering of academic standards to 
look forward to the day when art will be placed upon the same basis. 
The attitude of the students themselves toward the study of art 
is one of the bright spots on the horizon. Many of them intend to 
follow highly specialized engineering, agricultural, or scientific lines 
of work, yet they frequently come to the art department eager for a 
glimpse into something that they feel is very much worth while. 
It is to be regretted that not all departments of art can give them 
what they feel they need. Sometimes they merely lose their ideals. 
Tt is not hard for a student to know whether he is getting some- 
thing worth while or not, and wherever courses of merit are offered ° 
there is never any difficulty as to the attendance. 
Reasoning by analogy it would seem as if Harvard and other insti- 
tutions offering the same types of courses occupy the most logical 
position of all. One institution with a marked archaeological tend- 
ency requires its students to do some drawing in learning to appre- 
ciate and understand architecture, but does not perceive the necessity 
of any technical study whatever for the understanding of other 
branches of the fine arts. This would seem to be an illogical posi- 
tion, only to be maintained by those who contend that there is no 
reason in art. 
In the discussion of the College Art Association concerning the 
advisability of certain types of courses, there have been many mem- 
bers who have vigorously opposed the teaching of technical branches 
of the fine arts, and maintained that not the slightest technical knowl- 
edge was necessary for intelligent criticism (at least so far as the 
fine arts were concerned), but it is worthy of note that none of the 
speakers urging this point of view had had any training in the 
technique of drawing and painting. 
A committee of the College Art Association was formed to con- 
sider what might be termed a standard minimum course in a college 
department of fine arts, but the presentation of its report aroused 
much antagonism. It was modeled somewhat along the Harvard 
lines, but it was impossible to come to any agreement about it, since  
-P-A-G-E-409
  ART EDUCATION. 389 
the teachers of technique, who were prepared to admit the useful- 
ness of a knowledge of art history, could not persuade the other 
extremists to concede the cultural possibilities of a study of the 
technique- of drawing and painting. The association has conse- 
quently postponed indefinitely the consideration of standard art 
courses. 
In only two universities are courses offered in the history of the 
art of China and Japan. It is practically impossible to secure any- 
one in university work who has anything like an adequate knowl- 
edge of the subject; nevertheless it is necessary that some start be 
made in order that it eventually shall receive the attention and recog- 
nition that it deserves. Harvard and Ohio State University each 
offer a course on Chinese and Japanese art. 
In speaking of art education in the United States it would be un- 
fair not to mention the good work that is done by the art museums 
of the country in a sincere desire to be of greater usefulness and to 
educate the public with respect to their collections. The Art In- 
stitute of Chicago, by a number of constantly changing exhibitions 
and Sunday afternoon and evening concerts, has succeeded in at- 
tracting by far the greatest number. Whether they are attracted 
more by the collections or the music is not as yet clear to the boards 
of administration of other museums which are contemplating the ad- 
visability of doing the same sort of thing. At any rate it is a good 
work and helps people to form the habit of using art museums. 
SPECIAL EVENTS OF THE YEAR. 
The College Art Association, at the spring meeting in Buffalo, 
changed its name to the College Art Association of America. The 
sessions were devoted to papers on subjects connected with the teach- 
ing of art and the principles underlying courses given or proposed. 
A tentative list of books essential to a library for college art courses 
was presented for discussion and was referred to a new committee 
for revision and expansion. One session was given up to source 
material, its care, and uses. At the suggestion of the association the 
president has compiled a list of dealers in different parts of the 
world who make a specialty of photographs of subjects connected 
with the fine arts, and it has since been sent to all the members. 
The association voted to adopt Art and Archeology -as its official 
organ for one year. 
Very encouraging for the progress of art education is the fact 
that the American Federation of Arts chose “Art education” as the 
general topic for its last meeting. The subject was handled rather 
cautiously and the value of the meeting consisted perhaps more in 
that a discussion of the sort was considered timely than in any re-
-P-A-G-E-410
  - 890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
sults of a far-reaching nature. The need of art education was em- 
phasized, but little constructive work was done. 
The federation has done and is doing a great deal, in a general 
way, for art education. It sends out exhibits of paintings and other 
art works to its chapters all over the country and circulates lectures, 
typewritten and illustrated by lantern slides. It also publishes a 
nontechnical magazine, Art and Progress, and the American Art 
Annual, a compilation of items of special interest to those in art 
work. 
A very important organization, the Art Alliance of America, was 
formed last year, and as it supplements directly the work of institu- 
tions, training students for an artistic career, a statement of its aims 
may not be out of place. It was founded by a group of public-spirited 
men and women connected directly or indirectly with the fine arts. 
The constitution states the purposes of the organization as follows: 
1. To promote cooperation between artists, art students, artisans, publishers, 
manufacturers, advertisers, and all others who are engaged in artistic activities. 
2. With the assistance of experts to aid, direct, and advise art students, 
artisans, and artists in their studies and pursuits. 
3. To provide a general registry for artists, art students, artisans, and 
employers. 
4, To provide a department of information. 
5. To hold exhibitions. 
6. To publish information relating to the objects of the alliance. 
The alliance has already proved its usefulness. No commissions of 
any kind are charged. 
The last report of the Western Drawing and Manual Training As- 
sociation contains a number of very well-written papers relating for 
the most part to the interrelations of manual training with art work. 
A committee was appointed to consider the advisability of changing 
the name of the association, so as to include and recognize the grow- 
ing membership in household arts. 
The latest report of the Eastern Art and Manual Training 
Teachers’ Association is devoted largely to discussion of the same 
subject and also contains a paper on the necessity for “State aid for 
industrial art education.” In a paper on the “ Modern art school” 
Frank Forrest Frederick declared : 
I do not believe that there will be much development in American art until 
through some evolution of public opinion or drastic action upon the part of 
educational authorities our art schools are reorganized and conducted more like 
other educational institutions.

ConTENTS.—Kindergarten conventions of the year—Kindergarten courses in summer 
schools—The kindergarten and educational experimentation—The kindergarten and 
the elementary school—Kindergarten training schools—Kindergarten propaganda— 
Legislation—Other items. 
Public kindergartens were maintained in 1,105 cities and villages 
during 1914-15. The number of separate kindergartens (both public 
and private) increased from 8,825 to 9,650 during the year, the 
number of children enrolled from 465,868 to 486,842, and the number 
of teachers from 10,569 to 10,886.1 
KINDERGARTEN CONVENTIONS OF THE YEAR. 
Three meetings of national and international importance have 
taken place during 1915: The International Kindergarten Union 
with the Department of Superintendence at Cincinnati, Ohio, Feb- 
ruary 22 to 27; the Kindergarten section of the National Education 
Association at Oakland, Cal., August 17; and the International Kin- 
dergarten Union convention at San Francisco, Cal., August 17 to 22. 
A better understanding between kindergartners and school super- 
intendents is undoubtedly growing. This was made evident by the 
main theme selected for discussion at the Cincinnati meeting, “ Cor- 
relation of the kindergarten with the public-school system”; by 
the representive group of speakers who dealt with the subject; and 
by the fact that Lucy Wheelock, chairman of the International Kin- 
dergarten Union committee on cooperation with the National Educa- 
tion Association, was elected second vice president of the department 
of superintendence. 
The subtopic “ How may kindergarten practice be improved? ” was 
taken up from three standpoints: That of the superintendent; that 
of the primary teacher; and that of the student of education. Miss 
Wheelock presided over the meeting and presented the following 
speakers: Carroll G. Pearse, president of the State Normal School   
1 Approximate ; subject to slight revision on the basis of complete returns.

at Milwaukee, Wis.; Franklin B. Dyer, superintendent of schools, 
Boston, Mass.; Annie E. Moore, Teachers College, New York, N. Y.; 
Andrew W. Edson, associate city superintendent of schools, New 
York, N. Y.; William M. Davidson, superintendent of schools, Pitts- 
burgh, Pa.; Mrs. Alice O’Grady Moulton, Chicago Normal College, 
Chicago, Il.; Charles H. Judd, director of the school of education, 
University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.; and Randall J. Condon, super- 
intendent of schools, Cincinnati, Ohio. Much of the discussion dwelt 
insistently upon primary-grade practice, as it is and as it should be. 
Another urgent note sounded throughout the addresses was that 
of the obvious need for kindergarten and-primary teachers to acquire 
a better knowledge of each other’s materials, methods, and ideals. 
Supt. Condon declared: 
The kindergartner should know what the primary teacher expects to do 
and how she is to do it; the primary teacher should know what the kinder- 
gartner does and why she does it. While the kindergartner should take into 
account the work of the primary school and should without doubt modify her 
work to some extent from that point of view, yet we must strongly oppose 
any movement which tends to make the kindergarten simply a preparation for 
the first grade. In the largest sense it is distinctly such a preparation, but 
. the kindergarten has its own life to live, its own furction to perform, its own 
work to accomplish, and it must be left reasonably free to do that work in its 
own way. 
Supt. Condon emphasized the fact that if the kindergarten does its 
work well it will afford not only a valuable preparation for the first 
grade but for all subsequent grades: 
The kindergarten should be considered the foundation upon which all the 
other grades build. There should be a kindergarten in every elementary 
school. It should be taken for granted that this is the way a child is to begin 
his school. The kindergarten should modulate from the home to the school in 
the most natural and helpful manner, and in addition it should begin that 
educational development which has a beginning but no ending. While the 
kindergarten has its own field and methods and should be reasonably free to 
live its own life, it does not exist for itself alone, but as a part of a system 
of education that is incomplete without it. As such the kindergartner and the 
primary teacher should clearly and sympathetically understand the other’s 
point of view, to the end that both by working together at the common task 
may so unite the kindergarten and the elementary school that the practice of 
the one may help the other.   Mr. Edson, enlarging upon the theme of including elementary 
training in kindergarten preparatory courses, made the pregnant 
suggestion that the kindergarten teacher be allowed to go with her 
children into the primary grade for a year and then return to the 
kindergarten to receive a new group of beginners. 
In his address on “Expanding the work of the kindergarten,” 
Dr. Judd discussed the principles of sensory training and social 
training, and argued that there was no valid reason why some chil-
-P-A-G-E-413
  KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 393 
dren should not be introduced to reading and writing in the kinder- 
garten. He declared: 
Many a child reaches in the kindergarten the stage of maturity where he 
wants to do what he sees his elders doing. It would be a mistake at this early 
age to make him write if he does not manifest an interest in writing; on the 
other hand, it is a fundamental mistake to keep him from writing if he wants 
to try. 
Many a child reaches the stage before 6 years of age where he wants to write 
his name. He wants to know the mystery of words. Why not satisfy him? 
He will be using his senses, and at the same time he will be learning one of the 
most important lessons of social life. We introduce him to the social art of 
speech ; why not take the next step? 
On the other hand, Dr, Judd reiterated that the kindergarten age 
is not the age for systematic instruction of all children in reading 
and writing: 
There are some children who are slower in interesting themselves in social 
examples. The kindergarten is right in cultivating in such children only the 
simpler social arts of oral speech. My plea is for such a change in the adminis- 
tration of the kindergarten that there shall be no rigid exclusion of any of the 
social arts which fit the needs of the children. 
Miss Moore urged that kindergarten teachers investigate their 
own plans of procedure, then work out their own standards and tests 
and insist that these be applied in all future evaluations of the kin- 
dergarten. 
The entire discussion was characterized by a sincere, vigorous 
effort to offer constructive criticism of kindergarten practice. The 
spirit of the meeting was charged with a sense of going forward to 
meet new opportunities. One such opportunity was immediately 
actualized in the form of a proposal from the National Education 
Association committee on economy of time in education that a com- 
mittee from the International Kindergarten Union be appointed to 
cooperate in the study of the causes of waste in education and the 
allied question of determining minimum essentials in the elementary 
school.t 
Several factors united to invest the meetings in Oakland and San 
Francisco with peculiar interest and pleasure. Education, with 129 
distinctive congresses and conferences, was made the most prominent 
feature of the official series of congresses which formed an essential 
part of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The tangible 
evidences of international fellowship and cooperation were also fruit- 
ful in suggestiveness for closer relationships and reciprocal service. 
Again, it was possible for the kindergarten section of the National 
Education Association and the International Kindergarten Union to 
join forces and thus multiply the strength of the two organizations; 
and yet another pleasant circumstance was the constant reminder of

-P-A-G-E-414
  894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the part played by California in the history of the kindergarten 
movement. It was inevitable that those in attendance at Oakland 
and San Francisco should be thinking of the names of Emma Mar- 
wedel, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Nora Archibald 
Smith, Mrs. Leland Stanford, Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, and others who 
have been so closely identified with the growth of the kindergarten; 
as well as of the Silver Street kindergarten of San Francisco, which, 
through the pathetic little “ Story of Patsy,” has secured for the kin- 
dergarten a permanent place in literature. 
Anna M. Stovall, chairman of the kindergarten section of the Na- 
tional Education Association, presided over the meeting of that 
section. The program included addresses dealing with the kinder- 
garten in its own interior concerns (industrial arts, child study) ; 
the kindergarten in its wider relations (legislative enactments, ele- 
mentary practice) ; and the kindergarten as a factor in the establish- 
ment of a new international spirit. 
The speakers were men and women of note and came from outside 
as well as inside the ranks of kindergarten workers. The place of 
industrial arts in the kindergarten was ably argued by Catherine R. 
Watkins, of Washington, D. C., and Marian Barbour, of Los Angeles, 
Cal. Various aspects of child study were interestingly presented by 
Dr. Maria Montessori, of Rome, Italy; Elizabeth Ross Shaw, of 
Evanston, Ill.; and Gail Harrison, of San Francisco, Cal. The recent 
legislative activities in California were recounted in detail by Mrs. 
H. N. Rowell, of Berkeley, and Lillian Clark, of Los Angeles. The 
relation of the kindergarten to the elementary school was discussed 
in a four-fold aspect by State Supt. Mary C. C. Bradford, of Denver, 
Colo.; State Supt. Josephine C. Preston, of Olympia, Wash.; Lil- 
lian B. Poor, of Boston, Mass., and Supt. C. E. Chadsey, of Detroit, 
Mich. The relation of “ Child education to a new internationalism ” 
was set forth in three illuminating addresses, one by Mrs. May Wright 
Sewall, of San Francisco, one by Mrs. Marion P. Thomas, of Chicago, 
and a third by Supt. Francis, of Los Angeles. 
A significant feature of the discussions was the use of general edu- 
cational terms in place of specific ones intelligible only to kinder- 
garten teachers. This closer approach as regards nomenclature was 
frequently commented upon during the meetings as indicative of the 
increasing number of points of contact between the kindergarten and 
the elementary school. 
The same characteristic features outlined above were noticeable 
throughout the sessions of the International Kindergarten Union in 
San Francisco. The conviction grew stronger with the succeeding 
meetings that the practice of the kindergarten is coming more and 
more to parallel its theory.
-P-A-G-E-415
KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 895 
In a brief sketch of the history of the organization, Mrs. Page, 
president of the International Kindergarten Union, emphasized the 
growth in numbers, the development of important educational 
activities, the affiliation with other great federated bodies, and the 
growth in international relationships. The original membership 
numbered about 30 individuals; now, at the opening of the twenty- 
second year, the membership approximates 19,000 persons belonging 
to nearly 140 branch societies, scattered through the United States 
and foreign countries. According to Mrs. Page— 
Twenty-two standing committees represent some of the expert working bodies 
of the organization, and their activities range from the investigation of edu- 
cational matters through propaganda work to the training of teachers and the 
vital questions of child-study, health, sanitation and hygiene, graphic arts, liter- 
ature, music, administration, organization, finance, publication, etc. 
Recently there have been established relations with the National 
Education Association, the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, 
the Council of National Organizations of Women, and the Woman’s 
Peace Party. i : : 
From many foreign lands come reports of the expansion of kinder- 
garten activities. Kindergartens for little children and training 
schools for young women are conducted in Hawaii, Japan, China, 
India, Persia, Turkey, Arabia, and portions of Africa, as well as 
Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and other countries of Europe. 
Reports from the field at large and from committees confirmed the 
impression that a great deal of quiet, persistent activity is going 
forward. The papers and discussions were forceful, thoughtful ex- 
aminations of practice and theory. The subjects under consideration 
were the training of kindergarten teachers, kindergarten work in its 
relation to health, the kindergarten curriculum, and the relation of 
kindergarten to elementary education. A fitting climax was reached 
at the closing session of the convention in the program to promote 
peace. 
KINDERGARTEN COURSES IN SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
The notable points connected with the kindergarten in the sum- 
mer schools of 1915 are the many normal schools, colleges, and uni- 
versities which offered courses in kindergarten or kindergarten- 
primary work, the large number of teachers taking advantage of 
these courses, and the interesting character of the courses them- 
selves. Over 30 institutions attracted students from various parts 
of the country and sent them back enriched and refreshed for the 
work of the new school year. At some institutions observation and 
practice classes were conducted by experienced kindergartners, and 
the schedules were adapted to summer conditions. At the University 
of California the work of the practice class was carried on entirely 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  
  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
out of doors. The activities illustrated the use of standard mate- 
rials with certain modifications of the exercises such as to fit them 
to American child conditions. The happy freedom and joyousness 
of the children at work and at play made the “garden under the 
trees” at all times the center of attraction for a large number of 
casual visitors as well as for the students 1 who were taking the courses 
in theory and practice. 
The important part to be played by the summer session in kinder- 
garten work, especially in the Southern States, is indicated in a 
statement by Grace Mix, of the kindergarten department of the 
State Normal School at Farmville, Vat. After pointing out that the 
Summer School of the South at Knoxville, Tenn., was among the 
first to introduce a summer course in kindergarten methods and a 
demonstration kindergarten; that the University of Virginia has 
followed its example, and that the newly reorganized George Peabody 
College for Teachers at Nashville, Tenn., established a kindergarten 
as a feature of its first summer session, Miss Mix declares: 
The value of these summer school kindergartens, under the auspices of some 
of our leading colleges and universities in the South, is making itself felt 
slowly but effectively. 
The kindergarten in the summer school gives the opportunity for observation 
which is lacking in many parts of the South. It presents to the primary 
teacher a study of conditions of work with materials somewhat different from 
those she uses, but with children very nearly the age of those she teaches. A 
good demonstration kindergarten suggests to her methods which may be avail- 
able with older children, and its atmosphere, which develops in little children 
attention to the task in hand and helpful fellowship in work and play, often 
inspires in her a desire to know more of the educational principles upon which 
ipods rounded..<.5 =~ * 
The courses in theory connected with these departments are designed not 
simply to train kindergartners but to show to other teachers that the basis of 
the kindergarten is in educational principles which are common to it and the 
rest of the school. 
Even though the immediate result of the kindergarten work at the summer 
school may not be new kindergarten legislation or an increased number of 
kindergartens in the State, right ideas about the kindergarten are disseminated 
and an ideal in regard to it established in the minds of teachers of other de- 
partments. In view of the fact that many unworthy imitations of the kinder- 
garten are scattered over the land, and untrained or ill-prepared teachers have 
taken its name in vain, it is of great value to present standards like those found 
in the summer school kindergartens to correct wrong impressions and give a 
real dignity and force to the name “ kindergarten.” 
Kindergarten courses, especially planned to fill the needs of pri- 
mary teachers, were given at the State normal schools in Emporia, 
Kans., Marquette, Mich., Peru,, Nebr., and Harrisonburg, Va. The 
State normal school in Milwaukee, Wis., offered kindergarten work 
during its summer session for the first time. The work included a 
  
1 Kindergarten Review, October, 1915.
-P-A-G-E-417
KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 397 
cemonstration kindergarten; a course for kindergartners of experi- 
ence on problems of the kindergarten; and a course in games, dram- 
atization, and music; also a course for primary teachers, entitled 
“A survey of the kindergarten.” At the University of Montana, 
Missoula, Mont., a class of small children using both Montessori and 
kindergarten materials was regarded as a laboratory for the demon- 
stration of methods suggested in a course on “The education of 
childhood and youth ”—a course which covered “the educability of 
childhood; some agencies for the education of the children; the 
kindergarten, its nature and values; the Montessori system; the ex- 
ceptional home; the elementary and secondary grades.” The Na- 
tional Kindergarten College of Chicago, Il., recognized the growing 
demand for playground directors by including a course in play- 
ground work in its usual summer session offerings. At Teachers 
College, Columbia University, New York City, there were courses 
given to kindergartners and primary teachers with a view to relating 
the work of the two more effectively. A playground where the 
children built various kinds of houses, using dry-goods boxes as a 
basis, was an interesting feature of the summer session. The various 
houses grew into a sort of village life. The children were nearly all 
above kindergarten age, but their play was directed by one of the 
Teachers’ College kindergartners. A significant type of work was 
done in the department of childhood, school of education, University 
of Pittsburgh. : 
In several schools offering courses for primary teachers only, 
handwork, story-telling, and games and other kinds of educational 
material derived from the kindergarten were accorded a prominent 
place. 
THE KINDERGARTEN AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENTATION. 
The attention given to kindergarten principles in recent educa- 
tional experiments reflects the new scientific interest in Froebelian 
theories. Practically all the schools described in the book by John 
Dewey and Evelyn Dewey on “Schools of To-morrow” definitely 
involve the basic principles of kindergarten education. As the 
authors declare in the chapter on “ Play.”: 
Schools all over the county are at present making use of the child’s instinct 
for play by using organized games, toy making, or other construction based on 
play motives as part of the regular curriculum. This is in line with the 
vitilization of the curriculum that is going on in the higher grades by making 
use of the environment of the child outside the school room. If the most tell- 
ing lessons can be given children through bringing into the school their occupa- 
tions in their free hours, it is only natural to use play as a large share of the 
work for the youngest pupil. 
  
1 Schools of To-morrow,” by John Dewey and Evelyn Dewey. New York, BH. P. Dutton, 
1915.  
-P-A-G-E-418
  398 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
An interesting experiment in the education of young children, of 
special significance to kindergartners, is the Demonstration Play 
School which held its third summer session at the University of 
California, Berkeley, in 1915. This school represents “an effort to 
solve the problems of elementary education by harmonizing the 
child’s extra-home educational experiences through combining, in 
one institution, the functions of the play-center and the functions of 
the school.” Hence the term “ Play School.” 
For the little children the plan absorbs naturally what is sound in the re- 
sults of educational experience since Froebel’s time, and extends the process 
to the tender years of infancy. For the larger children, it brings together in 
a practical school scheme, and extends down the scale of years, the valuable 
results and the ideals which initiated them in many recent educational efforts, 
namely, the “ outdoor school,” the vacation school, gardening, manual training, 
organized excursions, camps, activities of the Boy Scouts and Campfire Girls, 
“training for citizenship,” intensive individual development, etc. 
The play school organizes the children into four groups: Those 
4 and 5 years old; 6 and 7; 8 and 9; and 10 to 13. The activities 
take place wholly out of doors, and the trees are utilized as play 
apparatus in conjunction with ladders, fences, acting bars, wooden 
boxes, building blocks, and other objects to which children naturally 
incline in undirected play. 
In the words of the special bulletin of the University of Cali- 
fornia describing the school: 
The plan correlates and gives a balanced relationship between physical edu- 
cation, moral education, and cultural education. It lays the real foundation 
for vocational training and guidance. Above all, it establishes in school prac- 
tice one of the more recent educational discoveries—the necessity of leadership 
in play from infancy to maturity and the educational superiority of leadership 
in play to instruction in work. It bridges the gap between play and work. 
Therefore the play school may be defined as an outdoor school and play-center 
combined, where the teacher’s interest is centered in the children and their 
activities, not merely in subjects of study, where the educational efforts, in- 
cluding the moral and social, are put on a basis of practical living experience 
radiating into the whole environment, and where children are considered both 
as free, active agents, and as immature social creatures requiring aid, social 
control, and discipline. Instead of teaching subjects, it organizes activities 
out of which subjects develop as they developed in racial history. The activi- 
ties organized are the natural, more or less distinct phases of the child’s com- 
plete life. The usual school subjects develop as phases of these activities.’ 
Any experiment based upon these underlying ideas will be ear- 
nestly watched by those who know Froebel’s theory and practice and 
who recall his Helba project.

KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 399 
THE KINDERGARTEN AND THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
Interest in the various efforts to coordinate the kindergarten and 
the work of the primary grades suffers no abatement. Reference 
has already been made to the prominent place occupied by kinder- 
garten-primary relations on the programs of the Cincinnati, Oak-° 
land, and San Francisco meetings; also to the appointment of a com- 
mittee to study economy of time in education. 
Another discussion is found in a bulletin recently published by the 
Bureau of Education entitled, “Adjustment between kindergarten 
and first grade.” It is a study based upon replies from primary 
teachers and supervisors, from kindergarten teachers and super- 
visors, and from superintendents and principals, to a letter sent out 
by the Commissioner of Education asking what advantage kinder- 
garten-trained children possess over nonkindergarten children and 
what adjustments need to be made between the kindergarten and the 
lowest primary grades in order that there may be a closer relation 
between the two. Miss Luella Palmer, assistant director of kinder- 
gartens, New York City, who prepared the material for publication, 
calls attention to the fact that “the answers to these general ques- 
tions could not be made the basis for a scientific statistical study, 
but any concensus of opinion would show wherein the ideals of the 
kindergarten and the first grade were in accord and what values the 
primary teacher appreciates in the kindergarten training. What- 
ever figures are used in the study Miss Palmer regards as merely 
pointing “the direction for thorough investigation and further ex- 
periment in the matter of adjustment.” 
In summing up the “evidence,” Miss Palmer finds that there is on 
the part of superintendents, principals, primary teachers, and kinder- 
gartners a desire for the better coordination of the kindergarten and 
first grades. The one thing needful to make this an accomplished 
fact is, as several kindergartners stated, a clearer understanding of 
the little child, his point of view, and his development. “It is 
necessary to know the interests and powers that continue to develop 
gradually and the rate of development during the years from four 
to eight. We must know what interests are gradually superseded 
and what other interests are coming into prominence and need to be 
introduced in the first grade.” 
Reports from various sections of the country afford ample evidence 
of measures taken, of plans tried out, with the object of furthering 
the close coordination of the two departments of education. Mention 
should be made of the work of the committee on investigation of the 
International Kindergarten Union, which is making intensive studies 
of kindergarten practice in various cities of the United States, in 
order to find a basis for standards of judgment as to the value of   
 
-P-A-G-E-420
400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
kindergarten training for little children. The cooperating committee 
on economy of time in education has also begun active work. Its 
chairman, Miss Annie E. Moore, of Teachers’ College, Colas 
University, says: 
Studies and investigations made by the National Education Association com- 
mittee on economy of time in education have dealt with the elementary school 
period not including the kindergarten. It is now proposed that the cooperating 
committee from the International Kindergarten Union attack the question of 
waste, which is generally believed to exist at the juncture of the kindergarten 
and first grade. It is our purpose to try to determine whether this “ general 
belief” is justified, by furnishing data showing the results of a year or two 
years in the kindergarten, and also tabulated facts calculated to reveal to what 
extent these acquisitions are recognized when pupils are promoted to first grade. 
It is desired that these investigations shall be made in the most scientific 
manner possible, and this will be conducted very largely by graduate students 
in education in universities and training schools. * * * <A small beginning 
will be made at certain centers in September and October of this year, and 
more extensive investigations will be conducted about the time of the mid- 
year promotions, 1915-16. 
Courses for primary teachers at the summer schools have already 
been mentioned. While these courses included instruction in the 
handwork, stories, and games, less emphasis was placed upon the 
devices and more emphasis placed upon the principles underlying 
the devices. Not only in summer sessions, but also in the regular 
terms of many schools, provision is now made for the preparation 
of teachers to teach in the kindergarten and the first three grades. 
Several States. among them, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Rhode 
Island, Wisconsin, grant certificates to teach in kindergarten or 
primary to graduates of the two-year kindergarten course in the 
normal schools. 
Philadelphia gives a kindergarten and a grade certificate to stu- 
dents who complete three years’ work in the Philadelphia normal 
school, and this year a new plan goes into operation in accordance 
with a resolution adopted by the board of education, July, 1915: 
Resolved, That in order that the plan of holding a kindergarten in the morn- 
ing and a part-time first-grade class in the afternoon, in the same classroom, 
to be taught by the same teacher, be given a trial, the superintendent of schools 
is hereby authorized to try the plan with not more than five (5) classes, the 
teachers thus employed to receive $1,100 per year. 
The teacher must hold both certificates. 
The Boston normal school has lengthened its course to three years 
and prepares teachers for both kindergarten and work in the first 
three grades. 
The board of education of New York City has adopted a by-law 
making kindergartners eligible to teach in grades 1A to 6B. In view 
of that fact, the Public School Kindergarten Association of New 
York City has decided to concentrate upon primary methods in
-P-A-G-E-421
  KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 401 
planning its lectures for the coming season, and a course on this 
topic has been arranged, to be conducted by I. Edwin Goldwasser, 
district superintendent of schools, New York City. Announce- 
ment is made that those who complete the course satisfactorily will 
receive certificates for a 15-hour course in primary methods. 
In Washington, D. C., a successful scheme of reciprocity was car- 
ried out during the year. The supervisor of primary grades and 
the supervisor of kindergartens arranged for a series of visits of 
kindergartners to primary rooms and primary teachers to kinder- 
garten rooms, in order that each set of teachers might see the actual 
work performed by the other set. These visits were followed by 
conferences, where questions were asked and answered and sugges- 
tions offered and accepted. 
A decided advance is noticeable in the number of kindergarten 
and primary teachers who are taking graduate work in child study 
and allied subjects. Intensive study of what the kindergarten really 
is and its real relation to the little child is resulting in renewed 
insight and fresh creative impulse on the part of the kindergartners. 
It is also not without significance that a kindergartner, for several 
years supervisor of kindergartens and primary grades in the schools 
of Los Angeles, Cal., was this year elected to the post of assistant 
superintendent of schools in that city. Miss Fulmer says of her 
new_responsibility: “The same great educational principles are at 
work all through the entire school, from the kindergarten up.” 
KINDERGARTEN TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
_ For the past few years there has been a growing consciousness of 
the need of reorganizing kindergarten training courses. There has 
been a readiness on the part of kindergarten training teachers to 
listen patiently to adverse criticisms and even to administer self-judg- 
ment with a view to strengthening the weak places when discovered. 
When constructive criticism, either from within or without the ranks 
of the kindergartners, has been offered it has met with ready re- 
sponse. Willingness to experiment with materials and methods, and 
open-mindedness in regard to other systems of education, are evident. 
A recent discussion of the subject at the conference of training 
teachers and supervisors in connection with the International Kinder- 
garten Union convention at San Francisco was fruitful in practical 
suggestions, and pointed the way to present and future lines of ad- 
vance. The topic was an interrogative—‘ How may the theory and 
practice work of students in kindergarten training schools be ad- 
justed to gain a balanced training such as will result in: (a) Wider 
culture; (b) intelligent insight; (c) practical efficiency? Papers had 
been prepared by Dr. H. H. Horne of New York University, Dean

Will Grant Chambers of the University of Pittsburgh, and Helen 
L. Gordon of the Wilson Normal School, Washington, D. C. A 
résumé of the three papers was presented by Gail Harrison of the 
State normal school, San Francisco, Cal. Miss Gordon’s compre- 
hensive discussion of the practical phases of the problem evoked great 
interest and stimulated thoughtful questions. A few paragraphs will 
indicate the nature of the discussion: 
Since the training of kindergarten teachers is primarily a vocational training, 
its main purpose is necessarily practical efficiency. This paper will consider 
how this may be best secured by the proper balancing and correlation of 
cultural and theoretical subjects with practical experience in teaching. * * * 
Practical efficiency in teaching can be secured first and foremost by expe- 
rience in teaching, but unless this is rationalized by “insight” and inspired by 
“culture” it will be worse than useless. We are increasing in our training, 
and justifiably, the amount of practical experience in teaching; year by year 
we add to our curriculum, also justifiably, if time permits, such subjects as 
sociology and primary methods to give greater intellectual insight. This so 
crowds our two-year course that much of the purely inspirational work is 
omitted. Year by year we gain in insight; our kindergartens may be better 
than of old in consequence of our greater knowledge, but there is no propor- 
tionate spiritual gain. Our greatest discouragement comes from the lack in 
many of our graduates of what may be called the “ missionary spirit,” the spirit 
which we of the second and third generation revere in the pioneers who have 
made and are still making our own work possible. Before, then, we can be- 
come practically efficient, we must have, more than all else, something of their 
devotion and depth of purpose. 
Yet, with the very great emphasis given to-day to the functional aspects of 
education and life, there is a tendency to eliminate from a training course cer- 
tain inspirational elements which have a very direct and practical value. In 
attempting to “ psychologize ” education we are neglecting to “ philosophize ” it. 
Philosophy and great literature are pushed aside or minimized to make room 
for the scientific and the practical, for child study at too close range. Gen- 
uine enthusiasm for one’s work will do much more toward producing practical 
efficiency than insight or even experience. It is the vision that leads us on 
and much of that comes through a recognition of the values of life, through 
culture. For efficiency is primarily and absolutely dependent upon character, 
personality, buoyancy, a touch of idealism, of faith in the child and the uni- 
verse, upon devotion to work, belief in it, and an ever-deepening and greatening 
sense of individual responsibility. We can secure efficiency only by sufficient 
emphasis on the cultural aspects of our curricula. 
The analysis of the subject matter was very carefully set forth, 
and five groups of subjects were classified under the following heads: 
(1) Subject matter of the kindergarten; (2) child nature, its devel- 
opment; (3) subjects given mainly for technique of student; (4) 
subjects given mainly for social and inspirational values; (5) prin- 
ciples of education. The ground to be covered in each study and the 
aims or values were outlined; the place and importance of practice 
teaching in a well-organized curriculum were emphasized; and the 
following summary of subjects and the time that should be devoted to 
each concluded the paper:

    It is interesting to compare this outline with one which is the re- 
sult of the cooperative work of a committee of 20 kindergarten 
leaders and which forms part of a study on “ Kindergarten training 
schools for the school year 1912-13,” undertaken by the Bureau of 
Education.t The committee advocates “the use of general educational 
terms for courses when advisable, instead of specific ones intelligible 
to kindergartners only.” In accordance with this recommendation 
the term “student teaching” is used to indicate practice work. 
“Kindergarten manual activities” is used instead of gifts and occu- 
pations; and “ kindergarten curriculum” for program work. 
The course is planned for two years of 36 weeks each, five days a 
week, four periods a day, 45 to 50 minutes a period; total number 
of periods, 1,440. 
The noticeable advances in the training schools are mainly in two 
directions: First, toward the school as a whole; second, toward the 
home and the community. In uniting closely with the school, kin- 
dergartners are becoming aware that the period between four and 
eight years in the life of the little child is largely characterized by 
the same instincts, impulses, and interests, and that the educative 
process therefore should be continuous and progressive, not sharply 
defined and changed at six years. Quick to see a new opportunity

for extending kindergarten ideas and responsive to a demand from 
school superintendents for “kindergarten-trained young women to 
fill positions in primary grades,” kindergarten training-teachers 
have expanded and enriched their curriculum so as to give their 
students a knowledge of education in a broad aspect and afford 
them an opportunity for experience in practical work in primary 
grades. This has resulted in several instances in lengthening the 
period of preparation to three years; graduates of such courses are 
then entitled to teach either in kindergarten or primary grades. 
A deep sense of social needs and of the responsibility resting upon 
the kindergartner to become a helpful force in the community has 
found expression in the training school in the shape of courses in 
child welfare, sociology, home making, home nursing, and allied 
topics. Students are given opportunities for practical experience in 
settlement work, in work related to charity organizations, home-visit- 
ing boys’ and girls’ clubs, children’s hospital work, and other occa- 
sions requiring the services of earnest young women. Several schools 
are paying attention to the demand for trained directors of play- 
grounds and are offering preparation for that particular line of 
activity. 
Increasing numbers of teachers of maturity. and experience are 
each year attending classes for advanced study. Not a few find 
their way to the colleges and universities in order to be prepared 
for training and supervision work or to study for advanced degrees. 
Within the past year or so important additions have been made to 
the roster of kindergarten training schools. Among these are the 
new department at Wellesley College, the training school of the New 
York Kindergarten Association, and the new department in Goucher 
College, Baltimore, Md. 
KINDERGARTEN PROPAGANDA, 
Kindergarten interests played an important part in the propa- 
ganda tour across the continent undertaken by the National Con- 
gress of Mothers during the month of May, 1915, and popularly 
known as “A Mothers’ Crusade.” A representative of the National 
Kindergarten Association distributed literature and gave talks on 
the kindergarten to earnest audiences in St. Paul, Minn.; Bismarck, 
N. Dak.; Butte, Mont.; Seattle, Wash.; Portland, Oreg.; and Bur- 
bank, San Bernardino, San Francisco, and San Diego, Cal. 
At the meeting in Portland the 200 delegates who were in attend- 
ance at the National Congress of Mothers pledged themselves to 
work actively for public school kindergartens in their respective 
communities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
  KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 405 
At the Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco 
the kindergarten was placed before the public by means of litera- 
ture for free distribution, lantern slides, and motion pictures. The 
slides consisted of 52 pictures of kindergarten buildings, gardens, 
playgrounds, and indoor activities, and were representative of work 
done in various parts of the country. One film showed the kindergar- 
ten children of the city of Washington in their annual spring play 
festival on the Smithsonian Institute grounds. Two others: showed 
indoor and outdoor play and the work of children in two large pri- 
vate kindergartens of New York City. Another interesting kinder- 
garten film was included in the picturization of the public school 
work of Los Angeles, Cal. 
LEGISLATION. 
California continues to lead the way in legislation. The 1915 legis- 
lature removed a serious obstacle to the extension of kindergartens 
by “a special kindergarten tax fund not to exceed 10 cents on $100 
in addition to other special-tax levies.” This gives a sum sufficient 
to maintain the kindergartens without withdrawing from the other 
grades their just share of public support. Much of the increase in 
kindergartens in California is due to the activities of a special col- 
laborator of the Bureau of Education, who has given her best efforts 
to stimulating interest in the kindergarten. 
Nevada has enacted a mandatory-on-petition law similar to that 
of California. North Dakota also provides that upon presentation 
of a petition signed by the majority of the legal voters in a district, 
kindergartens shall be established and maintained, and that in cities 
of over 5,000 inhabitants kindergartens shall be established and 
maintained upon petition of one-fifth of the legal voters. 
The North Carolina Legislature passed a law permitting the es- 
tablishment of public-school kindergartens, but through a techni- 
cality it will probably remain inoperative. 
Tn the Southern States, notably in North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Georgia, and Virginia, where legislative campaigns for kindergartens 
have been carried on, good results are evident in widespread interest, 
intelligent questionings, and a wholesome ventilation of the entire 
subject of child welfare and education. 
The New York State plan for kindergarten extension attracts 
much attention. A committee, with Miss Fanniebelle Curtis, director 
of public school kindergartens in New York City, as chairman, has 
been created by the kindergarten section of the State Teachers’ 
Association to conduct a campaign in behalf of legislative measures 
based upon those of California.

OTHER ITEMS. 
Dr. Montessori’s demonstration school—The arrival of Dr. 
Montessori in this country and the demonstration of her methods and 
materials in three important educational centers in California (San 
Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) have provided an immediate 
focalizing point for the general interest which has during recent 
years been manifested in her contribution to education. Classes for 
the preparation of teachers were held in three cities; and a daily 
demonstration of the practical work with little children took place 
in a glass-inclosed space in the Palace of Education at the Panama- 
Pacific International Exposition. Students in the training class were 
thus permitted to observe the working out of the theory. Casual 
visitors to the fair were also attracted and interested, and by means 
of this concrete exhibit discussion which formerly dealt with the 
printed accounts now dealt with the tangible practice. 
The kindergarten and the rural school.—The possibility of carry- 
ing the kindergarten into the rural school is in process of discus- 
sion. There is no question as to the need of the kindergarten in 
rural communities; the method of organization and the financial sup- 
port are the chief concerns. So far, reports are confined to isolated 
instances. An interesting report comes from Hollis Center, Me., 
where Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora Archibald Smith have for 
several summers made it possible for their little neighbors to have 
8 or 10 weeks’ experience with a well-prepared kindergarten teacher. 
Better music——The call for “ better music” in the kindergartens is 
being heard and heeded with more earnest attention, and certain im- 
provements are beginning to emerge from the field of effort. Simpler 
songs, shorter songs, fewer songs, more attention to tone, more in- 
dividual work with children are some of the evidences of reform in 
this direction. 
Applications to art and library work.—The application of kinder- 
garten ideas and methods to art and library work is one of the more 
recent projects worked out in a large city. The experiment, begun 
three years ago, is yielding remarkably successful results. A teacher 
in the department of normal art training in the Cleveland School of 
Art is in charge of a group of normal students who are preparing to 
be teachers and supervisors of art, and of a group who are studying 
to be illustrators with the expectation of going into commercial and 
advertising work. Finding the “students at first too academic in 
their point of view, and very far away from childhood,” and realiz- 
ing that even the best German, French, English, and American 
illustrators of books incline “toward the decorative rather than the 
child-life interpretation of the text,” this instructor, who was for- 
merly a kindergartner of wide experience, gives a course in child 
 
-P-A-G-E-427

study and story telling. The child’s interests and play activities 
throughout the seasonal year “furnish wonderful material for the 
art worker.” The simplest form of story is told first, the finger 
play and nursery rhyme; then the fairy tale and folk tale; then the 
myth and the classic story. The stories are worked out by the 
students in black and white, and in color, and are criticised from 
the standpoint of the child and from the standpoint of technique. 
“The work has been exhibited with the highest success,” says the 
report. In a similar manner, the same instructor in working with 
a group of children’s librarians applies Froebelian principles to the 
study of the reading child as compared with the playing child. The 
course is based upon an examination of the book preferences of 
children and the nationalities represented among the youthful 
readers.

EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 
By Wirrarp 8. SMALL, 
Principal, Eastern High School, Washington, D. 0. 
ConreNntTs.—Cooperation in health administration—Schoolhouse sanitation—Medical in- 
spection of school children—Hygiene of the rural schools. 
A survey of the educational field with respect to the relation of 
education to the conservation and promotion of the health of school 
children would reveal an astonishing volume and variety of activi- 
ties. Similarly it would reveal an astonishing number and variety 
of agencies engaged in some form or aspect of school health work— 
agencies as widely remote from each other as the Federal Reclama- 
tion Service and city charitable organizations, or as the Iluminating 
Engineering Society and county health officers. In this chapter it 
is not attempted to box the compass either of activities or agencies, 
but rather to present what seem to be some of the more important 
recent facts and tendencies. This has necessitated the omission or 
the incidental treatment of some really important topics. Among 
these are the recent advances in the science of ventilation; the 
research and educational work of the Illuminating Engineering So- 
ciety; * physical education, athletics, and health teaching; and open- 
air schools.* 
In connection with health teaching the following three items are 
of special interest and importance: (1) Under date of February, 
1915; the New Jersey State Department of Public Instruction issued 
a brief but comprehensive monograph entitled “The Teaching of 
Hygiene and Safety” as a handbook and guide for the teachers 
of the State. (2) In September, 1915, the board of education of 
Kansas City adopted Supt. Cammack’s plan for a department of 
hygiene, the purpose of which is to unify and extend the work for 
the “ conservation of the health of the child,” including in its func-

report of the New York ventilation commission (1915).

land, Ohio. 
8In collaboration with Dr. J. H. McCurdy, of the International Y. M. C. A. Training 
School (Springfield, Mass.), the bureau is now collecting data for a bulletin covering 
adequately these topics.

tion the direction and control of the teaching of hygiene. .(3) In a 
paper in the Educational Review, May, 1915, entitled “The Case 
System of Teaching Hygiene and Preventive Medicine in the Upper 
Grades,” Dr. Harry W. Haight, of Princeton, N. J., presents a very 
suggestive statement of his successful experience with the “Case 
method ” for two years in public-school work. 
With regard to open-air schools, a comprehensive study of the 
subject by Dr. Sherman P. Kingsley and Dr. F. B. Dresslar is about 
to appear in the form of a bulletin of the Bureau of Education. 
This treats of the history, significance, organization, equipment, 
cost—indeed, of all the practical and theoretical problems—incident 
to the open-air school movement. It shows that in 1914 there were 
over 500 such schools widely distributed in the United States. 
An experimental study made by Supt. D. C. Bliss, of Montclair, 
N. J., of the effect upon health of open-window schools was pub- 
lished in the Psychological Clinic April 15, 1915. The results of his 
study indicate that other factors than “open air” in the open-air 
schools are predominantly important. 
The topics selected for discussion in this chapter are: Cooperation 
in health administration, schoolhouse sanitation, medical inspection, 
and hygiene of the rural schools. 
COOPERATION IN HEALTH ADMINISTRATION. 
A notable feature in the progress of school-health administration 
is cooperation of school authorities not only witi health authorities 
but also with responsible voluntary organizations. Such coopera- 
tion, in many places, is becoming much more than a complacent 
willingness on the part of the school to act as a mere distributing 
agent for properly authenticated tracts and oral messages; it is be- 
coming a rational and considered policy in which the several co- 
operating agencies effectively perform their several parts. 
A good example of effective State-wide cooperation is the Minne- 
sota Public Health Association. This is an outgrowth of the Minne- 
sota Association for the Prevention and Relief of Tuberculosis. It 
is an independent organization, financed by voluntary contributions. 
It serves as a coordinating center for investigation and propaganda 
and has relations with the State board of health, the State department 
of education, and other voluntary organizations. The salary of the 
executive secretary of this association is paid in part by the State 
board of health for his services as publicity agent for the board. 
Among the dozen or more “ planks” in its “platform” are the fol- 
lowing, directly or indirectly relating to school-health work: 
Promotion of the teaching of true public health in the public schools, paro- 
chial schools, normal and high schools, through ministers, priests, women’s 
clubs, press. (First educate these; then get them to educate others.)
-P-A-G-E-431
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 411 
Education and remodeling the work of public-health officials. 
Establishment of whole-time district health officers, especially for rural areas. 
Hstablishment of school medical inspection everywhere, to be conducted in 
rural districts by whole-time district health officers. 
Since the organization of the association in March, 1914, it has per- 
formed or projected the following services for school-health work: 
(1) A syllabus of public-health teaching was prepared for the 
State education department, which was distributed by the depart- 
ment to the 16,000 public-school teachers of the State. Later, through 
Archbishop Ireland, it was distributed to the Catholic parish-school 
teachers. Arrangements have been made with the State department 
for a second syllabus, to be issued in the fall of the current year. 
A public-health placard was similarly prepared and distributed to 
about 10,000 schools and other public institutions. 
In cooperation with the Minnesota Federation of Women’s Clubs 
a questionnaire on public health in the schools was prepared and 
distributed to the number of about 8,000. This inquiry was designed 
primarily for the public schools, but has been indorsed by some of 
the Catholic authorities and will be used in some, at least, of the 
parish schools. 
“We are hoping to secure funds for a rural health exhibit to be 
transported from school to school in a given school district, moving 
it from district to district and so gradually covering the State.” 
In cooperation with the State department of education, it is 
planned, to conduct an essay contest on public health in the public 
schools. Prizes of small value are to be awarded to pupils standing 
highest in class examinations upon the material sent out in the 
syllabus on public-health teaching and for essays on these subjects. 
In cooperation with the State board of health it is proposed to 
conduct a health census of the 500,000 children of the State. Such 
a census has been undertaken on a small scale in certain localities. 
In one town of 55,000 inhabitants 8,900 usable returns were secured. 
The results of this investigation showed an average of 34 infec- 
tions for each child before the age of 20 is reached, most of them 
occurring before the age of 8. They showed a higher percentage 
of infection among girls than among boys, and a higher percent- 
age in the schools attended by the well-to-do than in the schools of 
slum districts. 
An example of effective cooperative effort in a great city in which 
the school department is the coordinating agency is furnished by 
Chicago. The school department cooperates with civic and philan- 
thropic organizations in the promotion of health instruction and 
health habits. The list of cooperating organizations includes: The 
General Safety Committee of the Chicago Surface Lines, the Civics 
Extension Committee, the Visiting Nurses’ Association, the Infant

Welfare Society, the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute, and the Eliza- 
beth McCormick Memorial Fund. 
The following report of this work has been furnished: 
The work with exhibits may be illustrated by an account of an exhibit re- 
cently held in one of the large high schools. Some of the young people made 
charts showing the historical and sanitary development of the school district 
from a swamp to a well-occupied business and residence district ; others showed 
on their charts the density of population, the business blocks, the residence 
blocks, and the recreation areas. Labels were prepared in the languages of 
the groups living in the district, children were trained to act as guides, lec- 
tures were given in the languages used by the people. 
After the exhibit had served its purpose in the high school it was divided 
and three sections of it were sent to as many elementary schools, there to be 
visited by the children of the school and by children and adults from the 
neighboring school districts. The other three sections were exhibited in as 
many Young Men’s Christian Association rooms. Similar exhibits have been 
shown from time to time in the field houses located in the parks and in other 
public places. 
The use of the public baths and of the facilities of the bathing beaches is 
encouraged by teachers. The school bath is installed in 84 schools. An at- 
tendant cares for the small children who need baths and supervises the older 
bathers. 
The daily visit of the health inspector, the follow-up work done in the homes 
by the nurses, the exclusion of families in which contagious diseases develop, 
all unite to give an object lesson of a most convincing nature. 
A group of children affected with venereal diseases is segregated in the 
Frances Juvenile Home. These children are under the care of a board of 
managers, physicians of high rank, and competent nurses. The board of edu- 
cation furnishes a teacher for these children and for a similar group in the 
county hospital. Protection from contagion is assured through the care of the 
nurse. 
In the fall of 1913 all high-school children and the normal school students 
were instructed, in a series of three lectures, in regard to personal purity. 
The meetings of the girls were held with woman physicians and the boys were 
instructed by men physicians. These doctors are of high rank in their pro- 
fession. The matters of general health and talks on the subject of physiology 
of the sexes were given in’a most dignified and forceful manner by these emi- 
nent physicians. 
In the fall of 1913 a committee consisting of the coroner, a representative of 
the Chicago surface lines, and three district superintendents prepared a bulle- 
tin on “ Safety First,” which was circulated in the schools. The teachers used 
it as a text for the instruction of children in avoiding accidents, poisoning, 
scalds, and burns. The board of education has permitted the expert from 
the surface lines to give a number of illustrated lectures on the subject of the 
prevention of avoidable accidents and the conservation of life and limb.   
These are not isolated cases; they are rather typical of the move- 
ment toward effective cooperation. Correspondence with State de- 
i partments of education reveals a large amount and a wide variety 
of cooperative effort. The “pupil deputy health officers” of Ore- 
gon* form an interesting phase of cooperation. Idaho, Louisiana, 
  
+See section on health work in rural schools.
-P-A-G-E-433
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE, 413 
Mississippi, Utah, West Virginia, Indiana, and other States report 
various cooperative activities. The State board of education of 
Virginia reports close and effective cooperation with the State board 
of health, the Cooperative Education Association, and the Virginia 
Journal of Education in issuing pamphlets on health topics; and 
with the University of Virginia, the Cooperative Education Associa- 
tion, and the Appalachian school improvement foundation in prepar- 
ing and presenting public lectures and exhibits in the public schools. 
As an illustration of effective cooperation between a voluntary 
association and a school department, eventuating in the integration 
of the special object of cooperation into the organized health work 
of the schools, the work of the School Lunch Committee of the Home 
and School League of Philadelphia is especially instructive. 
This committee has disbanded after an existence of nearly eight 
years. During this period its work has been that of experimentation 
and demonstration. It has established lunches in the elementary 
schools of this city, administered them successfully, demonstrated 
that they can be self-supporting, and it has now issued a final report 
in which the results of this extended experiment are made available 
for use by others. A statement by the chairman of the committee 
declares: 
The school lunch committee is going out of existence because it has voluntarily 
transferred its activities to the public school authorities of this city. At the 
May meeting of the board of education the report of the committee was ac- 
cepted, its recommendations adopted, and the superintendent of schools author- 
ized to extend elementary lunch service immediately to 25 additional schools. 
The committee has carried on its work and is now terminating it, because 
it holds that the function of a privately supported organiaztion is to experiment 
and demonstrate. It never can eventuate on a large scale, and it should not 
if it could. The function of a publicly supported organiaztion is to eventuate 
on a large scale. It can seldom experiment, and it lacks freedom and flexi- 
bility in demonstration. 
The school lunch committee has experimented and demonstrated successfully. 
It is a source of profound satisfaction to its members that the public school 
system is now taking over its work, continuing it, and extending it. 
SCHOOLHOUSE SANITATION. 
A recent bulletin issued by the United States Bureau of Education? 
gives a comprehensive survey of the statutes, judicial decisions, and 
administrative regulations of the several States governing the 
hygiene and sanitation of schoolhouses and school grounds. 
Forty States have enacted laws relative to the sanitation and the 
safety of school plants. The eight States that appear to have taken 
no legal steps in this direction are not necessarily indifferent or in- 
active as to the conditions of schoolhouses, although public sentiment 
and activity have not yet culminated in legal action.   
1 Bulletin, 1915, No. 21, “ Schoolhouse Sanitation,” by W. A. Cook.  
-P-A-G-E-434
  414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
The laws concerning school plants are of varying degrees of 
thoroughness and effectiveness. They invest various central admin- 
istrative officers with authority to advise local school boards, with 
authority to approve plans for school buildings, and with authority 
to inspect and condemn school plants. 
The nine States that empower officials outside of the district to 
give advice have backed up this advisory authority with stronger 
prerogatives. Advice, except in three instances, includes the prepa- 
ration of plans for buildings and the loan of plans where they are 
desired. 
The power of approval of plans, which is more potent in effect 
than the power of advice, is exercised in 30 States; in 28 of them by 
legal enactment, and in 2 through administrative rules. In some in- 
stances State aid toward building schools is conditioned on approval 
of plans by the superintendent of education. 
Twenty-six States have regulations concerning inspection, and in 
over one-half of these the right to inspect carries with it the right to 
compel remedial measures where they are needed. This may mean 
condemnation. 
In many cases these laws regarding advice, approval, and inspec- 
tion lack “ teeth,” because there is no penalty provided either for non- 
observance or for nonenforcement. In other instances the responsi- 
bility for enforcement is so dispersed as to render the laws relatively 
ineffective. In still others the scope of the laws is limited too nar- 
rowly. 
As an instance of a weak law, one State says, in effect, that man- 
agers of public institutions—schools specified, among others—shall 
remedy the sanitary defects called to their attention. The health 
authorities are presumably the ones to call attention to defects; but 
there are no penalties and no enforcing of authority. 
On the other hand, as an example of a strong law, one State says: 
“The inspector of rural schools, the inspector of State graded schools, 
and the inspector of high schools of the State * * * are hereby 
made inspectors of public school buildings.” Any school official, 
member of a board of health, or voter of a school district in this 
State, may complain in writing concerning insanitary conditions 
about a schoolhouse or any imperilment to life or limb of the attend- 
ants. 
In the more recent enactments of laws relating to schoolhouse 
sanitation there is a marked tendency toward correction of previous 
weaknesses. The later enactments are also characterized by breadth 
and completeness, by centralization and definiteness of authority, and 
by the inclusion of adequate penalties for nonobservance of the laws.

EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 415 
Minnesota presents a good illustration of these tendencies. The 
revised statute of 1913 defines the powers and duties of the State 
superintendent of education so as to include control of construction 
of school buildings. The statute reads: 
He shall prescribe rules and examine all plans and specifications for the 
erection, enlargement, and change of school buildings, which plans and specifi- 
cations shall first be submitted to him for approval before contract is let, and 
no new school building shall be erected or any building enlarged or changed 
until the plans and specifications have been submitted to and have been ap- 
proved by the superintendent of education. He shall include in such rules 
those made from time to time by the State board of health, relative to sanitary 
standards for toilets, water supply, and disposal of sewage in public-school 
buildings. In all other respects the authority to make rules for public-school 
buildings shall be vested in the superintendent of education. Under such rules 
and procedure as the superintendent or the high-school board shall prescribe, 
he may condemn school buildings and sites which are unfit or unsafe for use 
as such. 
The law further provides that no contract shall be let until the 
plans have been approved, and— 
In order to carry out the provisions of this section a special assistant has 
been appointed who will be known as commissioner of school buildings. Plans 
and specifications for school buildings should be sent direct to him, as well as 
correspondence relating to this subject. 
The general school law of Illinois was amended by the last legis- 
lature so as to authorize the State superintendent of schools— 
To prepare, with the advice of the State board of health, the State architect, 
and the State fire marshal, for school directors and boards of education, specifi- 
cations for the minimum requirements for the heating, ventilation, lighting, 
seating, water supply, toilets, and safety against fire which will conserve the 
health and safety of the children attending the public schools. 
County superintendents are authorized and directed to inspect 
plans and specifications for the heating, ventilation, lighting, seat- 
ing, water supply, toilets, and safety against fire, and to approve 
only those which comply with the specifications prepared and pub- 
lished by the State superintendent; and to condemn, upon written 
recommendation of the State board of health, the State fire marshal 
or the State architect, buildings that are “ unsafe, insanitary, or un- 
fit for occupancy.” Failure on part of boards of trustees to fulfill 
legal requirements is penalized by forfeiture of State funds. 
It is further provided that— 
Before erecting or remodeling a public-school building the board of directors 
or the board of education in districts containing fewer than 100,000 inhabitants 
shall submit the plans and specifications respecting heating, ventilation, light- 
ing, seating, water supply, toilets, and safety against fire to the county superin- 
tendent of schools for his approval.

    416 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
A drastic law was proposed in the last Kansas Legislature, but 
failed of passage. Its salient features were: (1) A State commission 
of school sanitation, consisting of the State superintendent of 
schools, the secretary of the State board of health, and the sanitary 
engineer of the State university, to “supervise and have full juris- 
diction over the sanitation of school buildings and school premises 
and of all properties adjacent to school premises whereon, or wherein 
exist, or are maintained insanitary conditions”; to approve all plans 
for construction or remodeling of school buildings; to make rules and 
regulations for supervision and control of school water supplies, 
privies and toilets, heating, ventilation, lighting, fire-escapes and 
other matters affecting the physical welfare of pupils; (2) a penalty 
of removal from office for violation of the act or of the rules and 
regulations of the commission, if the violator is a member of a board 
of school trustees; or a fine if the violator were other than a member 
of a school board. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
At the time of the publication of Gulick and Ayres “Medical In- 
spection in Schools” (1908), but two States, Massachusetts and Con- 
necticut, had statutes relative to medical inspection of school chil- 
dren. A few States were reported as having in operation some gen- 
eral laws pertaining to the health of school children. Since 1908, 
21 States have secured some form of legislation upon medical in- 
spection or examination for defects. The triennium 1909-1911 was 
the most productive period. In those three years 16 States provided 
medical-inspection laws of some kind. In 1913 there was one addi- 
tion; in 1914 one more. Strengthening amendments have been fre- 
quent since 1912. 
In 1915 Wyoming was added to the States having medical inspec- 
tion. In two other States, Nevada and Oklahoma, bills were before 
the legislature, but failed of enactment. In five others amendments 
were considered. One of these, the New Jersey amendment, which 
was reactionary in character and sought to change the law from the 
mandatory type, is important because of its failure. 
These laws vary widely in breadth, in local application, and in 
force. Some provide only for examination by teachers of the sight 
and hearing of pupils. These are hardly worthy the name of “ medi- 
cal-inspection” laws, but in a number of cases they have been the 
first step. Others are so broad and general that they vest in the 
designated authorities ample powers for the creation of adequate 
and thorough health supervision. 
The following summary of the desirable features of legislative 
enactments covering health supervision of schools is based upon a
-P-A-G-E-437
EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE, 417 
careful study of the medical-inspection laws of all States having 
such laws in 1913. It includes no feature not found in one or more 
laws then in force: (1) Compulsory health supervision of school 
children; (2) a provision placing the administration of the system 
in the hands of the school authorities with discretion to cooperate 
with the health authorities in an epidemic, etc. (whether the inspec- 
tion should be in the hands of the school authorities or the local 
health board is still an open question) ; (8) inspection by a physician 
to control contagious diseases; (4) annual examination by physician 
to discover defects of a deterrent nature; (5) annual tests of sight 
and hearing by teachers; (6) examination of teachers and janitors 
and regular inspection of buildings, premises, and drinking water to 
insure sanitary conditions; (7) adequate training of students in 
normal schools in conducting tests of vision and hearing; (8) pro- 
vision for employment of school nurses; (9) a penalty or other pro- 
visions to secure enforcement of the law.* 
The classification of medical-inspection laws and ordinances adopted 
by Gulick and Ayres? in 1908 is still serviceable, though some of the 
recent laws are too general in character to fit nicely any of their 
categories. For instance, the Virginia law provides that— 
the school boards of cities and counties may in their discretion select and ap- 
point medical inspectors of school children, whose duties and compensation 
shall be prescribed by the respective boards and who shall report to and be 
under the control of such boards. 
The classification is as follows: 
I, Examinations for the detection of physical defects of school children con- 
ducted by teachers. Usually limited to sight and hearing. 
II, Examinations conducted by physicians for the detection of communicable 
diseases. 
III. Inspections conducted by physicians for detection of contagious diseases, 
combined with physical examination for the detection of physical defects. 
IV. Systems combining examination by teachers for detection of defects of 
sight and hearing and examination by physicians for contagious diseases and 
for physical defects other than sight and hearing. 
Other important aspects of medical-inspection laws are: Whether 
mandatory or permissive, administering authority, and scope of ap- 
plication.

The Massachusetts law of 1906 has had a strong normative influ- 
ence. The term “medical inspection,” as defined in the act, is “held 
to mean the testing of sight and hearing of school children and the 
inspection of school children by physicians for disease, disabilities, 
decayed teeth, and other defects which may reduce efficiency or tend 
to prevent their receiving full benefits of school work.” With slight 
variations, this is the wording of the definition of the aim and scope 
of “medical inspection” in the statutes of Indiana, Maine, Mary- 
land, New Hampshire, New York, and West Virginia. Amend- 
ments to the Massachusetts law in 1911, 1918, and 1914, respectively,  
-P-A-G-E-439
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE, 419 
authorize towns to appropriate money for the employment of dis- 
trict or other nurses; cities and towns to provide free meals for 
school children, and cities and towns to establish and maintain dental 
dispensaries for children of school age.* The Maryland law of 1914 
provides also for the establishment of special schools for defectives 
and the employment of school nurses “to visit parents to assist in 
securing the medical attention required ;” and also provides that the 
State normal schools shall give “ suitable instruction ‘and practice for 
testing sight and hearing of school children.” 
West Virginia specifies an “accurate and complete record of each 
pupil examined, the examination to cover heart, lungs, eyes, ears, 
throat, teeth, contagious or infectious diseases, skin diseases and mea- 
sles.” A number of States specify also the inspection of school build- 
ings and grounds and the examination of teachers and janitors. The 
New Jersey law provides specifically for control and prevention of 
communicable disease, for sanitary inspection, and for the annual 
physical examination of all school children. The New York law has 
a strong enforcement clause, placing the enforcement of the law in 
the hands of the State commissioner of education and authorizing 
him to withhold at his discretion State moneys from districts not ful- 
filling the law. It further authorizes the State department to employ 
a State school medical inspector. Like Massachusetts and Maryland, 
it authorizes employment by districts of school nurses.? 
It is worthy of notice that the initiation of medical inspection has 
not anywhere waited upon specific enabling legislation. School 
medical inspection was practiced in every State having now a medical 
inspection law prior to the enactment of such a law. Likewise it is 
practiced to-day in every State not having a specific enabling law. In 
1914 out of 1,466 cities of over 4,000 population, from which the 
United States Bureau of Education received accurate information, 
750 reported some form and degree of “ medical inspection.” Every 
State was represented. School nurses were reported as employed in 
one or more places in all but nine States. Illinois, Minnesota, and 
Wisconsin, none of which have State medical inspection laws, show 
some of the best examples of organized health supervision in the 
schools. In most States the general powers of the health or educa- 
tion authorities are adequate; and in a number of instances (e. g., 
Minnesota State Board of Health) broad and effective work has been 
done under administrative orders having the force and effect of law. 
In general, the value of State laws is in their standardizing and 
stimulating influence. The definition of aim and scope of the work 
even where the laws are merely permissive generally brings results 
both quantitative and qualitative. Indeed the moral compulsion of

permissive laws is probably as effective as the legal compulsion of 
mandatory laws in communities that have not grasped the significance 
of such Iaws. : 
Two gratifying tendencies appear in recent legislative and ad- 
ministrative dealing with “ medical inspection”: The broadening of 
the scope of medical inspection and the recognition of the educa- 
tional department as the proper administrative authority. They are 
interdependent. ° 
The first of these has been suggested in the first part of this sec- 
tion dealing with the scope of recent enactments. The almost chaotic 
condition of the use of terms in this field is a sign of healthy progress. 
The following list is not complete: “ Medical inspection,” “medical 
examination,” “medical and sanitary examination,” “health work in 
the schools,” “school health supervision,” “medical supervision,” 
“school health administration,” “educational hygiene,” “ depart- 
ment of school hygiene,” “bureau of child hygiene,” “department 
of health and development.” All recent books on this subject; the 
discussions in educational, civic, and medical organizations; and the 
discussions in the popular press as well as in the educational and 
scientific journals bring clearly into relief the broadening scope and 
the fundamental character of the health movement in education. 
The narrower problem of medical or health supervision is coming to 
be conceived in its true relation to the broad and fundamental ques- 
tion of educational hygiene. 
This inevitably leads to a recognition of the school authority as the 
proper locus of administration of all health work in education. 
From the beginning it has been recognized that the expense of 
medical inspection is a proper charge upon the school funds. In 
a few instances nothing is specified in this respect in the State laws, 
but in most cases it is specified that the expense is to be borne by the 
school department. This is almost universal. In Pennsylvania, for 
instance, where the fourth-class districts are under the administrative 
jurisdiction of the State health department, the expense is charged 
to the school fund. It is also generally recognized that responsibility 
for organizing medical inspection rests with the educational authori- 
ties.. Reference to the table on page 418 shows that in 20 States the 
law vests the power to organize medical inspection in the educational 
authorities. Only two States, by legal enactment, have placed medi- 
cal inspection with the health authorities—North Carolina, with the 
county health authorities, and Louisiana, by specifically authorizing 
the State health department to make rules. 
The difficulty is in the administration of this function. Medical 
inspection antedates all State medical inspection laws. It began as 
an exercise of the police power of health authorities to protect the 
public health through the inspection of school children for the de-
-P-A-G-E-441

tection and control of communicable disease. Systems were organ- 
ized and in effective operation by health authorities before the 
broader educational significance was recognized. Technique and 
experience were with the health departments. Naturally there has 
been a good deal of controversy over the locus of administrative re- 
sponsibility. This has been reflected in some of the statutes, espe- 
cially in those of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In these two 
States in communities where medical inspection had been organized 
by health authorities prior to the enactment of the law, it has been 
permitted to the health authorities to retain control, provided they 
satisfy the demand of the educational authorities with respect to 
quality and extent of work. In Massachusetts, the health authorities 
may also initiate medical inspection, if agreeable to the educational 
authorities. In Pennsylvania, control is divided—in districts of the 
first three classes it is lodged with the school boards; in fourth-class 
districts (rural), it is with the State health commissioner. 
Events, however, as well as logic point clearly to the concentra- 
tion of administrative control in the school authorities. Within the 
past year such control has passed from health to school authorities 
in two large cities, Boston and Washington. In the latter city the 
transfer was made by act of the last Congress. 
The change in Boston is significant as the final solution of a long 
controversy. For some years the Boston school committee has ad- 
ministered, through its department of school hygiene, all phases of 
health work in the schools, except the inspection for contagious dis- 
eases. Even the control of the school nurses was under the school 
authorities. Such a bifurcation of control was a self-evident ab- 
surdity. The transfer of control to the school committee was made 
when the board of health, in June, 1915, voted that— 
on and after the 1st day of July, 1915, the board of health shall no longer 
maintain the medical inspection of the children in the public schools of the 
city, as the school committee has voted to exercise the powers and to perform 
the duties provided by law for the appointment of school physicians and for the 
maintenance of such medical inspection. 
A statement issued by the board of health explains that— 
the division in the charge and control of the work of medical inspection * * * 
by having the school committee appoint the nurses and the board of health 
appoint the school physicians seemed to the board of health unnecessary and 
to result in less efficient service than if complete authority for the subject were 
reposed in one department. 
Boston now has a complete and unified organization for educa- 
tional hygiene. Immediately upon assuming control the school com- 
mittee took an important step toward more efficient medical inspec- 
tion by reducing the number of inspectors from 80 to 40 and raising 
the compensation from $300 to $500. This is not the most desirable 
   
-P-A-G-E-442
  422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
arrangement, as it retains the plan of employing a large number of 
part-time physicians instead of a small number of full-time inspec- 
tors. Appointments are to be made by competitive examination. 
Returns from 1,466 cities and towns received since November, 1914, 
show the following data relative to medical inspection (elementary 
schools only) :

The notable thing in these figures is the number of school clinics, 
dental, psychological, and general. The maintenance of clinics is 
coming to be recognized as essential to effective health work in the 
schools. A special inquiry by the Bureau of Education relative to 
school clinics in 1914 showed a preponderating weight of opinion 
on the part of those responsible for health supervision in favor of 
school clinics. Out of 608 replies, 350 favored the establishment of 
school clinics; 24 opposed; the rest were noncommittal. The reason 
given in most cases was the inadequacy of existing clinical agencies. 
Other reasons were “conservation of the time of school children and 
school nurses,” and “ control by the school of facilities for treatment.” 
Undoubtedly the establishment of school clinics and the organization 
of systematic use of existing voluntary agencies is one of the most 
important administrative problems in the development of educational 
hygiene. It should be noted that not all of the cities reporting school 
clinics really have well-organized clinics. In a good many cases the 
clinic is maintained by the voluntary unpaid service of physicians, the 
school board merely furnishing the room and equipment. Such cases
-P-A-G-E-443
  
EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 423 
are purely tentative and frequently are abandoned. At first the 
physicians are enthusiastic and the results are substantial, but, in 
course of time the interest and enthusiasm wane and the project fails. 
A voluntary organization, in the nature of the case, is temporary. It 
serves only to demonstrate the value and practicability of the idea. 
As the value and practicability of the school clinic have now been 
abundantly demonstrated both in this country and in foreign coun- 
tries, it is inadvisable now for communities to.go through the motions 
of proving what is already proved. 
HYGIENE OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS, 
In the past. three or four years there has developed a significant 
and gratifying interest in the health problems of the rural schools. 
Prior to that there had been sporadic attempts at betterment of 
rural conditions. ‘These had dealt almosteexclusively with gross 
sanitary conditions and with improvement of rural-school architec- 
ture. It was pointed out at the Fifteenth International Congress on 
Hygiene and Demography, in a discussion, that whereas more than 
half of the American school children were in the rural schools, prac- 
tically nothing had been done in this field in the way of health super- 
vision. The proceedings of the school hygiene section of that meeting 
show nothing of importance and, in the exhibits, only the collapsible 
models of rural-school houses, shown by the United States Bureau of 
Education, and some jacketed stoves by various manufacturers were 
especially significant. The Fourth International Congress of School 
Hygiene (Buffalo, August, 1913), again was almost barren of papers 
and exhibits relative to rural-school conditions. The bureau’s sum- 
mary ” of the papers contains only one specifically rural-school topic, 
“Tntestinal Parasites and the Rural School,” by Dr. Ferrell, of the 
Rockefeller Sanitary Commission. In the introduction to the bulletin 
appears the following generalization in regard to health supervision 
in rural schools: 
A more fundamental problem is the extension of health supervision to country 
schools. Here again the rural school is much behind the city school. If medi- 
cal supervision takes the course of other changes in education, it will proceed 
from the city to the State, and may eventually reach all the rural districts if 
State supervision is made effective. Where there is a county organization the 
task of reaching the hygienic needs of the rural school is by no means im- 
possible; but adequate State support and control are essential if this and other 
needed improvements are to be made in rural educational facilities. The begin- 
nings of State medical inspection are visible in a few States. Colorado has a 
State plan that is reported to be working satisfactorily, Pennsylvania sends 
medical inspectors into remote country districts, and New York has a recent 
law providing for medical inspection in every school in the State, the results of 
which will be watched with interest.

    424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Some of the more important manifestations of interest in the 
health problems of the rural schools are the following: 
1. The joint committee on health problems in education of the na- 
tional council of the National Education Association and of the 
American Medical association was created at the meeting of the 
National Education Association in 1913. Up to the present it has 
devoted itself almost exclusively to the rural school problem. The 
first fruit of its labors was the report submitted to the St. Paul 
meeting of the National Education Association in 1914 proposing 
a standard of “Minimum sanitary requirements for rural schools,” 
which should be demanded by “educational authorities and by 
public opinion of every rural school in the country.” The items 
for which standards are erected are: Location and surroundings, 
schoolhouses, ventilation and heating, lighting, cleanliness, drinking 
water, water for washirg, furniture, toilets, and privies. 
It is further stated in the report that— 
No community should be satisfied by the minimum requirements indicated in 
the foregoing, but every country school should be so attractive and well equipped 
as to minister with some abundance of satisfaction to the physical, mental, 
eesthetic, social, and moral well-being of those who provide it, who own it, who 
use it, and who enjoy it. 
The report refers to the “deplorable conditions of rural school- 
houses” and specifies the following reasons for the existence of such 
conditions: 
Low architectural and sanitary standards in rural regions; ignor- 
ance regarding the physical, mental, social, and moral effects of un- 
attractive and insanitary school buildings; false economy of school 
boards; and lack of State supervision and assistance. 
Improvement, according to the report, can be effected by two gen- 
eral measures: (1) “A popular campaign of education regarding the 
conditions desirable and possible in the country school”; and (2) 
“mulation and competition should be recognized and rewarded in 
ways that will promote wholesomely and progressively the welfare 
of the community as a whole.” 
The following are designated as important “issues” in such a 
campaign of education: 
(a) The United States Bureau of Education and State departments of edu- 
cation should furnish plans and instructions for construction and equipment 
of rural-school buildings. 
The United States Bureau of Education in Washington is already supplying 
on request valuable help of this kind, and a few State departments of education 
are demonstrating what may be done by supervision and support which aid 
without controlling. 
(b) State departments of education should supply supervision of rural 
schools and should have power:

EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 425. 
(1) To condemn insanitary and wholly unsuitable buildings and school sites. 
(2) To give State aid to rural schools when the local authorities fulfill cer- 
tain desirable and reasonable conditions. 
(c) Ideas ‘and standards of school sanitation should be inculcated in minds 
of local school patrons and school authorities who control school funds and 
who administer the affairs of the schools. Public lectures on health topics 
should be provided in the schoolhouse and elsewhere. 
(d) Effective school health courses should be introduced in normal schools 
and teachers’ institutes. 
Better education of rural-school teachers, county superintendents, and rural- 
school supervisors in the principles and practice of school hygiene and sanita- 
tion should be assured. 
(e) Interest in and enthusiasm for the improvement and care of all features 
of the school and its surroundings which affect health and happiness should be 
inspired in the minds of rural-school pupils. 
Organizations such as “ Pupils’ boards of health,” “ Civic leagues,” or “ Health 
militias” may profitably be formed among pupils. 
(f) Organizations like “the Granges,” women’s clubs, county medical 
societies, and other groups so situated that they may further the cause of 
health and efficiency should cooperate with the rural board. 
(g) Attractive but reliable health information should be furnished abun- 
dantly by the public press. 
Arrangements have been completed for the distribution of three- 
quarters of a million copies of this report by the United States 
Bureau of Education. The report should thus reach most of the 
rural-school teachers throughout the country and in itself should 
be an important campaign document. 
Another important contribution made by this committee is an. 
investigation of the actual health and sanitary conditions in rural 
schools. The results were shown graphically in the education ex- 
hibit of the Panama-Pacific Exposition. 
(a) Comparative statistics of defects in school children show less 
defect among city children than among country children. One chart 
giving the relative percentages of 18 defects in the school children of 
the cities and rural districts of five States showed that for all defects 
except two, the prevalence of defect was much greater among the 
children of the rural schools. 
(6) The deplorable sanitary conditions in rural schools were pre- 
sented in a chart showing the results of careful investigation of 109 
rural schools in five States: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
Vermont, and Maryland. There was an astounding prevalence of 
insanitary and indecent conditions. Unclean privies, bad ventila- 
tion, inadequate lighting, defective cleaning, and unhygienic furni- 
ture are common. Out of 3,572 rural schools in Pennsylvania in- 
spected by the State health department, 3,036, or 85 per cent, were 
found to be insanitary in one or more of the points mentioned. 
Both supply and distribution of water are undesirable. Of the 109 
schools mentioned above more than one-half depend upon dug wells 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
    426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
for water supply and upon open pails for distribution. Reports 
received by the committee from 1,258 rural schools in 18 States show 
the common drinking cup in use in 580, or 46 per cent, of these 
schools. 
(c) Another important fact presented graphically by the com- 
mittee’s exhibit is that, in general, health supervision does not exist 
in the rural schools. Of the 20 States having health supervision 
laws, only 8 provide for inspection in the rural schools. In the 
other 12 the statute applies only to city schools. Reports from 
1,262 rural schools in 18 States (two counties in each State) show 
that medical inspection was practiced in only 61 schools, dental care 
in 68, and sight and hearing were tested in only 294 and 238, re- 
spectively. Similarly only 6 States report provision for warm 
lunches in any rural schools, whereas 27 States report warm lunches 
in some city schools.t 
2. The Rockefeller Foundation International Health Commission 
is doing a large work of investigation and education. In coopera- 
tion with local educational and health authorities the commission has 
conducted surveys and educational campaigns in several of the States 
where hookworm disease is prevalent. Incidentally these investiga- 
tions and demonstrations have stimulated interest in the general 
health problems of the rural schools and rural communities. The 
exhibit of the commission at the Panama-Pacific Exposition had as 
its keynote “Teaching the people by demonstration.” Wax models, 
pictures, graphic charts, and other devices were used to show the 
ravages of the hookworm disease and the details of the campaign 
that has been waged for the eradication of the disease. The ex- 
hibit showed that during this five-year campaign more than 500,000 
children of school age (6-18, inclusive) in all Southern States had 
been examined for hookworm disease and that 216,828, or 39 per 
cent, were found infected; 2 out of every 5 children of school age. 
By the same concrete means the meaning of infection was clearly 
shown: Impaired health; greater susceptibility to other diseases; 
stunted growth; dulled mind; diminished results of teaching; 
blighted manhood and womanhood. Another important feature of 
the exhibit, perhaps the most important, was the demonstration of 
improvement in community well-being by the elimination of insu 
tary and the substitution of sanitary living conditions. 
It will be noted that the work of the International Health One 
mission is primarily a general community service and concerns itself 
with school health problems only as these are integral with com- 
1 Many of these charts and of the exhibits subsequently referred to are reproduced in a 
bulletin to be issued by the Bureau of Education on “ Education Exhibits at the Panama- 
Pacific International Exposition.”

munity problems. In this respect it is like the work of many other 
organizations, such as the Antituberculosis Society, which working 
directly upon the community at large and incidentally and coopera- 
tively with the schools exert tremendous influence in the improve- 
ment of school conditions. As shown in another section, coopera- 
tive effort is the significant feature of organized health work. 
3. The United States Public Health Service has conducted some 
sanitary surveys that involve rural school problems. In its exhibit 
in the Liberal Arts Building at the Panama-Pacific Exposition were 
shown, in striking contrast, models of a sanitary and an insanitary 
country school. The latter bore the date of “A. D. 1890” and car- 
ried the following legend: 
In the erection of this building no attention was paid to proper lighting or 
sanitary environment. The surface privy pollutes the soil, increasing the dan- 
ger of infection by hookworm and other intestinal parasites. These breed 
in the manure in the horse shed and may transmit typhoid fever. The well 
is so located that surface drainage from the privy and stable may contaminate 
the water supply. No provision is made for physical exercise. The lack of 
individual drinking cups favors the transmission of disease. 
The sanitary country school, dated “A. D. 1914,” was intended to 
fit the following requirements: 
This school building was constructed with a view to proper lighting and 
ventilation. The privy is of the type known as the L. R. S. privy. The horse 
shed is kept clean and the manure is in a covered bin to prevent fly breeding. 
The water supply is from a driven well, incased with concrete cap, to prevent 
contamination by surface drainage. There are no roof gutters except over 
doors, and the surrounding ground is drained so that there may be no breeding 
places for mosquitoes. A playground and school garden are provided. Hach 
child is required to have an individual drinking cup. 
4. Through its Town and County Nursing Service, the American 
Red Cross is prepared to place qualified visiting nurses in rural dis- 
tricts, in towns of less than 25,000, and for county work. Red Cross 
visiting nurses are appointed to communities where the same local 
organization that finances and directs the work has regularly affili- 
ated with the town and county nursing service. These nurses give 
instruction in the home, teaching families the care of the sick, pro- 
tection against disease, and the general principles of hygiene and 
sanitation. They give talks to school children, to Boy Scouts and 
Campfire Girls, to groups of mothers, to parent-teachers’ associa- 
tions, and to other clubs and classes for young and old. Red Cross 
visiting nurses are now employed in 34 communities. 
Several of the nurses are teaching mothers’ helpers classes, giving 
instruction school hygiene in teachers’ training schools, starting den- 
tal clinics in rural schools, and developing rural-school nursing along 
with the various forms of their community service. 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
  428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Effort is made by this arm of the Red Cross service to interest 
educational institutions in conjunction with visiting nurses’ associa- 
tions in various sections of the country to provide training courses 
in public health work. There is as yet no training center west of 
the Mississippi, but the University of Colorado has the matter under 
consideration. 
The directors of this service wish to affiliate with school boards, as 
well as with private organizations undertaking school nursing. The 
Red Cross service is likely to be the standard source of supply for 
rural-school nurses, as well as for information in regard to rural- 
school nursing problems.* 
5. During the past two years a number of State laws have been 
proposed or enacted,” and a great many administrative bodies have 
promulgated regulations which breathe the spirit of the recommenda- 
tions of the joint committee on health work in education referred to 
above. In some cases it is probable that they have been directly 
inspired by the report on minimum requirements. 
(a) The State Board of Health of Kentucky, under its regula- 
tion having the force and effect of law, requires specific types of sani- 
tary toilets and privies to be constructed in every school or other 
public building in the State not on lines of sewers. A full description 
and plans of the “ Kentucky sanitary privy ” are given in the bulletin 
of the Kentucky Board of Health for July, 1914. A good many 
schools have already installed the required improvement. 
The Mississippi State Board of Health has taken similar action. 
(6) The State Board of Education of Pennsylvania has issued 
an admirable 70-page bulletin entitled “School Architecture: One, 
Two, Three, and Four Room School Buildings.” “The purpose of 
the bulletin is to present to boards of directors suggestive standard 
plans and limited specifications for the construction of one, two, 
three, and four room buildings.” ‘Local boards are required to em- 
ploy architects to prepare plans and specifications which, however, 
must be submitted for approval to the architect of the State board 
of education. “Standard plans supplied by the State board of 
education may be changed to suit local needs, but before any legal 
contracts can be made such changes must be submitted to the State 
board of education.” “This specifically requires that schoolhouses 
built hereafter must conform to the modern principles of lighting, 
heating, ventilating, and physical activity.” To insure such con- 
formity and to encourage local communities to provide attractive 
schoolhouses, constructed with due regard for modest artistic effects 
of grace and beauty and surrounded by large and well-kept grounds

-P-A-G-E-449
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 429 
“this bulletin is issued under the direction and authority of the State 
board of education.” 
The bulletin states simply and succinctly the elementary require- 
ments relative to character of sites, floor and air space, lighting, 
heating and ventilation, fire protection, construction and care of 
toilets and playgrounds. It is amply illustrated not only with 
plans of school buildings but also with cuts representing hygienic 
school furniture, hygienic provisions for drinking water, jacketed 
stoves, and various types of sanitary toilets. Furthermore, there are 
clear and definite instructions in regard to many phases of school 
hygiene and sanitation. 
The bulletin is much more than a handbook on rural-school archi- 
tecture; it is also a statement of proper hygienic operation of a sani- 
tary school plant. 
(¢) The Oregon State Department of Education has put into 
effect a plan that actualizes the recommendation of the “joint com- 
mittee ” relative to encouraging “emulation and competition in ways 
that will promote wholesomely and progressively the welfare of the 
community as a whole.” In the four-page leaflet entitled “ Stand- 
ardization of Rural Schools” 15 of the constituent elements of a 
good school are briefly and cogently stated. Of the 15 “standard” 
requirements 5 are “sanitary ”—lighting, heating and ventilating, 
grounds, drinking water, and toilets. The purpose is to erect a 
“standard to which each rural district must bring its school, a 
measuring rod by which the farmer may be convinced that he has 
not as a rule been providing house and grounds equal to those for 
his cattle and horses.” 
The requirements are printed on a large card and hung on the 
front wall of each rural school. At each regular visit the county 
superintendent inspects the school and fastens a gold star opposite 
each requirement that has been fully met. When all the require- 
ments are fulfilled, a pennant is awarded to the school. Methods 
are suggested for enlisting the active interest of the community, as 
well as of teachers and pupils, in this wholesome and inspiriting com- 
petition. 
Oregon contributes another interesting idea in a plan for com- 
missioning pupils as deputy health officers. In cooperation with 
the State department of education, the State board of health has 
offered to deputize one pupil in each school whose duty it becomes 
to look after the matter of lighting, ventilation, water supply, toilets, 
and buildings and grounds. The pupil taking this office receives 
from the State board of health a metal health officer’s badge and a 
little circular of instructions on sanitation. These deputy health 
officers are being appointed in a large number of schools of the State.
-P-A-G-E-450
  430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Other features, promoted by State departments of education, that 
are of special significance for rural schools are motion picture ex- 
hibits, in cooperation with State health departments and tuberculosis 
organizations; “health day campaigns” (Arkansas, Alabama, New 
York, and others); special emphasis on rural hygiene in teachers’ 
institutes (New Hampshire, Utah, New Mexico, and others); a 
division of medical inspection in the State Education Department of 
New York. 
6. State educational institutions in a number of States are per- 
forming important practical services. The following are typical: 
Kansas State Normal School.—The school has designed what is 
known as the Emporia model plan. Blue prints for building plans 
are sent to boards desirous of building a modern structure. The 
plans are designed as a social center building as well as schoolhouse. 
The school is intended for school purposes, entertainments, and Sun- 
day school, and other social center uses. 
Washington State Normal School, Cheney.—The school has organ- 
ized a department of health education which extends its influence 
into the rural demonstration schools and the country round about 
where health examinations are held and the children given informa- 
tion and lectures on personal health improvement. Much work is 
also done to encourage improvement in school architecture with a 
view to making the school premises as wholesome and sanitary as is 
possible. 
Utah State College of Agriculture, Legan.—Rural sanitation is a 
constant part of the instructional work of the college proper and the 
educational division. Through special lectures, farmers’ institutes, 
and county agents definite instruction is given in sewage disposal, 
house-fly control, water supply for rural homes, school building con- 
struction and the like. Practical headway has been made in the 
reconstruction of many of the older type of rural schoolhouses. 
7. Feeble-mindedness and the rural schools. The problem of 
amentia in the rural schools is one to which as yet little careful study 
has been given. There are few urban school systems to-day that do not 
make some provision for atypical children both in the way of exami- 
nation and special training. On the other hand there are few rural 
schools that have done anything in either respect. Furthermore, in- 
vestigation of feeble-mindedness in rural districts is much less ad- 
vanced than in cities. The data mentioned above in regard to the 
relative prevalence of defect in city and country school children 
showed more mental defect among country than among city children. 
These data are suggestive but not conclusive. The few investigations 
that have been made to determine the number of mental defectives 
in certain States or localities show very little in regard to the 
comparative situation in rural and urban communities. The report
-P-A-G-E-451
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE, 431 
of the New Hampshire Children’s Commission (1914) contains im- 
portant facts in regard to the geographical distribution-by counties. 
The investigation revealed that “the range of feeble-mindedness 
gradually ascends from the smallest percentage, in the most populous 
county of the State, to the largest Rementa Bee in the two most re- 
mote and thinly populated counties.” 
Whether such a condition prevails in other States—indeed, whothes 
the incidence of feeble-mindedness is greater or less in rural dis- 
tricts—is relatively unimportant; the important fact is that feeble- 
mindedness exists extensively in rural as well as urban communities 
and that, as yet, little attention has been given to this very serious 
problem of rural sociology. Prof. Groves, of the New Hampshire 
State College, points out that immediate progress may be made by 
educating country teachers and pastors and, through them, the sub- 
stantial people of the rural communities as to the social and moral 
significance of mentally defective children. He urges that— 
rural school organization be made use of in the attempt to find the children who 
are defective. It is wise economy to organize the forces of public education so 
as to enable them to undertake clinical investigation in localities too small to 
carry on such work by themselves. There is a special reason why such investi- 
gation * * * will appeal to educational officials. They of all persons are 
likely in practical and even painful ways to feel the need of such work being 
done.* 
In addition to the New Hampshire investigation the following re- 
ports are significant: The New Jersey department of charities and 
corrections “ Research Work in New Jersey,” 1918; commission on 
segregation of feeble-minded and epileptic persons in Pennsylvania, 
1918; Adele H. McKinnie, “The Feeble-minded in One Michigan 
County,” Journal of Pyscho-Asthenics, March, 1914; report of the 
New York State “Commission: to investigate provisions for the 
mentally deficient,” 1915; Davenport’s studies of the “Nam Family 
and the Hill Folk.” A survey of Nassau County in New York is now 
under way.

  ORANGE COUNTY, VA. 
During the early months of 1918, at the suggestion of Joseph D. 
Eggleston, retiring State superintendent of public instruction, a 
sanitary survey of the white and of the colored schools and school 
children of Orange County, Va., was undertaken. The purely rural 
investigation was placed in charge of Dr. Roy K. Flannagan, direc- 
tor of inspections of the Virginia State Board of Health. He was 
assisted in the hookworm investigation by Drs. W. A. Brumfield and 
Hi. A. Lickle, of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission. The inspec- 
tion of all the consolidated schools was made through the voluntary 
services of Drs. H. S. Hedges, R. L. Compton, and J. C. Flippen, 
members of the medical faculty of the University of Virginia, and 
Marvin Harris, D. D. S., of Orange. Valuable assistance and 
cooperative suggestions were received from Supt. C. P. Cowherd 
and Dr. E. G. Williams, commissioner of health of Virginia; R. C. 
Sterns, the State superintendent of public instruction; and Dr. W. H. 
Heck, of the University of Virginia. 
The report on the results of the investigation was prepared by Dr. 
Flannagan and published by the United States Bureau of Education. 
  
1In the Report of the Commissioner of Education for the year ended June 30, 1914 
(Ch. XXIV, vol. 1, pp. 513-562), appeared a previous report on school surveys in 
the United States. The educational inquiries and surveys, the reports of which, with 
two exceptions, had been published up to the close of that year, were analyzed with ref- 
erence to the place and time, the authorization, the details of the staff, the situation 
leading to the inquiry, the scope and method, and the fundamental problems investigated, 
with a summary of the more important findings and the recommendations. 
This second report presents in the same manner the data of 21 new school surveys, all 
of which, excepting the first 2 on the list, where published in the year ended June 30, 
1915. Copies of the Salt Lake survey were received too late for inclusion in this report. 
For the survey of the University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin normal schools, see, 
respectviely, Ch. VI (Higher Education) and Ch. VII (Training of Teachers).

  434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
(Bul. 1914, No. 17, whole No. 590, 28 pp.) The report includes 
four chapters: The setting of the survey and explanatory note, 
organization and methods, results of the inspection, rural school- 
building equipment and environment. Eight plates give pictures of 
some of the school buildings, interior and exterior. A map and speci- 
men blanks and forms used in the inquiry are included in the report. 
The survey included a study of “the physical condition of the chil- 
dren in attendance on the schools, the enrollment, the proportional 
attendance, the size, equipment, and appearance of buildings and 
grounds, heating and lighting arrangements, water supply, and sani- 
tary conveniences.” -The most important findings are briefly con- 
solidated in three pages of statistical tables, which include the data 
concerning school population, age, height, weight, eyes, ears, throat, 
nose, teeth, glands, nutrition, anemia, eruption, vaccination, previous 
sickness, organic disease, hookworm and data in relation thereto, 
nutrition and hookworm, roundworm, school buildings and grounds, 
water delivery, and sewage disposal. 
Twenty-two one-room white, 20 negro, and 7 consolidated schools 
were investigated. The procedure was to reach the children in school 
during the hours of 9 a. m. and 3 p.m. The survey equipment in- 
cluded such material as could be conveniently transported in a two- 
seated vehicle: Scales with measuring rod, tongue depressors, steriliz- 
ing pan, towels, head mirror, throat and nasal speculums, Snellen’s 
eye-testing cards, containers for hookworm specimens, and a stere- 
opticon and acetylene tank for use in illustrating talks to patrons 
wherever possible. S 
In the matter of attendance it was found that 30 per cent of the whites ‘and 
40 per cent of the colored enrollment were absent from school. Out of 315 
white children examined in the one-room schools, 27 per cent had defective eyes ; 
of the 651 examined in the colored schools, 23 per cent were defective; of the 659 
in the graded white schools, 17 per cent were found defective. The total per- 
centage for defective eyes in the county was 21.5. The tests on hearing may 
have been inadequate, yet results show 7.5 per cent with hearing defects; 33.3 
. per cent enlarged tonsils; 34.7 per cent enlarged adenoids; 31 per cent showed. 
deviated septums; 58 per cent of the children had defective permanent teeth 
and 42 per cent defective temporary teeth; 18.5 per cent of the children in the 
one-room schools showed glandular enlargement; 31.2 per cent of the children 
in the one-room schools gave evidence of poor nutrition; 67 per cent of the boys 
and 33 per cent of the girls (in the white one-room schools) were anemic. 
Prevalence of the hookworm infection is indicated as follows: 25.6 per cent in 
rural white one-room schools, 19.5 per cent in rural colored schools, 14.5 in the 
consolidated graded schools. These results argue for the general prevalence of 
better sanitary conditions in the graded or consolidated schools. 
These, with the other data discovered, lead to the general conclu- 
sion which the report urges upon boards of health and education 
alike, namely, that there must be a more serious consideration of the 
physical side of education.

  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 4385 
SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. 
One of the best examples of a survey of schools designed to reach 
and to influence public opinion is that which was made in San 
Francisco by the school survey class ox the California branch of the 
Association of Collegiate Alumnez. 
The report was based on studies made during the winter of 
1913-14 and was published under the title “Some Conditions in the 
Schools of San Francisco—What Kind of Education Shall San 
Francisco Buy in 1914-15? 
The school survey class realizes that this report is not a complete survey of 
the schools in the sense that other cities have had educational surveys. We 
have not attempted to solve, or even to state, some of the gravest problems that 
affect the destinies of the 54,000 children in our public schools. We have 
focused merely on two questions: (1) The need of a greater appropriation as 
brought out by official figures, and as reflected by conditions found in 20 
schools visited by members of the class; (2) the need of installing immediately 
scientific records and reports which will automatically index school conditions, 
and which will keep administrative officers and the public informed about 
school needs. A second report upon charter limitations other than those affect- 
ing the school budget is now under preparation, and will be issued at a later 
date. 
The report (96 pp.) employs photographs, diagrams, graphs, and 
statistical tables to present the material which relates to the follow- 
ing 18 topics: 
How the work begen; the school-survey class; the school-budget study ; 
significant facts about San Francisco; where the school money comes from; 
where the school money goes; six years in San Francisco’s schools; San Fran- 
cisco’s rank among 195 cities over 30,000; San Francisco’s rank among 18 
California school systems; summary of conditions found in 20 schools; what 
does San Francisco know about her schools; some good things about our 
schools; where San Francisco lags behind; defective conditions easily cor- 
rected—no charter revision necessary; charter limitations affecting the school 
budget ; the school estimate for 1914-15; and next steps and recommendations. 
  The appendix includes copies of circular letters, outline of lecture 
courses, and the blanks used by the members of the class in visiting 
and scoring the schools. Each school visited is observed with refer- 
ence to its external appearance, its internal appearance, the teacher 
and teaching of the lesson, the type of teacher, the type of child in 
school, particular merits and defects observed, and various personal 
observations and recommendations. The time given to the study 
was two months, with four weeks additional for the preparation of 
the report. The class enjoyed the cooperation of the board of edu- 
cation and the superintendent of schools. 
The report indicates that the schools of San Francisco were suffer- 
ing from evils due to three fundamental sources: 
(1) Defects which are inherent in the charter governing the organization 
and finances of the school system; (2) inadequate and unscientific financial
-P-A-G-E-456
  436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
and education records and reports; (3) a lack, year after year, of a sufficient 
appropriation for educational purposes. 
Among the significant facts about San Francisco discovered by 
the class were these: 
It is the richest city per capita—based upon actual valuation of property— 
among the 11 principal cities of the United States; with the exception of Los 
Angeles and Washington, it has the lowest tax rate of any city over 300,000 
population; it is also one of the great cosmopolitan cities of the nation, having 
only 27.7 per cent born of native parents; the foreign-born elements of its popula- 
tion come from nearly every nation upon the earth; like other coast cities, it 
is peculiarly “a single man’s city,” with comparatively few children in the popu- 
lation; San Francisco’s percentage of children under 15 years of age is only 
18.9 as compared with the percentage of 27.3 for all the cities in the United 
States. Portland, Oreg., is the only city in the country which has a smaller 
percentage of children, namely, 18.8. In such a community, the maintenance 
of school should be very easy. In spite of the wealth and population conditions, 
however, San Francisco stands fifth from the bottom among the 18 cities over 
300,000 in the per capita cost for schools. It is also found that in the past 
six years since the rehabilitation of the city there has been an unbalanced 
growth in school expenditures as compared with the increase in city population 
and other expenses of government. In the matter of expenditure for schools in 
1912 San Francisco was one of the six cities spending the smallest amount, its 
expenditures being 19 per cent of the total city expenditure, whereas the average 
among 195 cities of over 30,000 population was 28.9 per cent. 
The relative position of San Francisco among 18 California school 
systems is no less striking. For example, it ranks fourteenth in order 
of cost per pupil for elementary school education, namely, $43.18; 
eighteenth in the order of cost per pupil for high-school education, 
namely, $71.92; seventeenth in the order of tax rates for elementary 
schools, namely, $0.177; and eighteenth in the order of tax rates for 
high schools, namely, $0.047. 
Outside of paying good salaries to elementary teachers, San Francisco has 
simply no conception of what it means to spend money upon education. 
Twenty of the eighty-four elementary schools were visited and ex- 
tended attention is given to the serious oversight of improving the 
school plan. Owing to the seriously defective organization of the 
department of education, San Francisco— 
has no idea, and can not easily discover, how many children there are in the 
city, how many children are not attending any school, how many children 
begin school each year, how many children drop out by the way, how many 
children repeat a grade, or how long it takes children to finish the school 
course, 
Detailed recommendations are given specifying the school facts 
which should be recorded and reported to the public, so that there 
may be an end to the practice of keeping— 
currently only such records and making only such reports as are necessary to 
obtain money from the State, fill out State blanks, and to comply with the law 
that an annual report be made.

  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 437 
While pointing out educational opportunities not yet afforded to 
children of San Francisco, the report specifies some good things about 
the schools. Limitations of the study are indicated by a list of the 
total of 31 items, divided into 7 groups, of problems that have 
not been touched upon. | 
The specific recommendations are as follows: 
1. An increased appropriation which shall provide: Enough teachers to 
reduce all classes to 40 pupils; enough money to restore the 18 ungraded classes 
and add at least 15 others; enough money to extend manual training into the 
sixth grade and to children of sixth-grade age; enough money to maintain the 
three intermediate schools; enough money to furnish adequate supplies—at 
least $10,000; enough money to make a beginning of social use of the school- 
house; enough money to restore the evening lecture system; enough money to 
make present temporary shacks livable and to relieve the present serious 
crowding of buildings. 
2. Immediate consideration of. the constitutionality of taxing San Francisco 
as a school district. 
8. Educational campaign in behalf of removing the schools from the dollar 
limit and of removing the present charter limitations upon school expenditure. 
4. The present study of the financial methods of the board of education should 
result in: Installation of an up-to-date system of bookkeeping; installation of 
a standard system of financial record keeping and reports, such as is recom- 
mended by the Bureau of Education in Washington. 
5. Introduction of time sheets and service records throughout the department. 
6. Employment of a commission of experts to pass upon all future school 
sites, school buildings, and ventilating and plumbing systems. 
7. Adoption of a standard of equipment which shall insure an adequate 
supply of necessary teaching material. 
8. Adoption of sanitary cleaning rules for buildings and abolishment of 
feather dusters. Janitors to be appointed on civil-service basis. 
9. Installation of scales in all schools for the weighing of coal upon delivery. 
10. Establishment of an efficiency and publicity bureau in the school depart- 
ment whose duty it shall be to collect scientific and adequate school data for 
* the guidance of school authorities and the proper information of the public. 
11. Wider publicity in the daily press—if possible, a school page in one of 
the leading papers, such as is run in two New York papers, the Globe and the 
Brooklyn Eagle. 
RURAL AND VILLAGE SCHOOLS, COLORADO. 
A novel attempt to utilize the data contained in official school 
records as the basis of a State-wide survey was developed in Colorado. 
In 1909 a survey of the rural schools of Mesa County was under- 
taken in order to secure a statement of the true condition of the schools. 
This effort included a personal visitation as well as the utilization 
of all other available sources of information. Incident to this first- 
hand inquiry was an examination of the records of these schools “ to 
see what light they might throw on the subject by giving the past 
history of these schools.” This form of investigation was. carried 
back until the preceding eight years were studied and all the items 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
of record included. The application of these data in the explanation 
of the unsatisfactory condition of the schools in this county created 
something of a situation in the matter of attempted reorganization 
and consolidation of schools. At this stage of progress an in- 
vestigation of “eight representative counties” was undertaken by 
the State agricultural college, which yielded results indicating that 
“conditions were fully as bad, or even worse, than in Mesa County.” 
With the added interest of the college teachers’ association in the 
movement for rural school improvement, the college undertook the 
task of completing an eight-year survey for the whole State. 
The scope of the survey included 62 counties and more than 1,800 
school districts of the first, second, and third class. The study 
was conducted by Prof. C. G. Sargent, specialist in rural education 
and the rural school visitor of the Colorado Agricultural College. 
The present report is published under the title “The Rural and Vil- 
lage Schools of Colorado; an Eight-year Survey of Each School Dis- 
trict, 1906-1918, inclusive,” Bulletin No. 5, Series XIV, Fort Collins, 
Colo., 1914. The report (106 pp.) includes the following topics: 
Introductory statement, the survey, the school census, the enroll- 
ment, the average daily attendance, eighth-grade graduates, length 
of term, special school taxes and revenues, teachers and salaries, sites 
and buildings, the district system, consolidation of districts, sum- 
mary, and suggestions for improvement. Three maps, 13 figures, and 
16 pictures of school buildings aid in a clear presentation of the varied 
material of the study. While the survey for the eight-year period - 
is completed for the entire State, this report gives “in a greatly 
condensed and summarized form the most important facts discussed 
by the survey ” of what is known in Colorado as the third-class dis- 
tricts—that is, those districts which have a school census of less than 
350 children between the ages of 6 and 21 years. A second-class ° 
district is one which enumerates from 350 to 1,000, and a first-class 
district enumerates 1,000 or more children between the ages of 6 
and 21 years. The scope of this report accordingly includes 1,725 
different districts. 
The real basis of the study is to be found in the material contained 
in the annual report of the Colorado superintendent of schools, which 
must be made on or before the Ist day of August of each year, under 
oath and a penalty of $100. The school board (three members) of 
each district must make a report to the county superintendent, and 
the county superintendent must report to the State superintendent. 
The survey assumes the complete reliability of the official reports 
which have been placed on file during this period. 
It is from the county superintendent’s report to the State superintendent that 
this survey was made. This report includes all items of record, such as the 
personal statistics of the school proper; the kind of building; its condition,
-P-A-G-E-459
ee en Oe ee ee ee ee Re ne ne eee 
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 439 
value, and equipment; and a complete financial statement. It is a fairly com- 
plete quantitative report of the educational activities of the district, and the 
completeness and correctness with which these reports have been made is, 
with but few exceptions, highly complimentary to the county superintendents of 
the State. 
Certain forms were used tabulating the data, thus rendering the 
material. comparable between the counties and the State. These 
forms included the items of census, enrollment, average daily attend- 
ance, eighth-grade graduates, male and female teachers, length of 
school term in days, salaries of men and women, assessed valuation 
of the district, special tax in mills, number of buildings, value of 
sites and buildings, and total cost of school. “The writer has ex- 
amined every item of the 1,725 districts, and to further corroborate 
the facts found in the records has visited 100 of the districts in dif- 
ferent parts of the State.” The sole purpose of the study was “to 
show conditions as they are,” although “ absolute accuracy is not and 
can not be claimed” for the facts presented. 
The first four topics consider the school children in their various 
relations to the school. The first for consideration is the average 
school census for each of the eight years for the 60 counties contain- 
ing the third-class districts. There were found to be 82,174 chil- 
dren, 289 districts having less than 15 children each, and 194 districts 
having more than 100 children each. The average enrollment was 
78 per cent of the census. “Seventeen thousand seven hundred and 
eighty-nine boys and girls constitute ‘Exhibit A’ in this investi- 
gation, and indicate the first loss recorded against the district system 
of rural schools in Colorado.” The compulsory school-attendance 
law, which has been on the statute books during the period, has 
apparently not been well enforced. Its recent revision may succeed 
in placing practically all the children of school age in school. De- 
tailed study was made of individual counties in the matter of census 
and enrollment. It was found that between an agricultural (Weld) 
and a mining county (Las Animas), the extremes are nearly the 
same, “ there being only 6 per cent difference in the county averages.” 
This may be taken as fairly typical of the rest of the State. A worse 
showing is made in the study of the average daily attendance of the 
enrollment, the extremes of this average varying from the highest, 
77 per cent, to the lowest, 51 per cent, for the eight-year period. The 
total average daily attendance was but 61 per cent of the enrollment. 
Twenty-five thousand one hundred and seventy-one, “the number 
who were out of school all the time on account of irregular attend- 
ance... is here marked ‘Exhibit B,’ and represents the second 
great loss recorded against the rural school system of Colorado.” 
The school course is arranged on the basis of an eight-grade, one 
year to the grade, plan. “ We have a right to assume that approxi-  
-P-A-G-E-460
    440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
mately one-eighth of the enrollment should be in the eighth grade each 
year, and if they are not it is perfectly proper.to inquire why they 
are not there.” Proceeding on this assumption, a detailed study was 
made of the situation as evidenced by the number of pupils reported 
as completing the eighth grade. In Mesa County this detail is 
studied from 1905 to 1912, inclusive; in all other counties, from 1906 
to 1913. The data for several counties are presented in detail. For 
all the rural schools of the State it was found that only 22 per cent 
of the average enrollment and 37 per cent of the average daily 
attendance were graduated from the eighth grade. Twenty-four 
thousand six hundred and sixty children who were in average daily 
attendance during these eight years are presented as “‘ Exhibit C’ 
and constitute the third great loss to be recorded against our system 
of rural schools.” 
Other aspects of the school system are examined “to see if any- 
thing can be discovered to help account for the low enrollment, poor 
attendance, and unmistakable evidence of general inefficiency clearly 
proven by the facts and figures already given.” In the absence of a 
minimum-term*law during the eight-year period it was found that 
5 counties had school terms of 160 days or more, 30 had between 140 
and 160, 21 had between 120 and 140, and 5 had less than 120 days 
each year. The average for the 1,725 districts was 140 days. A 
very great variation was found in the special school taxes and reve- 
nues. On the basis of an eight-year average, the special tax levy for 
schools in the counties averages 8.08 mills, with a range of 13.21 
mills to 3.56 mills. Under the legal limits fixed for local taxation 
it was found that at no time during this period did any county in 
the State “make use of more than 80 per cent of its resources allowed 
by the special district tax.” The average use by the 60 counties was 
but 50 per cent of their available resources. The study shows in 
detail how the additional revenue available, by means of using the 
entire tax limit, would greatly improve the teaching situation in the 
schools by the addition of six county supervisors of school work. In 
contrast with the town and cities in the first and second class school 
districts, the third-class districts are “ getting an inferior article,” 
or the other districts are “paying an enormous price” for the edu- 
cation they are trying to buy for their children. The study also 
included the data respecting the number of teachers employed, their 
sex, number of months taught during the current year, and the 
salary of each. No information was available on the education, pro- 
fessional training, and experience of these teachers. 
The total number of teachers engaged in all the districts is 19,563, 
of whom 16 per cent were men and 84 per cent women. The eight- 
year average salary for men is $64, and for women $53 per month. 
“One county paid an average of $81 per month, 6 paid between $70 
 
-P-A-G-E-461
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 441 
and $80, 20 paid between $60 and $70, 23 paid between $50 and $60, 
9 paid between $40 and $50, while one paid less than $40 per month 
for the eight years.” The range of salaries in any one-teacher school 
was $20 per month to $133 per month. 
In the examination of the data relating to sites and buildings it 
was found in light of the bonding ability on the basis of the assessed 
valuation of all third-class districts that only 50.4 per cent of the 
available resources for building purposes was used. 
The general outcome of the study is an indictment against the dis- 
trict system, and a special plea for the consolidation of districts in 
order to secure rural school improvement. “It would seem from the 
facts given that there is something fundamentally wrong with the 
district system, and that a more complete reorganization is more 
necessary than the expenditure of more money, much as that is 
ueeded.” 
There is every degree of variation between these 1,725 districts. They vary 
in area from a little more than 1 section of land to many townships; in assess- 
able property on which taxes may be levied to build and support school, from 
$250 to more than $1,000,000. They vary in number of children from an aver- 
age of 1 in a district to 340; in number of teachers, from 1 to 18; in the value of 
buildings, from nothing to $25,000, while there is but little uniformity in 
length of term, taxes, or results. Other things being equal, the smaller the 
number of districts in a county the greater is the efficiency of the system, and 
the greater the uniformity throughout the county in all things that make for 
better schools. 
Illustrations of progress in rural school improvement are given in 
the detailed accounts of five consolidated schools. The study con- 
cludes with a special recommendation that the plan for a system of 
‘public schools, presented at the joint meeting of the Southern Edu- 
cation Association and the Conference for Education in the South in 
Louisville, Ky., April, 1914, be adopted as the basis for the reorgani- 
zation of the rural and field schools of the State. 
NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
The constructive power of a selected type of educational survey 
may come to have its directive value fully estimated when the cen- 
tral trades school, founded by a bequest of Isaac Delgado and to 
bear his name, is established and in full operation in New Orleans, 
La. A similar judgment of worth may then also be available concern- 
ing the material assistance to a public-school system derivable from a 
division of educational research. In July, 1913, the city, by ordi- 
nance, organized this division and committed to it the tasks of edu- 
cational measurement and a vocational survey as a first preliminary 
step in the establishment of the Delgado school. On June 25, 1914, 
Dr. David §. Hill, director of the division of educational research,
-P-A-G-E-462
    442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
presented to the commission council of the city his first report: 
“Facts about the Public Schools of New Orleans in Relation to Vo- 
cation; Part I, Vocational Survey” (pp. 58). Its contents center 
about these topics: General facts about public schools in New Or- 
leans; elimination of pupils from the schools; a study of our 13-year- 
old boys (1,387); attitude of employers of New Orleans toward 
evening, part-time, preparatory, and practical trade schools; and 
night-school students in relation to trade education in that city. 
Twenty-one tables and charts are used to exhibit the statistical ma- 
terial. 
The first annual report of the new division to the superintendent 
of schools was presented in September, 1914. It contains principally 
a record of the primary activities of the division in its “clinical” 
studies of the school children of the city. The principal topics are: 
Studies of the progress (age grade) of.36,284 school children (white 
and colored) ; the special investigations in the educational laboratory 
(established as a psychological clinic in 1912) of 63 delinquent and 
dependent boys; and an outline of the data collected by the division 
concerning industrial education. 
COVINGTON, MACON, AND MORGAN COUNTIES, ALABAMA, 
One of the interesting contributions to the utilization of the sur- 
vey for State-wide purposes is to be found in the study of educa- 
tional conditions in Alabama. One of the first official acts of the 
present superintendent of education, William F. Feagin, was to in- 
augurate a close study of educational conditions in the State, by 
means of the rural-school agents of the State department. The re-. 
sult of the investigation was published under the title “An Educa- 
tional Survey of Three Counties in Alabama, Bulletin No. 43, Issued 
by the Department of Education, July 1, 1914.” 
Instead of surveying the entire State, as in the case of Ohio and 
Vermont, this investigation proceeded to find three counties in the 
most divergent geographical sections of the State that would typify 
conditions both fairly and generally. Anything like a close study of 
the findings will show how the wisdom of the choice of Morgan, 
Macon, and Covington Counties has been abundantly confirmed. 
Morgan County, in the Tennessee Valley in the north, represents 
conditions where the white population largely predominates; Macon 
County, on the eastern border of the Black Belt, represents condi- 
tions where the colored population predominates; and Covington 
County, on the southern border, represents one of the newly devel- 
oped counties in the Pine Belt. 
The field work of the survey was done by rural-school agents of 
the State department, N. R. Baker and J. L. Sibley. In the prepa-
-P-A-G-E-463
    SCHOOL SURVEYS. 443 
ration of the blanks, forms, and questionnaires, the assistance of Dr, 
F. B. Dresslar, specialist of the Bureau of Education and of the 
George Peabody College for Teachers, was secured. 
The agents visited, in company with the county superintendents, 
a total of 263 white and colored schools in three counties. Five 
months’ time was spent in collecting information, compiling figures, 
and preparing the manuscript of the report. Accuracy in learning 
and stating the conditions, rather than completeness or perfection in 
the survey, was the chief aim. The object of the investigation was 
to lead the way for a decided improvement in the State educational 
system in such matters as local taxation, better supervision and con- 
solidation of schools, and compulsory education. : 
The report (179 pp.) is admirably prepared. It comprises 13 
chapters, as follows: Three type counties; population, literacy, and 
farming; economic conditions; public health; general administra- 
tion; teachers; school buildings; school grounds; material equip- 
ment; values of public-school property; vitalizing agencies; games 
played by the children at school; miscellaneous unclassified observa- 
tions. In the three appendices are found the field forms used in 
the survey, the form of medical inspection report in use in Macon 
County, various charts and diagrams, and a very useful summary 
of the statistical information in comparative tables for the three 
counties. Maps, diagrams, charts, and photographs are freely used 
to exhibit the facts gathered. The value of the presentation of the 
data is enhanced by carrying forward the material pertaining to each 
of the three counties together. The historical, economic, social, and 
educational facts and conditions are made the basis of the interpre- 
tation of the data as they are presented from topic to topic in the 
progress of the various chapters. 
The constructive purpose of the survey appears in the special 
attention given to the agencies already at work in the counties for the 
improvement of economic and social conditions, such as farm demon- 
stration work, merchants’ and farmers’ league, live-stock association, 
county fairs, farmers’ unions, boys’ and girls’ clubs, farm-life confer- 
ences, Chautauquas, and Sunday school associations, as presented in 
chapters 3 and 11. Attention is likewise called to the educational 
value of railroads, highways, the relation of roads to schools, parcel 
post and rural delivery, and rural telephones. 
Take Macon County as an example: Here we have the farm demonstration 
agent, the farmers’ union, the live-stock association, the country fair associa- 
tion, the boys’ and girls’ clubs, and the merchants’ and farmers’ league, all more 
or less affiliated. A country-life committee, composed of one representative 
from each of the above, with the county superintendent of education, the county 
health officer, some one to represent the women’s clubs, and another the re- 
ligious life of the county, would form a splendid framework about which to   
-P-A-G-E-464
  444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
build a more prosperous community life. Covington County has already taken 
preliminary steps for such an organization. 
The study of public-health conditions leads to the constructive 
suggestion that each county should be given. the benefit of three 
officers: A full-time health officer, a full-time superintendent of 
education, and a full-time farm-demonstration agent. The study of 
the various agencies and activities in the general administration of 
State, county, and district administration, involving the duties of 
various officials, a tendency toward the grading of schools, the great 
school mortality, elimination and retardation, and salaries, leads to 
the following recommendations: 
1. County boards of education should be alert to pass such regulations as 
will favor the organization and vitalization of the work of the school. 2. 
Hither appropriations for janitor work should be available for rural schools 
or more systematic housekeeping should be done by pupils. 3. The terms in 
rural districts should be lengthened. 4. Think of 5,423 pupils entering school 
in the first grade and but 60 completing the work of the fourth-year high 
school. Why not make a more intensive local survey in an effort to account 
for this numerical decrease in the grades? Or is the entire theory of grading 
wrong? 5. Pay the teacher more and demand a higher class of service. 
So far as the study of the teachers was concerned, the surveyors 
directed their attention to “the preparation, experience, and activi- 
ties of the teachers rather than their methods of classroom instruc- 
tion.” 
The surveyors visited 171 white teachers in rural schools, 77 white 
teachers in city schools, 80 colored teachers in rural schools, and 14 
colored teachers in city schools—a total of 348. The facts gathered 
are strikingly set forth in the report, as follows: 
The instructor should keep constantly in mind when he faces an average 
institute of 100 teachers in a rural county that— 
22 have never taught before; 
30 have never been in high school, have never studied beyond where they 
are expected to teach; 
34 possess no professional books ; 
43 subscribe to no professional magazines; 
45 are strangers in the county where they expect to teach, and hence are, 
to a certain extent, without county spirit and do not know county conditions ; 
51 hold third-grade certificates ; 
63 have never attended a summer school; 
70 do not belong to the State Teachers’ Reading Circle; 
76 are strangers to the community where they will teach; 
80 do not belong to the State educational association; and 
80 have never attended a normal school even for a day. 
To follow these teachers a little further, when they arrive at the schoolhouse 
where they are to teach 41 pupils each— 
19 will have schools without desks of any kind; : 
41 others will have only home-made desks, while often three pupils will face 
the teacher from a desk intended for but two; 
60 will find unpainted houses;
-P-A-G-E-465
  
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 445 
65 will teach schools without toilet facilities ; 
66 will find schools with no idea of sanitary drinking arrangements ; 
70 will find pictureless walls; 
78 will teach without wall maps; 
79 will find schools without libraries ; 
84 will teach in houses with defective lighting. 
The study of the teaching force leads to these constructive sug- 
gestions: 
1. The higher the grade of certificate the higher the grade of the school. 
Would it not be a good investment for the State to encourage some form of 
teacher training in a high school in each county? <A considerable number of 
teachers have some high-school training. If pedagogical training were offered 
in the last years, many would stay to complete a course. “A half loaf is better 
than no loaf.” 
2. When the school grounds shall have been enlarged and made to include a 
teacher’s home, and when local taxation has provided a better building and a 
better salary, he will then cease to be a sort of tramp teacher moving from 
place to place year after year. 
As to school buildings, it is recommended: 
1. State aid for school buildings should be reapportioned to the counties at 
the end of each year, just as the library fund now is. 
2. Public funds should be used for equipment up to, say, one-half mill. 
3. The number of schools should be reduced rather than increased. 
4, There should be greater space for seating pupils, so as to safeguard their 
health. 
5. A closer adherence to State plans in the construction of State buildings is 
imperative in the absence of county regulation. 
6. Better care of the school plant. 
7. More care in sweeping arrangements. Floors should be oiled. Use cot- 
tonseed oil or regular floor oil obtained at a hardware store. Apply by means 
of a common string mop after the floor has been scrubbed thoroughly and is 
perfectly clean. 
With regard to school grounds, the findings are: 
1. The grounds should be larger, so as to give ample space for recreation; 
should contain a school garden and farm and a home for the principal. 
2. The school well should be sanitary, supplying the school, the principal’s 
home, and afford water for irrigation and for filling a trough at the road for 
passers-by. The well should be closed and provided with a force pump and 
either a tank above ground or a pressure tank below the surface. 
3. The grounds should be graded and beautified. 
4. Jacketed stoves should be more generally used. 
5. Houses should be provided with means for keeping the fuel dry. 
6. Every school should have two sanitary toilets. 
The needs of school equipment are thus indicated: 
1. More furniture and equipment of suitable proportions are needed. This 
should be procured at public expense. 
2. Blackboards of wood are wasteful, inelegant, and otherwise unsatisfactory 
and should be replaced by slate or other prepared boards. 
8. More pictures of proper selection are needed.
-P-A-G-E-466
  
446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
4. Drinking fountains, not individual cups, are the only safeguards for 
drinking water. The cups are dangerous because they are not used as it is 
designed they should be. They are frequently lost, exposed to dust, loaned, ete. 
5. Half of the available light should not become unavailable by the use of 
opaque window shades. % 
6. Libraries are a most excellent investment. No county should neglect to 
secure all possible libraries allowed under the law. 
In the study of the value of public-school property there were 
found variations from the amounts reported to the State superin- 
tendent, which led to the suggestion that the county superintendent 
should make all inventories in person in order to arrive at the real 
facts. It was found that the average value of the entire school plant 
and equipment, based on the whole number publicly surveyed, is $600 
for white rural schools and $491 for colored rural schools. In the 
study of national conditions of education made by Dr. Leonard P. 
Ayres, who used the figures of 1910, it was found that the average 
value of school property per child of school age in Alabama was $13. 
In the three counties of this survey this average in 1914 came to $15, 
but for the entire State, based on enumeration, it still remained $13. 
Can a school building and equipment worth less than $600 serve effectively 
as the school center, social center, and economic center of a community? Can 
it be consolidated? Can it serve a large community? Can it be beautiful, 
artistic, attractive, and at the same time large enough to contain an auditorium, 
workrooms, cloakrooms, libraries, and the necessary classrooms to accommodate 
nine grades and sustain the vocational as well as cultural subjects of the 
course of study? One building and its entire equipment was valued at $65. 
A separate chapter is devoted to the study of the vitalizing agencies 
noted at the beginning of the report. Leading to the following con- 
clusions and constructive suggestions: 
1. In Macon County the board of education should employ an additional 
Negro supervisor to work out from the superintendent’s office in connection with 
the present supervisor and give this highly deserving form of instruction a 
systematic basis. It would be advisable for Covington County to employ a 
supervisor similar to the one in the other two counties. 
2. More time should be allowed for agricultural instruction. 
3. Home industries are still almost a negative quantity in rural schools. 
4. The Negroes seem to outdistance the whites in the matter of using the 
school as a community center. 
5. Better roads would make more and better teachers’ meetings possible. 
6. Literary work drags when and where vocational work is not emphasized. 
7. School improvement associations should be free to work for better social, 
spiritual, and cultural conditions, along with material betterment. 
An exceedingly interesting but very brief chapter reports a list of 
100 games played by the children at school. About 40 per cent of the 
teachers attempted to direct or supervise the play of their pupils.

SCHOOL SURVEYS. 447 
SPRINGFIELD, ILL. 
A new and interesting point of view from which a school survey 
can be made is that which characterized the study of the public 
schools of Springfield, Il. It was conducted as a part of a general 
social survey of the city undertaken by the Russell Sage Foundation. 
The authorization for the study was given by the board of education 
on January 19, 1914, when Dr. Leonard P. Ayres was invited to 
direct the work. The survey staff comprised four persons from the 
regular staff of the division of education of the foundation: Dr. 
Leonard P. Ayres, R. R. Lutz, Edna C. Bryner, and A. H. Richard- 
son. The material used in one chapter was secured in the recrea- 
tional survey by Lee F. Hanmer and Clarence A. Perry. The entire 
time consumed was that of 4 persons for 10 weeks, and 2 persons 
for 5 weeks, including the preparatory work, 3 weeks in the schools 
in Springfield, a tabulation of data, the interpretation of results, 
clerical work, and publication. The total cost of the survey was 
$3,261, of which the board of education appropriated the sum of 
$1,000, the remainder being defrayed by the Russell Sage Foundation. 
The report (152 pp.) may, in many respects, be considered a model. 
It comprises 14 chapters, the 5 forms used in the collection of data, 
87 tables, 18 diagrams, and 23 illustrations. Each chapter forms a 
complete unit and includes a summary of findings and recommenda- 
tions. The topics of the chapters are: The school survey; Spring- 
field and its schools; the board of education; the school plant; the 
children; the teaching force; the quality of classroom instruction; 
the course of study; financial administration; medical inspection; 
the high school; the organization of intermediate schools or junior 
high schools; vocational education; educational extension. 
SPRINGFIELD AND ITS SCHOOLS. 
1. Springfield is a prosperous, growing city having an unusually large pro- 
portion of native-born white American citizens, a high per capita wealth, an 
average tax rate, and a high expenditure for municipal government. Its busi- 
ness interests are largely commercial, although there is considerable manufac- 
turing. 2. The daily school attendance is about 10,500. Of every 100 of these 
young people 67 are in public schools, 26 in parochial and private schools, and 7 
in business colleges. 3. There are 21 public-school buildings, 8 parochial schools, 
2 private schools, and 2 business colleges, making a total of 33 buildings. 4. 
The school district is a State organization and includes more than twice as much 
territory as does the municipality, but over nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the 
district live within the city. 5. The board of education consists of seven mem- 
bers elected at large and has independent taxing powers within the limits im- 
posed by law. 6. The public schools are 20 in number and are administered by 
the superintendent, 18 principals, and 4 general supervisors. Nine employees 
besides the superintendent are attached to the central office. There are 224 
teachers, and the average attendance in all public day schools is 7,082.

  448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
1. The board transacts a great amount of detail administrative work that 
could better be delegated to its employed executives. 2. The board’s offices are 
exceptionally satisfactory, and its office employees are efficient. 3. Economies 
could be effected by dispensing with the services of the attorney and the book- 
keeper and the filing and record systems rendered more efficient by simplifying 
them. 4. It is recommended that a bureau for the purchase and distribution of 
supplies be organized. 5. It is recommended that the administration of com- 
pulsory attendance and the issuance of age and school certificates be reorganized 
by employing two competent attendance officers and reforming the school census 
so as to make it tell the names and addresses of the children who ought to be in 
school, . 
THE SCHOOL PLANT. 
1. Build no more buildings according to the plans now in use; profit by the 
experience of other cities and secure plans embodying the most modern practice. 
2. Build future classrooms smaller; make ceilings lower; plan coat rooms 
somewhat narrower. 3. Reduce width of corridors from 25 feet to about half 
that width. 4. Insist on lighting of classrooms from the left only. 5. Have 
the window area in classrooms equal to one-fourth of the floor area. 6. Secure 
a better type of window shades and insist on constant care in their adjustment. 
7. Establish standards for the cleaning of windows and insist on their observ- 
ance, 8. Reduce classroom temperatures to a maximum of 68 degrees and equip 
all rooms with reliable thermometers. 9. Equip new buildings with the best 
type of mechanical ventilation and repair defects in existing systems. 10. Place 
some seats and desks of varying sizes in each room; equip some rooms in each 
building with the new movable combined seats and desks. 11. Install drinking 
fountains elsewhere than in the toilet rooms. 12. Arrange blackboards in class- 
rooms, hooks in coat rooms, and seats in toilet rooms with reference to the size 
of the children who are to use them. 18. Build new schools fireproof or fire 
resisting; straighten winding stairways in old buildings or, better still, re- 
place one stairway in each old building by fireproof stairs. 14. Immediately re- 
place all bolts on outer doors by panic bolts, and forbid the fastening of any 
outer doors by any other means. , 15. Reorganize fire drills, forbidding all run- 
ning and confusion. 16. Plan all auditoriums built as annexes of old buildings 
so that they will be integral parts of the new buildings to be erected in the 
future; where this is impossible, do not build them. 17. Secure new sets of 
specifications arid reorganize the system of inspection so that specifications will 
be followed in new buildings. 18. Organize a school for janitors under the 
direction of the superintendent of buildings, in which they may learn the best 
and most efficient methods of carrying on their very important part of the school 
work. 
THE CHILDREN. 
1. The school census should be reformed so as to tell how many children 
there are of school age in the city, who they are, where they live, and where 
they attend school. 2. As compared with other cities, Springfield makes a 
good showing in having a relatively small proportion of children who are 
overage for their grades or are making slow progress. 3. There are 1,000 
children in the elementary schools who are both overage for their grades 
and are making slow progress. The proportion of such children varies from 
5 per cent to 27 per cent in the different schools. These children need indi- 
vidual teaching and provision for giving it should be made. 4. There are 
some 101 cases of extreme retardation. These children should be in special
-P-A-G-E-469
SCHOOL SURVEYS. __ 449 
classes. Some of them’should not be in the public schools at all but in insti- 
tutions. 5. The course of study, teaching methods, and administration of the 
‘schools are better adapted to the needs and abilities of the girls than they are 
to those of the boys. The boys make slower progress, fail more often, and 
drop out of school earlier than the girls. This condition is always found where 
the school work is artificial, formal, and abstract. It has been remedied in 
other cities and can be remedied here. 6. Promotion rates are high, but not 
too high. 7. Classes range in size from 17 to 53, with an average of 36. 
Wherever possible, the children should be redistributed so as to have fewer 
overcrowded classes. The welfare of the children is vastly more important 
than the strict maintenance of school-district boundaries. 
THE TEACHING FORCE. 
1. The teaching force consists of 238 teachers and principals. Of these, 
199 are in elementary and 39 in high school. 2. They range in age from 19 to 
71 years and the average age is about 30 years. 3. The teaching force is rela- 
tively stable, the average length of service in the schools of Springfield being 
seven years. 4. Salaries are relatively high, Springfield being fourth from the 
top in a comparison of average salaries of elementary teachers in 16 cities. 
5. Of each ten teachers in the elementary schools, seven are graduates of the 
Springfield High School and six are graduates of the Teachers’ Training School. 
Too large a proportion of them have been trained in the local schools. 6. The 
efficiency of the system can be greatly enhanced by suspending the training 
school and attracting to the service of the city the best teachers from other 
localities. 7. An assistant superintendent of high professional education and 
successful experience should be employed to assist in classroom supervision. 
This survey is one of the few that have made use of the new 
standard scales of measurement for teaching purposes. Tests were 
made in spelling, handwriting, and arithmetic. Some of the results 
are summarized as follows: 
1. The members of the survey staff made 684 classroom visits, of which 273 
were for the purpose of observing teaching methods and the remainder for 
noting details as to physical equipment or making humidity, ventilation, and 
illumination tests. 2..The strongest feature of the work is the free relation- 
ship between pupils and teachers. The weakest feature is that throughout the 
system there is too little real teaching and too much hearing of recitations. 
38. In too large a proportion of the classrooms the work suffers from the 
inadequate professional, educational, and cultural preparation of the teachers. 
4. Throughout the elementary schools the discipline is good. 5. Standard 
spelling tests in all grades from the second through the eighth indicate that 
in general the children spell as well as average children in other city school 
systems. 6. Measurement of the quality of handwriting of pupils in the four 
upper grades shows that it is in general as good as that of children in the same 
grades in other cities. 7. Standard tests in arithmetic show that in Spring- 
field children do work in fundamentals more rapidly but less accurately than 
average children in other cities. In reasoning their work is less rapid and less 
accurate than the average work in other cities. 
In a study of some of the values obtaining in the course of study 
a novel exercise was introduced “to test the practical value of the 
subject matter taught to children in the elementary grades.” Eleven

-P-A-G-E-470
  450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of the leading successful citizens, all men, were brought together one 
evening and asked to take short examinations, including material 
“prescribed by the course of study and actually being taught in the 
upper grades in spelling, arithmetic, history, and geography.” The 
special group included a State senator, a former lieutenant governor, 
the president of a manufacturing concern, the former superintendent 
of parks, a banker, a physician, a merchant, a lawyer, a newspaper 
editor, an efficiency engineer, and a clergyman. Of course “the most 
difficult material was purposely selected” for these tests. The re- 
sult of these examinations in spelling, geography, arithmetic, and 
history of the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades was that no one of the 
men examined made a passing mark in any subject. 
THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
1. The course of study in its present form is the product of a number of 
partial revisions of a course in use many years ago. In parts it is rigid and 
behind the times, while in other parts it is modern and progressive. It is not 
closely followed in the schools. 2. The time devoted to each subject varies so 
widely in the different schools that no general study of the time allotment is 
possible. 3. A new course of study and time allotment should be developed, and 
in this work the best experience of the most progressive school systems should 
be utilized. 4. Tests of the existing course show that it includes much material 
that is so artificial and unrelated to the needs of real life that if should be 
abandoned and more useful matter substituted. 5. The city should adopt the 
policy of supplying textbooks free. This promotes educational efficiency, 
facilitates uniformity, and reduces expense to the community. 
EXPENDITURES. 
1. Springfield spends on its schools about one-third of a million dollars each 
year, more than 90 per cent of which comes from local taxes. 2. The board of 
education fixes the tax rate for schools within limits imposed by the law. 
3. As compared with other cities of similar size, Springfield is somewhat wealthier 
than the average, spends less than the average amount on city government, and 
ranks a little above the average in its expenditures for education. 4. This city 
spends as much as the average city of similar size for each high-school pupil 
and more than the average amount for each elementary pupil. 5. The per 
capita cost in this city is more than in the average city for salaries of prin- 
cipals, maintenance of buildings, purchase of stationery and supplies, salaries of 
supervisors, and the purchase of water and light. It is less than in the average 
city for the salaries of janitors and the purchase of fuel. 6. The system of 
collection and disbursement of funds is accurate and safe. It is deficient in 
that there is undue delay between the collection of tax money and its delivery 
to the board of education by the county treasurer. 7. It is strongly recom- 
mended that Springfield will abandon the unnecessary practice of issuing bonds 
for the erection of school buildings. 8. The board would do well to submit to 
a vote of the people a moderate advance in the tax rate for educational pur- 
poses.
-P-A-G-E-471
  
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 451 
HEALTH SUPERVISION. 
1. Medical inspection is carried on by one nurse. The work accomplished is 
well done, but it is impossible for one person to do thoroughly the amount of 
work that she is attempting. 2. Two nurses should be employed and the half- 
time services of a physician secured. This could be best arranged by having 
the board of education cooperate with the board of health in employing a 
municipal physician, half of whose time could be devoted to work in the 
schools. 3. Nearly three-fourths of the children are not vaccinated. Vaccina- 
tion should be required as prerequisite to entrance into the public schools. 4. A 
most successful school dental clinic is maintained. 5. Arrangements for the 
establishment of an eye clinic are under way. 6. Special ungraded classes 
should be organized for exceptional children. A beginning should be made by 
establishing open-air classes, classes for the mentally slow, and classes for 
those having speech defects. 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
1. The high school has nearly 900 pupils in average attendance, of whom 
about 50 come from outside the city. It is growing at the rate of about 50 
pupils per year. About 400 pupils are boys and nearly 500 girls. 2. Nearly 
half of the pupils entering leave within two years. 3. The building is seriously 
overcrowded and many of the rooms are entirely unfit for classroom use. 
4, The teaching force consists of 39 men and women, of whom nearly one-third 
are graduates of the school. The salaries run from $800 to $1,400. 5. Of the 
pupils entering the school only about 1 in 16 goes to college, which indicates 
that the college entrance requirements should wield less influence than they now 
do in shaping the courses of study. 6. The school needs better administration, 
more cooperation between students, teachers, and principal, and a higher quality 
of teaching. 
REORGANIZATION. 
1. It is recommended that the school system be reorganized so as to include 
intermediate schools or junior high schools, which shall comprise the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades. This will leave the first six grades in the elementary 
schools and the three highest grades in the senior high school. 2. Such a reor- 
ganization will provide temporary relief from the overcrowding in the present 
high school until a new building can be erected. It also provides for the eco- 
nomic utilization of the present high-school building. 8. The proposed plan is 
educationally superior to the present one because it provides a special type of 
schooling for the boys and girls during the period of adolescence, when they 
most urgently need it. Schools organized as recommended are in successful 
operation in other countries and in many cities of this country. 4. Schools 
organized on the proposed plan hold their pupils better than do schools organ- 
ized as they are in this city at present. 5. The adoption of the new plan would 
help to solve the problems of vocational education. 6. If the schools are reor- 
ganized as is recommended, some opposition from teachers, principals, and 
parents must be expected. This is true of every innovation, but in this case it 
would not be either serious or of long duration. 
In the study of vocational education a new attack was made upon 
the problem in order to secure the data which would be really sig- 
nificant. This included particularly the nativity, the migration of 
parents, and the family relations of those engaged in each class of 
industry studied, and the proportion of schoolboys who wished to 
enter the same industrial groups. The occupational choices of boys  
-P-A-G-E-472
452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
as compared with the occupations of fathers and older brothers and 
the occupational choices of girls as compared with the occupations of 
older sisters brought to light interesting data on the aspirations of 
youth. 
1. At present the boys and girls, upon: reaching the limit of the cumpulsory 
attendance period, are scattered throughout the grades of the elementary and 
high schools. Nearly half of them are in the sixth grade or below. The prob- 
lem of securing a reasonably complete elementary schooling for all these chil- 
dren is part of the problem of instituting vocational education. 2. Among the 
fathers of these children only one in six was born in this city and of the chil- 
dren only one-half were born here. This indicates that narrowly specialized 
preparation for specific industries will not solve the problem of vocational 
education. 8. The children in school aspire to types of life work far in 
advance of those to which their brothers, sisters, and fathers have succeeded in 
attaining. They also hope to secure far more schooling than it is probable that 
they will be able to secure. 4. The statements of the boys as to life work 
which they hope to enter appear to be reliable in general and unreliable in 
detail as guides for the formulation of courses of vocational education. The 
choices of the girls are of less value, both in general and in detail. 5. An analy- 
sis of the available data indicates that most of the girls and substantially half 
of the boys desire to enter occupations for which the schools already offer some- 
what adequate preparatory training. 6. About one-half of the boys desire to 
enter industrial work for which general industrial preparation can be given. 
7. It is recommended that the city establish courses of preparatory industrial 
training in its junior and senior high schools through utilizing for educational 
purposes the work that is incidental to the maintenance of the public schools. 
8. This work can be instituted at slight expense, and the major part of its cost 
can be defrayed from the building fund.   BLAINE, WASH. 
How an educational survey may be useful in helping the new and 
rapidly changing communities in the far West to eliminate the evils 
that make their early appearance in the public schools can in future 
be illustrated by the permanent results derivable from the study of 
the schools in Blaine, Wash. At the request of the board of educa- 
tion the public schools of this Northwesternmost town in the United 
States were studied under the supervision of the department of edu- 
cation and the extension division of the University of Washington. 
The investigators were Prof. H. G. Lull, assisted by F. E. Millay 
and P. J. Kruse, graduate assistants in the department of education. 
Attention was directed to the educational needs of the town; 
grounds, buildings, and hygiene; age-grade distribution of pupils; 
the course of study; and instruction. The object was to present the 
most pressing needs of the schools for the immediate consideration 
of the local authorities. Some conditions were compared with those 
prevailing in 15 other small towns in the State. The survey “con- 
tains so much that is applicable elsewhere” that it was decided to 
publish it in the issue of the University [of Washington] Eatension 
Journal, volume 1, No. 3, July, 1914 (pp. 89-165).
-P-A-G-E-473
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 453 
CHICAGO, ILL. 
A new method of conducting a survey of schools was inaugurated 
in Chicago by Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, superintendent of schools, 
in the effort to anticipate the appearance of this new educational 
movement in that city. 
After listening to the presentations by the members of the committee on 
standards and tests of efficiency [at the Department of Superintendence, Rich- 
mond, Va., February, 1914] I concluded that great benefit would be derived in a 
system if the teachers, those who are directly associated with the children and 
youth, could first make such a study, if of only one line of instruction or effort. 
I then called together the superintendents to consider conducting a survey of 
our system by ourselves, before outside experts or lay investigators should take 
up the work. With 7,000 teachers and principals, it was impossible that all 
should have the benefit of activity in visiting schools and discussing the work 
observed. A few governing conditions were laid down: Every school should 
have a representative on some one of the survey committees, hence no school 
should have more than one representative; the chairmen of the committees 
should be taken from the superintendent’s staff, because each could have greater 
freedom in planning the trips and the meetings of the committee in charge than 
a principal or teacher could; no member of a committee should be a specialist 
teaching the subject assigned that committee. Having gone thus far the fol- 
lowing points were decided upon: First, each committee should hand in a 
written report on or before May 15; second, the reports should indicate defects 
in the work as well as excellencies ; third, suggestions for improving the schools 
should be made freely ; fourth, the committee reports should be presented to the 
board of education in the annual report of the superintendent of schools in 
place of the customary individual reports of regular day schools and districts 
by members of the superintendent’s staff. 
The schools were grouped by the chairmen so that every school in the city 
should be visited by at least one committee. Upon the urgent request of some 
committees one exception was made to the ruling that no school should have 
more than one representative on the committees; the exception was in case of 
three specialists in the normal college faculty.   
Some aspects of this method of having teachers conduct a survey of 
their own activities may be found in the following communication 
sent out when it was learned that “teachers were becoming uneasy 
as to the object of the visits:” 
‘The survey which we are making of our schools at present is not in any way 
intended to bring schools into comparison with one another. No teachers will 
be marked ; no schools will be marked. In the report the schools will be spoken 
of as schools A, B, C. Even the good schools will not be mentioned by name. 
There is no need for any anxiety or excitement. Without doubt, we shall be 
more conscious of our excellencies or failures because of visitors coming to the 
school, but there is nothing which will in any way disturb any teacher in his 
or her position as a result of this survey. 
Should there come later a survey conducted by inspectors from the outside, 
we shall have our own survey with which to judge their results.’ We also shall 
have gone through the first palpitations and excitement caused by a cooperative 
investigation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-474
  454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Another angle from which to estimate the value of a teacher-made 
survey may be found in an observation in the report of the committee 
on geography and nature study: 
To our mind, one of the best and most unusual features of this unique survey 
has been the fact that teachers, not overawed by the presence of some great 
expert, have communicated their difficulties and perplexities freely and have 
often asked for help that was fully accorded them whenever possible. The 
fact that the elementary teachers themselves participated in the survey has 
made it easy for the teacher of the class to ask her visitor in entire good faith, 
“Now, as one teacher to another, tell me candidly what you think of this lesson? 
What are its weak points, and how can I make it better?” 
This survey presents the findings of the various committees more from the 
viewpoint of the principal and the teacher than do the reports of the college 
experts. College experts who are making a specialty of testing and standard- 
izing public schools earnéstly desire to march on to the schools of Chicago. 
We are ready for a fair test, but we suggest that the situation would be most 
delicate if a survey committee should include any one immediately concerned 
with the organization or instruction in an elementary or high school charging 
tuition fees within the corporate limits of Chicago. 
The work was conducted by 320 superintendents, supervisors, prin- 
cipals, and teachers arranged in committees, each of which was as- 
signed particular topics. The length of time involved in the inquiry 
is not stated. The reports were ordered printed by the board of 
education on May 18, 1914, and appeared in the sixtieth annual 
report of the board of education for the year ending June 30, 1914. 
The survey occupies pages 31-287. The 25 topics, with the extent 
of the reports and the size of committees, respectively, are as follows:

  SCHOOL SURVEYS. : 455 
The report of each committee is made independently of the others. 
There is no summary of the findings and of the recommendaticns. 
Among the numerous details in the statements, discussions, and 
recommendations the following may be grouped as most interesting: 
A complete elementary-school plant is thus described: 
For teaching purposes: Classrooms, with varying equipment to meet the re- 
quirements of the various subjects; kindergarten, manual-training, cooking, 
and sewing rooms, and other special rooms as needed, properly equipped; and 
space on the grounds for school gardens. 
For administration: A principal’s office, with a private office for consulta- 
tions; storerooms for supplies and movable equipment; a room for meetings of 
the faculty. i 
For health and sanitation : A gymnasium, properly equipped, and separate 
from the assembly hall; playrooms or shelter rooms into which children may 
go while waiting for the doors to open in inclement weather and for play space 
for pupils of the primary grades in bad weather; a bathroom; a room for the 
use of the visiting nurse and physician; sanitary toilet rooms on each floor 
of the building; drinking water supplied on each floor; playground space on the 
grounds sufficient to give an average of 30 square feet per pupil. 
For teachers: A rest room; a room properly equipped in which they may eat 
their luncheon; toilet rooms on each floor. 
Supplemental: An assembly hall on the ground floor, not combined with gym- 
nasium, so constructed that it may be used for evening meetings without requir- 
ing the use of other portions of the building; a library room for pupils’ use; 
an adaptation of the ground-floor rooms for community center uses in the 
evening. 
With this plan in mind the committee endeavored to estimate the 
fitness of the equipment of the nearly 300 school buildings in the 
city. Taking 30 square feet of open playground per pupil as the 
minimum in school grounds, it was found that 50 per cent of the 
schools had from 5 to 29 square feet per pupil and 50 per cent from 
30 to 100 square feet per pupil. The problem of the semifireproofing 
old buildings received special attention. A regulation of the board 
of education called for window-glass area equal to 20 per cent of the 
floor area of the room. It was found that in all elementary and 
kindergarten classrooms only 33 per cent of all the classrooms had 
20 per cent or more of glass area, 27 per cent of the rooms having 
less than 15 per cent of glass area. 
The committee on administration endeavored to widen the door of 
opportunity to let trained and experienced teachers from elsewhere 
enter the Chicago system. A number of changes were proposed in 
the matter of certificates, oral examinations, and the adoption of a 
strictly merit system for the eligible list. The present promotion 
system should be abolished. It was suggested that the Chicago Nor- 
mal College be made a public school, and, accordingly, an integral 
part of the school system. The tendency of the teachers to adopt 
commercial in the place of professional standards was definitely 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
deplored. The amount of equipment and the distribution of supplies 
received special consideration. 
The department of child study and pedagogic investigation, estab- 
lished in 1899, was one of the earliest in the country to make appli- 
cation of the scientific method in dealing with individual children. 
Some aspects of the restricted development of this work may be 
gained from the following recommendations: 
It is the opinion of this committee that owing to the growth of the city’s 
demands, and owing to increased calls by schools for instructions in handling 
difficult and peculiar children, the child-study department has been crowded 
beyond its capacity; that it lacks organization both within itself and in its 
relation to other agencies looking to the welfare of children in the city; and 
that it therefore does not reach all cases needing attention, and its records and 
recommendations are now insufficient to serve the demands made upon it. We 
recommend, therefore— 
(a) That its scope be enlarged. 
(b) That it be given more help and more facilities. 
(c) That it be put in closer relation with other departments which care for 
children. 
(d) That it be given greater power to call upon agencies concerned in carry- 
ing out its recommendations. 
(e) That there be more definite internal organization, and that it be made 
more accessible as a bureau of educational research for the welfare of all 
classes of children in the city. 
(f) That every school have one or more ungraded rooms, with a maximum 
attendance of 25 pupils, providing a specially equipped teacher and facilities 
for treating these pupils as to their individual needs. 
(g) That since malnutrition is responsible for much of the retardation and 
subnormality, and since marked improvement is noted where proper food is 
provided for such children, steps be taken to insure suitable food, at least one 
meal a day, to all pupils needing such attention. 
(h) That a more comprehensive “ adult probation law” be passed, giving 
school authorities power to compel parents to provide for the proper examina- 
tion of their children, where such is deemed necessary, and for the carrying out 
of the suggestions made after such examinations. 
In the matter of physical education the recommendations were: 
1. Our schools should move in the direction of required courses in physical 
training that produce noticeable results. 
2. Strengthen instruction in the elementary schools. In the light gymnastics 
or calisthenics, work more toward simplicity, accuracy, and vigor. 
3. Encourage school athletics by. appointing field directors to relieve over- 
worked gymnasium teachers. 
4. Wstablish a department in the normal school tor a thorough training of 
special teachers and supervisors, and in that way supply the greatest need of 
our work in physical education at the present time. 
In the study of the situation of the training of teachers the report 
directs attention to the Chicago Normal College, the practice schools, 
and a period of four months’ cadetship in the elementary schools. 
The following suggestions, looking toward an increase in the number
-P-A-G-E-477
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 457 
of admissions to the normal school and the improvement of the 
quality of its product, were made: 
1. That the normal school should be made a more integral part of the public- 
school system by admitting graduates of the public high schools without exami- 
nation. 
2. That some plan should be devised for securing a pro rata apportionment 
for each public high school and for each accredited high school, thus giving 
the schools an opportunity to offer their best product to train for the profession 
of teaching. 
3. The cadet period should be made financially productive to the graduates 
of the normal school without requiring them to perform the work of substi- 
tuting. ;: 
4. The vocation of teaching, and this means of entering it, shouid be kept 
prominently before the students of the high schools by addresses by members 
of the faculty of the normal school, formal and informal meetings, such as a 
“high-school day ” at the normal school, acquaintance with their best teachers 
of the staff, and the like. 
In the study of spelling, three separate lists of 50 words each were 
prepared for the fifth and sixth grades, the seventh grade, and the 
eighth grade. Testing 1,881 fifth-grade pupils yielded an average 
of 74.3. The same list given to 1,948 sixth-grade pupils yielded an 
average of 82.7; to 1,803 seventh-grade pupils, resulted in an average 
of 75.5; to 1,783 eighth-grade children, resulted in an average of 76.3. 
Attention is given by means of the questionnaire to the problems of 
the spelling recitation and the study period in this subject. An 
attempt was made to study the spelling needs of business firms, but 
the replies were not very satisfactory or instructive. 
It is the opinion of your committee that this experience should discount very 
considerably the complaints said to emanate from the business houses concern- 
ing the inability of pupils, fresh from the schools, to spell in terms of their 
employer’s business. 
The recommendations are: 
1. That a spelling book, or fixed list of words, should be provided and adopted 
for general use in the schools without excluding the privilege of using textbook 
lists for special study. 
2. That more attention should -be given in the school system to the method of 
study in preparing lessons. Your committee is persuaded that if the same 
attention were given to the study of words that is given to the study of prob- 
lems, spelling results would be much better. 
8. That it would be wise for the board of education to authorize as optional 
the use of as large a list as might be approved from the “ Simplified spelling 
board’s” recommendations. 
The committee on arithmetic and mathematics— 
found the teaching of arithmetic in the elementary schools good; far better than 
they had anticipated. They were struck by the great amount of careful indi- 
vidual work done and by the responsibility assumed by the individual child 
despite the large classes where much work is necessarily formal. They wish to 
commend many new and effective methods seen. If the pupils do not get a
-P-A-G-E-478
  458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
reasonable knowledge of arithmetic in our elementary schools the cause must be 
sought elsewhere than in the teaching in the schools visited. In some cases the 
committee saw much formal review and would suggest more careful planning 
of the work from grade to grade. The committee saw too much abstract and not 
enough concrete work in many cases. The present demands of “ business ” that 
the schools turn out expert manipulators of figures is liable to result in irre- 
parable loss to pupils. : 
It is also suggested that if mathematical forms and language were more care- 
fully exact throughout, time would be saved and power gained. There should 
be more real problems. The value of so much oral and mental abstract work 
divorced from the written and concrete work is seriously questioned. The gen- 
eral overlapping of the work in the elementary schools and the high school busi- 
ness arithmetic is inexplicable. 
The committee on geography and nature study recommended, in 
part, as follows: 2 
1. That a more helpful supervision of geography and nature study, empha- 
sizing fundamental educational principles, rather than details of method, be 
given. 
2. That, as far as is possible, the work in geography and nature study be de- 
partmental. 
38. That an exchange of visits between teachers be provided for and encour- 
aged. - 
4, That excursions by classes, accompanied by experienced teachers, to places 
of interest connected with these subjects be a regularly planned part of the 
work, 
5. That some systematic plan of collecting, distributing, and using illustrative 
material be followed in the schools. 
6. That, as far as possible, the special training in geography and nature study 
now given in our Teachers Colleges be utilized by placing the incoming young 
teachers where they shall have opportunities to use this training. 
7. That attention to home geography be continued in the fifth and sixth 
grades. 
8. That the closer correlation of geography with history, civics, literature, and 
other subjects should be made wherever possible. 
9. Finally, that a permanent nature study and geographical committee be 
appointed, whose duty it shall be to plat the city and its surroundings; show 
what material can be found; tell where and how to reach it and consult with all 
transportation lines, with the view of getting reduced rates and special accom- 
modations for classes wishing to visit the various sections. A comprehensive 
excursion plan would be worked out which would open up a new field of investi- 
gation for nature study and geography. 
. The scope of the study made by the committee on history, as well 
as some of the findings, can best be illustrated by the outlines which 
were used by the committee on elementary schools and the commit- 
tee on high schools, respectively (where figures occur in the first out- 
line they indicate the summary of reports from 72 schools) : 
Is there an organization of the celebrations in connection with the patriotic 
holidays which results in a knowledge of history? Yes, 53; no, 19. Which holi- 
day is singled out for emphasis? Are the patriotic songs a means of cultivat- 
ing a love of country? Are the patriotic poems memorized by classes or by indi- 
viduals? Has the school a collection of historical pictures? Are any of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-479
  
  
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 459 
decorative pictures historical in character? Has anything in the way of 
pageant been organized? If so, note its character. Is there a well-selected 
supply of supplementary reading material? Yes, 50; no, 22. Has the school 
a supply of library books bearing on history? Yes, 29; no, 48. Does the school 
make use of the facilities offered by the public library? Yes, 43; no, 29. By 
the historical society? Is the principle of the three-textbook plan recognized? 
Yes, 61; no, 11. A list of patriotic poems suitable for different grades. Some 
of the best supplementary readers bearing on history. Some of the most suit- 
able library books presenting historical material. Is training for civic responsi- 
bility manifest? Yes, 60; no, 12. Did the registration of the mothers bring out 
the necessity and advantage of naturalization for foreign-born people? Yes, 43; 
no, 29. Several of these 29-schools are American. 
The recitation in history: 1. Was it inclined to be formal or memoriter? 
Yes, 19; no, 48. 2. Did the teacher depend upon volunteers? 3. Did the recita- 
tion develop “initiative”? 4. Were formal written tests in evidence? 5. Did 
the lesson lead into questions of the day? 6. Did it start with a question of 
the day? 7. Was there evidence of organization on the part of the teacher? On 
the part of the children? Yes, 58, no. 14. 
Do the high-school pupils approach the study of history with the advance in 
power which should reasonably be expected? To what extent is the study one 
of isolated facts? To what extent does it trace the development of the free- 
dom of mankind? To what extent does it make for good citizenship? Are 
questions concerning such subjects as these connected with the discussion of 
the history: Industrial development, child labor, naturalization, suffrage for 
women, State rights, laws regarding the holding of land by aliens? To what 
extent do the pupils make use of histories other than the required text? Is 
collateral reading evident? Are pictures and other illustrative material used? 
Is the public library used for history material? Are the pupils familiar with 
the work of the historical society? Is the English of the recitation clear, dig- 
nified, connected? 
The report of this committee called particular attention to the 
importance of the use of three textbooks in the upper grades and 
the topical recitation in the high schools. 
The report of the committee on industrial and prevocational edu- 
cation is one of the most comprehensive in the survey. The follow- 
ing statement of principle was enunciated : 
1. The committee holds that the primary or fundamental purpose in elemen- 
tary education is the development in the child of those attitudes and reactions 
essential to social well-being in a democratic society. 
2. The different handworks are hence in the elementary schools, as, in fact, all 
content, primarily to further the end of good citizenship or social culture, and 
only secondarily for vocational purposes. It is granted that all elementary 
school content has a vocational aspect. In this sense all work in the elementary 
school is prevocational. 
Criticism: The committee looks, therefore, with disfavor on overemphasizing 
the vocational aspect of handwork in the elementary schools for pupils, under 
14 years of age and the subordination to this aspect of the academic content 
taught. 
The report undertakes to make a contribution to this new move- 
ment in education in its discussion of aims, terminology, differentia- 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
tion of schools, courses and pupils, types of handwork, and the prep- 
aration of teachers. 
Two committees agree in the recommendation of the organization 
of the vocational guidance bureau as an integral part of the public- 
school system. The plan detailed for this bureau is as follows: 
The vocational guidance bureau should consist of the director and such pro- 
fessional and clerical assistants as the director and superintendent shall from 
time to time deem to be necessary. 
The work of the director should include the following: 1. To advise, instruct, 
and confer with the school advisers. 2. To plan and direct a system whereby 
each child who leaves school to go to work may be followed wp, and such assist- 
ance and advice given him as he may need from time to time. Also to keep on 
file in his office such data gathered from the various schools as shall be of value 
for reference and consultation. It is understood that the work undertaken by 
this bureau shall not in any way conflict with or take the place of the work 
of the compulsory education bureau. 3. To organize and maintain a placement 
bureau, which shall be conducted under his direction, and to cooperate with 
industrial, social, and philanthropic organizations outside the schools in their 
efforts to place children in suitable vocations. 4. To give advice and help to 
such children as the school advisers may refer to him. 5. As rapidly as pos- 
sible, to make surveys of the more important industries, especially of those 
which employ young people between 14 and 16, and to have the results printed 
in suitable form for reference and distribution. 6. 'To perform any other duties 
appertaining to his office which may from time to time seem necessary. 
The committee recommends that the principal of each school, or some 
teacher appointed by him, shall act as vocational adviser. The work of the 
vocational advisers should include the following: 1. To advise pupils who in- 
tend to go to work. To furnish information to pupils and parents as to op- 
portunities in occupations open to children. 2. To confer with the parent 
always before a school certificate is given. 3. To make out the school certifi- 
cate after conference with the parent and pupil and mail it to the central 
bureau. 4. To fill out in duplicate an informational card, one of which shall 
be mailed to the central bureau with the school certificate and one kept on 
file_at the school. This card shall contain such data as are necessary in advis- 
ing and placing the child intelligently. 4. Acting in cooperation with the com- 
pulsory education bureau to keep track of all children to whom work certifi- 
cates have been given, to ascertain whether they are actually at work, where 
such work is, and, as far as possible, the conditions under which they are 
laboring. This information shall be entered on the pupil’s card and kept at the 
school for reference. 6. As far as possible, to keep in touch with the employers 
of children in the neighborhood, and to advise the central bureau of needs and 
“conditions in local establishments. 7. To attend meetings called by the director 
and to perform such other work as may be necessitated by the vocational 
demands of the schools. 
The central bureau will always act in harmony with the bureau of compul- 
sory education, both in reference to the “ follow-up work” and the issuance of 
work certificates. In all cases where necessity arises the powers of both depart- 
ments should be concentrated to accomplish the observance of the law, and 
consequently the*highest interests of the child.

  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 461 
SOUTH BEND, IND. 
A distinct contribution to the study of school systems is made in 
the survey of the public schools in South Bend, Ind., conducted by 
the department of education of the University of Chicago. During 
the “last six weeks of the school year,” 1912-13, the field work was 
conducted by Prof. Charles H. Judd and Dr. J. F. Bobbitt, the latter 
being the director of the survey. A personal investigation of the 
school conditions in the city included the visitation of 17 buildings, 
a half day usually being devoted to each building. Each expert was 
in the field not more than two or three days each week, aggregating 
“15 days actually on the grounds.” The data were secured with 
“the friendly cooperation and assistance of superintendent, assistant 
superintendent, principals, teachers, and clerk of the board.” 
It appears that the question of having a study made of school 
conditions was first introduced by the superintendent in a meeting 
of the principals a year earlier. “The money to defray the expenses 
of the actual survey was raised entirely through efforts of the teach- 
ing force, and later the board appropriated $250 to be used if neces- 
sary for the publication of the same.” The situation leading to the 
inquiry was accordingly not one of dissatisfaction; on the contrary, 
it was desired by the school staff “ with the thought that some outside 
aid and outside guidance would be able to render service valuable to 
the entire school city?” 
The report is published in connection with the biennial report of 
Superintendent of Schools L. J. Montgomery, for the biennium 
ending August 1, 1914 (pp. 117-216). The report was submitted by 
the director of the survey on August 27, 1914, the section on reading 
(pp. 125-131) being contributed by Prof. Judd. 
Among the large number of findings and recommendations «the 
following may be stated here: In their possession of the tools of 
knowledge or training for literacy it was found there was great 
diversity of practice in the several elementary schools of the city, 
due to the freedom allowed principals to adjust time allotments, 
methods, and materials to meet the specific needs of their buildings, 
respectively. Attention is called to the necessity of differentiating 
the method of teaching reading in the upper grades from that which 
obtains in the lower grades. The material was not always well 
selected, either being too difficult or not well adapted to the children, 
as in the case of those of foreign parentage. Freedom from the 
limits of the adopted textbook and the selection of reading matter is 
especially recommended. The system of phonic analysis which teach- 
ers have developed is commended. Attention is called to the over 
emphasis upon the extraction of the meaning of particular passages 
in the upper grades, and to the practical neglect of methods of in- 
struction in silent reading. :
-P-A-G-E-482
  462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The study of the education situation in South Bend is dominated 
by a careful and exhaustive analysis of the various functions which 
a system of public schools should discharge. Briefly stated, these 
are as follows: (1) The overcoming of illiteracy in the whole popu- 
lation; (2) the giving of college preparatory training to those 
looking forward to professional and managerial labors; (8) training 
for vocational skill and understanding because of the highly complex 
industrial processes and the great wealth of technical information 
needed for guidance; (4) training for wise and efficient citizenship 
because of the status of the individual and the democracy; (5) train- 
ing of the population for physical efficiency due to the congestion of 
population in civic centers and the increasing sedentariness of the 
work of men and women; (6) training for leisure occupations as the 
best antidote for the modern competitive nervous strain. 
The practical test to which the school data were brought was in 
each instance an approximate measurement of the extent to which 
each of these functions was converted to organizing the administra- 
tive and teaching purposes. In general, it is found that the first 
and second functions have been well performed in South Bend; the 
third has received some partial but wholly inadequate recognition. 
As to the fourth function, “much is being done, but purposes have 
not been defined, consequently work is wavering and fragmentary.” 
The fifth has received some partial but very inadequate recognition, 
while the development of a recognition of the last function is only 
in its incipiency. The final offering of “a short list of things done 
and a long list of things yet to be done” is not to be construed as 
“ faultfinding” but rather an indication of the growth which always 
characterizes a school system. “ Educational growth in South Bend 
has been rapid and healthy, but the school system is not full grown.” 
Were I asked to point out the greatest single weakness of educational work 
in South Bend, or in most other cities for that matter, I should point to the 
haziness of ideas as to what the schools are after. I should not only point to 
this as the greatest weakness but as the taproot out of which almost all other 
weaknesses grow. As one visits classrooms one often finds perfunctoriness, 
forcelessness, incoherency in the organization of materials, abstractness of 
materials, passivity of pupils, unthinking use of textbooks, etc. All these things 
can be traced to the central root of purposelessness in the work. 
There is no need of our discussing these derived faulty conditions. Our 
business is to get at the root of things—the definition of the purposes and the 
fitting of means to these purposes. This has been our central aim in all the 
preceding chapters. 
* * * Faulty conditions are not to be got at in any direct and easy manner. 
They all spring from a common root. We felt that in giving so much time in 
the earlier sections to definition of proper ends and purposes we were making 
the recommendations that would go furthest in remedying imperfect teaching 
methods. 
 
-P-A-G-E-483
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 463 
The report includes 12 chapters and 25 tables. The chapter topics 
in order are as follows: The general situation, education for literacy, 
education for vocation, education for citizenship, education for 
physical efficiency, education for leisure occupations, definition of 
purposes, the student population, elementary teachers, the high- 
school situation, the general administrative situation, the financial 
situation. 
The report stands out in strong contrast with all other surveys 
made by reason of the method of interpretation given to the data 
which were collected. Instead of the usual procedure of inquiry into 
the so-called “ fact basis,” this study is an application of the princi- 
ples of education which are kept constantly in the foreground. The 
fact features of the situation are then brought forward for proper 
distribution and further recommendation. The first seven chapters, 
or nearly seven-ninths, of the report are devoted to the consideration 
of the purposes which are obtaining in “the school city.” This 
feature is clearly set forth in the prefatory statement: 
What is needed in a first survey is an examination of the fundamental 
aspects of the work. One must see whether the schools are trying to meet 
the needs of the community ; whether they are emphasizing the various aspects 
of the work in proportion to relative social values; whether all the children 
are being reached, and for a long enough period; whether the teaching and 
supervising corps are well trained and clearly conscious of the specific ways in 
which their labors are designed to serve the general community; whether the 
material bases of good work are being supplied by the community; whether 
the general public is performing its share in actively promoting the labors of 
its schools. 
The teaching of spelling exhibited many merits as well as short- 
comings. The work is too abstract. Special commendation is given 
to the development of the English work called “Free expression.” 
It is recommended that the time now given to the classes called lan- 
guage, composition, and grammar should be greatly curtailed, but 
without an exclusion of language drill. In penmanship South Bend 
ranks 16 per cent above the average speed in writing letters by 
pupils in all grades, from the second to the eighth, in 138 American 
cities. Speed is overemphasized and quality is apparently sacri- 
ficed; on the Ayres scale, South Bend is the lowest of 38 cities. A 
redistribution of special drill to those pupils in need of it is recom- 
mended. 
The data of the 1910 census report on the vocational distribution 
of both the male and female wage-earning population were utilized 
as a foundation for considering the next steps that should be taken 
in making provision for giving training for entrance into all of the 
major vocations in which the city is directly interested. The report 
of the survey makes the interesting suggestion that this training 
should be “ upon three levels ”—the general vocational training, the
-P-A-G-E-484
  464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
semispecialized, and the specialized. In addition to the wide range 
of practical activities that are listed in detail, the need of additional 
wraining is emphasized—technical vocational information of many 
sorts and general socializing vocational information for purpose of 
social vision. It is found that some beginnings have been made in 
each of these seven aspects of vocational training. That these “ prac- 
tical activities must be intellectualized through and through” is a 
special note in the report. 
In addition to the consideration of the teaching of the vocational 
subjects, special attention is given to geography and history as 
academic instruments directly concerned with the development of 
vocational purposes. It is recommended: 
(1) Teachers and supervisors should clearly define their purposes in teach- 
ing geography in terms of twentieth century social needs, keeping in mind that, 
among these various social needs, wide industrial vision is the major one. 
(2) Each building should be supplied with all necessary books and visual mate- 
rials. (3) The development of geography work of the right sort for the eighth 
grade and the high school is urged. 
Practically the same recommendations are made with reference to history. 
History and geography deal with the same social groups, with the same institu- 
tions, and with the same vocational labors. One, however, looks at them 
spatially, the other temporally. The geographical and historical treatments of 
any topic should not be divorced. 
It is recommended that training for citizenship be recognized by the school 
at South Bend as one of the legitimate functions of public education and that 
the curriculum of grammar grades and high schools be modified accordingly. 
In order properly to perform his portion in carrying on the very many civic 
functions demanded of the citizen to-day, it is necessary that he be given much 
the same in general outline as that for vocational training: (1) Practical par- 
ticipation ; (2) technical information for guidance; (3) general social, economic, 
and political information for perspective. 
That education for physical efficiency is a legitimate province of public educa- 
tion has been recognized partially, but imperfectly, in South Bend. The ele- 
ments in training necessary for this purpose are recognized as of the three kinds 
necessary in other fields—practical training, technical information, and a wide 
social point of view. The important place of play and games is strongly em- 
phasized in this connection. 
The attention given to the educational purpose of training for leisure occu- 
pations shows that the past emphasis upon reading and music as preparation 
for the enjoyment of leisure during maturity does not sufficiently supply the 
needs of a community. Folk dancing, sports, and games, as well as a general 
vocational training which lays the foundation for healthy avocations, are 
brought forward as demanding immediate attention. The probable future val- 
ues of the modern foreign languages, such as French and German, in this con- 
nection are not probably commensurate with the effort and expense which are 
expended upon them. Finally, it is definitely recommended that courses of study 
be stated in terms of purposes rather than in terms of topics and materials to 
be covered. Along with such courses there should be a wealth of suggestions 
as to material that may be employed which will assist in reaching the ends 
in view. Each teacher should be permitted to continue to enjoy large freedom 
from arbitrary authority in the selection of the material that is used.

The school census of South Bend shows a population of somewhat over 16,000 
between the ages of 6 and 21. The number of children of each age is unknown. 
The number in school, including public, private, and parochial, of each age is 
unknown. The number of each age who are not in any school is unknown. The 
annual school census seems not really designed as a means of supervising 
attendance. 
Principals and teachers should cooperate with the community of their district 
and know it so intimately that a family could not move in under ordinary cir- 
cumstances without their becoming aware of it. The welcoming into their 
district of all newly arriving families in which there are children of school 
age should be one of the primary functions of teachers and principals. 
A novel attempt was made at a new problem in the treatment 
of the position and progress of every pupil in every school. The 
16 elementary schools were also compared as to their relative 
standing in the progress of pupils through the grades. By this 
scheme it was found that in 10 schools satisfactory progress was 
being made, whereas in 6 schools the progress was clearly unsatis- 
factory. A retardation chart shows the comparative position occu- 
pied by each school. In view of the serious situation created by 
the well-known phenomenon of elimination, it was recommended that 
special classes be formed for the purpose of giving rapid treatment 
of the essentials of history, geography, hygiene, elementary science, 
and vocational studies, so that no student of normal intelligence 
may go forth from the school in total ignorance of these vital fields 
of training. 
The study of the elementary teachers revealed that the amount of 
academic and professional training received by them averages 4.8 
years beyond the eighth grade, or eight-tenths of a year beyond a 
full high-school course. They had had an average experience in 
teaching of 6.7 years, and an average tenure of four years in South 
Bend schools. In these three respects South Bend occupies a very 
low rank in a group of 26 cities and villages in the Middle West. 
The median salary of the elementary teacher is $540. In this re- 
spect South Bend is next to the lowest in a list of 34 northern cities 
east of the Rockies. Immediate attention should be given to the 
raising of the salary schedule in order to hold teachers. 
Study of special topics relating to the high schools developed some interesting 
results. In terms of the conception of the several education purposes, some 
of the facts are not easy in explanation. It was found that the portion of each 
$1,000 expended for instruction in each of the high-school subjects was as 
follows: English composition and literature, $157; the sciences, $180; higher 
mathematics, $117; commercial subjects, $106; manual training, $81; history, 
$77; modern languages, $71; public speaking, $58; physical training, $58; Latin, 
$54; domestic science, $35; domestic arts, $29; drawing, $22; music, $5.

The distribution of the time of the high-school students was taken 
as another means for judging the community valuation of the ma- 
terial in the course of study. The distribution of each 1,000 student 
, hours over the different subject is as follows: 
  Commercial subjects, 151; English, 149; science, 129; mathematics, 112; 
physical training, 88; history, 78; modern languages, 69; manual training 45; 
Latin, 89; public speaking, 35; domestic science, 31; drawing, 27; domestic arts, 
24; music, 23. 
An effort was made to determine the cost per student-hour of the 
different subjects, with the following results: 
Manual training, $0.111; public speaking, $0.104; Latin, $0.085; domestic 
arts, $0.074; domestic science, $0.070; English, $0.066; modern languages, 
$0.063 ; mathematics, $0.062; history, $0.062; science, $0.062; drawing, $0.051; 
commercial subjects, $0.043; physical training, $0.041; music, $0.016. 
It appears that the burden of teaching the different subjects is 
inequitably distributed among the teachers of the different depart- 
ments as shown by the relative amount of classwork done per 
teacher per week. ’

The medium high-school teacher’s salary is $940. Three-fourths 
of the cities in its class pay a higher average salary than South Bend. 
The financial problem receives final consideration. It is shown that 
the city is in a very fortunate financial situation, being able to under- 
take without strain any of the things recommended in connection 
with thesurvey. Comparatively speaking, it is a very wealthy city, as 
shown by the practice of 46 Northern cities east of the Rockies. The 
property tax for all purposes is also far below the average, and the 
tax rate as based upon the estimated true valuation of property is 
nearly at the bottom of the list. The very slight burden of the city 
debt per capita of population shows that its material resources in the 
direction of education need to be more completely utilized.

  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 467 
UPPER PENINSULA, MICH. 
The bureau of research of the Upper Peninsula (Mich.) Educa- 
tional Association, which gives instance of a cooperative school sur- 
vey in its first report in 1913, modified the work, the results of which 
were presented in its report of September 1, 1914. 
This year the bureau has attempted to discover the points of strength and 
weakness in the schools, as judged by parents and others interested in them. 
The duty of the school is to produce the type of citizen demanded by the 
times, and it must frequently inquire into its own success or failure in accom- 
plishing this task. ‘ 
The basis of this report is the individual judgments of 317 representative 
citizens of the Upper Peninsula. The judgments of teachers were not consid- 
ered, consequently the report gives only the viewpoint of the layman. 
The following occupations were represented by the persons who responded to 
the committee’s inqui: Attorney, banker, bank cashier, bookkeeper, broker, 
chemist, city clerk, clergyman, contractor and builder, construction superin- 
tendent, county Young Men’s Christian Association superintendent, draftsman, 
druggist, electrician, farmer, health officer, housewife, justice of peace, laborer, 
mayor, manager of mine, manager of business house, merchant, mining engineer, 
mine inspector, mine superintendent, mine clerk, mill superintendent, mining 
captain, mill owner, newspaper man, observer at weather bureau, photographer, 
physician, postmaster, president of railroad, railroad agent, real estate and insur- 
ance, register of deeds, railroad manager, salesman, sheriff, secretary of Young 
Men’s Christian Association, secretary of commercial club, stenographer, super- 
intendent of stone quarry, soprano soloist. 
  The inquiry was made by means of a questionnaire sent to laymen, 
dealing with problems connected with moral education, physical 
education, industrial education, and general. 
On moral education the questions were as follows: 
1. In your opinion, are the public schools doing all they should in training 
for conduct and character? (qa) If not, in what particular are they deficient? 
(b) If not, what remedy would you suggest? 
2. Should the schools do more to train boys and girls socially; that is, in the 
amenities of society? 
8. In your opinion, do parents sufficiently exercise their responsibility in 
training children for conduct and character? 
4. Should the conduct of boys and girls outside of school hours be more 
carefully supervised by parents? ¢ 
5. Do you believe sex hygiene should be taught in the schools? Why? How? 
On physical training and care of the health, the questions were: 
1. What more can the schools do than they are doing to conserve the health 
of the pupil? 
2. What more can the schools do than they are doing to develop the physical 
well-being of the child? 
8. What more can parents do to further the physical welfare of the child? 
4, Should dental inspection be compulsory in the schools? 
5. Should medical inspection be compulsory in the schools? 
6. Should thoroughly sanitary conditions in and around school buildings be 
required by law?
-P-A-G-E-488
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
7. What should be done in case a child has physical defects which need 
treatment, and the parents refuse to have them treated? 
8. What should be done in case a child has physical defects which need 
treatment, and the parents are unable financially to have them treated? 
9. Should there be more playground space in connection with the school 
building? 
10. It is recognized that playgrounds should be supervised. Who should 
supervise them—the school or the city? 
On industrial education, the questions were: 
1. What portion of the time should be devoted to industrial education? 
(a) In elementary schools? (0b) in high schools? 
2. What portion of the time should be devoted to cultural education? 
(a) In elementary schools? (0) In high schools? 
8. How can the schools secure the cooperation of industries, business, and 
home, in teaching special phases of industrial education? 
4, In your opinion, are the schools at present successful in teaching educa- 
tion? (a) If not, in what particular are they defective? (b) If not, what 
remedy for these particular defects would you recommend? 
5. How can arrangements be made with industrial establishments so that the 
pupils may work part time and attend school the other part of the time? 
6. Should pupils be taught specific trades? (a) If so, what trades? 
7. Should city schools teach agriculture? If not, where should it be taught? 
8. At what age should training begin? (a) For boys? (0b) For girls? 
9. Should cooking, sewing, and household economy be taught te all girls? 
On general phases of education, the questions were: 
1. What, in your opinion, should be the qualifications for members of school 
boards? 
2. Should schoel officers be paid? Why? 
8. How can we keep pupils in school until they are older? 
4, How can the cooperation of home and school be secured to aid the boy in 
fixing a life purpose? 
5. Should the school year be lengthened so that pupils who wish to and are 
able may make up time? If not, why? 
6. Should school buildings be used as social centers? If not, why? If so, 
who should have personal charge of the building while put to such use? 
7. In your opinion, are school-teachers somewhat out of touch with the 
business world and its methods? 
The report presented to the association includes a tabulation of the 
“Yes” and “no” answers to the specific questions and summaries of 
the variations of opinion. This summary is submitted by comment 
and discussion to each of the four general topics by the committee. 
The survey thus begins, as it were, a sort of educational referendum, 
but without power to enforce its majority conclusions. It is, never- 
theless, an interesting exhibit of the state of the public mind on 
these educational issues in that particular locality. 
The report concludes with the following recommendations: 
1. There is need of greater interest in training for character. 
2. Both the home and the school should do more to inculcate refined manners 
and respect for serious and good things.
-P-A-G-E-489
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 469 
3. The child’s health should be studied in a calm and sane way. 
4. The teaching of sex hygiene in the school is not favored with the present 
means at our disposal. 
5. There is need of careful dental and medical inspection of school children. 
6. Physical exercise should be primarily for health. 
7. The duties of school boards and superintendents should be differentiated. 
8. Members of school boards should be intelligent, honest, broad-minded 
citizens and the best of business managers. 
9. Finally, the committee recommends that the committee on research be 
continued another year and that a special and detailed study of industrial 
education be made. 
BELL, COLLIN, FISHER, HARRIS, AND NACOGDOCHES COUNTIES, TEX. 
The department of extension of the University of Texas com- 
prises an organization of seven divisions, as follows: Correspondence 
instruction, public welfare, public discussion, home welfare, public- 
school improvement, public lectures and publicity, and child welfare. 
Each of these divisions is organized so as to assist in the effort to 
take the university to the people—to bring its benefits within the 
reach of as many individuals as possible. A part of the work of 
the division of public-school improvement has been that of making 
“a study or a survey” of the educational conditions and needs of 
the rural public schools, particularly as found in the five counties, 
Bell, Collin, Fisher, Harris, and Nacogdoches. 
The investigation was conducted by E. V. White, head of the 
division, and Edward E. Davis, a lecturer in the division. Their 
method of investigation led them— 
to original sources for information and observation—to the county school 
superintendents, to the boards of school trustees, to the teachers, to the schools, 
to the homes of representative citizens, to the records of the commissioners’ 
courts, to the officers and some of the leading members of the social, industrial, 
and religious organizations of the counties. 
As in the Alabama survey the counties selected were regarded as 
typical of conditions in different parts of the State: Bell, located in 
the south-central part of the State; Collin, in the northern part of the 
State; Fisher, in the west-central part of the State; Harris, in the 
southeastern part of the State; and Nacogdoches, in the eastern part 
of the State. Particular attention is given to the jocation, history, 
economic resources, and development of these different representative 
parts of the State. The report of the survey, “A Study of Rural 
Schools in Texas,” was issued by the University of Texas as Bulletin 
No. 364, October 10, 1914 (167 pp). It includes 11 chapters, several 
charts and diagrams, and many photographs. In addition to the 
single chapter given to the presentation of the material concerning 
the rural schools of each of the five counties the following topics 
are presented: Educational rank of Texas; necessity for compulsory 
school attendance in Texas; consolidation and transportation; rural
-P-A-G-E-490
  470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
school administration; the rural church. The eleventh chapter is not 
a part of the survey but an article contributed as an illustration of the 
betterment of rural life in connection with the Tuleta Rural High 
School, Bee County. 
The report is characterized by a persistent plea for the consolida- 
tion of rural schools as the chief means for a radical improvement 
of the backward condition of rural education in Texas. This plea, 
with its various recommendations, was addressed to the thirty-fourth 
legislature as well as to the people in the particular counties and the 
State at large. The starting point of the authors is found in the 
educational rank which the State occupied as shown by the results 
of Dr. Leonard P. Ayres’s “A Comparative Study of the Public- 
School Systems in the 48 States” in 1910, and published in 1912. In 
this measurement it was ascertained that Texas ranked eighteenth 
in the amount expended for schools per $100 of wealth; thirtieth in 
the average annual salary of teachers; thirty-second in the per cent 
of pupils in high school; thirty-third in the per cent of average 
daily attendance per child; thirty-fifth in the per cent of illiteracy 
among persons 10 years of age or over; thirty-sixth in the value of 
school property per child; thirty-ninth in the annual expenditure 
per child in the length of public-school term and in the daily cost 
per child in school attendance; forty-second in the average days of 
attendance per child; and forty-sixth in the per cent of children en- 
rolled in school. On the basis of these data special plea is made to the 
legislature for enacting a compulsory education law. 
The progress of consolidation of schools and transportation of 
pupils in seven counties effectively illustrates the contention that 
small schools mean high cost, short terms, and low attendance, while 
large schools mean moderate cost, long terms, and high attendance. 
Particular attention is given to the problem of proper and adequate 
county school supervision. The past system of assigning the super- 
vision of county schools to the county court or commissioners’ court 
and the method of political election of county superintendent are 
severely condemned. It is recommended that every county having a 
school population of 2,000 should be required to have a county super- 
intendent, while those counties having fewer than 2,000 should be 
grouped, so that two or three counties would be required jointly to 
employ such an officer. This officer should have professional train- 
ing, be paid an adequate salary, be assured of a longer tenure, and 
have sufficient clerical help to discharge the duty of supervision. 
The exceptional position occupied by the rural schools of Harris 
County is described and explained in the following language: 
There are 35 mothers’ club organizations. Every school district in the 
county has voted a local maintenance tax. The amount of $125,000 is raised 
annually by local taxation for the purpose of school maintenance. The school-
-P-A-G-E-491
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 471 
building bonds issued during the past two and one-half years amount to 
$325,000. There are 26 brick school buildings in the common-school districts. 
There are 200 odorless, fly-proof, sanitary closets in use. The schools have in 
all 115 pianos. Six wagons are being operated at public expense to carry 
children to and from school. There are 50 school districts in the county, 
with an average area of 32.5 square miles each. There is a total of 173 white 
teachers employed. Three of the largest school districts employ district superin- 
tendents. The largest district in the county has 1,641 pupils, 7 schools, 33 
teachers, and 2 public transportation wagons. The present county superin- 
tendent has been in the office for the past 10 years. The county superintendent 
uses an automobile to make his school visitations. The commissioners’ court 
furnishes a stenographer to the county superintendent. 
The summary of the causes that have contributed to educational develop- 
ment of Harris County includes: Good county roads; 74 per cent of the farmers 
own their homes; the rural population has increased 73 per cent during the 
past 10 years, and the ingress of new people with new ideas has been a won- 
derful stimulus; the county superintendent has progressive educational ideas 
and has the courage to put them into effect; with the assistance of good roads, 
an automobile, and adequate office help, the services of the county superin- 
tendent have been multiplied many fold. The present county superintendent 
has been in office 10 years, and thoroughly understands the people, the local 
conditions, and the needs of every district in the county. Mothers’ clubs and 
local improvement associations have contributed all that could be expected. 
The city of Houston, with its advanced governmental ideas and excellent sys- 
tems of schools, has had an unconscious constructive influence far out into the 
country. Interscholastic athletic contests among the schools have done much 
to develop the latent possibilities of many school communities. The superin- 
tendent’s annual report of more than 100 pages each year has had a good 
effect. It has given the people of each district a chance to see what those of 
other districts are doing, and the spirit of friendly rivalry and the desire to 
excel have thus been created. 
Bell County.—The Texas Experiment Station would be an ideal place for the 
maintenance of a model rural high school at comparatively little cost. Not to 
mention the possibilities of better country schools and improved social inter- 
course among neighbors, the commercial value of permanent roads amply justi- 
fied their construction. In almost every community there is ample evidence of 
the good that could be accomplished by the teacher in directing social life. The 
procuring of competent pastors is the biggest problem of the country church in 
Bell County. Living salaries are not at present paid to ministers. Church 
buildings should be made more attractive. The maintenance of efficient country 
schools in Bell County will require the expenditure of more money for better 
teachers. The consolidation of districts is the only guaranty of the possibility 
of good schools for the country children of Bell County. Wor this purpose the 
county needs redistricting. An official map defining district boundary lines 
should be prepared. Outhouses should be screened and provided with septic 
tanks. Local school-tax sentiment has shown a marvelous growth during the 
past few years. The office of county superintendent should be removed from 
factional politics. The county superintendent is overloaded with clerical work 
that should be done by an assistant. A larger number of local institutes would 
prove beneficial. Very little industrial work is done in the schools. Such in- 
struction is not possible to any great extent until larger districts are obtained 
by means of consolidation. 
Collin County—After having looked over the field carefully, the writer be- 
lieves that an area of 12 to 20 square miles would be the most practical unit to  
-P-A-G-E-492
  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
adopt for rural-school purposes in this county at present. Collin County has a 
number of village and town schools that are well equipped and well taught, but 
the country schools are very inferior and below the average for the State. Bad 
roads and farm tenancy are the two greatest hindrances in the way of good 
country schools. The smallest common-school districts found in the entire 
course of this survey are in Collin County. The poorest attended and most ex- 
pensive schools are among the smaller rural districts. Some clerical help 
should be provided for the office of the county superintendent. He needs to 
spend his entire time in the field among the schools, but as it is, more than half 
of his time is consumed in the office. There is no economy in having a $1,500 
man do the work of a $40 office clerk. There should be a map of the entire 
county, showing the exact boundaries of each school district. As it is, there is 
much irregularity in the rendition of property for school taxes. 
Nacogdoches County.—Supt. R. F, Davis, of the Nacogdoches High School, is 
president of the county board of education. His influence as an educator is 
felt throughout the county. Every county board in the State should have at 
least one professionally trained school man on it. A majority of the rural 
teachers are ladies. In some of the one-teacher schools they are walking as far 
as 24 miles to procure board and accommodations. No teacher can do the best 
work under such conditions. Trustees should give such matters their atten- 
tion, and provide a remedy where possible. North Church School was annexed 
to Nacogdoches in 19138. Formerly it had three teachers. At present it is a 
ward school of Nacogdoches and employs two teachers. One teacher at $50 
per month has been eliminated by a transportation wagon for $30 per month 
that conveys all the children above the seventh grade, 11 in number, to Nacog- 
doches, where they get nine months of school instead of seven. School boards 
should keep posted as to the success of this public transportation wagon, and 
adopt the plan wherever efficiency and economy among the schools can be 
gained by it. There are 29 negro schools in the county. The greatest waste 
of the public-school funds is on these negro schools. They are poorly housed, 
poorly taught, and poorly attended; and, withal, are made to conform to an 
educational system planned entirely for the whites. 
Fisher County.—The employment of a county farm demonstrator to initiate 
industrial organizations through the schools would be a profitable investment. 
There needs to be a broader social utilization of the school plant under the 
leadership of the teachers. The teachers are commended for the personal 
interest which they are taking in athletics, and for the friendly contests de- 
veloped among the different schools. The churches need more resident pastors 
whose time should be available for community betterment during the entire 
week. Salaries should be at least large enough to enable the pastors to be- 
come business men to the extent of meeting tromptly their living expenses. 
This can be best accomplished by strengthening present organizations and by 
discouraging the establishment of too many new churches. It is also evident 
that the church should assume a larger work in directing the activities of the 
young people. The fundamental weakness of the country schools is that they 
do not offer industrial courses. - Salaries are entirely too small to employ and 
retain efficient teachers. The fact is plainly evident beyond contradiction that 
the lack of thorough high-school opportunities is a most serious defect and 
that the conditions now imposed upon these schools make good high-school 
instruction impracticable and impossible. The people of Fisher County are 
commended for the unparalleled progress which has been made in the voting 
of local taxes and in the erection of hygienic schoolhouses. The holding of 
local institutes throughout the county would doubtless bring the people and
-P-A-G-E-493
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 473 
the local trustees into closer relation with the county superintendent, thereby 
assisting in the solution of many school problems. If the country schools are 
to perform the character of service which prepares the pupils for life, there 
must be country high schools, industrial courses, higher salaries for teachers, 
longer school terms, better libraries, and adequate laboratory facilities. £   
RABUN, CLAYTON, TALIAFERRO, AND BULLOCH COUNTIES, GA. 
The utilization of an educational survey for the improvement of 
conditions in rural school work has been specially applied in Georgia. 
Through the cooperation of the General Education Board in 1914, 
which provided funds for the salary and expenses of a trained expert, 
M. L. Brittain, State superintendent of schools, appointed M. L. 
Duggan rural school agent. His duty is to make, as rapidly as 
possible, educational surveys of the various counties. Mr. Duggan 
has issued the following reports: 
1. Educational Survey of Rabun County, Bulletin No. 1, under the direction 
of the department of education, November 2, 1914 (48 pp.). 
2. Educational Survey of Clayton and Taliaferro Counties, Bulletins Nos. 2 
and 3, under the direction of the department of education, January 19, 1915 
(23 pp.), and appendix of two statistical tables. 
8. Educational Survey of Bulloch County, Bulletin No. 4, under the direction 
of the department of education, 1915 (78 pp.). 
RABUN COUNTY. 
The first county selected in which to make “a true inventory of 
the educational interests, activities, resources, and deficiencies” was 
Rabun, “the brave little county ” in the extreme northeastern corner 
of the State. While it is not a typical county of the whole State, it 
is a typical mountain county. It was thus selected because it was 
the first mountain county in Georgia to add to the State fund for 
schools by local taxation. It is a county in which there are “no rich 
citizens” and “no paupers.” The greater part of six weeks was con- 
sumed in making the survey. Every school was personally visited 
and inspected as carefully as the time allowed. It included 27 white 
and 2 colored schools, 1 high school, and 3 additional schools not a 
part of the public school system, namely, the Rabun Gap Industrial 
School; the Logan E. Bleckley Memorial Institute, under the auspices 
of the State Baptist. mission board; and the Tallulah Falls Industrial 
School, which is owned and maintained by the State Federation of 
Women’s Clubs. The survey of the last-mentioned school was made 
by special request, and received some assistance from Miss C. S. Par- 
rish, the State supervisor. 
The method of the inquiry was based on the adoption of the mini- 
mum standard of efficiency for rural schools, issued by the State 
superintendent of schools. More than 100 county schools have re-

following particulars: :

6. Good doors with locks and keys. 
7. Clean and well kept. 
The presentation of the study of the schools in detail is simple and 
direct. In nearly every case one page is given to a school. The 
report includes a photograph showing equipment and surroundings, 
and in many cases the children and teacher, with the data arranged 
under the following 11 items: Teacher, location, grounds, building, 
community uses, equipment, statistics, water, school organization, 
organized community help, maintenance. 
The recommendations are submitted to three groups of persons as 
follows: 
To the county school officials: First. Whole-time supervision by the county 
superintendent; and as soon as practicable provide during the school term a 
trained lady supervisor as his assistant. Second. In so far as possible employ 
only trained teachers. This will require somewhat better pay. It is of even more 
importance than a longer term. Third. Consider the advisability of further 
consolidation. Fourth. Encourage in every legitimate way school fairs, educa- 
tional rallies, etc. Fifth. Make teachers’ contracts binding for not less than 
a full school year. 
To the teachers: First. Clean up your schoolhouse and grounds, and keep 
them so every day in the year. Second. Teach and demonstrate hygiene and 
sanitation, and look for the result of your teaching in the better health habits 
of your pupils. Third. Free yourselves from the slavery to textbooks; teach 
some lessons “not in book.” Fourth. Devote regular and systematic attention 
to at least one of the homemaking industries. (See Industrial Bulletin from
-P-A-G-E-495
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 475 
Department of Education.) Fifth. Organize school clubs, and supervise but do 
not “boss” them. 
To the patrons: First. Demand trained teachers for your children; they 
deserve as much. Second. Organize for the purpose of helping along the work 
of éducation in your county and at your local school in every proper way. 
Third. Visit your school occasionally, and always take notice of the manner in 
which the house and grounds are kept. (Your children are being influenced by 
these every day.) Fourth. See that suitable closets are built and kept in sani- 
tary condition. (The prevalence of hookworm disease in your county, as shown 
: by the survey of the State board of health, ought to be sufficient argument for 
this. There are other reasons.) Fifth. Give the teacher freedom in her work 
and uphold her in it. See that your children attend school regularly. 
CLAYTON AND TALIAFERRO COUNTIES. 
Two of the older counties, Clayton and Taliaferro, were next se- 
lected for study. The State superintendent of schools gives the 
reasons for this selection: 
Both are small; the county seat of each is well situated in many respects to 
serve as a central high school; both have as superintendents elderly gentlemen, 
veterans of the sixties, and both have failed to keep pace with some of the more 
vigorous new counties, particularly with regard to modern education. 
These are small counties, located in the central section of the 
State. The field work was done during November and December of 
1914. The method followed was similar to that reported above. 
The data collected are conveniently tabulated separately for each 
county, respectively, under the main items of grounds, buildings, 
equipment, organization, maintenance. Pictures of all the schools 
and of the model plans for rural schoolhouses are included in the 
report. 
The similarities and the contrasts of the two counties are noted. 
The prime need in both counties is found to be constructive direc- 
tion and expert supervision. 
Naturally enough we found practically the same methods of “teaching” 
prevailing in the two counties. Many of the “beginners” were set to the 
antiquated tasks of “learning their letters,” and “ could not yet begin to learn 
to read.” Much drilling on the symbols of reading and numbers and the hur- 
ried hearing of lessons seemed to be the order of the day at many of these 
schools. In many schools it was difficult to make the children “be quiet” on 
the stiff, uncomfortable seats, often poorly adjusted to their physical demands, 
while their minds were unconsciously protesting against the emptiness of the 
tasks assigned and their muscles aching for natural activity. 
The two counties are also contrasted. In Taliaferro the sur- 
veyor was unable “ to discover a perfectly good title to any school lot 
in the county.” No efforts of any sort are made to increase the 
resources for education through local taxation. In Clayton, on the 
contrary, 14 out of a total of 19 districts now levy a local school tax. 
This has been accomplished through the district system as the unit 
   
-P-A-G-E-496
  476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
and not through the county. In Taliaferro it was found that the 
schoolhouses for Negroes “ will average about as good as those for 
the white children of the county, but are without equipment of any 
value whatever.” After a review of the financial resources, from the 
standpoint of taxation, a special plea is made to the business men of 
Taliaferro County to examine carefully the proposition that in- 
creased revenues should be secured through “a county-wide plan” of 
assessment and taxation. 
The recommendations submitted related principally to the addi- 
tion of a professionally trained assistant to the county superin- 
tendent, who shall be employed as a supervising teacher. The work 
for this assistant should include: 
(a) Planning constructive educational policies; (b) constantly advising, 
supervising, and assisting the teachers at their several schools; (c) seeking to 
vitalize the academic work of the schools by relating it to the life activities of 
the pupils through the organized agencies of the corn clubs, pig clubs, canning 
clubs, éete.; (d@) promoting educational interests and creating stronger public 
sentiment and securing a better school attendance by constant and close contact 
with the patrons in their homes; (e) organizing and directing the teachers 
of the county in their professional interests and the patrons and citizens in 
social, agricultural, and educational interests. 
This assistant should be either a competent woman or man. To 
Taliaferro County it is recommended “that no more public-school 
buildings be erected without first having the plans approved by the 
State department of education.” 
BULLOCH COUNTY. 
Bulloch is “ one of the largest, richest, most progressive, and most 
resourceful of the southeast Georgia counties.” A period of seven 
full weeks was required to inspect the 93 public schools of this 
county. In the report brief attention is given to the subjects of 
schoolhouses and grounds, equipment, sanitation, consolidation, 
course of study, scholarship, and finances. 
A lack of thoroughness in the fundamentals of scholarship is probably the 
most noticeable characteristic of the rural schools in this and other counties 
surveyed. In the majority of schools we have found that the majority of the 
children of the fifth and sixth grades do not readily enumerate numbers of six 
figures, can not add accurately and with reasonable rapidity ; can not read their 
history lessons understandingly or well, are very slow in finding a word in the 
dictionary, generally unable to determine its meaning clearly when found, and 
can rarely determine its pronunciation at all. These serious defects seem to be 
mainly the results of a lack of training on the part of primary teachers, but 
partly, perhaps, from irregular attendance. Satisfactory work can not be done 
in the intermediate grades because good work has not been done in the primary 
grades. 
The method of study and the manner of presenting the results are 
those which characterized Rabun County.

It is interesting to note that the effect of the study of the school 
conditions in this county were noticeable during its progress. “Many 
of our reports of conditions had to be modified before leaving the 
county on account of having been immediately improved, and before 
this report can be put into print it will do injustice to others on 
account of still further improved conditions.” 
“The most pressing needs” of the schools of this county are sum- 
marized as follows: 
1. County-wide “local taxation” for the businesslike support and direction 
of the schools. 
2. A supervisor to assist the superintendent in a closer supervision of the 
schools; also, more office room for a permanent display of school work. 
8. A better planning of schoolhouses for school purposes; also, better 
equipments. 
4. Better sanitation, particularly with reference to the drinking water and 
the school toilets. 
5, Consolidation at some points. One-teacher schools can never reach the 
highest efficiency. The children deserve the best. 
RICHMOND, VA. 
In partial preparation for the eighth annual convention of the 
National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, held 
at Richmond, Va., in December, 1914, a “ type” survey of the schools 
and of the industries of that city was completed on November 1 
preceding. The society and the city succeeded in arranging for 
unusual cooperation in the undertaking, which was shaped by sev- 
eral correlated aims. 
The director of the school survey was Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, of 
the Russell Sage Foundation and of the industrial survey, Mr. 
Charles H. Winslow, of the United States Bureau of Labor Statis- 
tics. The agencies cooperating were the United States Bureaus of 
Labor Statistics and of Education, the Russell Sage Foundation, the 
school people and the citizens of Richmond, a local and a general 
survey committee. The latter, of seven members, had direct charge 
of the investigations. It was enlarged to 14 members for making 
the recommendations. 
A preliminary report of this double survey has been published 
under the titles “ Synopsis of the Findings of the Vocational Educa- 
tion Survey of the City of Richmond” (pp. 62), with an appendix 
of four charts presenting the findings about occupations, and find- 
ings about education for occupations in the building, metal, and 
printing trades, and the tobacco industry of Richmond; and “ Synop- 
sis of Recommendations” (pp. 29). 
The recommendations, 58 in number, relate to Richmond’s problem 
of financing vocational education; compulsory attendance as a factor 
in a program of industrial education; the types of schools and  
-P-A-G-E-498
  478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
courses of study for boys and men and for girls and women, as deter- 
mined by the findings of the industrial survey; prevocational train- 
ing; and the place of private institutions receiving city moneys in 
the general plan. The complete report will be issued as Bulletin 
No. 162 of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
SEATTLE, WASH. 
A suggestive study and interpretation of “the vocational problems 
involved in education and the educational problems involved in in- 
dustry” was carried on by Dr. Anna Y. Reed during a full year 
beginning September, 1918. The basis of the study includes 402 
pupils of the grammar schools and 822 pupils of the high schools 
who left school during 1913-14, personal visits to 919 homes in fol- 
lowing up these cases, and 202 girls and 223 boys up to the age of 21 
years who had been out of the Seattle public schools more than one 
year. 
The report (103 pp.), made November 24, 1914, and presented to 
the board of directors January 15, 1915, includes 8 sections and 37 
tables. The topics presented are: Facts about Seattle; sources of 
information and methods of investigation; children who left school, 
1913-14; school leaving and labor permits; educational and occupa- 
tional experience of boys and girls up to 21 years who have been out 
of school from one to five years; minimum wage and vocational effi- 
ciency; State school and child-labor laws and the making of unem- 
ployables; conclusions and recommendations. In his letter of trans- 
mittal Supt. Frank P. Cooper emphasizes a new aspect of the work of 
the school: 
Gradually it is dawning upon the observant portion of the public that the 
most critical time in the child’s school life is the day on which he leaves it. 
Then, for the first time, he is entirely released from discipline; then, for the 
first time, with little help and no experience, he attempts to adjust himself to 
new conditions and surroundings, and, immature of mind and will and un- 
developed in judgment, he is forced to grapple with the great and varied prob- 
lems which puzzle the mind of the nation. Moreover, the theory that the public 
schools exist for children who are in attendance, whether attendance ceases 
at 14 or 18 years, whether in the grammar grades or in the high schools, is 
gradually giving place to the belief that there are educational problems within 
the shop as well as within the school, and that the protection and supervision 
of the educator should follow the working child into his new surroundings and 
help in the solution of the problems involved in his daily life.

SCHOOL SURVEYS. 479 
MANUAL, DOMESTIC, AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES. 
A somewhat different form of “survey” from that which has 
usually characterized the study of school systems may be found in the 
report of the “inquiry into the progress of manual, domestic, and 
vocational training in the cities of the United States,” which was 
authorized by the board of school directors at Reading, Pa., and for 
the most part was conducted by Wallace E. Hackett, director of 
the department of practical arts in the Reading schools. The survey 
was begun in February, 1914, the report (156 pp.) being presented 
to the board February 16, 1915. The object of the survey was— 
to find out what subjects were being taught in other school systems, the amount 
of time given these subjects, the number of shops in use and the number of in- 
structors employed; to know how many vocational and prevocational schools 
each city had and how many of them conducted bureaus of vocational guidance ; 
and then, the above information having been received, to compare Reading 
with the cities studied, to discover where she stood in line and to what extent 
her system could be improved. 
The material of the report comprises the replies received from 147 
cities out of 150 which were requested to supply data. The report 
presents detailed information concerning the teaching of the fol- 
lowing practical arts subject: 
Paper tearing, paper cutting, thin woodwork, paper folding, cardboard con- 
struction, weaving, raflia work, basketry, embroidery, bricklaying, gas-engine 
mechanics, blacksmithing, mural decoration, book illustration, furniture finish- 
ing, tailoring, sign painting, tile setting, terra-cotta drawing, house framing, 
lamp-shade making, novelty work, sample mounting, clay modeling, whittling, 
elementary bench work in wood, Venetian ironwork, bookbinding, chair 
caning, joinery, art metal work, sheet-metal work, printing, mechanical drawing, 
applied design, furniture making, wood turning, pattern making, forge-shop 
practice, foundry practice, machine-shop practice, bookkeeping, typewriting, 
stenography, sewing, cooking, dressmaking, millinery, home economics, nursing, 
engineering, cement work, color work, knitting, industrial arts, block printing, 
free-hand drawing, reed work, kite making, coping-saw work, house practice, 
wood carving, wood knotting, lettering, building trades, concrete construction, 
automobile repairing, tool making, architecture, household decoration, toll- 
leather work, laundrying, telegraphy, house carpentry, building model houses, 
theory of woodwork, thin-metal work, cabinetmaking, painting, costume de- 
signing, serving, pottery, molding, dietetics, automobile construction, brush 
making, clothing-machine operating, straw-machine operating, applied mechan- 
ics, soldering, pipe work, and commercial advertising. 
The arrangement of the material includes the data on these sub- 
jects as taught by elementary grade-and other schools, instructors, 
shop and drawing rooms, vocational and prevocational schools, 
bureaus of vocational guidance, the ranking position of Reading in 
comparison with other cities, and details the survey by cities.

  480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., BUSINESS MANAGEMENT. 
The widening use of the “survey ” in the field of education is illus- 
trated by the special study, extending over 16 weeks, of the conduct 
of the business side of the school system of Minneapolis. At the 
request of the board of education, F. S. Staley, director of the 
bureau of municipal research of the civics and commerce association 
of Minneapolis, inquired particularly into the manner of the conduct 
of the business side of the school system. The study, which was com- 
pleted in February, 1915, has not been published, but a summary ap- 
peared in the American School Board Journal, May, 1915. The 
purpose of the inquiry was to ascertain the actual conditions and to 
suggest in a spirit of cooperation means for the correction of any 
business defects in the conduct of the system. 
It was found in the business management of the schools that there 
was an absence of definite planning; no clear definition of the au- 
thority of the business executive and his relation to other depart- 
ments; no coordination of all the branches of work; no adequate 
system for the determination of repairs to be made; excessive cleri- 
cal, petty, detail work in the offices of principals of schools and the 
business executive; too much duplication of work by the repair force 
and a consequent waste of time by workmen; inadequate organiza- 
tion of the heating and ventilating plants; a failure to organize 
properly the engineers and janitors; decentralization in the purchas- 
ing and storing of supplies; an absence of the modern budget system 
and displacement of the auditing function of the auditor’s office by 
excessive accounting. 
In suggesting plans for reorganization, the survey considered five 
chief divisions of the business affairs of the schools: The organiza- 
tion of the business administration, the operation and maintenance 
of buildings, the construction of new buildings, the purchase, stor- 
age, and distribution of stores, and accounting. 
In order to improve the conditions discovered, it is recommended— 
that there should be a business executive, subordinate to the superintendent of 
schools, under whose charge would be placed the construction, operation, and 
maintenance of buildings and equipment, maintenance of grounds, accounting 
and auditing, purchase, storage, and distribution of stores, insuring school 
property, supervision of all buildings by contracting, safe-keeping of docu- 
ments and records. He should have under his direction (1) an architect, (2) 
an overseer of buildings, (3) an accountant, (4) and chief clerk in charge of 
purchasing. The architect should design all additions to buildings and prepare 
. plans for all buildings which are to be similar to those already built. The 
poard should call outside architects to design new buildings whenever it is 
desirable. The overseer of buildings should be responsible for keeping the 
buildings in proper condition for use and report the necessity for repairs or 
replacements. Under his direction there should be a chief engineer and a repair 
foreman, the former of whom should have immediate charge of the mechanical
-P-A-G-E-501
  SCHOOL SURVEYS. 481 
equipment of the schools, including supervision of engineers and janitors; the 
latter should have charge of the repair force and the activities of the repair 
shop. All records of accounts and business orders, collections, and claims 
should be in charge of the accountant. The report offers detail suggestions for 
handling repairs, including the adoption of the budget system, emergency re- 
pairs; and various suggestions for increasing the efficiency of the business opera- 
tion of the school system. 
OGDEN, UTAH. 
In April, 1915, there was published by the Utah State Department 
of Education the report of the Ogden public-school survey com- 
mission. 
Because certain suggestions of the superintendent, J. M. Mills, 
regarding the vitalization of the schools by reorganizing them on an 
industrial plan had aroused considerable opposition in the com- 
munity, a commission for the survey of the schools was proposed. 
The commission was appointed by the United States Commissioner of 
Education, P. P. Claxton; President J. T. Kingsbury, of the Univer- 
sity of Utah; and Prof. Milton Bennion, of the Utah State Normal 
School. The survey commission included W. S. Deffenbaugh, special- 
ist in school administration of the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion; Prof. Edward J. Ward, of the University of Wisconsin; Supt. 
Charles S. Meek, of the Boise (Idaho) schools; Prof. W. G. Roy- 
lance, of the University of Utah; and George A. Eaton, principal of 
the Salt Lake City schools. 
The division of labor between the members of the survey commis- 
sion is interesting because of the differentiation in the allotment of 
the special tasks. Three members, Messrs. Deffenbaugh, Meek, and 
Eaton, studied the public-school system in “the aspect in which the 
school system is considered specifically as the actual machinery for 
the instruction of children.” Messrs. Roylance and Ward studied 
“the aspect in which the school system is considered as the potential 
machinery for the whole community’s cooperation in an educational 
process that includes also the systematic organization of the political, 
economic, and recreational life of adults and older youth.” The 
members of the commission were in Ogden one week. The report 
(42 pp.) was submitted May 11, 1914. 
The report on school organization, curriculum, and instruction 
comprises pages 6-23. The report on a plan for municipal and edu- 
cational unity of administration comprises pages 23-42. 
In view of the extended discussion aroused among the citizens by 
the policy of the administration in organizing subhigh schools and 
reorganizing them on the half-day plan, the treatment of the topics 
_ allotted to the first committee partook more of the nature of an inves- 
tigation than of a survey. Special approval is given to the position 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——81 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
  482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of the school board of Ogden whereby the superintendent is definitely 
permitted to be the head of the school system. The school plant is not 
up to the standard, in adequate buildings and equipment, of cities of 
the same size in other parts of the country. Touching some of the 
issues relating to the subhigh schools into which grades seven and 
eight have been organized— 
The commission does not believe that the subhigh-school teachers should have 
more pupils per teacher and be paid less, but that the elementary schools should 
immediately be given more teachers, and salaries so increased that teachers of 
extended training and long experience may be attracted to this department. 
In the matter of retardation and elimination of pupils the schools 
of Ogden were found, as measured by the Ayres scale, based on 
886 cities, to make a favorable showing, particularly for the first 
eight grades. The high school does not show as favorably, but is still 
above the scale. In Ogden schools 19 per cent of the children were 
found to be over age, and in one-half of 318 cities 386 per cent were 
over age for the grade in which they were found. Ogden is consid- 
erably below the average in per capita cost of education in both ele- 
mentary and high schools when compared with cities whose popula- 
tion ranges from 25,000 to 100,000. The average cost per capita per 
year for elementary schools is $30.37; for secondary schools, $60.83. 
So far as the course of study is concerned, it was found in the 
elementary schools to be comprehensive and rich in educational sub- 
jects, the fundamental topics having been retained and modern 
material introduced in place of the useless topics. The subhigh 
schools which are organized on a departmental plan are specially 
commended in the report. There is no evidence of overwork of the 
pupils; the teachers show an excellent spirit of cooperation. The 
class-room work throughout the system was on the whole found to be 
good—in fact, much better than could have been expected under the 
meager supervision. The use of the standard tests in writing, Eng- 
lish, arithmetic, etc., is strongly recommended. The plan of super- 
vision is not approved. The proposal to reorganize the school on 
the plan of the half-day session with two different sets of students 
doing work of accredited study on one half day, and of music, art, 
study, sewing, cooking, manual training, bookbinding, and physical 
culture on the other half, is not approved by the commission. The 
plan is regarded “as being unpedagogical, unnecessary, and well- 
nigh impossible of realization.” 
The other section of the survey, which is directed to the attention 
of the public aspects of the school system for the development of 
community life, outlines a plan of organization and extension for 
future developments rather than states the immediate condition. _ 
This city, with a population of mixed and diversified character, has 
had difficulty in becoming conscious of its fundamental problem of
-P-A-G-E-503
  SCHOOL SURVEYS, 483 
unifying its economic, civic, educational, and recreational resources 
into a veritable community system. The lack of unity of the past 
must give way to a new type of unification. 
Because of the financial saving and the business efficiency that would result 
from unification of administration; because the public-school system can not 
succeed even in its prime functions of effectively training children for citizen- 
ship and promoting their morality unless the adults and older youth of the 
community make use of the schoolhouses as centers of organized civic expres- 
sion and wholesome recreation; and because this full use of the public-school 
system as the machinery of the city’s comprehensive self-organization depends 
absolutely upon the unification of its municipal and public-school administra- 
tion; therefore, we find, after careful study of all the elements of the situation 
and after consulting officials and other responsible and well-informed citizens, 
that the key to the solution of Ogden’s problem, civic, moral, and economic, 
is the consolidation and identification of its municipal commission and its 
board of education. 
The chief constructive suggestion, which is offered and defended 
at some length, is the establishment of a civic secretaryship. 
The responsibility of this office would not conflict with that of the superin- 
tendent of schools, but would begin where the responsibility of the superin- 
tendent now ends and extend throughout the community. 
HAMMOND, IND. 
A survey, with an especially constructive aim, of the industrial 
and vocational aspects of the public-school system of a manufactur- 
ing city is reported by Prof. Robert J. Leonard, of Indiana Uni- 
versity, in “Some Facts Concerning the People, Industries, and 
Schools of Hammond, and a Suggested Program for Elementary 
Industrial, Prevocational, and Vocational Education” (pp. 165), 
and published by the board of education April 15, 1915. The work 
was carried on by the department of industrial education of Indiana 
University, in cooperation with the vocational division of the State 
department of public instruction. 
The report includes 8 chapters, 42 tables, 10 charts, and an ap- 
pendix giving the sources and methods of deriving data and the 
forms used. The topics are: Facts concerning the people of Ham- 
mond; the city’s industries; work of young people under 17 years of 
age; part-time education; the children enrolled in the schools; 
present provisions for industrial, household, and art instruction; and 
suggested provisions for elementary industrial, prevocational, and 
vocational education. Two-thirds of the material relates to the last 
three topics, and one-fourth of the space is needed for the presenta- 
tion of the recommendations. These detail the special courses neces- 
sary in the elementary grades, the vocational high school, and even- 
ing school, and the equipment of teachers for the instruction out- 
lined. These provisions are suggested to the school system, which is 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to be reorganized on a basis of seven elementary grades and a four or 
five year high-school course, and particularly for the new industrial 
high school, which, after litigation, the city is now free to build. 
The care taken in the preparation of the program offered as a result 
of the study is evident from the following statement: 
The recommendations for future courses, departments, and equipment, though 
in the main specifically proposed by the writer, are really conference measures, 
as all parts of the sections bearing upon future work were first submitted to 
the superintendent of schools, principals, supervisors, and special teachers, after 
which many conferences were held, and nothing has been included as a specific 
recommendation that has not been agreed upon in conference. 
SAN ANTONIO, TEX. 
The period under review for this report may be regarded as espe- 
cially fortunate in having a second instance of the application of the 
educational principles so strikingly utilized in the investigation of 
the public schools in South Bend, Ind., reported above. On March 
27, 1915, Dr. J. F. Bobbitt, of the University of Chicago, submitted 
the report on the survey of the San Antonio public-school system con- 
ducted in January, as authorized by resolution of the school: board 
December 16, 1914. When he began his field work, the surveyor was 
informed by the chairman of the survey committee that he was “to 
study the situation in his own way and to make any recommendations 
that, in his judgment, would promote the efficiency of the schools. 
Beyond this no instructions were given nor suggestions made.” 
Four weeks were given to the personal observations, conferences, and 
the examination of documents. Three high schools and 19 of the 29 
elementary schools were visited. The report (257 pp.) was published 
May, 1915. . It comprises 14 chapters, 31 tables, and 10 charts. The 
topics of’ the chapters are: Prefatory statement; the work of the 
schools; education for vocation; education for citizenship; educa- 
tion for physical efficiency; education for leisure occupations; Eng- 
lish language training; the teaching of certain subjects; general or- 
ganization and administration; the student population; elementary 
teachers; the high school; buildings and equipment; finance. The 
tables and charts presented data concerning pupils, teachers, high 
school, finances; general organization and administration; and the 
community. 
The most helpful kind of a school survey is described as one— 
(1) That sympathetically looks to the good that exists in the school system ; 
(2) that sees this good not as the end of progress, but as gains made that are 
steps toward further gains; (3) that suggests constructive plans for further 
progress; and (4) that shows the reasons for the plans recommended so as to 
permit verification of their validity. 
The functional point of view which characterized the South Bend 
investigation is characteristically maintained in the valuation of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-505
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 485 
factors in the situation presenting education in San Antonio. The 
values of the distinctively educational activities in the schools, as 
they are held to function in the future adult’s interests and activities 
in the community, are kept constantly in the foreground. All other 
features of the school system are interpreted in terms of their rela- 
tions to this prime aspect. A fully rounded educational program 
should therefore be designed : : 
1. To fit the children and youth for effective performance of the labors of 
their life’s calling. 2. To lay a broad and secure foundation for sound judg- 
ment as to the various social, economic, and industrial problems with which 
one is concerned as a citizen in a democracy. 3. To lay a secure foundation in 
knowledge and in habits for lifelong health and physical vitality. 4. To 
develop habits of healthy and socially desirable leisure occupations. 5. To give 
effective training in the means needed for social interecommunication, namely, 
the language or the languages that one actually needs. 6. To train individuals 
for the activities concerned in the rearing and education of children; or, in 
other words, the functions of parenthood. 7. To train one for his religious 
activities. 
The seventh item, for well-known reasons, is omitted. The first 
six items are made to serve as the basis for justifying the retention 
and development or exclusion of any of the work found in, or that 
ought to be found in, the San Antonio schools. The survey is also 
made on the basis of a distinction between fundamental and supple- 
mentary or preliminary and functional education. 
The supplementary relation of school work to community life in San Antonio 
is not greatly taken into account in drawing up the courses of study. As a 
result there is a considerable quantity of useless and wasteful work. * * * 
Except for the teaching work of shop, sewing room, kitchen, and commercial 
department, practically all the work of both elementary and high schools is of 
the preliminary prefunctional type. 
Under the guidance of these conceptions the study in fact became 
a double survey of the material of the curriculum and the work of 
teaching it, namely: First, an interpretation of the six functional 
values, as illustrated by the presence or absence of appropriate mate- 
rial in the school work, and secondly, an estimation of the useful and 
the wasteful in the teaching of certain subjects and the distribution 
of the varied activities of school officers, teachers, and pupils. In- 
stead of summarizing briefly its recommendations, the report dis- 
tributes them pertinently throughout the treatment of the different 
phases of the various topics. 
The educational problems of San Antonio are peculiarly deter- 
mined by the fact that it is a southern city, comprising American, 
European, Mexicans, and Negroes. Its total school population is 
probably above 25,000; its public schools are costing half a million 
dollars. Its financial outlay at present and resources for meeting the 
future needs in the further growth of the system, from the stand-  
-P-A-G-E-506
  486 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
point of its material equipment, are indicated by some of the follow- 
ing comparisons: The annual cost of janitors per school room in 19 
southern cities ranges from $21 to $105, the average being $53, San 
Antonio expending $71. The cost of supplies for instruction per 
pupil in the practice of 19 cities of the same population ranges from 
23 cents to $2.92, the average being 75 cents, San Antonio spending 
81 cents. In the cost of elementary education per pupil San An- 
tonio, in spending $31, is fairly generous as compared with 18 other 
cities, in which this expense ranges from $16 to $35, the average 
being $28. It is not so generous when compared with cities of the 
same population, grouped through the country in general, where the 
expenditure ranges from $24 to $44, San Antonio standing fourth 
from the bottom of the list. In the cost of high-school education per 
pupil in comparison with other southern cities with a range from 
$31 to $108, the average being $61, San Antonio is not doing as well 
in its expenditure of $53 by its secondary pupils as it is by its ele- 
mentary pupils. In comparison with other southern cities its total 
property tax per capita for all purposes, $13.34, is slightly above the 
average for the group, which is $12.56. When compared with the 
cities of the United States belonging to its population class, it occu- 
pies the medium point. In the total net city debt, which amounts to 
$50.17 per capita, San Antonio stands in a middle position among 
the 19 southern cities. 
The survey found in general that “much progress has been made; 
the schools are in a healthy, growing condition; in many respects 
they are fully abreast with the best work going on in any portion of 
our country. The city will have to be numbered among cities of the 
educationally progressive type.” 
In considering the problems of general organization and adminis- 
tration the survey offers the following explanation of the weaknesses 
found in the schools: 
Such weaknesses as exist in the schools of San Antonio seem to be due in 
large measure to the state of tutelage in which practically everybody from 
superintendent down has been held. The State has decreed the studies that 
shall be taught in elementary schools and the textbooks that shall be used. 
The colleges have decreed the subjects and the units which shall be given in the 
high schools. The board has held most powers of initiative except as to the 
routine classroom teaching. Teachers and supervisors have had too much to 
go like children and get permission to do almost anything that they do. They 
have largely been forbidden the exercise of individual responsibility and 
initiative. Visible responsibility is not a thing that will grow in such an atmos- 
phere. Things will not be corrected until responsibility can be so distributed 
that everybody can bear his due share. 
The recommendations distributed throughout the report are not 
intended to be taken as specific things which must be done imme- 
diately, but rather as constructive suggestions which shall lead to

more detailed inquiry by thuse who are doing the work in the sys- 
tem itself. For example, in calling attention to the large sum of 
money which the city is investing in high-school algebra and geom- 
etry, which could be better expended “upon the study of the prac- 
tical, civic, social, industrial, recreational, and other matters which 
are greatly needed by this rising generation of young people.” It 
is admitted that the recommendation will appear “absurd.” It is 
then recommended that the school city should— i 
Get the opinion on this topic of intelligent leaders of thought in this county, 
educational leaders as well as leaders among public-spirited, social-minded lay- 
men. Also, consult any group of laymen of San Antonio who are graduates of 
the high school as to the degree in which they have ever used their algebra or 
the demonstrational aspects of their geometry. 
Among the numerous findings of the inquiry respecting the cur- 
riculum are the following: In education for vocation the following 
principle is laid down for the organization of the instruction: “The 
department which is responsible for the practical labors employed in 
vocational training should be responsible for the teaching of that 
mathematics, science, drawing, and design that is concerned in the 
guidance of those labors.” By eliminating the waste in teaching 
certain portions of mathematics, science, and social studies, English, 
foreign languages, history, and literature, suflicient time will be 
found for the introduction of the technical and social material which 
is specified as essential to the further development of this form of 
education. The work that is done in reading is found to be “strug- 
gling in the quagmire of pedagogic methodology.” This is due to the 
State-adopted textbooks imposed upon the teachers, and the order of 
method of instruction which is issued to them in this work. There is 
a wrong emphasis in method and a wrong selection of material for 
the work in spelling, the doctrine of habit and use being applied in 
the recommendations that are made. An excess average amount of 
time is devoted to handwriting. The results of this instruction, as 
tested, shows that in quality determined by the Ayres scale, the school 
occupies an exactly average standing among 33 cities; and in speed 
San Antonio stands high. The tests were used-also so as to show the 
relative rank of the work in the same grade in the different buildings. 
The work in grammar, which is too abstract and not purposeful, 
could probably best be reduced to one lesson a week for the pre- 
liminary education. The work in geography should substitute “the 
method of geographic experience” in the place of mere textbook 
learning, and become characterized by the selection of topical mate- 
rial based on social needs. The introduction of a functional study of 
history would eliminate most of the “ wasteful overdoing” which is 
found to characterize the work. The test in arithmetic indicated 
that San Antonio, with a seven years’ course, “is getting about aver-

age results” in comparison with other cities having an eight-grade 
course. Special attention is given to the local significance of the 
teaching of Spanish and German. The elementary teachers are 
undertrained, having had an average of only 4.6 years beyond the 
elementary schools. On this point the different schools in the city 
were compared, showing a range of courses of training from 3.7 to 
6.7 years. The total teaching experience of the teachers average 7.5 
years. Their tenure in the city schools is very short, showing an 
average of only 3.5 years. The average elementary teacher’s salary 
is $720, which is slightly above the medium for the cities of its class. 
Immediate attention should be given to the acute problem of train- 
ing new teachers. 
The following features in the high-school data may be compared 
with those discovered in the South Bend investigation: 
The portion of each $1,000 expended for instruction in each of the high-school 
subjects was as follows: English composition and literature, $204; higher 
mathematics, $170; the sciences, $131; history and civics, $106; modern lan- 
guages, $103; household occupations, $97; shopwork and mechanical drawing, 
$63; commercial subjects, $53; Latin, $52; public speaking, $19; music, $4; 
physical training, $00; drawing and design (not mechanical), $00. 
The distribution of each 1,000 student-hours over the various subjects was 
as follows: English literature and composition, 243; algebra and geometry, 
200; the sciences, 154; history and civics, 102; household occupations, 92; mod- 
ern languages, 73; shopwork and mechanical drawing, 48; Latin, 40; commercial 
subjects, 41; music, 7; drawing and design (not mechanical), 0; physical train- 
ing, 0; training of elementary teachers, 0. 
The cost per 1,000 student-hours of instruction in the various high-school 
subjects was as follows: Modern languages, $114; Latin, $103; shopwork and 
mechanical drawing, $103; commercial subjects, $103; public speaking, $98; 
history and civics, $83; household occupation, $83; mathematics, $69; sciences, 
$68; English literature and composition, $67; music, $40. 
THE DANSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK. 
An interesting example of an effort of a small public school system 
to “survey” itself is found in “A Study: The Dansville High 
School,” by J. Murray Foster, supervising principal. This investiga- 
tion consumed about 16 months of the surveyor’s spare time, and grew 
out of his feeling that the high school was not doing its proper work 
in comparison with the high schools in neighboring villages about 
the size of Dansville. When the work, which was aided to some 
extent in statistical compilation by the teachers in the school, was 
finished it was presented to the board of education, by whose order it 
was published (1915, Dansville, N. Y., 109 pp.). 
The material of the study is presented in 19 chapters, 13 illustra- 
tions, 8 graphs, and 21 tables. The study led to 11 conclusions which 
were offered not as “a program for immediate action,” but as “a 
sort of guide for the future.” These conclusions pointed out the
-P-A-G-E-509

need of increasing the salary scale ef teachers; a good library in or 
near the school building to supplement the work in the grades, and 
particularly that in the junior and senior high schools; the addition 
of a teacher trained in giving tests for mental deficiency ; the addition 
of a department of agriculture and horticulture, and in home-mak- 
ing; readjustment of the curriculum; the appointment of super- 
visors of play of boys and girls; more active concern about medical 
inspection; frequent parents’ meetings; the organization of a group. 
of the mothers of children in the lower grades; a wider use of the 
school plant by broadening the work of the night school; and enlarg- 
ing the district so as to increase the school revenues. 
OAKLAND, CAL, 
On June 12, 1915, Dr. E. P. Cubberley, of the Leland Stanford 
Junior University, presented to the board of education his report 
(48 pp.) on a special study of the school system which he had been 
requested to make by resolution of the board of education on June 1, 
1915. The motive of the study is to be found in the fact that “the 
per capita cost of maintenance, based on the average daily attendance 
of the Oakland school department, has increased 22 per cent during 
the last five years.” The surveyor was “to investigate the reasons 
for the increased expense and to determine if it were possible to 
conduct the schools more economically without loss of efficiency.” 
“The report of a survey of the organization, scope, and finances 
of the public-school system of Oakland, Cal.,” presents the answers 
to the three main questions which received consideration. Thirteen 
tables and two figures illuminate the details of the answers: The 
form of organization of the administrative departments and the over- 
head expense of the school department; the scope and further needs 
of the school system; the financial aspect of the problem and the 
ability of the city of Oakland to maintain a good system of schools. 
It is found that the form of organization can best be modified by 
coordinating the present four separate departments under the re- 
sponsible direction of the superintendent. It is found that overhead 
expense, excluding the salaries paid the six members of the board 
of education by the city, is 2.5 per cent of the total estimated cost 
for the maintenance of the educational work of the city. Consider- 
ing the work that is accomplished in the different branches of the 
administration, it is found that this expense is comparatively low. 
It would not be unreasonable to increase this expenditure to 3 per 
cent or even 3.5 per cent. 
The expenditures for education in Oakland have shown a marked 
rise because the old type of school system has, during the past five 
or six years, been displaced by efforts to meet the newer demands  
-P-A-G-E-510
ee ee eI en ee ee Snes 
490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
made upon a school system designed to meet the community needs. 
The chief causes of this rise are found to be: 
The increased salaries for teachers; the large increase in the number of 
teachers employed; the recent rapid introduction of kindergarten instruction; 
the additions to the supervisory force; the organization of new high schools 
and new departments in these schools; the reorganization of a number of the 
elementary schools for instruction along department lines; the addition of 
new subjects of instruction in the elementary schools and of new departments 
in the high schools, such as domestic science and home economics; an excellent 
reorganization and expansion of the work in music; the organization of a 
department for health development and sanitation; the better organization of 
the work in physical training and the provision of directed school play- 
grounds; the organization of a department of child study, the classes for the 
instruction of atypical children; the organization of a vocational school; the 
extension of the courses in the evening high schools; and the beginnings of 
an evening lecture system. 
Fourteen of these “causes” are reviewed in detail from the stand- 
point of cost. The study “does not reveal any place where any im- 
portant economy is possible, if the school system is to continue to 
serve the needs of the children of the community.” The detailed con- 
sideration of the increase in the cost of maintenance of all of the city 
departments, the increase in tax rate, the comparison of increase in 
property valuation, the increase in the cities of the school system, and 
considering the financial burdens upon the city as estimated by com- 
parison of wealth, size, and per capita costs for maintenance with 
other cities in the eastern, middle western, and western sections of 
the country, the study finds “that there is no need for any curtail- 
ment of the public-school system in Oakland.” If economies must 
be effected, the city should turn to “other departments than that 
which deals with the education of its future citizens.” 
FOREIGN SURVEYS. 
Ié is well known that the American survey movement has been 
preceded by-a definite survey movement abroad. Bulletin, 1915, No. 
87, of the United States Bureau of Education, “Some Foreign 
Educational Surveys” (39 pp.), by James Mahoney, contains an ac- 
count of “certain foreign types” and describes surveys conducted in 
Belgium, Canada, England, France, Germany and Austria, Ireland, 
New South Wales, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden, and Switzerland 
between 1798 and 1914. : 
“EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS.” 
This report for the year under consideration may appropriately 
close with a reference to two brief discussions of the “some 30 sur- 
veys” which had been made at the beginning of the year. In the 
ninth annual report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-
-P-A-G-E-511
SCHOOL SURVEYS. 491 
ment of Teaching (123 pp.), dated October 15, 1914, President Henry 
S. Pritchett presents a number of observations on the growth and 
values of the new survey movement. Since “no other subject touches 
life on so many sides or includes such a wealth of varied material,” it 
is most important “to have authoritative and thorough investigation 
of the fundamental facts and principles” found in our educational 
activity. It is noted as significant that the surveys have for the 
most part been made in order to secure “suggestions and direction 
for the next step in progress” and have been an expression of the in- 
terest of the public in educational matters. As to the future of the 
movement, it is felt that “there is every indication that some such 
scheme of educational inquiry will become a permanent feature of 
American education.” 
From the present indications it would be hazardous to infer, and dangerous 
_ for general educational welfare, to suppose that educational control and advice 
will become concentrated in the hands of a few experts, and much will have 
been gained if the need for the critical habit of mind becomes part of the 
educational routine. More important than the occasional survey is constant 
study of and familiarity with progress in contemporary educational thought on 
the part of those charged with the conduct of the schools. 
It is noted that “these reports have added nothing radical to edu- 
cational thought or literature.” The work of a survey should include: 
First, the historical development of the system studied; second, the 
relation of educational needs to economic, political, and sociological 
conditions; and third, conclude with a constructive program which 
“should point a way not too far removed from present conditions as 
affected by the factors mentioned.” It is also noted that there is an 
absence of “agreement as to the ends of education,” that the stand- 
ards of measurement are “ equally indefinite,” and that the compara- 
tive method “ does not give a measure of the essentials or establish 
guiding principles.” Accordingly, these surveys reveal a great deal 
as to the present scientific status of our educational knowledge. 
“The value of the recent educational surveys lies not so much in 
their actual contributions as in the suggestions to which they give 
rise.” 
- In the same report (pp. 56-59) are found brief observations and 
comment on the report on education in Vermont which present the 
results of the first study of this character conducted by the division 
of educational inquiry of this foundation. The wide and sharp criti- 
cism which this report awakened is constructively interpreted. 
“4 SURVEY OF SCHOOL SURVEYS.” 
On April 17, 1915, Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, director of the division 
of education of the Russell Sage Foundation, delivered an address 
_on “A Survey of School Surveys” at the close of the second annual 
 
-P-A-G-E-512
  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
conference on educational measurements, held under the auspices of 
the extension division of Indiana University. In tracing the de- 
velopments of the survey movement and pointing out the important 
characteristics of the 30 surveys which have been made, Dr. Ayres 
adds information on different items, such as agencies and directors, 
cost, length of time expended, and the size of the reports. 
These surveys have been carried through by organizations or individuals as 
follows: Individuals, 7; universities, 6; bureaus of municipal research, 5; State 
departments of education, 3; foundations, 3; United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion, 2; municipal departments, 2; national societies, 2. 
The directors of these 30 surveys have been the following: Professors of 
education, 18; special investigators, 11; directors of foundations, 4; United 
States Commissioner of Education, 1; superintendent of schools, 1. 
The cost figures that are available for the different pieces of survey work are 
as follows: Montclair, N. J., $500; Baltimore, Md., $2,000; Hast Orange, N. J., 
$1,000; Bridgeport, Conn., $1,000; Waterbury, Conn., $126.89; Portland, Oreg., 
$7,500; New York, N. Y., $125,000; State of Ohio, $10,000; State of Vermont, 
$10,000 ; Springfield, Il., $3,261; San Francisco, Cal., $700; Butte, Mont., $4,500. 
The time required is as follows: Baltimore, 8 months; Hast Orange, 23 
months; Vermont high schools, 4 months; Montgomery County, Md., 4 months; 
Waterbury, 3 days; New York, 2 years 2 months; Portland, 4 months; Ohio, 8 
months; Springfield, 2 months; San Francisco, 3 months; Butte, 1 month. 
Nine surveys were conducted by 1 individual, 8 surveys conducted by 2 
individuals, 4 surveys conducted by 8 individuals, 2 surveys conducted by 4 
individuals, 2 surveys conducted by 5 individuals, 1 survey conducted by 7 indi- 
viduals, 3 surveys conducted by 8 individuals, 1 survey conducted by 12 indi- 
viduals. 
The published reports vary greatly in size. The smallest consists of 6 pages 
and the largest of 2,573; 11 have less than 100 pages; 3 from 100 to 200 pages; 
2 from 200 to 300 pages; 2 from 300 to 400 pages. 
To summarize the salient characteristics of the survey, it may be said that 
they are 30 in number; that they have all been conducted in the past four 
years; that they are increasing in frequency; that they have largely been con- 
ducted by professors of education; that they have largely been undertaken by 
agencies or individuals outside of the school systems; that they range in cost 
from $126 to nearly $126,000; that the time consumed ranges from three days 
to more than two years; and that the reports range in bulk from 6 pages to 
nearly 2,600 pages.

PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 
By Epwarp ALLen Fay, 
Gallaudet College, Washington, D. 0. 
ConrTentTs.—The training of teachers—Much reading of books—A constant language envi- 
ronment—Better speech—Vocational training—Pensions for teachers—Tests of effi- 
ciency and mentality—A correction. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
In the early days of the education of the deaf in America little 
provision was made for the special training of teachers for the work. 
There was generally no preliminary training whatever. During 
their first year of service young teachers were given a thorough 
course of instruction in the sign language, which was then regarded 
as the all-important element in the instruction of the deaf, and they 
received some advice and suggestions from the head of the school 
and older teachers; otherwise they were left largely to their own 
devices. No doubt they would have done better work if they had 
been prepared for it by courses in pedagogy, psychology, and the 
special needs of the deaf; perhaps they spoiled two or three classes 
while they were learning how to teach; but being generally men of 
liberal education, graduates of New England colleges, mostly of 
Yale, eager to solve a new and intensely interesting problem in 
education, they accomplished, notwithstanding their lack of special 
training, wonderful results in the teaching of language, which is the 
essential feature of the education of the deaf—results which, during 
the same term of instruction, are not surpassed and probably are not 
equaled at the present day. 
The need of special training for teachers of the deaf is now much 
greater than it was formerly. For this there are two reasons. 
One reason is that nowadays comparatively few men of liberal 
education can be persuaded to become teachers of the deaf, on account 
of the greater pecuniary inducements offered them in other occupa- 
tions. A large majority of the present-day teachers are young 
women whose only general preparation has been that of the high 
school, rarely the normal school, too often only the common school. 
493,
-P-A-G-E-514
  494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Without some special training their work would be far inferior to 
that of the highly educated, profoundly thinking men of former 
days. 
The other reason is that the teaching of speech and speech reading, 
which now has become. general in the schools, demands a thorough 
knowledge of the physiological basis of speech, the visible move- 
ments upon which speech reading depends, and the various ingenious 
devices by which deaf children may be led to produce the vocal ele- 
ments, combine them into words, give the proper inflection and accent 
in sentences, modulate the voice, etc. Here the college graduate, with 
all his superior mental equipment but without special training, 
would be almost as much at a loss how to proceed as the tyro just 
out of the grade school. 
The training of teachers of speech in America was begun by Dr. 
Alexander Graham Bell, at Boston, in 1872, and was continued in a 
private school under his supervision until 1879. For several years 
subsequently a few young women were prepared in various schools 
for the deaf to give instruction by the oral method, but no general 
provision for the training of teachers was made. 
To meet this need, to provide for the deaf students of Gallaudet 
College hearing and speaking associates who would give them prac- 
tice in speech and speech reading, and at the same time to raise the 
general standard of qualifications for teachers of the deaf in America, 
Dr. Edward M. Gallaudet, in 1891, persuaded Congress to establish 
a normal department at Gallaudet College for a limited number of 
young people, mostly men, who had received a liberal education. 
Candidates for admission were required to have, in addition to a 
college diploma, a certificate of proper capacity from their previous 
instructors and of special fitness for the work from the head of a 
school for the deaf. Exceptions to the requirement of a collegiate 
degree have been made in some cases where there were unusual quali- 
fications in other respects; but, in general, the requirements have been 
maintained. Both oral and manual methods of instruction are in- 
cluded in the curriculum. The results hoped for by Dr. Gallaudet in 
the establishment of this normal department have been fully realized. 
While some of the graduates have risen to the highest positions in the 
schools, becoming superintendents, principals, and head teachers, 
the general standard of the work of teaching the deaf throughout 
the United States has been raised in a marked degree. 
The Clarke School at Northampton, Mass., under the direction of 
Dr. Caroline A. Yale, which for several years had had a training 
class for its own teachers, began in 1892 to admit a few students who 
might become teachers in other schools. Fourteen years later, 
through the aid of the Melville Bell Memorial Fund, the school was 
enabled still further to enlarge the capacity of the training class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-515
  PROGRESS IN. THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 495 
The requirements for admission have always been high and the 
course of instruction thorough. The curriculum is limited to the oral 
method. Most of the students are young women. Dr. Yale is also 
doing much to improve the quality of speech work in the United 
States by conducting a summer school, which is attended by teachers 
from schools for the deaf from all parts of the country. 
While Gallaudet College and the Clarke School have thus provided 
the schools with many well-trained teachers, they have never been 
able fully to supply the demand. In consequence, a considerable 
number of schools within recent years have found it necessary to 
establish training classes for their own teachers and in some cases 
have admitted students who afterwards became teachers in other 
schools. The result of all these efforts is that at the present time the 
entrance of an untrained teacher into a school for the deaf is as 
rare as the entrance of a trained one was 25 years ago, and the quality 
of the work accomplished in the schools, especially the oral work, 
has been greatly advanced. 
MUCH READING OF BOOKS, 
One of the most important aids in the acquisition of language 
by the deaf is much reading of books. From the frequent repeti- 
tion of words and phrases, by which the hearing child unconsciously 
acquires language through the ear, the deaf are wholly shut off; 
reading, and reading alone, can give them this needed repetition. 
Although the early teachers recognized language as the great 
want of their pupils, sought earnestly for the best methods of im- 
parting it, and were acquainted with Dalgarno’s principle that it 
is the frequency with which words are presented to the mind that 
impressed them upon the memory, they seem to have overlooked the 
fact that this need can be met by much reading of books and in no 
other way. In the considerable body of the literature of the pro- 
fession for more than 50 years after the establishment of the first 
schools for the deaf in America, there is not a single reference to it. 
Probably few teachers during that period encouraged their pupils 
to read much unless the pupils had a natural taste for it; one pupil 
who had such a taste reported in after life that his teacher even 
discouraged him from reading, because it took time that he thought 
might better be devoted to the learning of set lessons. 
The value of this means of acquiring language seems to have been 
first discovered by a man who was himself deaf, Henry C. White, 
then a student in Gallaudet College. Seeing that some of his fel- 
low students who were congenitally or quasi-congenitally deaf had 
a much better command of the English language than others of 
equally good natural advantages and an equally long term of in- 
struction, he sought the cause of this difference. He found it in the
-P-A-G-E-516
    496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
circumstance that those who understood and wrote English well 
were eager readers of books, while those whose command of Eng- 
lish was inferior had, like the great majority of deaf-born people, 
no taste for reading, and did little more of it than was required by 
their instructors. His article on “ Reading as a Means of Acquiring 
a Good Command of Language,” published in the American Annals 
of the Deaf in 1879, was the first of many that have been written 
on that subject. 
It remained for Dr. Alexander Graham Bell to point out the rea- 
son, which is stated above, why reading is so helpful to the deaf in 
the acquisition of language. This he did in a lecture to the students 
of Gallaudet College in 1887 and in an address to the conference of 
superintendents and principals of American schools for the deaf 
in 1888. Since then he and others have persistently urged its im- 
portance. American schools for the deaf now generally recognize 
its value and endeavor more and more to make use of it. Ingenious 
devices are employed to give children a taste for reading at a period 
when their vocabulary is still very scanty; little story books, written 
in the simplest language, are prepared for beginners; stories suited 
to classes of varying grades are printed in the school papers; attrac- 
tive books are supplied in great profusion for the use of older pupils; 
reading periods are assigned during school hours or (in the Ohio 
school) during the hours formerly devoted to evening study; teachers 
encourage and guide pupils in their reading; in some schools special 
teachers of reading are employed. 
Tt can not be affirmed that these methods always lead the pupil 
to a mastery of language or a love of literature; but where they are 
efliciently applied they result in an enlargement of his vocabulary, 
a comprehension and use of language, a development of the imagina- 
tion, breadth of vision, clearness of thought, and sense of values that 
fully justify the labor bestowed. 
A CONSTANT LANGUAGE ENVIRON MENT. 
While much reading of books gives the deaf child a repetition of 
words that corresponds in some respects to the repetition that the 
hearing child receives through the ear, it does not provide the same 
incentive to the use of language by the child himself, nor afford the 
same opportunity for practice in it. These essentials to the mastery 
of language are supplied as far as possible by the teacher in the 
schoolroom, who faithfully drills his pupils day after day and year 
after year in the use and practice of the English language, making all 
his other instruction subsidiary to this. Much further than this few 
of the schools go. On the playground and in the general intercourse 
of daily life outside the schoolroom the children, not yet having a 
sufficient command of the language of words to use it as a means of
-P-A-G-E-517

communication, resort to the easier and more intelligible language of 
signs. This is true not only of the combined-system schools but 
also of the oral schools. The attempt to repress by severe measures 
the use of signs by little children who have as yet no other means of 
communication results in what is worse than the use of signs—no 
communication at all. The sign language thus is apt to keep its 
place in the mind of a congenitally deaf person as the natural 
medium of thought and expression in daily life, while written and 
spoken language are too often looked upon as something belonging 
exclusively to the schoolroom. 
This great drawback to the mastery of language is probably most 
successfully overcome in the Western New York Institution for 
Deaf-Mutes, at Rochester, N. Y., under the direction of Dr. Z. F. 
Westervelt. In that school the manual alphabet is used, to the ex- 
clusion of signs, as the ordinary means of communication as well 
as of instruction from the very beginning of the child’s education. 
The English language is so readily acquired by this method that the 
pupils become able to express their childish wants in it at an early 
stage of their instruction. In their hours of recreation they are 
under careful supervision, the persons in charge being always ready 
to address them in English rapidly spelled upon the fingers and to 
encourage and assist them in using English in the same way them- 
selves. The children are thus provided with a constant environ- 
ment of the English language, and the results from a language point 
of view are highly satisfactory. 
Other American schools do not deem it wise to follow the Western 
New York Institution in its strict adherence to the manual 
alphabet method, some because they regard the sign language as too 
valuable a factor in awakening and developing the mind of the deaf 
child and too convenient a means of addressing the pupils in as- 
sembly to be wholly rejected; others because they believe that speech, 
to the exclusion of the manual alphabet, should be the only medium 
of instruction and communication. But if they wish to achieve as 
good results in language as the Rochester school can show they must 
in some way provide an equally effective language environment for 
all the waking hours of the pupils. English, spelled on the fingers, 
written, or spoken, must be the language used in the trade school and 
on the playground as well as in the classroom; and with the children 
there must be at all times when they are not in school or shop com- 
petent supervisors who will surround them with a constant atmos- 
phere of good colloquial English. Such supervision demands a 
higher standard of intellectual and moral qualifications than is usu- 
ally to be found in persons available for monitorial service and in- 
volves a larger expenditure than most schools can afford. In the 
Kendall School, at Washington, D. C., this difficult problem is solved 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——32
-P-A-G-E-518
    498 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to some extent by requiring the students of the Normal Department 
of Gallaudet College to act as supervisors during a part of every 
day. 
BETTER SPEECH. 
The vocal utterance of those whose ears are sealed to sound is usu- 
ally more or less painful and disagreeable, and sometimes, even after 
years of instruction by faithful teachers, almost unintelligible except 
to the teachers themselves, to members of the family, and to inti- 
mate friends. This has generally been regarded as an inevitable, 
though deplorable, consequence of deafness; and oral teachers of the 
deaf, knowing with how great an expenditure of effort on their part 
and on their pupils’ part the power of speech has been acquired, 
have been indignant when the results attained were criticized as un- 
satisfactory. Parents, too, hearing from their heretofore voiceless 
children the longed-for words “papa” and “mamma,” and finding 
them ‘able to make their simple wants understood in their own homes 
through speech, have been amazed and delighted at the transforma- 
tion wrought and have asked for nothing more. 
Within the past two or three years, however, there has grown up 
a belief among oral teachers that better results in speech than have 
hitherto been achieved are not only desirable but really possible. 
This belief is due to the fuller understanding of the mechanism of 
speech, the discovery and invention of new devices for teaching it, 
and the introduction of music, both instrumental and vocal, to give 
the idea of rhythm and increase the control, flexibility, and strength 
of the voice. The success of Prof. Charles A. White, of Boston, in 
developing Helen Keller’s voice so that she is able to address large 
public audiences has shown what can be accomplished under un- 
usually difficult conditions. The declaration of Dr. Yale at the con- 
vention of American instructors of the deaf held at Staunton, Va., 
in 1914 that “the plea now should be not for more speech, but for 
better speech,” met with an enthusiastic response from the large body 
of teachers present. 
What is said above of the importance of a constant language en- 
vironment in order to acquire a mastery of language is equally true 
of a constant speech environment in order to secure the best results 
in speech and speech reading. Not only must the most advanced 
methods of instruction be used by the most competent teachers in 
the schoolroom, but the pupil must be surrounded by an atmosphere 
of speech at all times. In oral schools this requires the employment 
of numerous supervisors of superior qualifications; in combined- 
system schools not only that but also the separation of the orally 
taught pupils from the manually taught out of school hours as well 
as in the schoolroom.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
The schools for the deaf were the pioneers in vocational training 
in America, though they called it by another name. They have 
always recognized the importance of preparing their pupils while in 
school to become self-supporting when they graduate. The equip- 
ment for the work and the character of the instruction given in some 
cases, however, have not been of the best. The high standard of the 
trade schools for hearing youth established within recent years has 
aroused the emulation of the schools for the deaf, and a general effort 
is now being made to improve the condition of their industrial de- 
partments. The great obstacle in the way is the lack of sufficient 
means. In this respect the endowed schools, as the New York and 
Pennsylvania institutions, which have an income from their invested 
funds as well as support from the State, have an advantage over the 
State schools which are wholly dependent upon legislative appro- 
priations. 
So much time is required to give deaf children the necessary 
knowledge of the English language and other branches of learning 
that the term of instruction allowed, though much longer in America 
than in any other country in the world, is all too short for the addi- 
tion of adequate vocational training. This difficulty is overcome to 
some extent in various ways. Gallaudet College offers optional 
courses for young men in electricity, chemistry, scientific agriculture, 
floriculture, stock and poultry raising, and dairying; for young 
women, courses in library cataloguing and dressmaking. The In- 
diana and New Jersey State schools have established postgraduate 
courses in shopwork. The Michigan school made a new departure 
last year by opening a school of agriculture under a different régime 
from that of the other departments of the institution. For the pupils 
in this department the school year begins the 1st of March and closes 
the 24th of December. The pupils go home for their long vacation 
from Christmas to March, instead of in the summer. During the 
term they spend half a day in school and half a day at work on the 
farm under the direction of a graduate of the Michigan Agricultural 
College. They are taught the science of agriculture in the school- 
room and the art of agriculture in their work. The course includes 
not only general farming, but also dairying and the raising of 
poultry and swine. 
The proper division of the time between school and shop has been 
a subject of much discussion among teachers of the deaf. While 
there is still some difference of opinion on this subject, the majority 
now probably believe that five hours a day should be given to the 
schoolroom and two and a half or three hours to the shop until the 
last two or three years of the term of instruction. During these 
 
-P-A-G-E-520
  500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
last years they would divide the day equally between the academical 
and the industrial training. The interdependence of the two depart- 
ments is more and more fully recognized and, by correlation of the 
work of brain and hand, by joint meetings of the literary and voca- 
tional teachers, and frequent visits to one another’s classes, mutual 
aid and cooperation are sought. 
PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS. 
A few schools for the deaf have been able to provide teachers of 
long service with suitable pensions when they retired on account of 
advanced age, but such schools are the exception, not the rule. For 
several years the three great organizations of teachers of the deaf in 
America—the Convention of Instructors, the Conference of Super- 
intendents and Principals, and the Association to Promote the 
Teaching of Speech—have been working together in the effort to 
establish some system of pensions which would be available for all 
deserving teachers. Various plans have been proposed, but have 
encountered obstacles that seemed insurmountable. Recently, how- 
ever, California, Indiana, Minnesota, and New York have passed 
laws making teachers in State schools for the deaf eligible to the 
pensions provided for teachers in common schools. This seems to 
be, on the whole, the most satisfactory solution of the problem, and 
it is to be hoped that it will be adopted generally throughout the 
country.   
TESTS OF EFFICIENCY AND MENTALITY. 
At the meeting of the Convention of American Instructors of the 
Deaf, held at Staunton, Va., in- 1914, there was a symposium on 
“Measurement of Efficiency of Schools for the Deaf.” It was 
pointed out that the educational departments of some States are 
attempting to measure the efficiency of schools for the deaf without 
any comprehensive knowledge of the peculiarities of the work, look- 
ing at it almost solely from the point of view of teachers of hearing 
children. They insist, for instance, that the same textbooks should 
be used as in the common schools, that the same standards should be 
applied, and even that ordinary teachers should be allowed to take 
charge of deaf classes without any special training for the work. 
In order to correct this mistaken view, the Conference of Superin- 
tendents and Principals, meeting in conjunction with the convention, 
adopted the following declaration of a basic principle in the edu- 
cation of the deaf: 
The education of the deaf child—which is claimed as a matter of right, not 
of charity—while a part of the general educational movement, is a distinct 
and highly specialized branch of the work, and, as such, requires the services 
of expert educators of the deaf—those who know not only the commonly applied 
principles of pedagogy and psychology, but who also, through special training,
-P-A-G-E-521
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 501 
active experience, and thorough research work, know the possibilities, the pecu- 
liarities, and the limitations of the deaf child; who know clearly what is possi- 
ble and practical, as opposed to the impossible and theoretical. This is a 
knowledge not possessed even by those who proclaim themselves masters, theo- 
retically or otherwise, of the work with the hearing child, who, as a matter of 
fact, receives his education largely at the hands not of his school-teacher, but 
of the thousands with whom he comes in contact outside the schoolroom, and 
through the acquisition of his mother tongue, with its vocabulary and expres- 
sion, which comes to him naturally and easily from the very day of his birth— 
all of which is denied to the deaf child. With this special knowledge of deaf- 
child nature, as referred to above, acquired through years of study of, and ex- 
perience with, the deaf, one may readily perceive that the problems presented 
are not ordinary ones, that they are indeed complex, and, further, that the 
ordinary curricula, textbooks, grade divisions, and modes of procedure adapted 
to the hearing child must be very decidedly modified with the deaf child. To 
those who are not in the work of educating the deaf, this knowledge does not 
come, and they are ill-prepared to criticize methods, progress, and results which 
necessarily must be seen and judged from a viewpoint entirely different from 
their own. 
The conference regarded this question of efficiency in schools for 
the deaf as so important that it appointed a committee to study it and 
to arrange a general scheme for the measurement of efficiency wherein 
mentality tests and age and class-year norms should be established. 
The committee consists of Mr. R. O. Johnson, of Indiana; Mr. 
Augustus Rogers, of Kentucky; Dr. A. L. E. Crouter, of Pennsyl- 
vania; Mr. J. W. Jones, of Ohio; and Mr. W. M. Kilpatrick, of 
Connecticut. These gentlemen have before them an exceedingly 
complicated and difficult task, but they have gone to work at it 
energetically and intelligently. They early secured the assistance of 
several psychologists of national reputation, who have attended the 
meetings of the committee and made many valuable suggestions. 
Two psychologists, Dr. Rudolph Pintner and Mr. Donald G. Pater- 
son, of the Ohio State University, who had previously experimented 
upon deaf children with the Binet-Simon scale and ascertained that 
it could not be applied satisfactorily without modifications, have 
examined, under the direction of the committee, the pupils of the 
Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania schools, using tests for mentality 
specially designed by themselves. The committee hopes to be able 
to present its conclusions to the conference at its next regular meet- 
ing, to be held in 1916.1   
1A CORRECTION. 
In the chapter on “ Progress in the Education of the Deaf,” in the Report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for the year ending June 30, 1913, the statement was made that 
Mrs. Edwin G. Hurd, of the Rhode Island Institute, was the first actually to apply the 
Montessori method to the education of the deaf. This was an error. Mrs. Hurd, as the 
report states, began the use of the method in January, 1913, but in February, 1912, Mrs. 
J. Scott Anderson, of Torresdale House, Philadelphia, had a Montessori class of deaf | 
pupils, and in the summer of that year full equipments for the Montessori work were 
procured for the New York institution, and teachers with special training were put in 
charge.

Mass.

    In 1872 there were 1,900 pupils in attendance upon the 27 schools 
for the blind; in 1914 there were 4,971 pupils in 62 schools. The 
property devoted to this field of education in 1872 was reported to 
be $3,986,678.71; in 1914 it was given as $15,224,693. The cost per 
pupil for instruction and maintenance necessarily keeps large; in 
1914 it was $360. This is owing to the fact that the schools are 
mainly residential, also that the proportion of teachers and other 
employees to enrollment is larger than in other types of educational 
institutions. In one institution, where the proportion of all em- 
ployees to pupils is approximately as 1 to 3, the pay roll amounts 
to about 60 per cent of the total current expenses, and yet this 
institution recently rebuilt in such manner as to reduce the number 
of people on its pay roll by 10. 
PROGRESS OF THE DAY-SCHOOL MOVEMENT. 
Public education of blind youth is then admittedly expensive when 
compared with that of the seeing. The attempt in certain places to 
make it less so and actually to apply compulsory education laws 
to the blind by creating the machinery for teaching them in the public 
schools and receiving local pupils there, which began with the twen- 
tieth century, is meeting with undoubted success. It is but fair to 
the originators of this plan to say, however, that they look for even 
greater educational efficiency from it, because the blind children are 
kept all the time with seeing children and in the world to which they   
1A somewhat statistical chapter on this general subject appeared in the 1913 report 
of this bureau. None had before been published by it since 1872. This resumption of 
the matter indicates in itself a recognition of the growth and importance of the work of 
educating the blind,

normally belong, rather than removed for a part of the time to a 
special residential school, even though in the latter case conditions of 
pupil competition are equalized and every conceivable chance is given 
for acquiring a well-balanced education. Be that as it may, the 
public-school classes for the blind are growing both in number, in 
attendance, and in balance, and, though the movement is believed 
by most to be still an experiment, it is one which the whole profes- 
sion can not but observe with sympathetic interest and be ready to 
aid and further so far as proves just and right to the blind them- 
selves. Many, perhaps most, expert observers feel that, while these 
“day schools for the blind” possess certain indubitable advantages 
over “boarding schools for the blind,” the latter likewise have their 
advantages, and that, until the existing state of society changes and 
a saner responsibility for all childhood and youth reigns, the best 
interests of the blind will demand both kinds of schools; also, that 
most of the blind would benefit by experience in each kind. It is 
felt, too, that education is not a matter of dollars and cents, but of 
results, and that blindness should command whatever the condition 
ealls for. 
It is gratifying to note, therefore, that a most helpful cooperation 
exists between the two kinds of schools; also that each kind has 
stimulated the other to work toward overcoming its defects, with 
resulting benefit to both. The day schools, as soon as they showed 
that their blind pupils could hold their own in the studies required 
by others of their age and grade, found themselves criticized by the 
institutions for failing to balance with physical training, manual 
training, and music the more purely intellectual studies of the public- 
school curriculum. To supply this evident lack some private asso- 
ciations in behalf of the blind and some semipublic agencies, like 
the Fox Fund in Brooklyn, came to the rescue, supplementing the 
existing facilities in an effective and beautiful way—such as bringing 
a larger number of the children together for story-telling, dancing, 
and social games, giving plays, forming Boy Scout battalions and 
Camp Fire chapters, providing inspirational talks on personal hy- 
giene, knitting for the Belgians, work in manual training, lessons in 
cooking, in chorus singing, and even individual lessons on the piano. 
Some, notably in New York City, also gave vocational opportunities 
in piano tuning. Obviously, these activities have meant utilizing 
occasional out-of-school hours—afternoons, evenings, and Saturdays. 
Where private organizations did not wish to take labor and means 
from the adult blind, as in Wisconsin, yet desired to get these social- 
izing and balancing benefits for the children, they caused legislation 
to be enacted, raising the State appropriation for a blind pupil at- 
tending day schools from $150 to $200 a year. In the light of this 
experience, Ohio made its appropriation $200 at the outset. In the
-P-A-G-E-525
EDUCATION FOR THE BLIND. 505 
three Ohio cities conducting these classes the school day of the blind 
is now six hours instead of five, and certain attendance is required 
on Saturdays also. The 1913-14 annual report of the superintendent 
of schools of Cleveland contains two full-page illustrations and 14 
printed pages descriptive of the city’s classes for the blind and their 
activities. Indeed, Cleveland would appear to be the center of Ohio’s 
movement for such classes, the Cleveland supervisor of blind classes 
having been given charge of the classes of the same kind recon- 
structed in Cincinnati and begun in Toledo. This fact augurs well 
for the general success of the day-school movement whose aim, as 
given in the 1914 report of the Chicago schools, where the movement 
originated, is “to give to the blind child the opportunity of growing 
up in a natural environment and to provide him such training as will 
enable him to mingle later on.in the business and social world as 
nearly as possible like a normal member of society.” 
Eleven cities now conduct day-school classes for blind children. 
“The room for the blind at each center is in charge of a special 
teacher, but the time of the pupils is divided between the work in the 
special room and that of the regular grade class rooms, the work in 
the special room being of necessity largely individual and supple- 
mental.” Where the pupils are many, an embossing press is run in 
order to provide textbooks; where they are few, as at Newark, N. J., 
the special teacher often writes out by means of an embossing type- 
writer, known as a Braillewriter, copies of the books needed which 
she can not procure elsewhere. In the school year 1913-14 the whole 
number of children attending these day schools was 422, New York 
City enumerating 194 in 17 centers. 
PROGRESS AT THE INSTITUTIONS. 
There are 48 residential schools for the blind, registering in 1913-14 
a total of 4,399 pupils. Many of these “institutions,” being located 
in populous centers, not only permit their pupils to go home for week- 
ends but urge as many as can to do so. Most of the pupils remain 
at home over the Christmas and Easter holidays, and all must leave 
the institution during the long summer vacation. In other words, 
these schools have long recognized the danger of weaning their chil- 
dren from home and have seemed to be doing their best to prevent it. 
But they, too, have been touched by the movement away from insti- 
tutions for children and, being perhaps influenced by the criticisms 
of the advocates of day schools for all kinds of pupils, have striven to 
meet these criticisms by introducing new socializing influences. The 
annual reports of these institutions and the school notes appearing 
in the Outlook for the Blind, a periodical chronicling every kind of 
activity for and by the blind, are more and more filled with out-of- 
class events in which the pupils participate—public festivals, con-
-P-A-G-E-526
    506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
certs, dramatics, pageants, and even with accounts of athletic, type- 
writing, and other contests with boys and girls who have full use of 
their eyesight. Where there are “patrols” of blind Boy Scouts and 
camps of blind Camp Fire Girls and nests of “ Bluebirds ”—and these 
are multiplying—the blind and the seeing are inevitably brought 
more and more into contact. At least three residential schools insist 
on pupil participation in the daily housework and are highly pleased 
with the results; and we read of others either adding new buildings, 
as, very recently, a kindergarten at Batavia, N. Y., or planning to re- 
build on the cottage system—all definite tendencies away from the 
congregate toward the segregate manner of housing. Again, there are 
increasing reference to courses in domestic science and to such out-of- 
door activities as school gardening and farming and poultry keeping 
scientifically conducted. In fact, the reports and the periodical now 
enrich and enliven their reading matter with pictures of such agen- 
cies and activities, indicating the greater emphasis placed upon them. 
All this tends to attract attention and to bring the schools into the 
public eye. 
Formerly the institutions felt more deeply than now the need of 
saving their pupils from the influences of home, the visiting of par- 
ents being often discouraged. Even to-day the rules of at least two 
institutions provide that parents and friends of the pupils can not 
be entertained at meals or overnight. On the other hand, the rules 
of several others contain definite invitations for parents to spend a 
night at the school. The much-to-be-desired cooperation of parents 
and teachers can be promoted in no other way so well as by bringing 
them together. 
THE BLIND AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The idea is evidently growing in the institutions that selected 
pupils who are ready for high school, normal school, and college 
should either leave the institution entirely or attend from it the pub- 
lic school or college desired. Daily contact with seeing students, 
necessitating self-measurement by the standards of the world, should 
be in the highest degree developmental. 
It is significant that there is a growth in the number of institu- 
tions whose high-school department is on the list of fully accredited 
high schools. Two institutions report that recent acts of assembly 
require the superintendent of their State school for the blind to be a 
trained teacher of the blind. 
It is also to be noted with satisfaction rather than with wonder- 
ment that numbers of the blind are in college, and that as a rule they 
more than hold their own, usually graduating with honor rank. 
The explanation is not far to seek. Only the best and most deter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-527
  EDUCATION FOR THE BLIND. 507 
mined essay higher education, and, as compared with others, they 
are more mature upon entrance, better prepared and more habituated 
to mental concentration, less able to put their best energy into ath- 
letics and other distractions, and more filled with “the motive of the 
life career.” It would appear that the University of Texas appre- 
ciates in an unusual degree the advantage of having blind students, 
since it had seven in 1914 and nine in 1915. It is reported that its 
senior law class in 1914 elected blind young men to the offices of 
president, vice president, and secretary-treasurer. In any com- 
munity of seeing people the presence of the blind who achieve note- 
worthy results in spite of their handicap is inspiring, and therefore 
extremely serviceable to the community. 
In order to make it more possible for such people of parts to ob- 
tain higher education, six States have now made limited appropria- 
tions of money, obtainable by individuals under certain conditions, 
either to defray the expenses of a reader or for other needs or for 
both. 
CLASSES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF VISION. 
The movement to include all kinds and conditions of children, sub- 
normal, and even supernormal, in the public schools and to instruct 
them according to their needs and possibilities has in two or three 
cities brought together in special classes children who see too little 
to progress in the usual grades and too much to be patient under 
methods used by the blind. As such pupils are obviously out of place 
unless trained through means modified by the condition of their eye- 
sight, special centers for them have been recently opened in a number 
of cities in Europe, and in Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Toledo 
in America. The instruction is addressed largely to the eye, under 
the watchful care of oculists, its chief object being to conserve such 
sight as the pupils have. For psychological reasons such pupils 
would better be called semisighted than semiblind. The multiplica- 
tion of these classes will be a relief to institutions for the blind, most 
of which still have to admit these children with defective vision and 
to treat them as semiblind pupils rather than as semisighted. 
THE PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS. 
The schools are very generally recognizing the obligation resting 
upon them to render valuable aid in local and nation-wide cam- 
paigns for preventing blindness. The Legislature of Arkansas, for 
example, recently voted a sum of money to its State school for the 
blind for the purpose of spreading knowledge and means of such 
prevention. Again, the State Medical Society of North Carolina 
has just appointed the superintendent of its State school a member
-P-A-G-E-528
  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of the society’s committee on conservation of vision. And, again, 
Principal Van Cleve, of the New York Institute for the Education 
of the Blind, has been made managing director of the new national 
committee for the prevention of blindness. This committee and 
kindred agencies keep on hand for general use slides, charts, and 
other means used in a modern publicity campaign. As evidence of 
the increasing attention to this matter the librarian of a special 
library of literature on all matters connected with blindness and 
the blind reports that her most notable and important accessions 
since 1907 fall in the section of “ Cause and prevention.” 
INFLUENCE OF PROVIDING WORK FOR THE ADULT BLIND. 
The librarian of the special library above mentioned likewise 
reports large recent accessions under the heading “Adult blind,” 
the most of these being under the subheading “ Industrial training.” 
There are now, in 1915, besides numerous societies, at least 14 State 
associations for the blind conducted with private funds and 8 State 
commissions conducted with public funds. These provide means 
of employment not only for people blinded in adult life but also for 
increasing numbers of former pupils of the schools for the blind, 
thus stimulating those schools to bestow a more complete training in 
the useful arts at which the blind may be profitably employed. In 
this and other ways have the schools been changed and benefited by 
the twentieth-century campaign in behalf of the adult blind. 
Where a field officer works under the management of a school, as 
at Pittsburgh, Pa., and Faribault, Minn., home and school can be 
kept in fairly close touch; and where he is also director of an em- 
ployment bureau, as in Philadelphia, the constant pressure his de- 
mands exert on his school for better workers is having a wholesome 
effect upon the quality of its instruction. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS FOR ADULTS. 
In communities where public and private agencies in aid of the 
adult blind are either nonexistent or feeble or where the institution 
superintendent prefers to have it so, he has opened his doors for a 
summer school for adults. The instruction and practice given, while 
mostly in the manual arts or handicrafts and piano tuning, have not 
wholly excluded such practically intellectual matters as reading, 
typewriting, etc. Supt. Dow, of the Minnesota institution, has suc- 
cessfully conducted a summer school for men since 1906, not 1911 
as previously reported, and one for women since 1914. Following 
this lead Supt. Hall opened in the Washington State School for the 
Blind, in July, 1915, a summer school for blind men and blind 
women.

HOME TEACHING. 
There are large numbers of old blind people; the median age of 
the 57,272 blind population reported for the United States in 1910 
was 59.6 years. Most of these older blind people are at home and, if 
sitting in idleness, are generally unhappy. Organized attempts to 
relieve their condition without removing them from home were begun 
in Great Britain at least as early as 1854, by sending teachers to carry 
cheer, encouragement, and instruction to them. This is what is 
meant by “home teaching.” The first permanent home teaching in 
America was begun in 1882 in Philadelphia, its chief service being to 
teach the blind to read an easily tangible type and to circulate books 
among them, a solace which is the greatest possible boon. Massa- 
chusetts began home teaching in 1900, the first to do so with public 
money. Since then at least 18 other States have instituted the work 
either with private or public funds or with both, and while all teach 
reading as their chief instrumentality, most home teachers teach 
whatever else they can; for their pupils can not read all the time 
and crave an occupation through which they can be useful and per- 
haps earn a little money. It has been found that the most efficient 
home teachers are blind people selected for their intelligence, re- 
sourcefulness, and cheer. Here, then, is an excellent and growing 
employment for the blind graduate and one for which the schools can 
and do prepare. 
EMBOSSED BOOKS AND THEIR CIRCULATION. 
The report of the Commissioner of Education for 1913-14 gives a 
total of 115,000 volumes in raised type in the various schools for the 
blind. The circulation of these is largely among present and past 
pupils. Material in 64 public and State libraries goes wherever a 
blind reader sitting at home makes her wants known.’ According to 
the 1914 report of the New York City Library, 26,224 volumes or 
magazines went out in 12 months from that collection alone, most of 
them by mail. In August, 1915, the Post Office Department an- 
nounced a substantial reduction in postage on reading matter for the 
‘blind exchanged between the United States and Great Britain. The 
weight limit is increased from 4 pounds 6 ounces to 6 pounds, and a 
flat rate of 10 cents a pound for each package exceeding 18 ounces in 
weight is charged. Should the efforts of the uniform type committee 
lead to a wider interchange of literature between the two countries, 
the reduction is likely to prove of great service.   
1Circulations through the Post Office Department were made possible on a large scale 
by the franking privilege granted in 1904.

THE BLIND AND MUSEUM EXTENSION. 
Established schools for the blind have collections, more or less 
extensive, of specimens and models for object teaching. Their pupils 
can “see” certain things in no other way than through handling 
them. A visitor to European continental institutions is astounded at 
the amount and variety of their object-teaching material. American 
instructors of the blind would possibly do well to increase the stress 
now laid by them upon such means of clarifying the conceptions of 
their pupils. Day schools, particularly, would appear to be liable 
to lack such opportunity. In New York City the danger was fore- 
seen and means taken to avert it in 1909. The American Museum 
of Natural History then exposed objects of contemporary interest, 
like polar expedition sledges and clothing, and invited blind people, 
young and old, to “see” them there. The things were explained and 
lectures given. Later special collections were sent to the centers for 
blind children in the public schools of the city and of neighboring 
cities, like Newark, N. J. Indeed, this work, which is part of the 
movement for museum instruction and its extension to the schools 
of Greater New York, has been endowed in behalf of the blind, trans- 
portation is supplied for the blind, and guides are furnished to and 
from the museum. As in Washington, D. C., people of note are 
glad to entertain and instruct the blind, and have done so for years 
at the Library of Congress and the National Library for the Blind, 
so in New York experts, such as Rear Admiral Peary and Ernest 
Thompson Seton, have lectured to audiences of blind people. 
PROGRESS TOWARD A UNIFORM TYPE. 
Many systems of embossed types palpable to the fingers of the 
blind have been put forth since 1784, when the first one was printed 
in Paris. These systems fall under two heads—those composed of 
lines and those composed of points or dots. The latter are writable 
as well as readable by the blind and partly for this reason have pre- 
vailed. Nearly all the codes are arbitrary, like the Morse telegraphic 
code. Three are in extensive use to-day—Braille in most countries, 
New York Point and American Braille in America. Americans de- 
siring the best possible instrumentalities for their blind, on the 
ground that blindness is in itself sufficient handicap, have so far 
been unable to agree on which is best. Asa consequence, their presses 
have been issuing books in two point systems, in some case even dupli- 
cating the same book in each system. To be sure the blind can 
readily master both, but having two systems is manifestly wasteful 
in time, money, energy, and in product. The blind are the obvious 
sufferers. A movement for uniformity, which the blind themselves 
began about 1900 and which a few devoted ones among them labored
-P-A-G-E-531
EDUCATION FOR THE BLIND. 511 
for and even financed for a number of years, has been gaining head- 
way, particularly since 1911. At a convention of the American 
Association of Workers for the Blind, money was raised for con- 
tinuing this investigation by a uniform type committee which had 
been appointed by that association in 1905. Since then more funds 
have been contributed, enabling the special investigators to travel 
widely in this country and in England and to compute from their 
tests both an ideal, or most efficient, system and a compromise system, 
thought to be more likely to meet with acceptance by the British, who 
are on the whole satisfied with their present alphabet. 
This past summer, at a convention of the association held in Berke- 
ley, Cal., the committee made its final report, which was accepted 
for adoption and the committee discharged. The system recom- 
mended, called “Standard Dot,” is the compromise, and while its 
alphabetical characters are those of Braille, the spacing prescribed 
both for writing and for printing them is similar to that of New 
York point; it also differs from any other single system in most 
of the punctuation marks and in its special characters for groups 
of letters known as “contractions.” Standard Dot is thus seen to be 
a new system. However, the conviction overwhelmingly shown at 
the convention above named and at that held in the same week 
by the American Association of Instructors of the Blind was for 
uniformity, not for diversity; and while the latter-named body ac- 
cepted Standard Dot for immediate trial, it appointed a strong 
committee both to see that the test was carried out in the schools 
and to make every reasonable effort to agree with the British uni- 
form type committee, to the end that there shall be but one system 
for the English-speaking blind. This American “commission on 
uniform type,” so called, is composed of workers and instructors, 
and is financed so that one of its members may give his whole time 
to the work. It has caused certain books to be embossed in Stand- 
ard Dot, and it has been instructed to report its findings in the sum- 
mer of 1916. Thus, though not a few of those most concerned ex- 
pected that the “type question ” would be definitely settled at Berke- 
ley, the majority of those feeling the responsibility involved voted 
for the delay which practically every one saw was absolutely re- 
quired if the introduction of another system to those in use was to 
be avoided. The progress toward uniform type is the most impor- 
tant recent advance in the progress of the education of the blind in 
the United States.

CHAPTER XXI. 
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 
By J. D. Wotcort, 
Chicf of the Library Division, Bureau of Hducation. 
ConrEeNnTS.—Legislation—Public library extensions—County library systems—State-wide 
use of university libraries—Library service to immigrants—Library exhibits at the 
Panama-Pacific _Exposition—Meetings of associations—Recent books on library ad- 
ministration and technique. 
LEGISLATION. 
During the past year a considerable amount of important legis- 
lation relating to libraries was enacted. The general tendency was 
to extend the scope of library activities and to increase appropri- 
ations for work already existing. The following is a survey by 
States of the general movement in library legislation during the 
year, including outlines of the laws which were passed, and also ref- 
erences to some proposed measures which failed of enactment. 
Alabama.—tThe Alabama legislature of 1915 passed an act requir- 
ing all libraries in the State, except those of strictly private char- 
acter, to make regular and specific reports to the State department 
of archives and history. 
Cdifornia—Section 1715 of the Political Code was amended by 
adding a clause authorizing the school board in any city maintaining 
a public library to arrange for library service similar to arrange- 
ments that are allowed between county free libraries and district 
schools. (S. B. 1129, ch. 469, Laws of 1915.) 
Section 1741 of the Political Code was amended to provide that 
the high-school board of any high-school district lying wholly or 
partly in a county maintaining a county free library shall have power 
to enter into a contract with the board of supervisors whereby the 
high school may secure the advantages of the county library. This 
bill will enable high-school boards to arrange for branches of county 
libraries in the various high-school buildings. (S. B. 811, ch. 464, 
Laws of 1915.) 
The library fund in cities not divided into school districts, under 
the provisions of an amendment to section 1714 of the Political Code, 
was increased to a sum not to exceed 80 cents for each child in average 
12084°—xp 1915—vor 1——33 513

    514 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
daily attendance. The effect will be to increase the number of sup- 
plementary books in the elementary schools. 
Connecticut—The following increases in appropriations for the 
two fiscal years ending September 30, 1917, over those for the same 
purposes for the preceding biennium were made by the 1915 general 
assembly: For school libraries, $20,000, increased from $18,000; for 
public libraries, $20,000, from $19,000; for the public library com- 
mittee, $8,000, from $6,500. 
Iitinois.—A bill was passed at the 1915 session increasing the maxi- 
mum tax rate for public library purposes in incorporated cities hav- 
ing up to 100,000 inhabitants to 2 mills on the dollar annually, from 
1% mills. (S. B. 114.) Cities with a population of over 100,000 
may not levy a tax to exceed 1 mill on the dollar annually; their pre- 
vious limit was 6 cents on $100. 
With reference to this new law, the librarian of the Chicago Public 
Library is quoted as follows: 
Our tax rate has been increased from six-tenths to one mill, which will net 
us about $200,000 more than we have been receiving. This assures us resources 
for considerable extension of our work during the coming calendar year, when 
the first installment will be available. * * * The law is a general State law 
which gives at the same time to cities outside of Chicago a possible increase 
of 663 per cent revenue, subject to the local aldermanic approval. 
A county library bill was introduced in the 1915 legislature, but 
failed of passage. ; 
Indiana.—A. library bill designed to codify the library laws of 
Indiana, approved by both the Indiana Library Association and the 
Indiana Library Trustees’ Association, was introduced in both houses 
at the 1915 legislative session. It passed the house, but failed to be 
favorably reported by the senate committee. A new bill was drawn 
up comprising those sections of the first bill which provided for 
county libraries and greater freedom in township extension. This 
new bill passed the senate, but failed in the house owing to the rush 
of business in the last few days of the session. 
Iowa.—The public-library law relating to the number of library 
trustees was amended by the general assembly: of 1915, so as to make 
the number 5, 7, or 9 at the option of the city council, to be fixed by 
ordinance. Previously, 9 was the only number permitted. 
An increase of $4,000 was made in the biennial appropriation for 
the Iowa library commission. The appropriation for the commis- 
sion made by the general assembly of 1913 was $7,600. 
Kansas.—The maximum tax rate for establishment and mainte- 
nance of free public libraries in cities having less than 40,000 popu- 
lation was raised from four-tenths of 1 mill to a half mill on the 
dollar by the Kansas Legislature of 1915. The limit for a public- 
library levy in cities having over 40,000 population continues to be
-P-A-G-E-535

one-fourth mill, as provided in section 1 of chapter 80, laws of 
1913. 
The appropriation for purchase of traveling-library books was 
increased from $2,000 to $3,000 per year. 
Maine—The annual appropriation for regular traveling libraries 
was increased from $2,500 to $3,500, and $1,000 was also appro- 
priated annually for the years 1915 and 1916 for the purchase of 
special traveling libraries for circulation among high schools located 
in those cities and towns having no public libraries. 
Massachusetis.—A Massachusetts act of 1915 authorizes the board 
of free public-library commissioners to determine by examination, or 
by such rules as.it may establish, the selection and appointment of 
supervising librarians and all other library workers who are paid, 
under the authority of the board, from the treasury of the Common- 
wealth. 
The trustees of the Massachusetts State library were allowed 
$5,000 for the purpose of continuing work on the card catalogue for 
public use. 
Minnesota.—The appropriation for public-school library aid in 
Minnesota was reduced in 1915 from $31,500 to $25,000 per year. 
Missouri—The appropriation for the Missouri library commission 
for the biennial period 1915-16 was increased to $15,430 from $14,200, 
which was the 1914-15 allowance. 
A bill was introduced in the legislature of 1915 providing for the 
establishment and maintenance of county libraries throughout Mis- 
souri; This bill was practically identical with the California county- 
library law and was introduced for the purpose of arousing discus- 
sion before the next legislative session, its immediate passage not 
being expected. 
Montana—The Montana Legislature of 1915 enacted a county- 
library law, of which the most prominent features are as follows: 
Upon petition signed by not less than 20 per cent of the qualified 
voters of a county, at least one-half of whom shall reside outside of 
the county seat, the county commissioners may establish at the 
county seat a county free library. Any incorporated city or town 
in the county may withdraw and cease to participate in the benefits 
of such county free library. The county free library shall be under 
the general supervision of the board of county commissioners, who 
may appoint as county librarian any person who is a graduate of a 
library school or who has had one year’s practical experience in 
library work. 
The board of county commissioners may annually levy a special 
tax, not to exceed 1 mill on the dollar, for the purpose of maintain- 
ing the county free library. School libraries may be maintained as 
a part of the county free library. Instead of establishing a separate 
   
-P-A-G-E-536
  516 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
county library, the board of county commissioners may enter into a 
contract with the free public library of any incorporated city or 
town to assume the functions of a county free library. 
Nebraska—The biennial appropriation for the Nebraska State 
library commission for 1915-1917 contained an addition of $900, 
making the total-$16,900. 
New Jersey—The annual appropriation for the New Jersey public 
library commission, which in 1914 was $13,400, was increased to 
$16,000 by the legislature of 1915.-On November 1, 1914, in ac- 
cordance with legislative enactment, the commission formally took 
over from the department of public instruction the supervision of 
‘school libraries and the control of the State school library funds. 
New York.—The New York Legislature of 1914 provided that 
district school libraries shall be free for public circulation in all 
districts where there are no regular free public libraries. 
The appropriation for the aid of local public libraries was in- 
creased at the 1915 legislative session from $35,000 to $37,000 for 
1915-16. 
An act to exempt from taxation the property of free libraries in 
the State was vetoed by the governor May 25, 1915. 
North Carolina—The General Assembly of North Carolina, at its 
1915 session, established a legislative reference library as a depart- 
ment of the North Carolina historical commission, with an annual 
appropriation of $5,000. 
The biennial appropriation for the equipment and operation of 
traveling libraries by the North Carolina library commission was 
in 1915 increased to $4,000 from the previous $3,000, as made in 1913. 
North Dakota—The State public library commission of North 
Dakota was in 1915 abolished by legislative enactment and its func- 
tions transferred to the newly created State board of regents. 
Oregon.—Chapter 346, general laws of Oregon, 1915, authorizes 
any county in the State to assess, levy, and collect a special tax, not 
to exceed 14 mills on the dollar, for the purpose of erecting a central 
public-library building upon a site approved by the county and con- 
veyed to such county by any person, firm, corporation, or city, 
school district, or union high-school district. 
Ohio.—An important law supplementing the county library law 
of Ohio was passed by the General Assembly of 1915. It provides 
for the establishment, maintenance, care, management, and control 
of a county library in counties where a library has been bestowed on 
the county by either gift or bequest. 
Pennsylvania.—The appropriation for the support of the Penn- 
sylvania free library commission for the biennial period 1915-1917 
was reduced to $24,000 from $31,000, which was the allowance for
-P-A-G-E-537
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 514% 
the preceding two years. This reduction necessitates considerable 
retrenchment in the work of the commission. 
The legislative act relating to free public nonsectarian libraries 
and branch libraries within the State and their maintenance, in- 
cluding taxation for their support, etc., was vetoed by the governor. 
The measure was described as a codification of existing laws relating 
to free public libraries, and raised the minimum tax rate to 1 mill 
per annum. Since this would have largely increased the library 
budgets of municipalities, the bill was vigorously opposed by the 
cities of the State. 
South Dakota.—An act of 1915 (ch. 195) amends paragraph 5 of 
section 5, chapter 217, Laws of South Dakota for 1913, which pre- 
scribed that the State free library commission should annually desig- 
nate a list of books from which the county library boards should 
select books for the school libraries. As amended, this paragraph 
now makes it a duty of the commission “to render upon request 
assistance to county superintendents and to county library boards in 
selecting books for school libraries.” 
The legal number of members of a board of public library trustees, 
which was fixed at three by chapter 217, Laws of 1918, is enlarged to 
five, two of whom must be women, by chapter 195, laws of 1915. 
The biennial appropriation for the free library commission for 
1915-1917 was made $4,000 per year, an increase of $1,000 per year 
over the previous allowance. 
Texas.—An act providing for the establishment of county free 
libraries was passed by the Texas Legislature at its 1915 session 
(general laws, 1915, ch. 117). The following is a synopsis of the 
main provisions of the law: 
Four ways are provided by which library privileges may be se- 
cured: (1) A separate county free library may be established at the 
county seat; (2) any incorporated city or town maintaining a library 
may become a part of the county free library system; (3) a county 
free library of one county may extend its privileges to another county 
that has no county library; (4) a free public library of any incor- 
porated town or city may assume the functions of a county library. 
When petitioned so to do by 25 per cent or more of the qualified 
voters of that part of a county which is to be affected, the commis- 
sioners’ court shall order an election. If a two-thirds vote in this 
election is favorable, the commissioners’ court shall proceed to estab- 
lish and provide for the maintenance of a county free library. Under 
methods 2, 8, and 4 above, the commissioners’ court of any and all 
counties, and all library boards, are authorized to enter into contracts, 
deciding upon their own terms. 
A tax not to exceed 6 mills on the $100 valuation must be levied 
upon all property outside of incorporated cities and towns maintain-  
-P-A-G-E-538
  518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
ing free public libraries, and upon all property within incorporated 
cities and towns which have elected to become a part of such county 
free library system. 
In the million-dollar appropriation bill for Texas rural schools 
there is a clause requiring that each school receiving aid from this 
appropriation shall be provided with “such library, books, maps, and 
globes as recommended in the State course of study.” 
Added appropriations in 1915 are $1,500 for a legislative reference 
librarian and $500 for conducting legislative work. 
Utah.—Chapter 109 of the laws of Utah, 1915, provides: 
The State board of education shall also promote the establishment of libraries 
and gymnasiums throughout the State, and shall have power to appoint a 
secretary, who shall work under the direction of the State superintendent of 
public instruction. 
West Virginia.—Chapter 64 of the Laws of West Virginia, 1915, 
authorizes incorporated cities and towns, and also counties and 
school districts, to establish public libraries and reading rooms sup- 
ported by taxation, and to appoint library boards for their manage- 
ment. 
Washington.—By an act of 1915 the Legislature of the State of 
Washington extended the operation of its public library law to cities 
of the fourth class, or incorporated towns. (Ch. 12, laws of 1915.) 
Wisconsin.—The appropriation for the general work of the Wis- 
consin free library commission was reduced by the 1915 legislature 
from $34,085 to $32,000. 
Wyoming.—The Legislature of Wyoming, in chapter 24 of its 
session laws of 1915, raised the maximum limit of the annual county 
library tax which a board of county commissioners is authorized to 
levy to one-half of 1 mill on the dollar, from the previous limit of 
one-fourth mill. 
PUBLIC-LIBRARY EXTENSION. 
The following is a summary by States of the number of public 
libraries established and of public library buildings erected during 
the past year, so far as reported to the Bureau of Education:

COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEMS. 
Montana and Texas enacted county-library laws at their 1915 
legislative sessions, and, while arrangements have not yet been com- 
pleted in either State for establishing libraries, seven counties in 
Montana are already circulating petitions under the new act. The 
West Virginia Legislature passed a law authorizing municipalities, 
under which term counties are included, to establish and maintain 
public libraries. In other States already having appropriate legis- 
lation the organization of new county libraries continued during the 
year, with especially marked gains in California and Wyoming, 
where county extension now prevails in a majority of the counties. 
Notable progress was also made in Oregon.t 
General laws under which counties may establish and maintain 
libraries, or contract for county service with libraries already exist- 
ing, are now in force in 16 States. These States, with the year of 
enactment, are: California (1909); Iowa (1913); Louisiana, for 
parish libraries (1910); Maryland (1898); Minnesota (1905); Mis- 
souri (1909) ; Montana (1915) ; Nebraska (1911) ; New York (1911) ; 
Ohio (1898); Oregon (1911); Texas (1915); Washington (1901) ; 
West Virginia (1915); Wisconsin (1901); Wyoming (1899). In 6 
of these 16 States county libraries organized under State-wide legis- 
lation are in operation, the number in each case being as follows: 
California, 33; Minnesota, 9; Ohio, 6; Oregon, 5; Washington, 1; 
Wyoming, 14. A seventh State is Wisconsin, with 15 county travel- 
ing library systems, organized under its county library law. 
The county free-library system has been more widely extended in 
California than in any other State. By October 1, 1915, the system 
had been adopted by 33 out of the 58 counties in the State, namely, 
Alameda, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Humboldt, 
Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Lassen, Los Angeles, Madera, Merced, 
Modoc, Monterey, Plumas, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, 
San Diego, San Joaquin, San Luis-Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Bar- 
bara, Santa Clara, Siskiyou, Solano, Stanislaus, Tulare, Ventura, 
Yolo. The total number of county free libraries in operation in 
California grew from 22 on July 1, 1914, to 26 on June 30, 1915, 
  
1The prospect for the passage of a law permitting the establishment of county libraries 
in Indiana is considered good, and similar laws are proposed in Illinois, Pennsylvania, 
South Carolina, and other States.
-P-A-G-E-540
  520 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
and by October 1, 1915, the number had increased to 30, with 3 
others established and soon to be opened. Of the total area in the 
State of 158,297 square miles, the equivalent of 104,958 square miles is 
now covered by the county system, and 1,601,887 of the 2,877,549 per- 
sons in the State are within reach of the service. The California 
county library is also coming into closer touch with the people 
through the multiplication of its branches. On July 1, 1914, there 
were 752 branches in connection with the county free libraries, and 
on June 30, 1915, there were 1,226 branches. The people of counties 
that have adopted the county free-library service are enthusiastic 
over its effectiveness. 
The California State library at Sacramento assists in the county 
free library work by supplying advice and encouragement, and by 
freely lending its books to the county libraries. A county free 
library organizer is sent out to explain the law to those desiring in- 
formation regarding it. On January 1, 1915, a school library organ- 
izer was also added to the staff, whose duty is to explain to school 
superintendents and trustees, teachers, and any one else interested, 
the benefits a school district receives by joining the county free 
library. 
The Iowa law provides that a town, township, school corporation, 
or county may contract with a public library in a near-by town for 
the free use of its books. County extension is not in operation, but 
14'town and city libraries are at present lending books to one or more 
outside towns or townships, which in turn contribute to the support 
of these libraries by means of tax levies. 
There are no libraries in Maryland organized under its general 
county library law, but at Hagerstown, in that State, is located the 
Washington County free library, established by a special legislative 
act in 1901, and receiving support from both city and county. The ~ 
Frederick County free library, which was opened in 1914 at Fred- 
erick, Md., is not supported by public funds. 
The nine county libraries now in operation in Minnesota are 
located in Anoka, Clay, Hennepin, Itasca, Lake, Meeker, Olmstead, 
Steele, and Washington Counties. 
Nothing has yet been. accomplished under the provisions of the 
county library law of New York State. The principal difficulty in 
the way of arranging for county library service under this general 
law seems to arise from its requirement that the property of any city 
or town now maintaining a library be taxed a second time if a con- 
tract for the outside districts is made. This obstacle was found in- 
superable ix. « recent test case ‘in Broome County, where county serv- 
ice from the city library of Binghamton was desired. A remedy 
may possibly be found in so unending the law as to exempt from
-P-A-G-E-541
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 521 
taxation for this purpose all property already paying a library tax, 
as is done in California, Nebraska, and other States. 
In addition to the six county libraries in Ohio organized under 
general enactment, located in Erie, Green, Paulding, Richland, Ross, 
and Van Wert Counties, there is the Hamilton County library at 
Cincinnati, established under a special law of 1898 applying to only 
two counties in the State—Hamilton and Cuyahoga. 
In Oregon the county library system has been adopted by five 
counties—Multnomah, Wasco, Hood River, Umatilla, and Klamath. 
Many other counties are considering the system, which is recom- 
mended by the Oregon State library as the best method of making 
books available to the rural population. 
The library of Thurston County is the only county library at 
present reported from the State of Washington. 
In Wyoming, out of a total of 21 counties, county libraries are 
located at the county seats of 14, namely, Albany, Big Horn, Carbon, 
Converse, Fremont, Johnson, Laramie, Natrona, Park, Platte, Sheri- 
dan, Sweetwater, Uinta, and Weston Counties. Five of these libraries 
send out boxes of books in the form of traveling libraries to rural 
districts. 2 
Indiana has no modern law under which county libraries may be 
established and operated. At Indianapolis is the Marion County 
library, organized under an old act of 1852, according ‘to which it 
may receive not more than $75 from the county annually. The 
public library of Bedford accords its privileges to the citizens of 
Lawrence. County, which contributes to the support of the library. 
At Evansville is an old county library, rarely used, belonging to 
Vanderburg County. No one of these libraries does extension work. 
Rural extension of libraries in Indiana, in recent years, has been 
effected chiefly through the township as a unit. Of the 1,017 town- 
ships in Indiana 91 now enjoy library privileges extended by 86 
libraries. In view of the fact that less than 10 per cent of the rural 
inhabitants of Indiana have free access to a public library, a vigorous 
movement is now under way looking to further extension of libraries 
by means of the township plan, as well as by the passage of a law 
permitting the establishment of county libraries wherever desired 
in the State. 
In North Carolina four libraries are serving the rural inhabitants 
of their respective counties, which in turn are giving the libraries 
financial aid. These four libraries are the public library of Salis- 
bury, Rowan County; the Good Will Free Library of Ledger, 
Mitchell County; the public library of Durham, Durham County; 
and the public library of Greensboro, Guilford County. The last- 
named county has appropriated $1,250 for one year toward the sup-
-P-A-G-E-542
    522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
port of the Greensboro public library, in order that the full priv- 
ileges of the library may be extended to all white citizens of the 
county. In addition to loans made directly from the library in 
Greensboro, six regular stations have been established in the county. 
This is the greatest advance in rural library extension so far made 
by any county in North Carolina. 
Attention in this chapter has so far been directed to county libra- 
ries which receive financial support or aid, either by taxation or 
appropriation, from their respective counties. In addition to li- 
braries of this class, there are also city and town libraries that are 
free to the inhabitants of the respective counties, though having no 
official recognition from the county government. 
The Warren County library at Monmouth, IIl., receives no tax 
support from the county, but different portions of it appropriate 
sums in order to obtain library privileges. It is the only county 
library in the State, and is an endowed institution. 
The Willard Library at Evansville, Ind., is an endowed library, 
supported by the income from invested funds and a small appropria- 
tion from the Evansville city council. According to the terms of 
the endowment, it is free to the residents of Vanderburg County. 
No library has yet been organized in Missouri under the provi- 
sions of the county library law. The Jewett Norris Library, of 
Trenton, is an endowed institution, free to the residents of Grundy 
County, in which it is located. 
In New York State are two endowed libraries, not under county 
management nor receiving county support, but which by the terms of 
their charters are free to the residents of their counties. These are 
the library of the Cornell Library Association, in Ithaca, Tompkins 
County, and the Wadsworth Library, in Geneseo, Livingston 
County. The second of these sends books to delivery stations, 
schools, and clubs in various parts of the county. 
To recapitulate, the county library system is officially recognized 
in the United States by a total of 91 counties, which either maintain 
county libraries or contract with city or town libraries to render 
county service. These 91 counties are distributed as follows: Cali- 
fornia, 33; Indiana, 2; Maryland, 1; Minnesota, 9; North Carolina, 
4; Ohio, 7; Oregon, 5; Washington, 1; Wisconsin, 15 (traveling li- 
brary systems); Wyoming, 14. In addition to these, the residents 
of a certain number of counties situated in various States are al- 
lowed the free use of city or town libraries located in their counties, 
without contributing to the support of these libraries.

  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 523 
STATE-WIDE USE OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES. 
The university library naturally has its part to perform in 
realizing the new conception of the function of a State university, 
that it is to serve the people of the entire State. The first duty of 
a university library is to the university community, but without in- 
terfering with its obligations to its immediate constituency, the 
library has many opportunities to serve the people of the State at 
large by lending books, pamphlets, and periodicals; by compiling 
bibliographies, and by supplying information which may be obtained 
from publications on file in the library or from specialists in the 
university faculty. This service is regularly rendered by the library 
in close cooperation with the extension division of the university. 
In States having no library commissions, as Montana, Oklahoma, 
and Wyoming, the State university library properly exercises some 
of the functions usually belonging to a State library commission, 
such as assistance in organizing public libraries, the provision of - 
traveling libraries, etc. It may be remarked here that care needs 
to be taken to coordinate the extension work of the State university 
library with the activities of the State library commission, or State 
library, in cases where one or both of the latter exist alongside of 
the former. 
The requests from citizens at large for assistance from the State 
university library are steadily increasing in volume in a number of 
States, and if the service is to keep pace with the demand, more 
books and an enlarged library staff will be required. Some typical 
examples of wider service rendered by State university libraries 
during the past year are presented in the following brief reports: 
University of California—tn every way possible, the library of 
the University of California endeavors to meet the needs of serious 
individual workers throughout the State of California. Books are 
not loaned directly to individuals, but through the local library. 
During 1914-15 the library made 189 loans, comprising 387 volumes, 
many of which were sent to libraries in Nevada, Washington, Oregon, 
New Mexico, and Texas. The borrowing library is required to pay 
transportation charges both ways, and is usually allowed to retain 
the loan for 30 days. The University of California library also 
undertakes to answer inquiries, supplies reference lists, and some- 
times sends copies of brief extracts, all without charge. The library 
is free for reference, and there is a constantly increasing use of it for 
this purpose by residents of San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley. 
Indiana University—The Indiana University library sends out, 
as interlibrary loans, any nonperiodical material requested, provided 
it is not needed for class use. Such books may be kept for two weeks, 
the borrower paying transportation charges both ways. Brief bibli-
-P-A-G-E-544
  524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
ographies are prepared on request. The use of the library by bor- 
rowers throughout the State is increasing steadily. 
University of Minnesota—The library of the University of Minne- 
sota makes every effort to serve the citizens of the State, outside of 
the university community, so far as this can be done with justice to 
its local constituency. Many requests for information and assistance 
are received both by mail and telephone. The library usually lends 
its books through the borrower’s home library, but if this method is 
impracticable, will lend directly to individuals of certified reliability. 
The volume of this outside work is large and constantly increasing. 
University of Montana.—The library of the University of Mon- 
tana gives free help to communities in organizing the county libra- 
ries provided for by the new State library law of 1915. 
As a part of the State educational system, the university library is 
glad to extend all possible assistance to the high schools of Montana. 
Under reasonable regulations, books and pamphlets are loaned upon 
request, and where this can not be done, reference lists or suggestions 
regarding sources of information are supplied. 
The university library is forming, in a tentative way, a series of 
package libraries on civic, political, and social subjects, to which ad- 
ditions will be made as rapidly as possible. As at present con- 
stituted, these libraries consist mainly of clippings from metropoli- 
tan newspapers. Magazines containing related material are in some 
cases lent by the university. Borrowers pay the postage on these 
package libraries. 
-The University of Montana library also cooperates, with the 
bureau of public information of the extension division of the univer- 
sity. 
University of North Carolina.—The library of the University of 
North Carolina serves the State in three ways: (1) By preparing 
reference lists and bibliographies for inquirers; (2) by giving, 
through letter, answers to specific questions; and (3) by loaning 
books and pamphlets from its collection and bulletins prepared by the 
bureau of extension of the university. 
Books and pamphlets are loaned for use in special studies and in- 
vestigation, as for debating purposes, and may be kept for three 
weeks. No charge is made for any of this service, except that the 
postage on the packages is paid by the borrower. 
The service during the year 1914-15 comprised the sending of 1,045 
letters and 1,196 books and pamphlets. The librarian of the uni- 
versity reports that no service which the library has rendered has been 
more fruitful, and certainly none has been more genuinely appre- 
ciated. 
University of North Dakota—The University of North Dakota 
library is not only filling the regular demands made upon it by the
-P-A-G-E-545
      LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 525 
university community, but is daily meeting specific and real needs 
of the people out in the State. During the year 1914-15 the library 
served directly 147 towns in the State; 312 requests were received, 
in response to which 987 books, periodicals, and pamphlets were sent 
out, in addition to many bibliographies and letters. A comparison 
with earlier statistics of this work shows a marked increase in 1914-15 
over previous years. The correspondence on file shows that the uni- 
versity library serves in this way bankers, business men, editors, 
lawyers, librarians, ministers, school superintendents, school prin- 
cipals, teachers, and high-school students. 
The library is officially recognized by the university authorities as 
a very definite and essential part of the extension organization of the 
institution, in that it acts as a bureau of general information, sends 
out books, pamphlets, periodicals, and documents, compiles bibliog- 
raphies, and refers the inquiries it receives demanding expert and 
technical knowledge to the proper men on the faculty. 
University of Oklahoma.—The University of Oklahoma sends out 
rural traveling libraries which supplement the bulletins of the uni- 
versity extension division, on the various subjects treated by them. 
In order to make these collections of value to the entire community, 
many other topics have been added; covering a wide range of infor- 
mation and interest. These libraries are 45 in number, containing 12 
to 15 books each, and are lent free of charge to any community or 
rural school for a period not exceeding four weeks. 
University of Oregon.—During the year ending September 30, 
1915, the University of Oregon library sent by parcel post to persons 
outside of Eugene 473 packages of books, pamphlets, and periodicals. 
Of these packages, 186 were sent to schools and teachers, 73 to public 
libraries, 71 to ministers, and 31 to students. The library will send 
to any responsible citizen any books that can be spared, to be kept for 
one month, the borrower paying transportation charges both ways. 
A special effort was made to serve the ministers of the State. Inter- 
denominational conferences of ministers are held at the university 
each summer, and the resources of the library are brought to the at- 
tention of those in attendance. Monthly lists of books added to the 
library are mailed to persons requesting them. 
Duplicate copies of text editions of some of the English classics 
were loaned to a number of schools. 
The library staff also does its best to answer inquiries from any 
persons wishing information of various kinds that can be briefly 
given, and for this purpose keeps in close touch with the members of 
the university faculty.

  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
University of Tewas—The people of Texas are calling on the 
State university library more and more each year for the loan of 
books. The university is supplying schools and clubs throughout 
the State with materials for papers, discussions, and debates. 
A resident of Austin, or of any part of the State, may enjoy the 
privilege of regularly drawing books from the University of Texas 
library by making a deposit of $5 with the university auditor. 
This amount is returned to the borrower upon his surrender of the 
privilege of using the library. 
University of Utah—Citizens of Utah in general may use -the 
library at any time for reference, and may borrow books which can 
be spared, provided the book desired is not to be found in the local 
public library. Borrowers pay the transportation charges both ways. 
University of Washington—tThe library of the University of 
Washington lends individual books to anyone in the State, if the 
book requested is available for circulation and is not needed immedi- 
ately in the university. Books are lent through the local library if 
practicable, or if not, directly to the individual. No guaranty is 
required. 
From August 1, 1914, to August 1, 1915, outside loans from the 
University of Washington library amounted to 452 books and 458 
pamphlets and magazine articles. 
During the same period the bureau of debate and discussion of the 
extension division of the university sent out 22,084 items, including 
pamphlets, magazine articles, and books. Some of these were in 
packages containing a number of items upon the same subject; others 
were individual loans. Additional statistics are as follows: Number 
of packages sent out, 1,184; number of centers served, 202; number 
of subjects covered, 149; bibliographies prepared, 6. 
University of Wisconsin.—Speaking of the university library and 
the State historical library, the librarian of the University of Wis- 
consin says, in his report to the board of regents for the biennial 
period ending June 30, 1914, page 317: 
Both libraries are especially glad to be of service to the college and public 
libraries of Wisconsin, and these libraries apply to us frequently for the loan 
of books and for bibliographical assistance. The university library and the 
State historical library cooperate freely with the department of debating and 
public discussion of the university extension division and with the Wisconsin 
free library commission in this matter of loans to libraries and schools in 
the State. Our feeling is that where books, not in immediate demand, can be 
of service to residents of the State outside of Madison, it is in accord with 
the general policy and aim of the university to make them available. 
University of Wyoming.—The library of the University of Wyo- 
ming lends books, when consistent with the regular needs of the uni- 
versity, merely on prepayment of express charges. Questions on
-P-A-G-E-547
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 527 
historical, economic, literary, scientific, technical, or practical sub- 
jects are answered freely. 
Traveling libraries containing 20 to 25 volumes are sent by the 
University of Wyoming library to any part of the State free of cost 
except for transportation charges. The list of books in each library 
covers a variety of subjects—fiction, history, biography, science, 
travel, and children’s literature. These collections circulate in every 
part of the State and are transported by any convenient method— 
parcel post, horseback, stage, automobile, wagon, freight, or express. 
The libraries are very popular and the demand for them exceeds the 
supply of books and boxes. 
LIBRARY SERVICE TO IMMIGRANTS. 
The public library continues to be an important adjunct in the 
work of Americanizing the foreign-born population settled in great 
numbers in many parts of the country, especially in the large cities. 
Standard reading matter in their own languages is also supplied to 
the mature immigrants who can not be expected to gain a command 
of English. This service is rendered both by the State libraries and 
library commissions, and by city and other local libraries. There is 
a growing recognition of the importance of this work, and its scope 
is being extended and its efliciency increased by the adoption of im- 
proved methods and equipment. Some of the more notable ex- 
amples of library work for foreigners during the past year are the 
following: 
The Massachusetts free public library commission has a director 
in charge of work with foreigners. Last year 83 traveling libraries 
in 17 foreign languages and in simple English were sent to 56 towns 
in the State. Nineteen lists in nine foreign languages were prepared 
for 12 towns expecting to purchase books for their foreign popula- 
tion. The director spoke at nine meetings and made 24 visits to 
libraries in furthering the work with foreigners. Many local libra- 
rians have cheerfully assumed the additional burden of work involved 
in providing books for foreigners, and satisfactory results from the 
work are reported in nearly all cases. In addition to their strictly 
professional services, one librarian was instrumental in securing 
funds to start an evening class in English for Polish mill operatives, 
and another librarian started a club for Greek girls, with activities 
in both social and industrial lines. 
The Connecticut public library committee reports that during 
1913-14 five traveling libraries in Italian, Polish, Hungarian, and 
French were loaned seven times, with a total circulation of 527. In 
57 libraries in the State, books representing 14 modern languages are 
available.  
-P-A-G-E-548
  528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The Minnesota public library commission circulates traveling 
libraries in Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Polish, and Swed- 
ish. Occasional requests are received for Italian and Dutch books. 
The needs of foreign readers in Minnesota are receiving increased 
local attention, especially from the libraries on the Iron Range, where 
there is great demand for books in many languages. These libraries 
are cooperating in this work through an exchange of books and in 
preparation of lists. One library in this region, in addition to 
supplying books in foreign languages, prepared a list of books in 
simple English for new Americans. A Bohemian library association 
was organized at Hopkins to place Bohemian books in the public 
library. 
In Nebraska the State library commission sends out traveling 
libraries in German and in Bohemian, and foreign books are also 
supplied by many public libraries. 
The Wisconsin free library commission sends out to libraries and 
elsewhere groups of books in various languages—German, Nor- 
wegian, Swedish, Bohemian, Danish, Polish, Finnish, Italian, 
Yiddish. 
The California State Library is undertaking to meet the needs of 
the State for foreign books, which are loaned through the county 
free libraries. Books are supplied in French, German, Portuguese, 
Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Swedish. 
The Boston Public Library has recently acquired collections of 
books in Polish, Swedish, Yiddish, and Italian, the Yiddish and 
Italian collections being principally translations from English works 
adapted to the needs of the North End branch. The foreign popu- 
lation is served chiefly through the branches. One branch custodian 
reported that more than 12 different races were represented in the 
new borrowers of the year. There is a strong demand for readers 
for foreigners and for books in easy English for use by the 
immigrants. 
The foreign department of the Providence Public Library, which 
is in charge of a special custodian, contains 6,742 volumes. In this 
collection 19 foreign languages are represented, some far more fully 
than others. There are also 131 volumes in English, for the most 
part manuals intended to teach a foreign reader the language, cus- 
toms, government, etc., of the United States. The circulation in this 
single department was 14,195, while in addition 571 volumes in for- 
eign languages were circulated from the branches, deliveries, ete. A 
series of lectures for foreigners was given in the library building 
under the direction of the immigrant educational bureau. 
During 1914 the circulation department of the New York Public 
Library issued 649,727 volumes in foreign languages. The languages 
represented, arranged in a list according to the volume of circulation 
 
-P-A-G-E-549

in each, decreasing in order from the largest number of volumes to the 
least, were as follows: German, Yiddish, Russian, Hungarian, French, 
Italian, Bohemian, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish, Roumanian, Swedish, 
Modern Greek. Besides the languages just named, there was con- 
tained in the total number of volumes reported a minor group of 12 
additional modern languages. 
The Buffalo, N. Y., Public Library emphasizes the use of the 
library by the immigrant population as a most important service 
which it is able to render the community in the constructive work to- 
ward better citizenship. The branch libraries in Buffalo come into 
contact with people from most of the European countries, many of 
whom do not speak or read English. The two largest groups are 
from Poland and Italy. Last year the library issued two small hand- 
books entitled “ Books for Poles in America,” and “ Books for Ital- 
ians in America,” which call attention to the public library and give 
brief lists of appropriate books. The fact that it was necessary to 
increase the stock of Polish and Italian books is an indication of 
the extent of their use. 
Branch 4 of the free public library of Newark, N. J., is its “ for- 
eign branch.” Here the library has books in the languages of the 
many foreign people who live in that part of the city—German, Yid- 
dish, Polish, Russian, Ruthenian, and Italian. This branch library 
numbers 10,000 volumes, and made last year 170,651 loans. 
The Carnegie Library of Homestead, Pa., maintains an educa- 
tional department which offers instruction in mechanical drawing, 
common and higher branches, and English for foreigners. The 
foreign-English class was attended in 1914 by 55 students. The 
library circulated Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Italian, French, Ger- 
man, and Lithuanian books among the foreign employees of the 
Homestead steel works. The library building also contains a music 
hall, club rooms, a gymnasium, and baths. 
A “free library ” was started in 1912 in the home of Mrs. Paul 
Kreuzpointner, at Altoona, Pa., beginning with 10 books in the 
summer kitchen of the house and 4 members. The location is in a 
section of the city inhabited by workingmen, many of whom are 
foreigners. The library was popular from the first, and its mem- 
bership has now increased to over 500. Supplementing the original 
library there are now five branches—a Polish branch, an Italian 
branch, a Negro branch, a Broad Avenue branch, and a small branch 
for messenger boys at the Western Union Telegraph: office. The 
Polish and Italian branches contain books in Polish and in Italian 
as well as in English. The total number of volumes in use is 1,764. 
Funds for the library are chiefly derived from the membership dues 
of 25 cents per year of the Altoona free library association, which has 
12034°—up 1915—vor 1——34

120 members. Donations of books and magazines are also received 
from various sources. 
The Cleveland, Ohio, Public Library endeavors to provide good 
books for adult immigrants from other than English-speaking coun- 
tries in the appropriate languages. These books include general 
reading, together with works on American history, biography, and 
institutions, preparation for naturalization and citizenship, and the 
study of English. The collection now has books in 22 languages other 
than English, is very largely used, and is reported by the librarian to 
be entirely inadequate for the growing demand. The foreign division 
of the library has charge of this material and also attends to the books 
in English for foreigners, which include textbooks, readers, books on 
civics, and a collection of easy and interesting books for reading and 
study. 
At the Chicago Public Library, in order that readers of books in 
foreign languages might have the same privileges of inspection and 
examination as those enjoyed by patrons of the open shelves, a num- 
ber of alcoves were set aside last year for the accommodation of 
groups of books in the various continental European tongues to the 
number of some 15,000 volumes. It was impossible to transfer the 
entire foreign collection to the new quarters, but a division was made 
by placing the most recent works on the new shelves in what is now 
called the foreign room and leaving the older works in their former 
location in the stacks. Thus, about one-fifth of all the German books, 
comprising the accessions of the past 10 years, were sent to the new 
room, and relatively similar allotments of French, Bohemian, Polish, 
and Scandinavian books were included. In other languages, with 
smaller collections, it was possible to find room for all the books. 
In this latter division are the books in Italian, Spanish, Russian, 
Yiddish, Lettish, Lithuanian, Hungarian, and Dutch. The estab- 
lishment of this open-shelf book room has doubled the library’s pre- 
vious circulation of books in foreign languages. 
Of periodicals in foreign languages, the St. Louis Public Library 
receives 65 German, 24 French, 6 Polish, 20 Bohemian, 3 Danish, 5 
Hungarian, 8 Italian, 5 Spanish, 3 Croatian, 11 Yiddish, and 1 each 
in Arabic, Swedish, Lithuanian, and Russian. The branches report 
extensive use of their books by foreign readers during the past year. 
The Crunden branch has a very good Yiddish collection, and a 
demand for Italian books has made itself felt. The foreign issue at 
the Soulard branch amounted to 29 per cent of the total annual circu- 
lation. Of the 13 languages issued, the largest use was in German, 
Bohemian, and Hungarian. During the year purchases were made 
in Servian, Croatian, Slovak, modern Greek, and Ruthenian, and the 
services of the foreign papers, the clergy, and men prominent in 
 
-P-A-G-E-551

various activities were enlisted in giving publicity to this branch of 
the work. 
Work with foreigners on the Pacific coast presents problems some- 
what different from those arising in the East or Middle West. The 
Seattle Public Library bases its ministrations to these people on in- 
formation obtained by a survey of their numbers, their neighbor- 
hoods, their clubs, their newspapers, and their special activities. 
The chief nationalities represented in the foreign population of 
Seattle were found to be Greek, Italians, Croatians, Japanese, Scan- 
dinavians, and Germans. The knowledge gained in the preliminary 
survey was of great assistance to the library in selecting books for 
these people, and in acquainting them with the English language 
and American institutions. In many cases the library staff came 
into very close personal touch with the foreign pupils in the city 
night schools through the cooperation of their teachers. 
LIBRARY EXHIBITS AT THE PANAMA-PACIFIC EXPOSITION. 
Libraries and their services to the community were well repre- 
sented at the Panama-Pacific Exposition by various exhibits, of 
which the following were especially noteworthy: 
In the Palace of Education a comprehensive display made by the 
American library association illustrated many lines of library activ- 
ity by means of photographs, plans, publications, blanks, forms, etc. 
The principal headings under which this material was arranged were 
as follows: 
1. Library work with children, including relations of public 
library and school, and school libraries. 
2. Public libraries—their civic and social services, including mu- 
nicipal reference and provision for blind and other special classes; 
their art and music work, and aid to industry, exemplified by two 
typical cities, Los Angeles and Cleveland. 
3. Service of library commissions, State libraries, and county 
libraries, to the rural population, by means of traveling libraries and 
other forms of extension. 
4. Special libraries, including business, factory, engineering, and 
legislative reference libraries; college and university libraries. 
5. Library publicity, by means of motion pictures, newspaper arti- 
cles, reading lists, circulars, bulletins, etc. 
6. Technique of library work. 
7. Professional training for library work. 
The California State library and California library association 
joined their exhibits with those of the American Library Association, 
the most conspicuous California display being a map of the State 
40 feet square, showing the present condition of its county library

system. Moving pictures of library work in the State were also 
shown in the hall of the California school exhibit. 
The exhibit of the United States Bureau of Education included a 
set of its own publications, a 6-foot shelf of books for a home reading 
course, a rural school library for California, and a representative 
collection of American college annuals; also statistical charts show- 
ing recent library progress in the United States and the advantages 
of county libraries. 
Rare books, manuscripts, maps, and newspapers relating to the 
early history of the Pacific coast and of Spanish America were im- 
portant features of the Library of Congress exhibit, located in the 
Palace of Liberal Arts. Other noteworthy parts of the exhibit came 
from the catalogue division of the library, the card section, and the 
divisions of bibliography and music. Statistical charts of American 
library progress were also shown. 
Among the State exhibits in the Palace of Education, that of 
Wisconsin gave especial prominence to school libraries. It included 
photographs of typical high-school and rural-school library rooms 
in various parts of the State, and charts containing school library 
laws and statistics. A typical rural-school library of about 200 vol- 
umes was another feature. A public library survey of Oshkosh 
showed the distribution of adult and child borrowers by means of 
black and red tacks, respectively, each tack standing for a house. 
The Oregon school exhibit in the Palace of Education included 
charts showing the work of the Oregon State library and of school 
libraries in the State. 
New York displayed a relief map of the State showing the location 
of its various educational institutions, including the public libra- 
ries, by means of small, different-colored electric lamps. 
In the California State building were a number of special exhibits 
of free county libraries, including those of Contra Costa, Solano, 
and Yolo Counties. 
Moving pictures and lantern slides of libraries were shown in the 
Massachusetts building. The Missouri building contained a special 
library of Missouri authors. 
The exhibit of the library of the Philippine Islands, Manila, in 
the Philippine Islands building, consisted of about 1,300 volumes 
covering the history of the islands from 1585 to 1785. In addition 
there was a collection of more recent literature relating to the islands 
and about 100 volumes illustrating the work of the native book- 
binder.

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-seventh annual meeting of the American Library Asso- 
ciation was held at Berkeley, Cal., June 3-9, 1915. Out of a total 
registry of 750 persons two-thirds were in attendance at each of the 
general sessions, and the special meetings also were well attended, 
notwithstanding the difficulties of location and the counterattrac- 
tion of the Panama-Pacific Exposition. The presiding officer of the 
conference was Hiller C. Wellman, librarian of the Springfield 
(Mass.) Public Library, president of the association for 1914-15. 
His presidential address reviewed the development of library work 
into the manifold features of to-day, and raised the question whether 
all of these were properly within the province of the library. Papers 
were presented by Henry W. Kent, secretary of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, on “The book,” and by T. M. Cleland, of New York, 
on “The fine art of printing.” Everett R. Perry, librarian of the 
Los Angeles Public Library, spoke on “ Bulletins and library print- 
ing.” The address of Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, en- 
titled “Per contra,” stated and reviewed the arguments against cer- 
tain tendencies of the modern library, answering the objections 
effectively. R. R. Bowker, of New York, addressed the conference 
on “The function of the public library,” which he said must be re- 
sponsive to and measured by the needs of its community environ- 
ment. “New features in library architecture,” illustrated by lantern 
slides, was presented by Chalmers Hadley, librarian of the Denver 
Public Library. In a paper on “The child in the school and in the 
library,” Willis H. Kerr, librarian of the Kansas State Normal 
School at Emporia, maintained that the library should do nothing 
that can be done by the school, but is a no less important factor in 
education. George F. Bowerman, librarian of the Public Library of 
the District of Columbia, discussed “How far should the library 
aid the peace movement and similar propaganda ?” 
The various sections of the association and the affiliated organiza- 
tions also held proceedings which were interesting and well attended. 
Among them was the recently established school libraries section, 
which discussed various problems of school library management 
and listened to reports of progress. 
The officers elected for 1915-16 were as follows: President, Mary 
W. Plummer, director Library School of the New York Public 
Library; first vice president, Walter L. Brown, librarian of Public 
Library, Buffalo, N. Y.; second vice president, Chalmers Hadley, 
librarian of Public Library, Denver, Colo.

  534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, LIBRARY DEPARTMENT. 
The departmental congress on libraries of the fifty-third annual 
convention of the National Education Association and Third Inter- 
national Congress on Education, met at Oakland, Cal., August 24, 
1915, with Harriet A. Wood, of Portland, Oreg., in the chair. The 
proceedings brought out many facts regarding library procedure 
in elementary, high, and normal schools, which were stimulating and 
helpful to those in attendance. Reports were made by departmental 
committees on rural- school libraries, elementary - school libraries, 
high-school libraries, and normal-school libraries, and by the Na- 
tional Education Association and American Library Association 
committees on standardization of the course of study in library in- 
struction in normal schools. These reports showed encouraging 
progress during the past year. Ella S. Morgan, librarian of Lin- 
coln High School, Los Angeles, Cal., presented a paper on “ High- 
School Library Progress in California,” in which she compared con- 
ditions in 1903, when the first high school librarian was appointed, 
with those of the present day. During this period 70,997 volumes in 
143 high schools have increased to more than 340,000 volumes in 255 
schools, with a corresponding improvement in equipment and meth- 
ods of administration. There are now 338 high-school libraries in 
California which have trained librarians. At the evening session 
Edward O. Sisson, commissioner of education for Idaho, spoke on 
“Books and Education,” and Bernard C. Steiner, librarian of the 
Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore, Md., read a paper on “The 
Library as a Continuation School.” John D. Wolcott, of the United 
States Bureau of Education library, gave a survey, illustrated with 
stereopticon slides, of progressive high-school libraries in the United 
States. 
An exhibit illustrating the equipment and operation of high- 
school libraries, with special reference to California conditions, occu- 
pied a room in the Oakland municipal auditorium during the con- 
vention of the National Education Association and attracted much 
attention from those interested in the subject. In addition to photo- 
graphs, plans, pictures, forms, pamphlets, etc., the exhibit comprised 
a collection of handsome editions of standard books suitable for 
inclusion in school libraries. 
SOUTHERN CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY. 
A significant organized movement for better high-school libraries 
in the South was inaugurated by the library conference at the meet- 
ing of the Southern Conference for Education and Industry at 
Chattanooga, Tenn., in April, 1915. This consisted in the appoint- 
ment of a committee on high-school libraries, of which C. C. Certain,
-P-A-G-E-555
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 535 
of the Central High School, Birmingham, Ala., is chairman, and 
J. L. McBrien, school extension agent in the Bureau of Education, 
secretary. The general membership of the committee is divided into 
two sections dealing with city and rural high schools, respectively, 
each section consisting of representatives for various groups of 
Southern States. A plan of work was mapped out for the committee 
to follow during the coming year. 
OTHER MEETINGS. 
The Twenty Seventh Educational Conference of the Academies and 
High Schools in Relation with the University of Chicago was held 
April 16, 1915, with “The relation of the organized library to the 
school” as the central theme for discussion. About 1,000 teachers 
were in attendance. The program was prepared under the direction 
of the librarian of the University School of Education, Miss Irene 
Warren. A large number of prominent librarians from the Missis- 
sippi valley participated in the conference, among whom were 
Arthur E. Bostwick, W. D. Johnston, Henry E. Legler, Carl B. 
Roden, George B. Utley, M. S. Dudgeon, Samuel H. Ranck, Mary J. 
Booth, and May Massee. 
A library conference under the auspices of the Wisconsin free 
library commission was held at Madison, Wis., July 22-30, 1915. 
“The librarian and the book” was the central theme of the con- 
ference, which was attended by 175 persons, representing 14 States, 
including one or more delegates each from 49 Wisconsin libraries. 
Many librarians of prominence in the Middle West took part in the 
program, and keen interest was manifested in the discussion of the 
various topics presented. 
RECENT-BOOKS ON LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION AND TECHNIQUE. 
A number of notable books appeared during 1914-15, dealing with 
library administration and history, and library science and tech- 
nique, from which the following may be selected for special mention: 
The County Library. The Pioneer County Library (the Brum- 
back Library of Van Wert County, Ohio), and the County Library 
Movement in the United States, by Saida Brumback Antrim and 
Ernest Irving Antrim, with an introduction by P. P. Claxton.

  536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
This book presents a plan for educational reorganization which 
Prof. Cubberley has worked out in the form of a school code and 
constitution for a hypothetical State called Osceola. The plan rec- 
ognizes the library as an important adjunct of the school, and under- 
takes to bring the librarian and teacher into cooperation. It makes 
the State library one of the branches or bureaus of the State depart- 
ment of education. The county is made the unit of school adminis- 
tration, with central schoolhouses as centers of the community life, 
not only for teaching but also provided with an auditorium and a 
branch library in each. All such schools outside of incorporated 
cities are to come under the single control of a county board of edu- 
cation. The library of the county also is to be under the control of 
this county board of education, which will appoint a county libra- 
rian, to be certified by the State and nominated by the county superin- 
tendent of education. There are to be branch librarians, who also 
must hold State certificates in library work. One county library is 
to be established in each county, and in each community center a 
branch library containing a duplicate card catalogue of the entire 
county collection, so that the branches may borrow books from the 
county library at the county seat and through it from the State 
library. The school libraries are made part of the county library 
system, and the purchase and distribution of all their books is in- 
trusted to the county library, which in turn is controlled by the 
county board of education. In cities the library is placed under the 
city board of education, according to the system now in vogue in a 
few American cities. There is thus throughout in this school sys- 
tem of the State of Osceola a very close coordination of library and 
school. The board of supervisors, school trustees, and so-called 
political officials are eliminated from educational affairs by the plan. 
The author presents this outline as a good scheme for securing effec- 
tive organization and states that its successful operation would de- 
pend upon the character and ability of the men intrusted with its 
management. 
Among the new publications issued by the American Library As- 
sociation publishing board were the following chapters of its Manual 
of Library Economy: 
Chap. 38. State libraries, by J. I. Wyer, jr. 
Chap. 7. High-school libraries, by Gilbert O. Ward. 
Chap. 8. Special libraries, by Richard H. Johnston. 
Chap. 16. Book selection, by Elva L. Bascom. 
Chap. 23. Government documents (city and State), by J. I. Wyer, jr. 
The board also published a supplement, 1900-1910, to the A. L. A. 
Index to general literature, and a revised and enlarged edition of 
Theresa M. Hitchler’s “ Cataloging for small libraries.”

CHAPTER XXII. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 
By Paut MARSHALL REA, 
Secretary of the American Association of Museums; Director of the Charleston (8. 0.) 
Museum. 
ConTENTS.—Introduction—Bxtension work of public museums of science—Extension work 
of public museums of art—College museums—Museum work of secondary schools— 
Museums of history—United States National Museum—New York State Museum— 
Independence Hall, Philadelphia—Conclusion. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Visits to museums in all parts of the United States, the discussions 
of the American Association of Museums at its San Francisco meet- 
ing, and the returns made to the Bureau of Education unite in 
conveying a strong impression of increasing interest throughout the 
country in the educational work of museums. This interest is mani- 
fested (1) by the enthusiasm with which leading museum workers 
discuss the educational side of their work; (2) by the considerable 
number of museums reporting a recent beginning in educational 
extension work; and (3) by the apologetic tone of many reports from 
museums that are not doing any of this work. 
It can be stated confidently that the educational and extension 
work of museums is a permanent addition to education and in no 
sense a fad. It is not a formal system to be readily outgrown, but an 
idea capable of the most varied and flexible application to the chang- 
ing needs of times and places. It has won recognition and appre- 
ciation by its results, and has been so large a factor in the growth 
and general financial support of the museums adopting it that their 
continued development of it is assured. 
Of much importance for a wider dissemination of information 
regarding this new relation between museums and schools is the 
recent publication, as a bulletin of the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation,’ of a paper on “The Educational Museum of the St. Louis 
Public Schools” by Carl G. Rathmann. This profusely illustrated 
account of a remarkable and conspicuously successful teaching mu- 
seum fills the need for an exposition of the traveling exhibit idea   
1 Bulletin, 1914, No. 48, 539

and should stimulate closer relations between schools and museums 
throughout the country. 
In previous reports the work of particular museums has been 
cited to illustrate the general principles and tendencies of the edu- 
cational and extension work of museums. In this chapter it seems 
desirable to enumerate briefly the activities of a larger number of 
museums as an indication of their variety and extent. Space forbids 
any attempt to make this list complete. Selection has been made to 
include museums of a wide range in size and resources and to rep- 
resent the various geographical areas of the country. 
In a previous report’ it has been shown that the public museums 
have been the pioneers in developing the sense of responsibility to 
the people, which is the mainspring of all extension work. The pres- 
ent activities of this class of museums will therefore be reviewed 
first. The term public museum is applied to those museums receiv- 
ing their maintenance largely or wholly from public funds or from 
endowments and private gifts that are not restricted to special inter- 
ests. For convenience of reference and comparison the science mu- 
seums and art museums are treated separately. College museums 
and history museums also form natural groups with special charac- 
teristics. 
EXTENSION WORK OF PUBLIC MUSEUMS OF SCIENCE. 
The American Museum of Natural History in New York reports 
1,300,000 school children reached by- its extension work in a single 
year. 
In addition to the traveling exhibits and the lectures on geog- 
raphy, history, and science given at the museum to between 40,000 
and 50,000 children, three local lecture centers have been established 
in selected schools. In two of these the lectures were given in school 
hours as a part of the school work. In these three centers 20,000 
children attended the lectures, and the year’s total is expected to 
reach 50,000. 
For the first time in its history the museum’s series of more than 
30,000 lantern slides have been placed at the disposal of public- 
school teachers for use in the classroom. These slides are available 
separately or in groups or in lecture sets, accompanied by full 
descriptions, and are delivered and collected by museum messengers. 
The museum maintains 635 traveling exhibits, comprising more 
than 10,000 specimens, which are in daily use among more than 400 
schools having more than 1,000,000 pupils.

  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 541 
Cooperation with the public libraries is receiving particular atten- 
tion. Several special traveling exhibits were sent to the children’s 
rooms in the libraries for the purpose of stimulating the reading of 
good books relating to the subjects illustrated by the specimens. 
The success of the experiment is strikingly illustrated in « branch 
library on the lower west side. An Eskimo exhibit in this library 
was followed in less than four weeks by an increase in the call for 
arctic books from 0 to 400, and other branch libraries had to be 
called upon to supply the demand. Extension of this work is under 
way. 
The interesting work with the blind, conducted by the American 
Museum, was described in this report last year.t 
The New York Botanical Garden began in 1905 to utilize its 
advantages in correlation with the nature-study work of the public 
schools in New York City. The classes assemble from the various 
schools of the Bronx in charge of their teachers, and the audiences 
number from 450 to 850. After the lecture the pupils are divided 
into convenient groups, each under the guidance of a lecturer or 
demonstrator, and the topics treated in the lecture are further illus- 
trated and enforced by a study of the museum collections and of 
the living plants in the greenhouses and out of doors in the forest 
and plantations. These lectures and demonstrations give pupils in 
the crowded city a close contact with nature and a breadth of view 
and inspiration such as could never be obtained in the more restricted 
conditions of the classroom. The total attendance at these lectures 
was approximately 115,000. 
Special lectures and demonstrations are provided for the meetings 
of societies, clubs, and other organizations, some of which are closely 
associated with the work of the schools. Throughout the year the 
garden is visited by biology classes from schools and colleges in New 
York City and vicinity, and members of the staff are specially 
detailed to conduct such classes or other visitors through the grounds. 
Regular public lectures on botanical subjects are given every Sat- 
urday afternoon from April to November and are attended by many 
school children. Many of the publications, the Jowrnal in particular, 
have contained articles of interest to public school children, some of 
which were written by the children themselves in competition for 
prizes offered by the garden. 
The Public Museum of the Staten Island Association of Arts and 
Sciences gives Friday afternoon lectures from October to March for 
children above the 4 B grade. In April, 1915, the Bird Lovers’ 
Club conducted in the museum a bird-house contest among school 
children. In all 232 bird houses were constructed, of which 127   
1Rep. Commis. Educ., 1914, Vol. I, ch. 28, pp. 506-507.
-P-A-G-E-562
  542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
were brought to the museum. Of these 24 received prizes and 12 
were given honorable mention. Four hundred and fifty visitors 
came during the first nine days of the display for the express pur- 
pose of viewing the houses, and about 50 houses were sold to the 
public. Significant of the interest aroused and the skill developed is 
the fact that several of the highest prizes were won by pupils who 
had never taken any kind of shopwork in the schools. 
The Children’s Museum of Boston has shown a steady growth 
during its second year. Lectures for private and parochial schools 
are now given in addition to those for the public schools. During 
July and August children from the settlement houses occupy all the 
time of one assistant. For the year ending September, 1915, 297 
lectures were given to classes containing 11,000 pupils. The total 
museum attendance for the year 1914 was 63,000. The museum has 
been incorporated and is administered by a board of nine trustees. 
An advisory council, a teachers’ council, and a museum aid associa- 
tion are closely affiliated with the trustees and render important aid 
in the development of the museum. 
The Fairbanks Museum of Natural Science, St. Johnsbury, Vt., 
arranges its educational work in cooperation with the superintendent 
and teachers of the public schools. Special nature lessons are given 
monthly in grades 3 to 9, inclusive. The 19 town classes, with about 
500 students, have regularly appointed lessons at the museum; the 11 
- rural schools, with 150 students, at their own school buildings. Dur- 
ing the past year progress has been made in correlating the nature 
study with drawing and English composition. Field classes and bird 
study are conducted through the spring, and a flower table is main- 
tained during the spring and summer. Requests for the identifica- 
tion of flowers, minerals, etc., are given prompt attention and infor- 
mation is frequently supplied on special topics. 
The Park Museum, Providence, R. I., has developed a novel method 
of focusing the interest of children visiting the museum in groups 
of 50 to 100. This is done by what is called a “museum game.” Each 
child is given a card bearing a puzzle sentence about some object in 
the museum. These sentences are carefully chosen to convey some 
fact of interest and information, and the children are asked to com- 
plete the sentence. A typical card may read as follows: “A 
is a large animal with a Roman nose.” As soon as a child reports a 
question correctly to the official in charge he is given another card. 
At the end of the allotted period all the children are gathered in the 
lecture room. This method is found to remove all problems of dis- 
cipline, the children going steadily about, absorbed in their search 
for information. In the lecture room they become reporters of the 
facts they have gleaned and show a keen interest in what their com-   
 
-P-A-G-E-563
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS, _ 543 
rades have learned and in what the instructor has to tell them. The 
curator reports the advantages of this plan as follows: 
(a) From the child’s point of view: 
1. He has received a lesson in independent research, concentration, obser- 
vation, and memory. 
2. His interest in natural science is stimulated. 
8. The museum has become a storehouse of knowledge to him rather than 
something intangible. 
4, The spirit of rivalry and enjoyment in the game, as such, makes its own 
peculiar appeal to the children and arouses great enthusiasm. 
(b) From the museum’s point of view: 
1. The children have received one or more definite impressions of the mu- 
seum exhibits rather than a confused jumble of ideas. 
2. The children have been stimulated to come again and actually do come 
often in groups of two or three to the office with a request to “play 
the game” by themselves. 
38. The problem of disciplining an ordinarily boisterous crowd has been 
eliminated because the mind of each individual is occupied along a par- 
ticular line, and excellent order is actually maintained by the boys 
and girls themselves. 5 
The Museum of Natural History, Springfield, Mass., is visited by 
teachers with their classes from Springfield and neighboring towns 
for a general survey of the collections and to hold actual teaching 
exercises. A classroom and illustrative material is provided. Col- 
lections of minerals, rocks, and birds are loaned to the schools or 
given permanently. Prizes have been offered by the museum for 
the best collections of minerals and insects. A very convenient 
check list of bird migrations is published by the museum. A chil- 
dren’s table is provided with special exhibits, frequently changed, 
and with books borrowed from the children’s room of the city 
library. 
The Newark Museum Association, in New Jersey, has from its in- 
ception been fundamentally an educational museum. That is to say, 
its preservation of things valuable only or chiefly for their rarity 
has always been incidental to its purpose of getting, showing, explain- 
ing, and lending things calculated to enlarge the knowledge and the 
interest of the people within its influence. 
The museum, indeed, grew out of the similar mission of the library 
which founded it. The library lends not only books, but magazines, 
newspaper cuttings, pictures, charts, poems, and it early began to 
keep and to lend rocks, birds, butterflies, physiographic models, and 
industrial collections. Some of these things have been taken over by 
the museum, others are still lent by the library. 
Each year, besides numerous other exhibits, the museum has one 
considerable exhibit covering a fundamental human industry. Last 
year the subject was pottery; this year it is to be textiles. Processes 
 
-P-A-G-E-564
544 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
in operation and steps of processes in sequence are shown, and an 
active docentry makes the exhibit a live teaching agency. Last year 
over 2,000 children came in classes and a number of clubs in groups 
for this instruction from Newark and neighboring cities, including 
Pratt, Teachers College, and other schools of New York. 
Tn conjunction with these exhibits pamphlets are issued, and from 
the exhibits are gathered materials not only for a permanent exhibi- 
tion in the museum, but for circulation in the schools. The school 
teachers, having visited the larger exhibition, are thus better able to 
deal with the traveling exhibits. 
The Charleston Museum, in South Carolina, maintains a depart- 
ment of public instruction in charge of a curator. The museum is 
formally affiliated with the board of school commissioners, and the 
relations with the public schools are arranged in detail by conference 
between the curator of public instruction and the superintendent of 
schools and the supervisor of primary work. 
The nature study in the primary grades is based upon the use of 
traveling exhibits from the museum and upon a manual prepared by 
the curator of public instruction. Economic and industrial exhibits 
are regularly used in the sixth and seventh grades in connection with 
geography. Over 70 different traveling exhibits are in regular use 
and are delivered by wagon provided by the museum. They remain 
one week in each school and are then transferred to the next school. 
Exhibits which have finished the public-school schedule are started 
on a similar schedule among private schools in the city. Requests for 
the use of the exhibits are received in increasing numbers from schools 
in other parts of the State, and these are granted in so far as they do 
not conflict with regular schedules within the city. 
In addition to the traveling exhibits the museum offers the follow- 
ing facilities to schools: (1) Docent service in the exhibition hall; 
(2) lectures on particular exhibits; (8) special lectures at the museum 
in illustration of subjects pursued in the schools; (4) the use of a 
classroom and specimens for teachers with classes; (5) special ex- . 
hibits of educational value from time to time; (6) a reading room 
supplied with popular nature-study literature adapted to the needs of 
both teachers and pupils and in charge of a trained librarian; (7) 
copies of the Charleston nature-study course furnished to teachers on 
request; (8) lectures to primary-school teachers supplementary to the 
nature-study work in the schools. 
The museum conducts a natural-history society, having three sec- 
tions, one for boys, one for girls, and one for adults, each of which 
meets in the museum once a month. Field trips for each section are 
conducted by the curator of public instruction. 
The Cincinnati Society of Natural History maintains a museum 
and circulates seven sets of school cabinets, each set consisting of one
-P-A-G-E-565
  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS, 545 
case each of birds, insects, and minerals. Each case is accompanied 
by a monograph descriptive of its contents.. These sets are started 
out about October 1 of each year and remain a month at each school, 
thus reaching about 63 schools in the course of the academic year. 
The society also provides a course of illustrated lectures on Saturday 
nights, which are open to the public without charge. 
The Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences conducts an extensive edu- 
cational work in close cooperation with the school authorities, as de- 
scribed in a previous report.t. Traveling exhibits are sent to the 
schools, and grammar-school classes also come to the museum on a 
regular schedule for lectures and demonstrations, which are an ofli- 
cial part of the school curriculum. On Friday evenings from No- 
vember to May free public lectures are given to audiences averaging 
800 to 900 people. 
The Chicago Academy of Sciences offers the following special fea- 
tures: (1) A large series of habitat groups, (2) the constant use of 
the celestial sphere by schools, (3) a children’s science library, and 
(4) a story hour conducted by the librarian. The habitat groups 
show the animals of the Chicago area in their natural surroundings 
and form very beautiful and instructive exhibits, which appeal 
strongly to all visitors. The celestial sphere is a mechanical device 
for the study of the heavenly bodies. 
The Milwaukee Public Museum maintains an extensive educational 
work, which has been fully described in the proceedings of the Ameri- 
can Association of Museums.” 
The Educational Museum of the St. Louis Public Schools is a model 
of its kind. Space forbids an account of its work, since it has been 
mentioned in a previous report® and is fully described in a recent 
bulletin issued by the Bureau of Education.* 
The California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, is planning to 
organize educational and extension work as soon as it is installed in 
its new building now nearing completion. Dr. Barton W. Ever- 
mann, who was appointed director of the museum March 15, 1914, 
says in his first report: “The one thing that impresses one most in 
the study of eastern museums is their activity along educational lines, 
and the ways in which they are endeavoring to interest the public, 
and to be of service to the public.” Dr. Evermann then emphasizes 
the importance of a carefully thought-out method of cooperation 
between the museum and the public and private schools. It is prob- 
able that the first extension activity will be the circulation of natural 
history exhibits among the schools.

    546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
* The Oakland Public Musewm, California, inaugurated a definite 
policy of educational work within two months after the opening of 
the museum to the public in October, 1910, by means of lectures to 
classes from the city schools. The excellent exhibit of American 
colonial material was made the basis of lectures on colonial life and 
customs. Teachers were quick to note the advantages of this method 
of teaching history and brought many classes to the lectures. Other 
lectures on history and natural history, closely correlated with the 
course of study in the public schools, have been added from time to 
time. The lecturer also visits the schools to give talks illustrated by 
museum specimens. 
A second method of extension work is by several series of loan 
material which are in almost constant use by the schools. A con- 
tinuous exhibit of fresh wild flowers is of much interest to gardeners 
and park men as well as to the general public. Although one of the 
youngest museums on the Pacific coast, the Oakland Public Museum 
seems to be the pioneer in organized educational and extension work 
in this section. 
The Museum of History, Science, and Art, Los Angeles, Cal., 
reports that it is working in close relation with the University of 
Southern California and the Manual Arts High School and is organ- 
izing a system of educational work with the public schools, modeled 
upon that of the Milwaukee Public Museum. 
EXTENSION WORK OF PUBLIC MUSEUMS OF ART. 
The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, maintains extensive educational 
work which is summarized by the director, Dr. Arthur Fairbanks, 
as follows: 
The work with schools is twofold: (1) Lectures and lecture courses for 
teachers, to train them to deal intelligently and sympathetically with works of 
art in their teaching, and (2) trained guidance for groups of children who are 
brought from various schools to the museum. In practice it has been related 
to four lines of school work, viz., history, geography, and ancient languages, as 
well as drawing and design. Hach of these subjects has been frequently treated 
in lectures for teachers. Lists of objects in the museum which illustrate the 
school work in these lines are furnished free to teachers, and the city of Boston 
furnishes various series of illustrations from objects in the museum for use by 
pupils in the schools. Groups of pupils are sent to the museum with or without 
a teacher and receive guidance (docent service) from a member of the staff. 
The museum instructor meets younger children; older children are met either 
by her or by a member of the department which they desire to visit. 
The extension work consists partly of courses given primarily for museum 
school students,.but open to the public, partly of specific extension courses. The 
aim of this work is to deal not with the history of art, but rather with the 
objects of art themselves. In addition to courses of lectures and guidance to 
visitors, there are regular Sunday gallery talks, each on one object or one group 
of objects in the museum; and a series of Thursday conferences and lectures by 
an expert on some objects or group of objects has been given regularly.

  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS, 547 
The Worcester Art Museum, Mass., reports 4,741 photographs and 
lantern slides loaned to 24 schools, 10 churches, and 13 clubs and other 
organizations in 1914-15, as compared with 3,198 in 1913-14. Thirty- 
nine special talks were given to classes from schools, compared with 
16 talks in the previous year, and 23 talks to other organizations, as 
compared with 15 in the previous year. The special work with chil- 
dren described in this report’ last year has been continued. The 
following comment is of interest: 
After four years the deeper and fundamental aim of the work is seen to 
justify itself. Those engaged in it have been enthusiastic about it from the 
start. But even to casual visitors to the museum its effects are sometimes 
strikingly apparent. A concrete instance may serve for illustration: Two boys 
of about 14 years, and plainly from a walk of life not made easy by riches, 
were seen the other day walking about in the galleries quietly and earnestly 
discussing new acquisitions made by the museum since their last visit. It 
was apparent not only that they knew perfectly how to conduct themselves, but 
that they were thoroughly enjoying the paintings in a way not possible to 
either grown-ups or children without some previous instruction in the very 
delicate art of appreciation. The secret is easily explained—the boys had 
formed a habit several years ago of fairly regular attendance at the Saturday 
afternoon stories. Their acquaintance with the collections in this museum is 
real and intimate, and, needless to say, their future visits to other galleries of 
art will be a source of genuine enjoyment to them. ( 
The Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence, maintains both 
an art school and a museum. One of its special purposes is the in- 
struction of artisans in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing 
in order that they may successfully apply the principles of art to 
the requirements of trade and manufactures. A special feature of 
its relation to the schools of Providence is the awarding of scholar- 
ships in the School of Design on the basis of competitions in drawing 
among public-school children. The superintendent of schools has 
arranged a definite schedule to bring classes from all the city schools 
to the public library, the School of Design, the Park Museum, the 
Rhode Island Historical Society, and the statehouse. Under this 
plan 2,244 pupils visited the museum of the School of Design in the 
year 1914-15. 
The Parrish Art Museum, Southampton, Long Island, is an inter- 
esting example of a privately owned museum endeavoring to exert as 
strong an influence as possible in a small community. During the 
past year a docent has been provided to give instruction to public- 
school children and adults. The attendance of children is volun- 
tary, but the classes meet regularly and the attendance hag been 
satisfactory.

  548 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, offers the fol- 
lowing special advantages to New York teachers and pupils: 
(1). Free admission on Mondays and Fridays, which are made 
pay days largely to facilitate students by giving them a greater op- 
portunity for privacy than is possible on free days. School children 
are welcome every day, but the pay days are theirs in a peculiar 
sense. Upon application made beforehand, a ticket is sent to the 
teacher, admitting the teacher and class. 
(2) If a teacher is preparing courses of study to be conducted at 
the museum, members of the staff will gladly advise him concerning 
the objects contained in the collections and aid kim to use the re- 
sources of the museum to the best advantage. An index of the paint- 
ings by subject and an index of the objects illustrating Greek and 
Roman history are obtainable. 
(3) The use of classrooms equipped witn stereopticon lantern, 
chairs, tables, and blackboard for talks given by the teacher to the 
class. Lantern slides may be borrowed, and books and photographs 
from the library may be taken to the classrooms to increase the in- 
terest and effectiveness of the talk. : 
(4) The services of a member of the museum staff to show the 
collections to the class or give them a talk, illustrated by the lantern. 
For this assistance application is made by letter, the day and hour 
of the proposed visit being specified. 
(5) If a teacher can not bring his class to the museum, but can 
find time for a talk in his own schoolroom, arrangements can be made 
for a member of the museum staff to go to the school and render such 
service. 
(6) The use in lectures outside of the museum of over 12,000 lan- 
tern slides owned by the museum of objects both here and elsewhere 
that illustrate the subjects represented in its collections. A set of 
mounted photographs of objects in the collection may also be bor- 
rowed for schoolroom use. 
The Arnot Art Gallery, Elmira, N. Y., which has only been or- 
ganized three or four years, has already developed a system of co- 
operation with the public schools. This work has been done on the 
initiative of the museum but has received the support of the board 
of education, which includes in the school work two visits to the 
art gallery each year by pupils of the sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades. The director of the gallery talks to these classes. The 
gallery has also held a prize exhibition of the work of the children 
in these grades, the material being selected by the director of draw- 
ing in the public schools. Prizes were given for the best water-color 
and pencil or charcoal drawings in the nature-study work in the 
sixth and seventh grades and in still-life charcoal studies in the

eighth grade. The cooperation of the Arnot Art Gallery is ac- 
knowledged in the annual report of the public schools of Elmira. 
The Albright Art Gallery, Buffalo, makes a specialty of art in- 
struction for school children, teachers, societies, clubs, and the general 
public through the medium of docent service. 
The Carnegie Institute, Department of Fine Arts, Pittsburgh, 
provides docent service for individuals or organizations desiring in- 
formation concerning the works shown in the galleries. The children 
of the schools are brought to the institute by their teachers. Twenty- 
six clubs and 64 classes from the schools of Pittsburgh and vicinity — 
availed themselves of this service last year. The museum also con- 
ducts a children’s hour on Saturday mornings at which the volun- 
tary attendance testifies to the enjoyment of the children. 
Toledo Musewm of Art—The varied and extensive educational _ 
work of this vigorous young museum was described in detail in this 
report’ last year, when it was noted that plans were being made for a 
bird-day celebration for the purpose of arousing community interest 
in the beauty and economic value of birds. This bird campaign is 
reported as showing results far exceeding expectations. Not only 
thousands of children but hundreds of grown people were led to 
study and plan for the welfare of useful birds. Three thousand bird 
houses were constructed in the manual training departments of the 
public schools from lumber furnished through the museum. When 
these houses were exhibited in the museum, in March, 11,000 people 
visited the exhibition. The houses were given by the children to the 
city and put in place in the public parks by the Boy Scouts, under the 
direction of expert ornithologists. Bird houses were also placed in 
the school grounds and around the homes of the children. Hundreds 
were purchased at the art museum and placed in private grounds. 
A permanent museum bird club is now organized under the auspices 
of the museum. The similarity of this work to that of the museums . 
of science is a striking illustration of the common purpose which 
underlies museums of all kinds. 
The Minneapolis Institute of Arts opened its beautiful new build- 
ing on January 7, 1915. During the first two months all the children 
in the grade schools were given time off from their school work and 
brought in groups by their teachers to see the institute and the ex- 
hibits. A volunteer worker was stationed in each room to tell the 
children something of the history of the things that they were see- 
ing. These visits took about an hour and a half each and presented 
merely an introductory survey. The children came in groups of 25 
to 30 at one-half hour intervals all day. Since that time the task 
of organizing the work of the institute in its new building has so

fully occupied the attention of the staff that no formal extension 
work has been undertaken. Docent service is provided at certain 
hours, however, and the institute hopes to do much more with school 
children this year. 
The City Art Museum, St. Louis, supplies docents and provides 
lectures and lantern slides upon demand. Circulating collections of 
paintings, with printed descriptions, are sent to the schools of the 
city. Paintings are also sent to the public library. All publications 
of the museum are mailed to the schools. 
Western Gallery of Art, Kansas City—The curator reports that 
the museum has been helpful in many ways to every grade of the 
public and private schools from the kindergarten to the high school, 
as well as to the colleges and universities and other educational in- 
stitutions of Kansas and neighboring States. Docent service is pro- 
~ vided, and every effort is made to assist visitors. Definite correlation 
with the school system has not been effected. 
COLLEGE MUSEUMS, 
The deplorable condition of college museums as a class when the 
Directory of American Museums was prepared in 1910 was described 
in this report two years ago,’ and some of the reasons for this con- 
dition were revealed by an analysis of the history and limitations of 
this class of museums. Extension work for the benefit of the gen- 
eral public can hardly be considered a duty of college museums, but 
it is a question worthy of serious consideration by college author- 
ities whether their museums can not be made to yield a return upon 
the investment they represent by promoting a closer relation between 
the public and the college. 
Prof. Homer R. Dill says that the opening of the’Laysan Island 
cyclorama in the University of Iowa museum drew more than 2,000 
visitors in the first two days and that special excursions from all 
parts of the State are arranged by the railroads with this beautiful 
exhibit as the objective. He believes the great need of the college 
museums to be men capable of building modern picture groups and 
that the possession of such exhibits will be worth many times their 
cost as an advertising feature. To supply men with the necessary 
training Prof. Dill has organized a special course in museum tech- 
nique at the University of Iowa and has assurances that some of the 
many small colleges in Iowa will employ his graduates to develop 
their museums in the manner he advocates. 
It is certain at least that the public museums have set new stand- 
ards of installation and demonstrated the possibilities of extension 
work, and have thus put a new face upon the problem of the college 
museum.

  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS, 551 
The following are typical of the reports received this year from 
college museums. The stimulating influence of the public museums 
is evident in some cases, especially in parts of the country where 
university extension is popular. 
The University Museum at Harvard is used in university courses 
but offers no organized facilities to schools other than a general 
hospitality and a limited guide service. 
The Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, in addition to the regular use 
of the collections to illustrate the work of courses in Harvard Uni- 
versity and in Radcliffe College, circulates among the high schools 
of Massachusetts three sets of slides—one devoted to the monuments 
of ancient Greece, one to the monuments of ancient Rome, and one 
intended to illustrate English history. The set of Greek slides was 
used by 22 high schools and the Roman slides by 26 in the year 
1913-14. These have been in constant use during the winter months 
and the museum hopes later to extend this service considerably. 
The Social Musewm at Harvard attracts the attention of various 
classes of serious students outside the university courses in which it 
is regularly used. Exhibits are loaned to national and international 
congresses and to public bodies for temporary display. A classified 
list of the collections is published in a pamphlet entitled “ The Social 
Museum as an Instrument of Museum Téaching.” 
The Farnsworth Art Museum at Wellesley College contains the 
laboratories and studios in which the regular courses of the art de- 
partment of Wellesley College are conducted. The primary purpose 
of the museum is to provide material for this work. A special 
activity is the maintenance of a training course for museum assist- 
ants. Graduates of this course are now engaged in art-museum work 
in Minneapolis, Chicago, Rochester, Providence, and Boston. 
The Hillyer Art Gallery at Smith College is maintained primarily 
for the art department of the college, but during the past three years 
has been opened to the public on Sunday afternoons, when it has 
more general visitors than on any other day. During the past year 
a series of talks on special exhibitions has been successfully given on 
Sunday afternoons. 
Wesleyan University Museum reports that while there is no sys- 
tematic arrangement for the use of the collections by the schools of 
Middletown and vicinity every encouragement is given to teachers to 
bring their classes to the museum, and in some cases specimens are 
loaned to the teachers. 
The University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania pro- 
vides special talks by the curators either in the exhibition rooms or in 
the auditorium to classes of school children from the grade and high 
schools, and especially to classes made up from clubs and other
-P-A-G-E-572

552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
organizations in the city and from colleges in the vicinity of Phila- 
delphia. 
The School of Mines at the Pennsylvania State College contains an 
extensive collection of minerals and models illustrating the various 
industries of the State and which are used only in the regular work 
of the school. The photographs accompanying the report of the dean 
suggest that this material might be of the greatest value in extension 
work. 
The Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan reports the 
extension work as growing slowly. It consists in the loan of collec- 
tions of Michigan animals to schools, the identification of specimens, 
and the supplying of information on biological subjects to the people 
of the State, and the giving of extension lectures. An effort is made 
to impress upon the residents of Michigan the importance of the 
museum as a central repository for Michigan zoological material. 
The success of this work is indicated by the number of requests for 
information, the increasing demand for the school collections, the 
cooperation of amateur naturalists, the increased appropriations 
allowed by the regents, and the gifts of money received from private 
sources each. year. 
The Classical Museum at the University of Illinois reports that 
in addition to the use of the museum in regular university courses it 
is visited by classes in ancient history and classics in the high 
schools of Champaign and Urbana. 
The Museum of European Culture at the University of Illinois, 
which was described more particularly in this report’ last year, has 
grown both in the extent of its collections and in the number of 
visitors and seems to be successfully fulfilling the purposes for 
which it was organized. 
The Bennett Museum of Christian Archeology at the Garrett 
Biblical Institute, Evanston, Ill., is used in connection with a course 
on Christjan archeology in the College of Liberal Arts of North- 
western University. It is used also in connection with courses in 
ancient history in Northwestern University, Northwestern Acad- 
emy, and the Evanston High School. 
The Museum of the Department of Fine Arts at Indiana Univer- 
sity comprises collections selected with direct reference to the uni- 
versity courses in painting, sculpture, drawing, architecture, and 
engraving. During the past three years the museum has successfully 
loaned traveling exhibits of pictures throughout the State. This 
work has become so important that it is now administered under 
the extension department of the university, but remains in charge of

Prof. Alfred M. Brooks, who is head of the department of fine’arts 
and who has created the museum during the past 17 years. 
The Museum of Birds and Mammals at the University of Kansas 
is successfully circulating traveling exhibits among the public schools 
of the State. 
The State Musewm at the University of Nebraska distributes 
geological and mineralogical specimens to the accredited high schools 
of the State. Delegations of pupils, commercial clubs, etc., from 
various towns in the State visit the museum. Last year a lecturer 
was appointed, and the work is expected to be considerably enlarged 
this year. The museum provides special material and places labora- 
tories at the disposal of visiting teachers with their classes, who often 
spend an entire afternoon in this work. The art departments in col- 
leges and high schools are also supplied with specimens to be used 
as models in drawing. 
The University of Colorado Museum encourages teachers and 
students of the grade and high schools to visit the museum and use 
its collections. The curator frequently lectures before scientific and 
other societies, teachers’ institutes, etc. Lantern slides relating to 
the museum exhibits are loaned upon request. An increasing num- 
ber of requests for information and for the identification of speci- 
mens is received each year. 
The University of Arizona Musewm is maintaining very little 
extension work at the present time, but plans formulated by the 
present curator form so admirable a program that they may be 
briefly stated as follows: 
(1) To classify and arrange the collections so that they may be 
readily understood. 
(2) To arrange visiting days for classes from the elementary 
schools within reach of the museum. 
(3) To give university courses in archeology and to give exten- 
sion courses in Tucson and neighboring towns. 
(4) To give popular illustrated lectures at the university and 
throughout the State on the archeology of North America and 
especially of Arizona. 
(5) To circulate throughout the State representative collections 
of Arizona birds, insects, and minerals and of prehistoric life and 
modern Indian life in Arizona and surrounding States. 
The University of Oregon has heretofore had no regular museum, 
but reports the recent establishment of a geological museura and the 
intention of working toward a large university museum for all de- 
partments in the future. Small sets of minerals and rocks are 
already being sent to various schools, which retain them for a period 
of about one month. There seems to be an admirable opportunity
-P-A-G-E-574
  554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
for the museum in connection with the general extension work of thi 
university. ’ MUSEUM WORK OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Several secondary schools report unusually good museums and 
show a keen appreciation of their educational value. Among these 
may be mentioned especially the Joliet Township High School in 
Illinois, which maintains a museum occupying at present five or six 
rather large rooms. The material is used in classes in geography, 
history, biology, zoology, and English composition. Occasionally 
some of it is sent to the elementary schools on the request of the 
principal or teachers. The superintendent says:     
   
                      
    
     
    
   
   
           We have already planned in our next building venture to have an entire 
building, three stories, with 12 rooms given over entirely to the museum with 
a view to making its value as an educational factor more pronounced. 
* * * We are much inclined to think that too little attention has been 
given to this phase of educational work, and when we see what is done in this 
particular in the city of St. Louis we wish that our position could be as for- 
tunate as theirs. 
MUSEUMS OF HISTORY. 
About 25 per cent of all museums in the United States are devoted 
to history. They are maintained for the most part by historical 
societies, and, although they would make a strong popular appeal 
if properly supported and administered, they are usually inactive 
and neglected. 
Public museums in many instances devote a part of their attention 
to history, especially to the installation of period rooms and to ex- 
tension work. Their influence seems to be discernible already in an 
awakening of some of the smaller history museums. The field of 
history as a museum subject may be expected to develop rapidly 
when the right methods are generally adopted. 
There is a small group of history museums which have adequate 
resources and progressive methods. Among them may be mentioned 
the museums of the Essex Institute at Salem, Mass., the Buffalo His- 
torical Society, the Chicago Historical Society, and the Ohio Arch- 
zological and Historical Society. 
The Chicago Historical Society allied itself directly with the edu- 
cational forces of the city in 1913 by establishing children’s lectures 
on Chicago history, conforming to the course of study in the public 
schools. The society considers this one of the most important activi- 
ties it has ever undertaken. In the beginning the lecturer was sent to 
the school, but after a brief trial period all lectures have been given 
in the society’s rooms, where the children are surrounded by th 
actual objects of the museum. 
Among the smaller institutions, one of the best known to the write! 
is the museum of the Nantucket Historical Society in Massachusetts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-575
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS, 555 
Others which show at least a desire to develop their educational 
influence are the Fitchburg (Mass.) Historical Society, the Mont- 
gomery County (Pa.) Historical Society, and the Whiteside County 
(I1l.) Historical Society. 
Although the secretary of the State Historical Society of North 
Dakota is very modest in his report of the educational activities of 
the society, its publications indicate that, in addition to preserving 
historic sites, publishing historical material, maintaining a library and 
museum, and conducting field explorations, the society is maintaining 
lecture work among schools and communities throughout the State. 
It would be difficult to outline a more valuable program of historical 
work, and it is to be hoped that the society may be successful in its 
purpose of arousing interest in history throughout the State, as well 
as in preserving historical records. 
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 
Although the United States National Museum is not in a position 
to conduct any of the usual forms of extension work, it has con- 
tributed in no small way through a long period of years to the up- 
building of museums throughout the country. It has done this by 
distributing among schools and colleges educational series of speci- 
mens. The extent of the service thus rendered by the National 
Museum is too little known and appreciated. 
NEW YORK STATE MUSEUM, 
No better illustration of the changing sentiment regarding the 
relation of museums to the public can be found than the section on 
“The Educational Function of the State Museum of Science” in the 
report of the director of the New York State Museum. After call- 
ing attention to the fact that “the good repute of the New York 
State Museum has come more from the work of original research 
which it has fostered than from the educational service thus far ren- 
dered through its collections,” the director continues: 
At no time in the history of the organization has there been an adequate 
museum ; not once in all its career have the people been able to come into actual 
touch with the materials on which the published scientific works have been 
founded or to learn through their own eyes the real meaning of the resources 
and of the operations of nature which have been portrayed on the thousands of 
pages and plates of our public reports. 
The fact that this time has now arrived, that capacious quarters are about to 
be fully equipped for the reception of the material objects of science, brings, 
in effect, a new function to this division—that of making an efficacious and im- 
pressive contribution to the education of the people into these sources of knowl- 
edge in a building devoted throughout to the official diffusion of knowledge.

  556 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
In the science of paleontology, a science of which the State of New York has 
for years been the especial patron, this fact is preeminently true. The museum 
resources herein are large, but of this large accumulation there is only a small 
part that can be made to tell its fascinating story to the uninitiated. To con- 
sider for a moment the demands of this science alone and its place in a museum, 
the people of the State have a right to know what it is all about and why such 
extraordinary encouragement has been given to its prosecution; how it is that 
the State of New York has acquired its repute as the exponent of this science, 
and, if it is true that more is known of the paleontology of this State than of 
any equal area of the world (as has been said by a distinguished French 
geologist), where is the proof of this outside of published.documents. There are 
no mysteries in science and the fruits of this knowledge are the property of the 
people who have paid for it. There is thus laid upon this division the acquisi- 
tion of materials in this field of science that will tell the story of the life in 
the seas and on the lands of ancient New York, its beginning, its development, 
and its outcome, and tell it in a way so lucid and intelligible that the visitor 
to the museum can read it and learn it. No good thing, therefore, that can 
make clearer the wonderful history of life in this part of our ancient earth, and 
so help to enforce the broader lessons of the life from which we have derived 
our own existence, can be sacrificed or neglected for so simply gross a reason 
as that appropriations for this work are inadequate. A scientific specimen in a 
Jaboratory and such a specimen in a museum are of two vastly unlike qualities. 
The. one tells its story to the expert, the other must be made to tell its simple 
and clear story to the larger world. 
Certainly no clearer exposition could be desired of the obligation 
of a great museum to the people who support it, and it is to be hoped 
that the New York State Museum will succeed as completely in 
transforming invertebrate paleontology into a popular museum 
subject as the American Museum has succeeded with vertebrate 
paleontology. 
INDEPENDENCE HALL, PHILADELPHIA, 
Independence Hall began in 1914 to provide docent service and 
lectures for school children, the experiment proving a success from 
the start. The curator talked to 7,000 children ranging in age from 
9 to 18 years. : 
Daily engagements three months ahead have been made with 
schools and colleges in Philadelphia and vicinity for these lectures. 
With the secondary grades the subjects are related to the classroom 
work of each grade. With older children a general review is given 
of the colonies before the war and of the Revolution itself. More 
time is given to industrial history than heretofore.

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. Byaye 
CONCLUSION. 
While the important educational function of museums is now 
generally recognized alike by the leaders in both museum work and 
school work and by the teachers who have come in contact with it, 
it is nevertheless true that— 
(1) As yet only a comparatively small proportion of the museums 
in the country are thoroughly aroused to its possibilities, and these 
chiefly among what are designated in this report as public museums. 
(2) There is a much larger opportunity for educational work 
among the smaller public museums, college museums, and historical- 
society museums than is now appreciated. 
(8) The initiative in this work is usually taken by the museums, 
and school authorities who have not had actual experience with it 
are not thoroughly alive to its advantages. 
(4) Museum facilities are available to schools in various localities 
to a very unequal degree. 
There is clearly need of some agency to stimulate and coordinate 
museum educational work throughout the country and to diffuse a 
‘full knowledge of it among schools and other educational organiza- 
tions. The American Association of Museums is endeavoring to do 
this and has appointed a special commission for museum cooperation 
for this purpose, while the Bureau of Education is performing a 
valuable service in giving publicity to the work, but there is need of 
still more highly organized effort if the facilities which are proving 
so valuable in a few centers are to be made accessible to both town and 
rural schools throughout the country. 
The experimental period is closed. Educational work has been 
done as efficiently by small museums as by great museums, in small 
towns as well as in great cities. Its State-wide extension among 
rural schools has been shown practicable. The need is for systematic 
encouragement of its development.

INTRODUCTION, 
The following account of the educational work of the churches in 
the United States and its dependencies for 1915 is more compre- 
hensive than for last year. It is still, however, incomplete for two 
reasons. First, several of the bodies reporting have not had time 
to collect full statistics. The Methodist Episcopal Church, for 
example, gives an account of its educational work mainly from the 
viewpoint of the Sunday school, preferring to wait until 1916 for 
a more detailed report. A representative of the Protestant Episco- 
pal Church explains in a letter to the bureau that time did not 
permit him to make a formal report. His letter gives some out- 
standing facts concerning the educational work of that church, 
which are included in a section of this chapter. Other denomina- 
tions, notably the Disciples of Christ, the Southern Baptist Church, 
the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the African Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church, the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church— 
all of which it was hoped could be included in this year’s report— 
could not get their data in hand in time to make any report. 
In the second place, some denominations make no report this year 
because, as their representatives declare, conditions given last year 
have not sufficiently changed to justify another statement. Still 
other denominations are not reported because their representatives 
say that there is not enough work included under the general head 
of parochial or parish education being done by these churches to 
call for special notice in this chapter. The work of the Young Men’s 
Christian Associations is given in a separate chapter. 
The report. included in this chapter on the educational work done 
by the several denominations in behalf of the Indians embodies the 
latest statistics.

  560 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH SCHOOLS. 
By Rey. Patrick J. McCormick, Associate Professor of Education, Catholic University 
Washington, D. C. 
In the Catholic school system, the elementary parish schools in- 
creased 85 in number during the school year 1914-15. While the 
enrollment for the 30 new Ruthenian-Greek schools was not pub- 
lished, the total registration increased 26,347. The total of schools 
reached the number 5,488, as compared with 5,403 for 1913-14, and 
the total enrollment became 1,456,209, while that of the former year 
was 1,429,859. As with the statistics for the Catholic population, 
which jherdased from 16,067,985 to 16,309,310, there was a substantial 
growth in schools and peuriancs 
For the first time since 1911 data have been gathered for the 
parish high schools. The Catholic Educational Association, through 
the advisory committee of its executive board, has published (1915) 
a report on the condition of Catholic secondary education in the _ 
United States, in which it is shown that there are altogether 1,276 
secondary schools, 56 of which are the high-school departments of 
colleges, 577 girls’ high schools or academies, and 599 parish or city 
high schools. The parish high schools have a total registration of 
29,476 in high-school grades—17,594 boys and 11,882 girls. Of these 
schools, 438 were especially studied by the committee, and it was 
found that all but 29 are directly connected with one or more parish 
elementary schools. The report shows that while many of the 128 
new schools which had answered the committee’s 1914 inquiry “ were 
in existence three years ago, fully as many Catholic high schools have 
sprung into existence during the past three years.” 
The important process of standardization of high schools through 
affiliation with the Catholic University, touched upon in last year’s 
report, has continued in a satisfactory manner. During 1914-15, 
19 new schools were added to the accredited list, which now com- 
prises 89 high schools, distributed as follows: Alabama, 1; Cali- 
fornia, 3; Colorado, 2; Connecticut, 2; Georgia, 2; Illinois, 4; Indi- 
ana, 2; Iowa, 8; Kentucky, 4; Maryland, 1; Massachusetts, 4; Michi- 
gan, 2; Minnesota, 2; Missouri, 4; New York, 3; Ohio, 19; Okla- 
-choma, 1; Oregon, 1; Pennsylvania, 8; Tennessee, 1; Texas, 10; Wash- 
ington, 1; Wisconsin, 4. 
Among the administrative and supervisory officers, a few changes 
may be noted. The district boards in the diocese of Syracuse have 
been consolidated into one school board, and the membership of the 
boards of inspectors and visitors in many dioceses have been nu- 
merically modified. The Rev. J. B. O'Leary has been designated 
diocesan director of schools for the diocese of Galveston. The Rev. 
Joseph V. S. McClancy has been appointed inspector of schools for 
the diocese of Brooklyn to succeed the late Rev. Joseph D. McKenna.

  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 561 
Summer schools, largely attended by the teachers of the parish 
elementary and high schools, were successfully conducted by De Paul 
University, Chicago, Ill.; Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wis.; 
Creighton University, Omaha, Nebr.; and the Catholic University, 
Washington, D. C. In the last-named institution, which had an 
extension at Dubuque, Iowa, the total enrollment reached 608, with 
40 States and 59 dioceses of the United States and Canada repre- 
sented. Teachers’ institutes were also held in various religious com- 
munities, and in dioceses for the teachers of their respective juris- 
dictions. The diocese of Cleveland held its first annual institute 
in June, 1915, and the enrollment was 450.

LUTHERAN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
By W. H. T. Dav, Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Mo. 
The present report on the status of the Lutheran parochial schools 
during 1914 has been prepared under an even greater handicap than 
its predecessor for 1913. The largest Lutheran body, and the one 
most devoted to the parochial school, the Missouri Synod, decided at 
its general convention at Chicago in May, 1914, to discontinue the 
annual publication of parish reports, and to publish these reports in 
periods covering three years. The next report will appear in Janu- 
ary, 1917. The reason for this action was economy. To publish sta- 
tistical tables exhibiting in detail the status and progress of church 
work in nearly 8,700 congregations entails a considerable expense. 
Moreover, the changes in the statistics of most congregations from 
one year to the next are not very great. Accordingly it was held 
that the last published statistics might be made to serve for several 
years. 
Some of the Lutheran Church bodies, however, have given to the 
public more exact statements regarding their parochial school work 
than were available for 1913. A comprehensive view of all the facts 
obtained shows that there is no marked change in the status of the 
Lutheran parochial schools of the country.

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 565 
For the history and location of the various bodies named in this 
chapter the reader is referred to the extensive account which was 
published by the Bureau of Education in 1918.1 
From the United Synod in the South no parochial school work has 
been reported. It is a question whether the school reported last year 
by the Mississippi Synod, which is federated with the above-named 
larger body, has been abandoned. If so, there is here to be recorded 
a loss of 1 school, 2 teachers, 119. pupils. The United Synod at the 
beginning of 1914 reported a baptized membership of 71,225 (69,603 
in 1913), and a communicant membership of 50,748 (50,819 in 1918). 
No parochial schools are reported from the General Synod, which 
now numbers 441,444 baptized and 328,586 communicant members 
(420,282 and 320,246 in 1913). 
The baptized membership of the General Council has arisen from 
766,623 in 1913 to 769,456, and the communicant membership from 
493,279 to 504,023. The parochial schools in this body have within 
the last year increased from 593 to 620, the number of teachers from 
690 to 754, and the number of pupils from 26,067 to 26,818. 
The General Council is composed of 13 synods. Seven of these re- 
port no parochial schools. Among the remaining 6 the totals given 
above for the entire General Council are distributed as follows: 
Ministerium of Pennsylvania, 40 schools, 73 teachers, 2,270 pupils 
(18, 22, and 2,120 in 1918) ; Ministerium of New York, 80 schools, 42 
teachers, 3,466 pupils (77, 41, and 3,295 in 1918) ; Swedish Augustana 
Synod, 437 schools, 613 teachers, 19,250 pupils (446, 598, and 18,927 
in 1913) ; Synod of Canada, 39 schools, 22 teachers, 980 pupils (37, 22, 
and 810 in 1913) ; Pacific Synod, 4 schools, 4 teachers, 72 pupils (3, (2), 
and 118 in 1918). The Synod of New York and New England, which 
appeared in the report for 1913, reports no parochial schools at Bed 
The changes in this part of the report as compared with last year’s 
would indicate that the parochial school has increased in efficiency in 
the Ministerium of Pennsylvania and in the Swedish Augustana 
Synod, both bodies having increased the number of their teachers for 
a smaller number of schools. 
The 14 independent Lutheran bodies operating in the United 
States report 1,102,463 baptized and 690,528 communicant members 
(1,083,141 and 672,150 in 1913). All but three make at least partial 
reports of parochial school work done by them, totaling 1,487 schools, 
1,595 teachers, 79,472 pupils (1,426, 1,986, and 78,981 in 1913). The 
differences in this division between the present figures and those for 
1913 are due chiefly to defective reporting; e. g., the Norwegian 
Synod, the United Danish Lutheran Church, and the Norwegian 
Lutheran Free Church have published no reports for the present

year. The total gains or losses in this division, as given above, are 
distributed among the various independent synods, as follows: 
The Ohio Synod has increased from 285 to 290 schools and from 
122 to 132 teachers, but has decreased from 9,708 to 9,655 pupils. 
Conditions have remained the same as last year in the German 
Buffalo Synod (20 schools and 7 teachers), the Norwegian Eielson’s 
Synod (6 schools and 4 teachers), and the German Texas Synod (12 
schools, 12 teachers, 250 pupils). 
Hauge’s Norwegian Synod last year reported 185 schools, with 
6,000 pupils, failing to give the number of teachers. This year the 
same synod fails to give the number of schools, but reports 222 
teachers and the same number of pupils as last year. 
The German Iowa Synod reports 985 schools, 39 teachers, 11,448 
pupils (500, 37, and 11,448 in 1913). 
The Danish Lutheran Church reports 59 schools, 78 teachers, 2,224 
pupils (84, 52, and 2,498 in 1913). 
The German Immanual Synod has increased from 11 to 18 schools, 
from 11 to 19 teachers, and from 702 to 814 pupils. 
The Finnish Suomi Synod reports 47 schools, 50 teachers, and 2,800 
pupils (49, 53, and 2,175 in 1913). 
The United Norwegian Church reports 1,032 teachers and 46,281 
pupils (941 and 36,500 in 1913). 
The 89 parochial schools which were credited to the United Danish 
Lutheran Church in the last report have not been reported this year. 
There is no reason to believe that they have been abandoned. 
From the Norwegian Lutheran Free Church no report has ap- 
peared this year. Last year’s figures for this body were 185 schools, 
220 teachers, 9,700 pupils. 
The synods composing the Synodical Conference have increased 
their baptized membership from 1,283,750 to 1,299,727 baptized, and 
from 831,120 to 778,500 communicant members. 
For reasons explained before, the report for the Missouri Synod is 
the same as last year, 949,771 baptized and 575,299 communicant mem- 
bers, 2,259 schools, 1,371 teachers, 96,287 pupils. 
The Wisconsin Synod reports 190,415 baptized and 153,521 com- 
municant members, 310 schools, 118 teachers, 36,112 pupils (190,217, 
175,624, 318, 118, and 35,875 in 1913). 
The Minnesota Synod reports 97,291 baptized and 25,547 communi- 
cant members, 120 schools, 26 teachers, 16,121 pupils (97,271, 48,114, 
154, 26, 16,121 in 1913). 
The District Synod of Michigan numbers 21,678 baptized and 8,843 
communicant members and reports 75 schools, 29 teachers, 3,085 
pupils (21,678, 15,514, 75, 9, and 3,021 in 1918).

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 567 
In the District Synod of Nebraska the baptized membership has 
increased from 20,105 to 20,285, the communicants have decreased 
from 11,108 to 6,090, the schools from 80 to 20, and the teachers from 
5 to 4; the number of pupils, 1,085, remains the same. 
For the Slovak Synod there are reported 20,292 baptized and 9,200 
communicant members, 28 schools, 2 teachers, 1,426 pupils. The 
figures were respectively 20,285, 15,631, 25, 2, and 8,821 in 1918. 
  
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH SCHOOLS (NORTHERN). 
By MarsuHatt C. ALLABEN, Superintendent of Schools, Woman’s Board of Home Missions 
of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. 
The educational work of the Presbyterian Church is so conducted 
that a full report of this phase of its activity would involve not only 
the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, but also 
the United Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian Church South. 
The account herein given has reference merely to the primary and 
secondary schools of the Presbyterian Church in the United States 
of America under the administration of the («) Woman’s Board of 
Home Missions and the (6) Board of Missions for Freedmen. 
(a) The task of the Woman’s Board, of Home Missions is pri- 
marily to establish and maintain grammar and secondary schools at 
strategic points throughout the United States, among communities 
deprived by location, race prejudice, environment, or for some other 
reason from the advantages of public-school education or Christian 
influence and training of any kind. Through the mission schools 
established in such centers appeal is made to the moral and spiritual 
sides of life, and the resulting tendency is almost invariably a gen- 
eral mental awakening and improved standards of living. The 
course of study followed in the mission schools is similar to that of 
the State public schools, with greater emphasis placed on industrial 
training, so that when boys and girls leave these schools they are 
well equipped for the successful undertaking -of life in a rural en- 
vironment, either as useful citizens or as home makers. 
These are approximately 235 teachers and 3,600 pupils connected 
with the mission schools, and with few exceptions the teachers are 
either college or normal-school graduates.

In addition to the above schools, mention should be made of Pres- 
byterian schools in immigrant communities. These are controlled 
on a different basis from the others, the work being administered 
locally, although the funds pass through the hands of the board. 
Organized effort for Slavs, Bohemians, Hungarians, and other for- 
eigners has been recorded, but the day school and community work 
are so blended that they can not well be differentiated in a brief 
report. 
(6) The Board of Missions for Freedmen has for its task the edu- 
cational development. of the Negro race in the South. This is a 
problem which has confronted the church ever since the emancipation 
of the Negro 50 years ago, until now it is concerned with more 
than 8,000,000 colored people, largely in rural communities, scattered 
throughout 18 States. When the fact is considered that 30 per cent 
of these 8,000,000 people are illiterate, it can readily be seen that the 
church is committed here to a most important work. 
In the 18 States referred to the Board of Missions for Freedmen 
has established 140 schools, having 480 teachers and approximately 
17,000 pupils. Only Christian teachers are employed, and as a rule 
they must be members of the Presbyterian Church. Of the 140 
schools, all with the exception of 6 are under the administration of 
responsible colored people. The value of industrial training is 
recognized as an important part of the curriculum of the schools, 
and Bible and catechism are required daily studies. The schools are 
classified and distributed as follows:

SCHOOLS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN THE UNITED 
STATES (SOUTHERN). 
By Henry H. Sweets, Secretary of Education, Louisville, Ky. 
The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United 
States is composed of 16 synods, which comprise the States of Mary- 
land, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Lou- 
isiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
Each one of these synods is now engaged in the work of correlating, 
standardizing, and unifying the appeal of all of the institutions 
within its bounds. 
In all of these there are 6 theological seminaries with 36 teachers, 
43 buildings, property valued at $1,000,000, endowment funds of 
$1,840,000, and 95,000 books in the libraries. 
There are 28 colleges with 387 in the faculties, 3,873 students, 164 
buildings, property valued at $4,895,000, endowment funds of 
$2,234,600, and 149,936 books in the libraries. 
There are 21 institutions of the grade of academies, collegiate in- 
stitutes, and junior colleges with 154 in the faculties, 1,482 students, 
54 buildings, property valued at $796,000, endowment funds of 
$130,000, and 12,702 books in the libraries. 
There are 34 mountain schools of varying grades with 117 in the 
faculties, 2,806 students, 72 buildings, property valued at $273,300, 
and endowment funds of $15,100. 
There are 11 orphans’ homes and schools with 42 in the faculties, 
1,016 children, 76 buildings, property valued at $773,000, and endow- 
ment funds of $171,000. 
This gives a total of 100 educational institutions with 736 in the 
faculties, 9,491 students, 409 buildings, property valued at $7,734,030, 
endowment funds of $4,386,603, and 255,359 books in the libraries. 
Mountain schools—Thirty-four schools of varying grades are be- 
ing conducted in the Appalachian Mountains, in the States of West

Negro schools—Three primary schools for the Negro population 
are conducted; and a large college and theological seminary at Tusca- 
loosa, Ala., is maintained by the church. 
Indians.—A college and high school are maintained in Oklahoma 
for the Indians. 
Mewxicans.—Several primary schools and an industrial training 
school of higher grade have been established in Texas to minister to 
the Mexican population. 
  
SCHOOLS OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH (NORTH). 
By F. W. Papetrorp, Corresponding Secretary, Board of Education of the Northern Bap- 
tist Convention. 
The Baptist Churches of the Northern States maintain an educa- 
tional system that includes 8 theological senrinaries for the profes- 
sional training of its ministers, 24 colleges and universities, and 25. 
academies. Most of the academies confine their instruction to work 
usually given in the four-year high-school course, though a few have 
developed the courses belonging to the junior college. The accom- 
panying table indicates the character of these schools, their size and 
strength. The Baptist Church has no parochial school system and 
maintains no schools below high-school grade, save such as are con- 
ducted among the exceptional populations. 
Among these populations the church conducts several schools for 
training ministers for their own people, as follows: For the Ger- 
mans at Rochester, N. Y.; for the Italians at Brooklyn, N. Y.; for 
the Hungarians at Cleveland, Ohio; for the Norwegians and for 
the Slavs at Chicago, Ill.; for the Swedes at Minneapolis, Minn.; 
and for the Danes at Des Moines, Iowa. These schools give in- 
struction of all grades, according to the requirements of the pupils, 
from the grammar school through the divinity school. 
The Baptists also maintain, through their home-mission boards, 
13 colleges and 10 schools of secondary grade for the Negroes. These 
are well scattered through the Southern States and enroll over six 
thousand pupils. In addition to these schools entirely maintained 
by the boards, many teachers are supported in schools under other 
control. For the education of the Indians, the church maintains 
Indian University at Bacone, Okla., besides one other school of lower 
grade in the State and two schools in Mantana. Schools for Chinese 
children are sustained in San Francisco, Sacramento, and Oakland, 
Cal., and at Portland, Oreg.; for the Poles in Milwaukee, Wis.; and 
for the Italians in Brooklyn, N. Y. Schools of various grades from 
the kindergarten to divinity schools are conducted in Cuba, Porto 
Rico, and Mexico.

  574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL 
CHURCH. 
By Epwarp 8. Luwis, Associated Editor of Sunday School Publications. 
The educational work of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the 
United States may be summarized as follows: 
1. Sunday schools. 
2. Young people’s work in the Epworth League. 
3. Institutions affiliated with the board of education. 
4, The schools of the Freedmen’s Aid Society. 
5. Deasonesses’ homes and schools. 
1. The work of the Sunday schools of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church is religious education. An extensive literature is provided 
by the publishing house of The Book Concern, located in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, and New York City. The Sunday schools of the church 
number 35,719, with a total enrollment of 4,186,766 officers, teachers, 
and scholars. 
2. The Epworth League is the official young people’s organization 
of the church. One prominent department of its work is educational. 
It conducts classes in Bible study, missions, and social service. All 
local leagues are urged by the central office to organize and main- 
tain such classes. These the central office aids with helpful super- 
vision and with suitable literature. 
3. The board of education operates with the numerous educa- 
tional institutions of the church to standardize them and to promote 
in them the best educational ideals. For this it works through the 
university senate. This has established scholastic standards for the 
secondary schools and colleges. These relate to courses of study, 
minimum requirements by units, quality of work, minimum of pro- 
ductive endowments, size of faculties, and number of students. 
To a number of needy institutions the board of education con- 
tributes financial aid. Upon its official list there are 51 colleges and 
universities, 42 secondary schools, 11 theological schools, and a num- 
ber of other professional schools and training schools for missionary 
work. In the above institutions there are 3,393 professors and 42,566 
students. The value of their property and equipment is $28,321,704, 
and their total endowment is $27,052,436. 
4. The work of the Freedmen’s Aid Society is the preparation 
and training of ministers, teachers, physicians, and other Christian 
leaders for the 10,000,000 Negro people in the United States, and par- 
sicularly for the 325,000 of them and their families that are members 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church.. This work is done in 22 schools 
and colleges in the South, in which are 6,961 students, about one-half 
of whom are in industrial classes, such as agriculture, blacksmithing, 
carpentering, wagon making, printing, painting, dressmaking, milli- 
nery, and general housekeeping.

    EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 575 
5. There are 78 Deaconess Homes of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, practically all of which are engaged in some form of educa- 
tional work. Many of them maintain well-organized training 
schools for deaconess and missionary work. Eight of the larger 
training schools report property values of $796,600 and 251 students 
in training. 
SCHOOLS OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH SOUTH. 
By W. BE. Hocan, Assistant Secretary of Board of Education, 
The educational work of the Methodist Episcopal Church South— 
not including its schools in foreign-mission territory—is confined 
largely to the 88 universities, colleges, junior colleges, and academies 
which it owns and controls. In addition to these, there are a number 
of special schools conducted by this church. 
Schools of the Home Mission Board.—The home department of 
the board of missions is maintaining: (1) Two mountain schools— 
1 in Kentucky and 1 in North Carolina—that together have 27 
teachers and 555 students; (2) 3 schools on the Florida coast, with 
26 teachers and 740 students; (3) 4 schools for Japanese—2 kinder- 
gartens,.1 day school, and 1 night school—on the Pacific coast, hav- 
ing 6 teachers and 109 pupils; (4) 2 schools in Georgia and Texas 
for friendless or unfortunate girls, with 12 teachers and 262 
students; (5) 1 school in Georgia for Negro industrial education; 
(6) 1 school for Mexicans at Laredo, Tex., having 15 teachers and 
276 students. There are in all of these schools 90 teachers and 2,006 
students, while the total value of the property is $368,465, and the 
annual cost of maintenance, in addition to the amount received for 
tuition fees, is $62,639. 
Cuba and Mewxico.—Through the foreign department of the board 
of missions this church is maintaining in Cuba 3 secondary and 2 
primary schools, with 29 teachers and 338 pupils; and along the 
borderland of Mexico it has 5 schools with 37 teachers and 884 
pupils. 5 
Mountain schools.—In addition to the 2 mountain schools men- 
tioned above the church, through its annual -conferences, maintains 
schools giving primary and secondary instruction in mountain fields. 
These schools are distributed as follows: In Alabama, 1; Arkansas, 1; 
Georgia, 2; Kentucky, 1; North Carolina, 1; Tennessee, 1; Virginia, 
1; West Virginia, 1. These schools are looked upon as missionary 
enterprises, and appropriations for current expenses are made to them 
annually by the general conference board of education. There are 
in these schools 80 teachers and 1,710 students. The majority of 
these schols doubtless report to the Bureau of Education as “ private 
high schools.”

576 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Bible and Missionary Training School—An institution which 
would not be reported elsewhere is the Scarritt Bible and Missionary 
Training School, at Kansas City, Mo. This institution is maintained 
by the Woman’s Missionary Council for the training of missionaries, 
deaconesses, kindergartners, and other special church workers. This 
institution has a plant valued at $73,000, an endowment of $140,000, 
an annual income of about $17,000, and enrolled in 1914-15 69 
students. 
Negro education—Through its general conference board of edu- 
cation the Methodist Episcopal Church South makes annual ap- 
propriations of from ten to fifteen thousand dollars to schools for 
negroes. Most of this goes to Paine College, Ga., an institution 
owned jointly by the Southern Methodist Church and the Colored 
Methodist Episcopal Church. In making this appropriation to 
Paine College, it is understood that it is to be used largely for the 
training of preachers and teachers of the Colored Methodist Epis- 
copal Church. 
SCHOOLS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE MORAVIAN 
CHURCH IN AMERICA. 
  By J. H. Cunwett,:Ph. D., Moravian Seminary and College for Women, Bethlehem, Pa. 
The Moravian Church in America was among the pioneers of ad- 
vanced education, especially for young women. Three-quarters of a 
century before any effort was made to provide advanced education 
for young women in any portion of the territory now embraced by 
the United States the well-known Moravian school at Bethlehem, Pa., 
was providing education for the daughters of almost every family of 
prominence in the Colonies and later in the States. 
In earlier years the church conducted parochial schools in connec- 
tion with nearly all its congregations, but these primary and sec- 
ondary schools were in later years gradually merged into the public 
schools. The boarding schools, however, because of their special 
home oversight, united with their scholastic advantages, have con- 
tinued without interruption since 1742 to the present day. 
The two principal groups of these schools are located in North 
Carolina and in Pennsylvania. The school for girls and young 
women in Winston-Salem, N. C. (Salem Academy and College), 
with more than 500 students, has done its work for more than a cen- 
tury. The boys’ school in Winston-Salem has been united with the 
city school system, after a history of usefulness of more than 100 
years. The school at Clemmons, N. C., still retains its organization, 
though it, too, has been united with the State’s interests as a home- 
farm school and promises to become a valuable institution of the 
newer type.
-P-A-G-E-597
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 577 
In Pennsylvania the work was begun in 1742 by the organization 
of the Moravian Seminary and College for Women, and this school 
has continued its work without interruption ever since. To-day it 
is an accredited college, with many States, North and South, repre- 
sented in the student body. : 
The Moravian Parochial School, in Bethlehem, also has an unin- 
terrupted history of 174 years, and is to-day largely patronized. In 
the same town of Bethlehem is located the Moravian College for Men 
and the Theological Seminary of the Moravian Church. This school 
has within recent years moved to College Hill, where a number of 
substantial stone structures have been erected, and the institution is 
doing an excellent work. 
Two other schools of historic interest and present-day usefulness 
are the schools at Nazareth and at Lititz, Pa. Nazareth Hall, the 
military academy for boys, and Linden Hall, the seminary for girls 
at Lititz, are both boarding schools with a widely distributed 
patronage. 
The Moravian Church has a flourishing school system among the 
Indians of California in connection with its regular church work. 
In Alaska the church also has an aggressive school system. The 
United States Government has joined its effort- with that of the 
Moravian Church in a number of districts on the Kuskokwim River 
and other sections, and these schools form an important part of 
the work of civilizing the natives and making them. intelligent 
citizens. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. 
Compiled from latest reports. 
The Congregational Church, through its Home Missionary So- 
ciety, sustains 415 distinct organizations among immigrant peoples 
in the United States. These organizations are distributed over 33 
States and include the following nationalities, divided according to 
language: German, Bohemian, Swedish, Dano-Norwegian, Italian, 
Welsh, Finnish, Slovak, Spanish, Persian, Albanian, Greek, Portu- 
guese, Polish, Bulgarian, Swede-Finnish, Turkish-Armenian, and 
Syrian. 
The American Missionary Association, of this denomination, does 
work among the backward races and in backward conditions in our 
own country. It has 90 schools, 3:of which are theological, 6 of 
which are colleges, 30 secondary. institutions, 27 elementary insti- 
tutions, 5 affiliated schools, 19 ungraded schools. In these schools 
are 14,515 pupils and over 600 teachers. This work is done among 
the Negroes, mountain whites, Indians, Chinese and Japanese, Porto 
Ricans, and Hawaiians.

  578 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
The Congregational Education Society has 7 mission schools and 
1 industrial institute among the Mexican people in New Mexico; 3 
graded schools and 2 academies in Utah. In addition to this, the 
society assists 10 academies and 7 colleges with financial aid. It is 
helping to support the university pastors at 10 State universities, is 
doing an extended Christian work among the students in colleges, 
and is assisting over 200 young men each year who are studying for 
the ministry. 
Among special work of the Congregational Church may be men- 
tioned in Slavic department of Oberlin Theological Seminary, de- 
signed to supply teachers and pastors for Slavic populations in the 
United States; also the Latin-American Institute of West Tampa, 
Fla., which trains teachers for the Latins, particularly for Cuba. 
The work that the Congregational Church has done for years at 
Ellis Island consists largely in giving information concerning public 
schools to the bewildered immigrants that pass into America through 
this gateway. 
SCHOOLS OF THE REFORMED CHURCH IN AMERICA. 
By Mrs. JoHN S. ALLEN, Secretary of Women’s Board of Domestic Missions. 
The women’s board of domestic missions of the Reformed Church 
in America sustains two well-developed schools in Jackson County, 
Ky. One is at McKee, the county seat. This is known as the McKee 
Academy. It has an enrollment of 125 pupils and the grades run 
through the eighth. There is also a special normal class for those 
who have completed the eighth grade and wish to become teachers. 
The school was opened in 1901. The curriculum keeps closely in view 
the development of community service by training in spiritual lines 
as well as in the cultural and industrial. 
The other school is at Annville, Ky., where the board of domestic 
missions sustains the Annville Institute for boys and girls, with sep- 
arate dormitories. There is here a daily attendance of about 130. 
The same general plan is in operation here as at McKee, except that 
industrial work is carried on more extensively through the large 
farm, which makes possible experiments in farming and cattle 
raising. 
At Gray Hawk, Ky., the board has recently opened a successful 
primary school. 
Scholarships are also provided at Santee, Nebr., for Winnebago 
Indian students.

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL 
CHURCH. 
By Rey. WiLt1AM BH. Garpnur, General Secretary of the General Board of Religious 
Education. 
The Protestant Episcopal Church has three church colleges, and 
about 225 church schools. Many of these are under dioceasan au- 
thority; others are managed by boards of trustees. The parochial 
schools of the church are connected for the most part with parishes 
that are doing work among foreigners. 
The church’s organization for religious education includes a de- 
partment of parochial education, a department of secondary educa- 
tion, a department of collegiate education, and a department of 
theological education. 
The aim of the church is to unify all of the educational work of 
the church that there may be proper correlation in Christian nur- 
ture as well as economy in administration. 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS FOR INDIANS. 
By E. B. Murirt, Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
The Indian Service welcomes the cooperation of the various re- 
ligious denominations in the conduct of educational work on the 
Indian reservations. The great assistance given by them in the 
civilization of the Indian, and likewise in his education, is fully 
appreciated. Their earnest efforts result in much educational work 
being done for the benefit of the Indian of which no record is ever 
kept and for which no credit can be given. 
The following table gives the mission schools carrying on educa- 
tional work on Indian reservations under the control of the various 
denominations and the total enrollment of each institution which 
reports to the Indian Office.

CHAPTER XXIV. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRIS- 
TIAN ASSOCIATIONS. 
By Gero. B. Hover, 
Hducational Secretary of the International Committee. 
ConTENTS.—The need and purpose—Hducational activities—Among different groups—The 
educational secretary—The educatograph—Christian service. 
I, THE NEED AND PURPOSE. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association believes most thoroughly 
in the American public-school system, and supports its leaders and 
policies. It realizes that only when such privileges and opportunities 
“are universally and effectively used can best dividends be realized. 
When it is considered, however, that a large proportion—nearly two- 
thirds—of the boys have left school by the end of the eighth grade; 
that the average length of a boy’s schooling is somewhat less than 
six years; that only a small percentage of the males are fitted by defi- 
nite educational training for their vocations; that illiteracy among 
voters in the United States is surprisingly large for a country sup- 
posed to be highly civilized; that there is relatively much less oppor- 
tunity in America for definite vocational training than is found in 
some other nations; there comes a realization of the need of supple- 
mentary educational facilities for men and boys, even in this land 
of rare privilege and opportunity. 
The purpose of the Young Men’s Christian Association in promot- 
ing educational facilities is to help meet some of the demands of 
present-day complex civilization. All forms of effort, whether by 
individuals, by clubs, by the church, or by the Young Men’s Christian 
Association, find opportunity for encouraging and supplementing 
the work of the public schools. As the church through the past 200 
years has so often wisely led in providing many forms of appropriate 
training through colleges, technical schools, and other features, so 
its leaders through the Christian Associations are now striving to 
help meet some of the needs of the time. The object in so doing is 
to develop Christian manhood; to help men and boys help them- 
selves; to inspire them to higher ideals of life and service; to 
acquaint them with, and help them wisely to develop, their own 
capabilities; to increase habits of industry and thrift; and to pre-

pare them to render more easily, willingly, and effectively, the highest 
type of industrial, social, and Christian service. Association educa- 
tional work thus encourages and strengthens other good forms of 
educational effort, improves citizenship, and assists commerce and 
trade through appropriate facilities offered at any time of the day 
or night, and places emphasis upon Christian character building as 
fundamental.

Il, EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
The scope of educational effort has steadily widened from year to 
year as associations have increasingly sought to meet local needs. 
The opportunities offered, day or evening, in the association building 
or elsewhere, for all kinds of boys and men of varying abilities, of 
-differing ambitions and desires, may be classified into the following 
groups. The figures are for the school year ended July 1, 1915. 
1. Reading rooms and libraries—The associations provide for and 
encourage the careful reading of the best periodicals, magazines, 
technical and trade journals. The reading of good books is steadily 
stimulated. The working library for study and research is the means 
of most efficient and permanent educational service. Public and 
private libraries are used increasingly. About one-half million males 
took advantage of these privileges daily during the year. Over 
600,000 standard books were read. Table 1 shows the associations 
in each of which over 5,000 standard books were read: 
Taste 1.— Associations in which 5,000 or more books were drawn and read.

2. Lectures and practical talks——During the past year 14,819 lec- 
tures and talks were given, and they were attended by nearly 1,000,000 
men and boys. Formal, high-grade lectures for mixed audiences, 
with paid speakers of national reputation, are relatively decreasing, 
while the number of informal, practical, and science talks or demon- 
strations given by local talent to small groups of men and boys at 
any time or place, day or night, is rapidly increasing. This is rela- 
tively the most inexpensive type of educational work and at the same 
time the best feeder for the definite class activities. There is no 
more limit to the opportunity of the association in conducting such 
features than there is a limit to the need of such privileges. Table 2 
gives the associations reporting 30 or more educational features of 
this kind.

3. Educational clubs——Many different kinds of clubs or groups of 
men or boys are promoted for research, study, discussion, and 
service to their fellows. 
the past year. Over 27,000 were gathered in such groups 
While the association can meet the needs of a few 
males by means of its library facilities, it appeals attractively to 
. other and larger groups of men through its reading rooms, to still 
other large groups of people through its lectures or its practical 
talks, and to still other groups comprising men who are clannish 
-and prefer to unite in groups with their fellows, through the club 
work. Thus the association in a measure exemplifies the Pauline 
doctrine—to definitely serve each individual according to his need. 
Table 8 shows the associations reporting five or more educational 
clubs with over 100 members.

WORK OF YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS. 587 
4. Class lecture serics—Those professional, semiprofessional, and 
vocational courses for mature men, handled by experienced teachers 
and leaders, form a kind of university-extension work. The sessions 
differ largely from the practical talks in that they are closely related 
in a series of from 10 to 25 sessions under one leader. They differ 
from the regular class-work subjects in that the instruction is largely 
the same as in college or university—by the lecture methods, supple- 
mented by quiz, reading, and study. The tuition is usually suffi- 
cient to cover the expense involved. The subjects include those of 
advertising, real estate, accountancy, law, salesmanship, credits, efli- 
ciency, business management, and the like. Over 9,000 business and 
college men are students in such courses. In other words, the asso- 
ciation in a part of its educational department is supplementing the 
college and university in affording vocational training in such timely 
and needed courses as college and university men must have, but 
which up to the present time they may not yet have secured. Table 4 
gives the places reporting such work where there are 50 or more 
students each.

5. Evening classes—These include commercial, industrial, aca- 
demic, language, technical, trade, and high-school subjects, taught by 
experienced and successful men teachers. The courses usually run 
during a term of from 25 sessions to 80 or 100 sessions, depending 
upon the length of the course and the number of sessions per week. 
Students pay tuition fees for the great majority of these courses. 
Such fees vary from $1 per season to $50 or more, depending upon 
the nature and length of the course and the expense necessary. to 
conduct it. In the elementary courses the tuition fee does not, and 
should not, cover the expenses. From the very nature and purpose 
of the Young Men’s Christian Association in a community, much of 
this fundamental and elementary service must necessarily be con- 
ducted at a distinct financial loss over and above what the students 
may be able to pay.
-P-A-G-E-608
  588 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Evening instruction is given -in about 130 different subjects or 
courses, ranging from the A, B, C’s to professional courses of uni- 
versity grade. The classes include males from 12 to 57 years of age, 
and provide for the man learning to read and interpret English as 
well as for the man with a university degree, and accommodate the 
man earning $1 a day, who often borrows money to pay his tuition 
fee, as well as the millionaire. Recently one course in finance and 
business management brought together in one association a group of 
men as students representing over $300,000,000.

  Nearly 3,000 men teachers are employed for this evening work. 
Such teachers are usually drawn from active commercial and pro- 
fessional life rather than from school or college. The salaries of these 
teachers last year was $330,000. That the students appreciate these 
definite privileges is shown in the tuition fees paid by them in the 
local associations. Such fees vary from $1 to $50 or more, and in 
the aggregate amount to $500,000 for the evening work alone. There 
are about 76,000 students in the evening classes. Table 5 shows the 
associations reporting over 500 students, and where such number is 
20 per cent or more of the association membership.

    WORK OF YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS. 589 
6. Association day schools —Experience shows that there is an in- 
creasing opportunity for appropriate day educational facilities, as 
well as for evening privileges to help meet the increasing variety of 
demands. Table 6 shows the growth of such facilities, as indicated in 
the number of students reported. Forty or more associations now 
conduct various kinds of commercial, academic, apprentice, voca- 
tional, and college preparatory courses, with over 9,000 students. 
The ages of the students vary from 14 to 30, the majority being 
under 20 years of age. They pay from $8 to $12 tuition fee per 
month, depending upon the courses taken. From the results thus 
far it would seem that each association, in a building of its own and 
in a community of more than 5,000 males between 12 and 30 years 
of age, would have ample opportunity to conduct appropriate edu- 
cational facilities in the daytime. In several cities, and for many 
years past, proprietors of private schools and business colleges have 
sought out and rented the desirable vacant rooms of the Young Men’s 
Christian Associations in the daytime for their private schools con- 
ducting such work as a regular business venture. It is felt that if such 
work can be done to the advantage of the proprietor and to meet cer- 
tain kinds of needs, the association, by conducting its own day schools, 
can largely increase the value and permanent influence of such work 
by conducting under its own auspices all forms of educational activ- 
ity needed both day and night. 
Experience shows the following to be some of the other reasons 
why associations conduct day schools under their own auspices: To 
serve employed men and boys who are not accommodated in evening 
classes; to meet a demand not yet supplied by public or other day 
schools which do not afford the additional privileges offered by the 
association; to utilize more fully the association capital invested in 
space, equipment, and supervision; to economize operation, super- 
vision, the teaching force, advertising, and the prestige of the even- 
ing educational work; to help men who work during the night or 
who have irregular times of employment, of whom there is a large 
and increasing number; to provide for more intensive and adapt- 
able study of special subjects than is possible in many other places; 
to provide for those who have physically outgrown their grades . 
or who for other reasons are not successfully served in the public 
schools; to do appropriate work for men and boys in the daytime 
for the same reason that evening work was organized to meet needs; 
to meet the desire of anxious Christian parents who wish appropriate 
training for their boys under auspices which are permeated by the 
Christian spirit of the association.

As the fundamental purpose of the Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation is to develop Christian character and encourage more eflicient, 
virile manhood, the association is finding by experience that the day 
schools, far more than the evening privileges, help to attain this de- 
sired product. The average student in the day school attends from 
4 to 5 hours per day, 5 or sometimes 6 days per week, and usually 
9 or 10 months during the year, for 2 or 3 years. In the course of 
a single year the average day student is under the influence and in 
the atmosphere of the Christian institution more than 40 times as 
much as the evening student. The result is as to be expected—an 
encouragingly large number of earnest, virile, clean, effective, Chris- 
tian young men entering college or business with more of that kind 
of preparation for Christian service and citizenship which is so 
very desirable. Such products react helpfully on other educational 
efforts. Numbers of high schools are asking the association for sug- 
gestions as to how their own courses and policies may be modified 
and improved to produce similar excellent results.

The association day school has a distinctive and unique field. It 
does not duplicate or compete with the public schools. It is found 
rather to strengthen and encourage them in the same general manner 
in which good evening work in the association has stimulated and 
strengthened other evening facilities. Boys who have prepared for 
college and university in the association day schools are found to be 
‘doing creditable work in Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Chicago, and 
many of the western universities. The oldest association day school 
is at Twenty-third Street branch, New York. One of the depart- 
ments of this school is a four-year college-preparatory course, from 
which students have finished to enter 10 of the leading universities 
and colleges of the East with much credit, and some of them with 
advanced standing. Association officers are convinced that the asso- 
ciation does not exist merely as a supplementary agency, and that it 
does not duplicate the work of other schools when it does a type of 
work and provides a kind of development plus Christian character 
building that many other schools do not specially attempt. If, for 
example, in teaching business law the association can develop a 
product which shall include more of character and moral application 
to daily life than is found in the product of many schools teaching 
similar subjects, then it is meeting an unmet need and rendering a 
real service to the community. 
The expense of the association day schools last year, with their 
9,780 students, was $261,000, aside from heat and rent. This expense 
was covered by the tuition fees of the students.

  {. Eutension features—One hundred and twenty-six associations, 
in addition to the privileges conducted in the building, carry on some 
privileges in various centers more or less remote from the association 
building, where groups of men and boys congregate. Appropriate 
adaptations of the regular educational facilities are thus offered. 
Depending upon local needs and circumstances, such privileges are 
held either day or evening. in shops, offices, stores, halls, churches, 
homes, or elsewhere. Often such privileges in a needy section of the 
city develop into a kind of mission of the association, and in time a 
branch association is formed. In this way it is carefully estimated 
that at least another 100,000 employed men and boys were definitely 
aided educationally the past year. :

8. Coming Americans.—During the past 10 years an increasing 
number of associations have given more and more attention to aiding 
non-English speaking men and boys in learning to speak, read, and 
write the English language. Aside from many definite courses lead- 
ing to naturalization, whereby thousands of worthy young men from 
foreign nations have been led into intelligent American citizenship, 
over 20,000 men and boys the past year have studied in the special 
classes in preparatory English. Much of this work has been done in 
centers outside the association building. The method-used most 
successfully is that of Dr. Peter Roberts, the secretary of the inter- 
national committee, for this special work.

9. Among boys.—A large and growing movement, with over 17,000 
boys already enrolled in definite evening-class work, is to be reported. 
Many of these are employed boys who have left the public schools 
with only from two to four years of training, and among whom there 
is such great need for vocational training. Among these boys there 
is greater need than ever for appropriate apprentice schools or 
elementary continuation schools. The efforts made have strength- 
ened the movement in various cities toward making education com- 
pulsory up to the age of 16 and is also aiding compulsory continu- 
ation school work up to the age of 18.

  594 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
In summer schools for boys, during July and August, the associa- 
tion has been giving another object lesson in its helpful service, 
showing that educational facilities can and should be offered 12 
months in the year. Slowly the public-school authorities are be- 
ginning to realize that there must be something of truth in this fact. 
The succession of day and night or of one’s breathing while in health 
and vigor are not more urgent or necessary in their respective func- 
tions than educational needs in any community. Fortunately, a few 
cities and some colleges or professional schools are providing summer 
terms which are on equal basis of credit with fall and winter 
facilities.

  10. Special courses—The association is rightly regarded as a pio-~ 
neer in discovering special educational needs and in striving to meet 
these new needs with new and adapted courses. The first automobile 
school in America was born in the Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion in 1900. The first course in window trimming began in the 
association in 1903. The first poultry school for boys was born in 
1908. Similarly with many other special courses to meet special new 
needs. The past year similar courses have been organized for the 
first time in photoplay writing and also for “movie” machine op- 
erators. The number of students in any such group of special courses 
naturally varies and includes all varieties of men and boys, even those 
with university training. 
11. Ewaminations—The international committee has conducted 
annual examinations in the fundamental subjects—commercial, in- 
dustrial, language, and science, since 1896. Behind each subject an

examiner of national authority and wide experience serves as the 
official who draws the questions and passes upon the results. The 
various tests are taken in the same rigorous manner as those con- 
ducted by the State boards of education, the regents of New York, 
or the several universities examining students for entrance. 
These examinations, while not compulsory on the part of either 
individuals or of the local associations, materially help each teacher 
and student to compare their work with that of a fair standard of 
similar work for the country. The certificates granted in such tests 
are accepted at their face value in many local colleges and uni- 
versities. About 4,000 men took part in such tests the past year.

Ill. AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association strives to serve educa- 
tionally men and boys over 12 years of age. These are naturally 
classified in various groups. (See summaries for these groups in 
Table 11.) 
1. City.—About 75 per cent of the educational activities of the 
movement as a whole is found among city men and boys in what are 
termed the city associations. Here the variety of work conducted 
ranges from a few activities like the practical talk, a class in business 
English or arithmetic, with few students and at small expense, to 
large educational institutions, each involving several departments, 
with annual expenses from $50,000 to $160,000 and from 2,000 to 
4,000 students. During the past two years such work has increased 
in efficiency, in the number and nature of its day-school privileges, 
and especially in the development of Christian character-building 
influences. (See summaries in Table 11.) 
2. Railroad—A number of the associations among railroad men 
give some attention to appropriate educational activity, as Philadel- 
phia, New York, Boston, St. Louis, and others. Practical talks, edu-
-P-A-G-E-616
  596 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
cational clubs, and various appropriate technical courses form the 
basis of this service. In several places the associations have organized 
apprentice schools among railroad employees, and in some of these 
cases such schools have been passed over to the conduct of the railroad 
company. 3

  3. Industrial workers —Aside from the practical educational facili- 
ties offered by city associations to industrial workers within reach 
of their buildings, the association has conducted educational facili- 
ties for various groups of industrial workers in communities where a 
regular Young Men’s Christian Association has not yet been organ- 
ized. In each such case, as among lumber men in the great lumber 
centers of America, or among men and boys in the cotton industries 
of the South, or among the mine workers of the mining sections of 
the country, appropriate facilities have been promoted where feasible 
and at very small expense. Over 35,000 wage earners in the indus- 
tries are taking drawing, shop mathematics, applied electricity, chem- 
istry, and many other technical courses. 
4. Rural—Among males in the small communities and country 
districts the association has been adapting its facilities to meet their 
needs. Much of this work is naturally of a popular and practical 
agricultural nature and serves equally well to meet the needs of its 
constituency, as the classes in electricity, accountancy, or other tech- 
nical subjects do with the city and industrial constituencies. 
&. Army and Navy.—Similarly the association, as far as possible, 
encourages the enlisted men in both the Army and Navy by conduct- 
ing appropriate educational privileges. During the last year or 
two, while the new management of the Navy has been striving to 
encourage a complete educational system under Navy control, the 
association has naturally been decreasing its definite educational 
facilities, but in each case helpfully cooperating with the officials in 
encouraging their educational plans and policies. 
6. Colored men.—In a number of associations among colored men 
and boys some appropriate facilities, including practical talks, read- 
ing rooms, and elementary class work, are conducted.

IV. THE EDUCATIONAL SECRETARY. 
The proper organizing, wise promoting, and social engineering of 
adapted educational enterprises of the Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation call for and are developing a new educational vocation, sepa- 
rate and considerably different from that of teaching—that of the 
educational secretaryship. A few association leaders recognize that 
inexperienced and inefficient supervision is often worse than no 
supervision at all, and in many cases means the speedy death of edu- 
cational efforts thus treated. Of more than 400 local associations in 
America, in each of which it is believed there should be an officer 
specially trained and experienced in this service, only 83 such asso- 
ciations have yet added such a secretary. Each year two or three 
associations are added to this list. As any good work of this kind 
will not successfully develop of itself, as any enterprise or manufac- 
turing plant needs a superintendent or manager to bring about the 
best use of such plant, so each association in a building of its own 
and serving any community of over 5,000 men and boys 14 to 40 
years of age will find an efficient educational secretary one of its best 
investments. 
While the local educational committee, composed of interested, 
cooperative, volunteer business men, is responsible for the general 
conduct of educational features, yet the presence of a paid secretary 
who is experienced in this work, as agent of such committee, is 
abundantly justified by the results. Eighty per cent of all the class 
work in the 1,300 associations of the movement as a whole is con- 
ducted in the 83 associations with educational secretaries.
-P-A-G-E-618
  598 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Experience shows that the best educational secretaries have many 
of the following excellent qualities: Christian character; ability to 
cooperate; leadership; openness of mind; good judgment of men; 
strong personality; command respect, support, and cooperation of 
their associates and friends; conviction, born of high ideals and ex- 
perience; a purpose to effectively help meet some of the eduéational 
needs of men and boys of his community (such needs vary in each 
community and must be specially discovered locally) ; permeate his 
efforts with Christian character-building influences. Successful edu- 
cational secretaries are usually good publicity men, good salesmen, 
good mixers, good cooperators and are learning to be good social 
engineers of appropriate education enterprises. The growth of 
educational supervision is shown in chart No. 6. One summer school 
for these secretaries has been held yearly at Silver Bay, N. Y., 
since 1906. It includes features, methods, policies, and problems of 
association work, religious education, psychology, Bible study, semi- 
nar, conference, and laboratory work for five hours per day for 14 
days each year.

Vv. THE EDUCATOGRAPH. 
The accompanying diagram is to aid in a comparative study of 
association educational work for the past year. Its only motive is 
to be suggestive, not critical, as local conditions materially influence 
results. It is based on the total membership and the total annual 
current expenses of the association, includes the improved goals, 
shows relatively the features of encouraging development as well as 
those needing increased effort, is equally accurate for an associa- 
tion of 50 members as for one of 5,000, and is absolutely impartial. 
To more accurately reflect the present growth and purpose of the 
movement, this educatograph includes association day schools, and 
Bible study in the educational department, in place of tuition re- 
ceipts and books read. 
Goal.—The following goal of 100 per cent in each of the seven 
items (lines A A) is based on many years’ experience:

75 students in class work, and won 4 international certificates. Asso- 
ciations of other sizes are in similar proportion.

Street, New York. 
VI. CHRISTIAN SERVICE. 
To an increasing degree association leaders unite upon empha- 
sizing the building of Christian character in all departments. They 
realize that efficient character is the thing most worth while in the 
world to-day. They also realize that while the majority of the 
worst men in the world may be bad men educated, yet they also 
realize that in the training of the world’s best workers and leaders 
character-building influences have been large and vital factors. 
Hence increased emphasis is given in educational work to (a) secur- 
ing teachers and leaders who possess strong Christian character plus 
the ability to teach and lead successfully; (6) promoting appro- 
priate forms of normal, manly, and virile Bible study among all 
students in the department, the slogan being “Every student also 
enrolled in some form of Bible study”; (¢) chapel exercises at least 
twice a week for evening students, daily for day students; (d) per- 
sonal work and appropriate Christian interviews, the purpose of 
which is to help each student in his personal religious life. In some 
associations a teacher will not be employed in any course unless he is 
both willing and able to teach a Bible class if called upon to do so.

I, EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 
GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The main lines of endeavor of the General Education Board are 
as follows: (1) The promotion of farm demonstrations in selected 
States; (2) the development of a system of public high schools in 
the Southern States; and (8) the promotion of higher education 
throughout the United States. Results are secured through estab- 
lished institutions and agencies. The corporation owns no real estate; 
its property, consisting of securities and money, is divided into 
different funds, according to the purpose for which it is to be used. 
According to the report filed with the Secretary of the Interior, 
September 23, 1915, the principal funds belonging without restric- 
tion to the board amounted to $33,958,848.40, invested in stocks and 
bonds. 
1¥or detailed accounts of other educational meetings see the special chapters in this 
report. For a complete list of educational associations, national and State, consult the 
Educational Directory for 1915-16. (Bulletin 1915 No. 43.)

The income from the above funds, together with the income from 
undisbursed income, including income earned but not received, 
amounted during the year to $2,230,425.41. The balance of income 
from previous years as of June 30, 1914, amounting to $5,223,863.68, 
increased the total to $7,454,289.09.

This leaves an undisbursed balance of income on June 30, 1915, 
of $6,213,055.99. Against this balance there are unpaid appropria- 
tions amounting to $6,011,563.64. 
The John D. Rockefeller special fund is a fund which Mr. Rocke- 
feller controls as to principal and income. In a previous report a 
gift to the University of Chicago of $9,912,540.74 was announced. 
One-tenth of this gift (or securities and cash representing it) is pay- 
able each year. The income from the unpaid balance, however, re- 
mains the property of the board, subject to Mr. Rockefeller’s direc- 
tion. The principal of this fund, as mentioned in the last report, 
has been completely used up, so that only the income account now is 
open. The income earned during the year was $277,270.61 plus the 
profit on invested income, $691.71. The balance from previous 
years: ($510,708.38) added to this brings the amount to $788,670.70. 
Disbursements during the year were as follows: Gift to the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, $20,000; expenses, $836.57; total, $20,836.57. 
This leaves a balance of $767,834.13. 
The Anna T. Jeanes Fund, the income to be used for negro rural 
schools, amounts to $200,000. The income from this fund during 
the year was $7,910.46. Added to the balance from the previous 
year, the total available income amounted to $17,910.46. Of this,
-P-A-G-E-625
    EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS, 605 
$8,812.70 was appropriated and paid to various schools and $40.10 
paid out for expenses, leaving a balance of $8,307.68 in cash. 
CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
The ninth annual report of the president and treasurer of the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching presents a 
detailed statement of the business of the year, a discussion of specific 
educational problems, a necrology, and the treasurer’s report of 
income, expenditure, and endowment. 
The income received during the fiscal year from the general en- 
dowment of the foundation was $696,038.60; from the endowment 
of the division of educational inquiry, now kept as a separate budget 
item, was $50,358.34. The total expenditures under the general en- 
dowment fund amounted to $669,532.99, of which $510,750.97 went to 
pay the retiring allowances and pensions in institutions on the ac- 
cepted list of the foundation, and $124,112.80 to allowances and pen- 
sions to individual officers, teachers, and widows in institutions out- 
side of this list. Forty-four allowances were granted during the 
fiscal year, being an expenditure of $70,900. The number of deaths 
recorded during the year was 15, making a net increase of 29 to the 
number of allowances and pensions in force, which at the close of 
the year amounted to 432, with a total grant of $687,370. The 
grants made during the year represented, in all, 82 institutions. At 
the close of the fiscal year the trustees held in trust, under the gen- 
eral endowment, securities of the face value of $14,129,000; under 
the division of educational inquiry, $1,250,000. 
As regards the obligation resting upon beneficiaries upon retire- 
ment to refrain from further employment for pay, the trustees, in 
their definition of the rule relating to this question, stated that the 
rule “does not prevent the retired professor from having access to 
the laboratories of his institution, or from accepting compensation 
for occasional lectures, but it does not permit him to assume stated 
academic duties.” In regard to professors of music, the trustees 
deem it necessary to restrict the award of retiring allowances to 
those who have shown “ distinct eminence in creative work in theo- 
retical knowledge.” 
Attention is called to the comprehensive studies of legal and engi- 
neering education now being undertaken. The problems of legal 
education group themselves under two main heads: (1) What should 
be the requirements for admission to the bar? (2) What should be 
the character of the institutional training provided in law schools? 
Says the report: 
It is by no means true that the conditions under which young men may be 
admitted to the bar provide grounds for discouragement, taking the country 
as a whole. A great improvement in this respect has been made during this
-P-A-G-E-626
  606 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
generation, and is still in progress. But the reports which our field workers 
have submitted prove conclusively that in certain States it would be utterly 
impossible for a law school to do honest, high-grade work and flourish. 
The monograph of Prof. Josef Redlich, of the University of 
Vienna, on American methods of law teaching, undertaken at the 
request of the foundation, has already been published. Prof. Red- 
lich’s work is based upon personal experiences secured at 10 repre- 
sentative law schools of the United States, supplemented by reading 
and discussion. 
The inquiry into engineering education, which has been under- 
taken in close conference and cooperation with the Society for the 
Promotion of Engineering Education, will attempt to throw light 
on the aims, the purposes, the curricula, the methods of teaching, the 
educational experiments and investigations of the engineering 
schools, as well as to study “the conditions into which a young 
engineer enters immediately on graduation, and of the estimates 
which the engineering profession has formed of ‘his needs and 
equipment.” 
The question of pensions is elaborately treated by the report. In 
discussing municipal pensions for teachers the conclusion is reached 
that pension funds for teachers must rely mainly on teachers’ con- 
tributions and local appropriations. The past two years have seen 
a remarkable increase in State pensions for public-school teachers, 
the number having risen in two years from 6 to 13. Regarding 
colleges the report concludes that a small college, with a faculty of 
20, out of an endowment of $100,000 or $150,000 may administer a 
relief fund that will care for most cases of actual need on the part 
of professors or their wives. 
For several years the foundation has considered the desirability 
of conducting an investigation into the present status of the train- 
ing of teachers for elementary, secondary, and vocational schools, 
and has come to the conclusion that the question should be ap- 
proached from a standpoint as nearly as possible identical with that 
of the State itself. If it can succeed in a few States or in one State 
in throwing light on the situation from various viewpoints—legisla- 
tive, administrative, and institutional—‘the result should prove 
valuable not only for the particular State concerned, but by analogy 
for all States possessing similar conditions.” The report expresses 
the hope of accomplishing this. The governors and the departments 
of education of Indiana and Missouri have already invited the foun- 
dation to undertake surveys of their respective Commonwealths. 
Under current educational problems the following subjects are 
discussed: “Standards and standardizers,” “The Vermont report” 
(which was the first study undertaken through the agency of the 
division of educational inquiry), “The American Association of
-P-A-G-E-627
  
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS, 607 
University Professors,” “The classification of medical schools,” 
“Medical education on the Pacific coast,” “ Medicine and politics in 
Ohio,” “ State educational reports,” and “ Educational surveys.” 
In the classification of medical schools emphasis is laid upon the 
question of instruction, and the statement is made that “there 
is no other teaching institution where the art of teaching is so little 
considered as in the medical school.” Because a man may be a good 
pathologist, a skillful anatomist, or a surgeon of renown does not 
prove that he possesses the power of imparting his knowledge. The 
lack of provision in the medical school for the improvement of the 
methods of instruction or for the elimination of ineffective teachers 
is deplored. 
RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION. 
The division of education of the Russell Sage Foundation 
(Leonard P. Ayres, director) exists for the purpose of carrying on 
educational research on behalf of the children of the public schools. 
This work is in large measure directed toward scientific tests and 
measurements, problems of school hygiene, and problems of admin- 
istration. A considerable portion of the work of the division con- 
sists in answering the large number of inquiries received from school 
executives with respect to particular problems of their work. The 
division correspondence averages about a thousand letters a month, 
a large ‘portion of which is of this character. Nearly one-fifth of all 
these questions deal with tests and measurements, approximately one- 
seventh have to do with problems of school hygiene, and about the 
same number take up problems of school administration. Almost 
one-eighth of all questions deal with surveys and exhibits, while 
nearly one-tenth have to do with problems of industrial education 
and vocational guidance. 
During the past year the division has taken part in the industrial 
survey of Richmond, Va., and the industrial and educational survey 
of Cleveland, Ohio. It has published the reports of two researches 
in the field of scientific measurement. One of these relates to the 
measurement of ability in spelling, and presents the results of a 
study which the division carried on in cooperation with the superin- 
tendents of schools of 84 cities. In this piece of work the thousand 
commonest words in written English were spelled by pupils of the 
different school grades in several cities, until spelling norms were 
established which were based on some 1,400,000 spellings. These re- 
sults were incorporated in the scale for measuring ability in spelling 
and were published together with the report of the investigation. 
The other research in this field produced a scale for measuring the 
quality of adult handwriting. In addition, the division’s earlier scale 
 
-P-A-G-E-628
  608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
for the measurement of children’s handwriting was completely re- 
vised. 
The division publishes a series of reports in monograph form and 
sells them at prices sufficient to cover the cost of publication. 
JOHN F. SLATER FUND. 
The fifty-second meeting of the trustees of the John F. Slater fund 
was held in New York April 22, 1914. The educational committee 
recommended appropriations for the fiscal year of 1914-15 amount- 
ing to $69,250. 
At the meeting held April 28, 1915, Director James H. Dillard 
gave an interesting survey of the work of the fund. 
He pointed out that during its 33 years of existence the Slater 
fund has made appropriations amounting in round numbers to 
$1,625,000. Its first appropriation, for the session 1882-83, was 
$16,250 to 12 schools. Of these 12 schools, 3 were small private 
schools receiving $250 each. The balance of the appropriation went 
to 9 larger institutions, 6 of which bore the name of college or uni- 
versity. For the following session, 1883-84, the appropriation was 
$17,106 to 18 institutions, including no small schools. For 1884-85 
the appropriation was $36,764 to 29 institutions. Coming down by 
periods of five years the following appropriations were made: For 
the session ending in 1890 an appropriation of $42,910 to 37 schools; 
in 1895, $42,400 to 16 schools; in 1900, $43,331 to 11 schools; in 1905, 
$53,550 to 27 schools; in 1910, $69,750 to 40 schools; in 1915, $69,250 
to 68 schools, 5 counties, and 18 summer schools. Of the 68 schools, 
17 were county training schools. In recent years there has been an 
increase of cooperation with State and county public schools. Up to 
1902 the only instance of such cooperation was an appropriation to 
the State Normal School at Alabama. In that year an appropria- 
tion was also made to the State Agricultural School of. North 
Carolina. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
From the first years of Negro education there have been many 
kinds of schools established, some by religious denominations of the 
North, some by Negro churches of the South, a few by white churches 
of the South, some by private associations or individuals. Most of 
the schools established with religious backing are still flourishing; 
many private efforts have gone to the wall; others are living a pre- 
carious existence. A few which have been able to acquire property 
and to establish an endowment fund are on a sound basis, but need 
constant aid from philanthropic individuals and associations. The 
small private schools, without backing and without endowment, seem 
 
-P-A-G-E-629
    EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 609 
destined to die or to be turned over either to some religious body or 
to the public-school system. 
Says Dr. Dillard: 
In estimating the value and efficiency of the many Negro institutions, high 
and low, that have been established in various ways, opinions of inspectors and 
investigators will naturally differ. Each individual is likely to emphasize in 
his own mind this or that feature. There are four questions upon which all 
would probably agree. Is the school property kept in satisfactory conditions 
of cleanliness, repair, and sanitation? Are the accounts of receipts and expendi- 
tures kept in good shape and open to inspection? Is the work of teaching hon- 
estly conducted; that is, is the professed standard as thoroughly followed as 
can reasonably be expected? Does the atmosphere of the school give the im- 
pression of industry, alertness, and morality? In its 33 years of useful aid I 
believe that the resources of the Slater fund have been distributed with careful 
regard to such questions as these. Doubtless mistakes have been made, but in 
the main the appropriations seem to have been well used. 
COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC-SCHOOL OFFICIALS. 
The growing tendency to cooperate with the public-school officials arises 
from the increasing desire of these officials to improve the Negro schools. One 
of the greatest immediate needs is for even fairly competent teachers in the 
small public schools. The Slater fund has contributed much to the preparation 
of teachers, but in the past its contributions in this direction have been mainly 
to the larger and higher institutions. There is now great need for the prepara- 
tion of teachers in a lower grade of advancement. The immediate conditions 
under which such work must be done may be far from ideal, but the effort faces 
facts as they are. It is a fact that a very large majority of the teachers in the 
small rural schools have got what they have of education and training in their 
own or a neighboring county, and many superintendents are showing much in- 
terest in the improvement of some central school in the county for the purpose 
of supplying a somewhat better grade of teachers. This explains the origin 
and the main purpose of the so-called county training schools of which the fund 
has aided in making a beginning. In 1912 there were three, in 1913 four, in 1914 
eight, in 1915 seventeen. For the next session the trustees of the Slater fund 
propose to aid about 30, provided the reasonable conditions are fulfilled. 
These conditions, as previously approved, are as follows: (1) That the school 
property shall belong to the State or county, thus fixing the school as a part of 
the public-school system; (2) that there shall be an appropriation of at least 
$750 from the public funds for maintenance; (3) that the teaching shall be 
carried strictly and honestly through at least the eighth grade, including in- 
dustrial work, and in the last year some training, however elementary, for the 
work of teaching. Under these conditions the Slater fund has agreed to appro- 
priate $500 for maintenance, and in the first year, where new buildings or re- 
pairs may be necessary, to aid in supplying these in cooperation with amounts 
raised from other sources. 
Another method in which the Slater fund has been able to assist country 
teachers has been through the work of summer schools, to which it has con- 
tributed for the past three years, at various points, amounts ranging from $50 
to $300. These contributions have been the means of starting several summer 
schools, which could not have been supported without such assistance. This 
expenditure has been especially commended by the State superintendents.

  610 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
During the past 10 years the Slater fund has cooperated with a few city or 
town superintendents in introducing industrial work, and such cooperation 
may well be extended as opportunity is offered and our resources will permit. 
The plan has been to start the appropriation with a certain amount ranging 
from $1,000 in Charleston, S. C., to $225 in, Danville, Va., with the understand- 
ing that the appropriation be reduced or abolished as the work becomes securely 
established. 3 
IMPROVEMENT. 
All these instances of cooperation between the fund and the public schools 
are indications of a healthy sentiment. 
State and county superintendents are manifesting a decided increase of in- 
terest in behalf of better school facilities for the Negroes. Counties are be- 
ginning to make appropriations for Negro schoolhouses, and there are expres- 
sions of desire to lengthen the short school terms and to increase the poor pay 
of teachers. The States are making better appropriations for the colored State 
normal and industrial schools. In the various denominational and private 
schools there is gradual improvement in the genuineness of the course of studies 
and in carefulness of keeping accounts. Thus it is evident that in the matter. 
of education there are signs of improvement, both in the small public schools and 
in the higher institutions. 
THE JEANES FUND. 
The Jeanes fund for the improvement of Negro rural schools co- 
operated, during the session ending June 30, 1915, with public-school 
superintendents in 133 counties in 14 States. The supervising in- 
dustrial teachers, paid partly by the counties and partly by the 
Jeanes fund, visited regularly in these counties 3,463 country schools, 
making in all 17,312 visits and raising for purposes of school im- 
provement $73,438. The business of these traveling teachers, work- 
ing under the direction of the county superintendent, is to introduce 
into the small country school simple home industries; to give talks 
and lessons on sanitation, personal cleanliness, etc.; to encourage the 
improvement of schoolhouse and school grounds; and to conduct 
gardening clubs and other kinds of clubs for the betterment of the 
school and the neighborhood. 
PHELPS-STOKES FUND. 
The Phelps-Stokes fund has cooperated with the division of Negro 
education of the United States Bureau of Education in two distinct 
lines of activity: (1) A comprehensive survey of all private and 
higher schools for Negroes; (2) constructive efforts to improve the 
work of these schools. In cities where private schools for Negroes 
were visited, public schools for Negroes were also investigated, and 
special reports were made on public high schools for Negroes, the 
studies being made by special collaborators from the Bureau of Edu- 
cation. Experts in accounting, architecture, and industrial educa- 
tion visited and inspected schools of importance. A fund of $100
-P-A-G-E-631
    EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 611 
was appropriated by the Phelps-Stokes fund to be offered as prizes 
in four schools for the boys who keep their rooms in the best condi- 
tion. An effort was made to improve groups of schools by assembling 
the representatives of denominational and private boards controlling 
schools for Negroes in the South. The success of these experiments 
has led the Phelps-Stokes trustees to continue the constructive side 
of work of colored schools. 
II. EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION AND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON 
EDUCATION. 
The fifty-third annual convention of the National Education Asso- 
ciation, which was organized as the Third International Congress 
on Education, was held in Oakland, Cal., August 16-28, 1915. The 
attendance was exceptionally large, and the program varied and 
comprehensive. Twelve general meetings of the International Con- 
gress on Education were held, and 54 meetings of the departmental 
congresses. Thirty-one different countries were represented by 
officially accredited delegates or speakers. 
At the general sessions, the topics discussed were war and peace, 
international educational progress, rural education, and miscella- 
neous problems of education. The presidential address was deliv- 
ered by Dr. David Starr Jordan, on “The teacher and the war.” 
He ascribed the war system of Europe “to the perversion of educa- 
tion.” Dr. Elmer E. Brown read a paper on “ Educational progress 
of the past 15 years,” the dominant note of which was “ public 
service.” Prof. Frederick E. Farrington, discussing the “ Educa- 
tional progress of continental Europe since 1900,” said that the twen- 
tieth century represents the subordination of the individual to group 
control, which inevitably leads to wider opportunity for the masses 
of the people to rise above their former level. 
In western Burope, during the past 15 years, the most significant changes 
have come in the field of secondary education. On the Continent, the secondary 
school is a school for the. classes, while in the United States it is a school for 
the masses. 
Prof. Farrington emphasized the fact that educational progress 
in Europe is mainly due to the spirit of cooperation which is every- 
where apparent, and is “the largest single idea we can gain from 
European experience.” 
In the session on rural education, Dr. P. P. Claxton, United States 
Commissioner of Education, dwelt on the development of those 
phases of agriculture and household arts which will enable the farm 
boy and girl to contend with the variety and complexity of farm 
management. The subject of “Efficiency and preparation of rural
-P-A-G-E-632
  612 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
school teachers in the United States” was discussed by H. W. Foght, 
of the United States Bureau of Education, who said that recent 
investigations of the Bureau of Education showed that 4 per cent 
of all the teachers now at work in the rural schools have had less 
than 8 years of elementary school preparation; that 32.3 per cent 
have had no professional preparation whatever, and that only one- 
tenth of 1 per cent of these teachers report attendance at schools 
making a specialty of preparing teachers for rural schools. He pre- 
sented a plan for hastening the change from amateur to professional 
teaching. 
An address by William B. Owen on the importance of teachers’ 
organizations in shaping educational policies and methods resulted 
in the appointment of a committee to investigate the efficiency of 
the National Education Association, and to formulate plans for 
increasing its scope and usefulness to the educational world. William 
T. Foster, in his paper on “Athletics as education and athletics as 
business,” spoke of intercollegiate athletics as an American insti- 
tution which provides “a costly, injurious, and excessive régime of 
physical training for a few students, especially those who need it 
least, instead of inexpensive, healthful, and moderate exercise for 
all students, especially those who need it most.” Charles F. Thwing 
presented a thoughtful paper on “ Higher ideals of education,” and 
Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews spoke on “The education of the world 
for a permanent peace.” 
In the departmental congress on school hygiene W. E. Watt made 
a plea for the fresh-cold-air room, and deprecated the mechanical 
devices and the superheating of air. In the department of elementary . 
education, Edith K. O. Clark advocated the necessity of smaller units 
of supervision for the rural schools. 
The sum of $4,490 was appropriated at the business meeting for 
educational investigations during the year 1915-16. An offer to 
present three cash prizes of $1,500, $250, and $100, respectively, made 
by Nathan Straus, to authors of an essay on the teaching of thrift, 
was accepted. 
The department of school administration presented a strong pro- 
gram. In his presidential address, O. M. Plummer urged that school 
boards should become an important part of the National Education 
Association. Prof. W. E. Chancellor delivered an address on “ School 
board members,” and Dr. Elwood P. Cubberley described the “ Pur- 
poses of school surveys.” In treating the question of county surveys, 
Dr. Cubberley gave an account of two California surveys where the 
school facilities were largely increased, high schools provided, terms 
lengthened, salaries increased, and expenses reduced $13,000 and 
$33,000 per year, respectively. The subject “Is the board of educa- 
tion an incubus upon modern education?” was discussed by R. E.
-P-A-G-E-633
    EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 613 
Blight, who said that the board of education will miss its purpose 
entirely unless it functions with four factors in view: 
(1) The schools are for the children, and not for the board or the teachers 
or for the politicians; (2) the schools must be kept free from partisan, political, 
and other special interests, particularly from the large taxpayer; (8) the board 
must restrict its activities to legislative and general supervisorial functions, 
reserving to the professional staff the actual conduct of the schools; (4) school 
boards must exhibit a real enthusiasm for education as education. 
The promotion of democracy through the enlightenment of the 
masses was the supreme test of a school board’s usefulness. 
Valuable papers on school architecture were presented. Dr. H. D. 
Sheldon read a paper on the tenure of teachers, in which he summed 
up the reasons for the insecurity of the teacher’s tenure in the United 
States. The climax to the sessions was the address of Dr. Claxton on 
“The city board of education—its constitution and function.” 
The committee on resolutions presented a declaration of principles 
dealing with the war in Europe, the peace propaganda instituted in 
the United States, and various educational problems, which were 
adopted. Attention was called to the question of differentiations in 
instruction as follows: 
It seems to this association to be a thoroughly sound and just principle that 
every child of school age in a community should be provided with that kind of 
education which will be best adapted to meet his peculiar educational needs. 
The adoption of such an educational principle, however, calls for differentiations 
and adjustments in schools and in courses of instruction and for a wide diversi- 
fication in our school work. What our schools have heretofore achieved for the 
mass they now need to set themselves to try to accomplish for groups within the 
mass. 
An appreciation of the United States Bureau of Education was 
recorded with the hope expressed that Congress by increased appro- 
priations would enable the bureau to carry on its work on a larger 
and more effective scale. 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE. 
The department of superintendence of the National Education 
Association met in Cincinnati, Ohio, February 23-27, 1915. The 
usual high average of this department was sustained. Charles H. 
Judd, in his paper on “The protection of professional interests,” 
advocated the organization of a permanent committee to act as a 
central clearing house for professional problems, with district com- 
missions cooperating with it. In addition, he recommended special 
commissions dealing with special problems, all of these commissions 
to prepare material for the general annual meeting of the department. 
The training of teachers was discussed by Calvin N. Kendall, Fred L. 
Keeler, Carroll G. Pearse, and Bruce R. Payne.
-P-A-G-E-634
  614 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Commissioner Kendall said that school systems can not rise to their 
proper level unless the main stress is put not upon administration, but 
upon good teaching. In order to verify or modify his personal con- 
victions on the training of teachers in service, Mr. Kendall sent let- 
ters to certain teachers in 10 representative school systems and to 
several progressive superintendents, inviting expressions of their 
views. In summarizing the replies received, with an admixture of 
his own opinions, he says that there seem to be two widely recognized 
means of improving teachers in service: 
1. The means that bear directly upon the art of teaching; the means that 
make for increased schoolroom efficiency this week and next week. 
2, The means employed to increase the personal worth of a teacher, to enlarge 
her interests, to improve her general scholarship, to widen her vision, to give her 
broader culture, to furnish individual resources. 
He expressed his strong convictions that, in view of prevailing 
economic and social conditions, the question of rendering teaching 
attractive can not be ignored. One reason is the competition of the 
increased number of occupations now open to women as well as men. 
The question of industrial education received marked attention. 
Arthur D. Dean read a paper on “A State program for industrial 
and social efficiency.” Charles A. Prosser, discussing the evolution 
of the training of the worker in industry, said that we must accept 
the methods of production in modern industry as a fact and adjust 
our program of action accordingly. He remarked that educators 
are realizing the fact that under modern conditions— 
the industrial education which fits the usual worker for his task and oppor- 
tunity must be a more direct and specialized training than the all-round train- 
ing for the old handcrafts. We need to-day a program of action in the pro- 
tection and education of the employed child which will set up definite goals 
toward which we may move. These goals themselves should be variable, 
which will advance with social, economic, and industrial changes and with the 
growth of a quickened public sentiment. 
The pros and cons of the Gary system were discussed by David 
Snedden. Former president of the United States, William H. Taft, 
read a paper on “Is a national standard of education practical?” 
The investigation of the efficiency of schools and school systems was 
ably treated by James H. Van Sickle, Leonard P. Ayres, Calvin N. 
Kendall, and William H. Maxwell. 
The report of the committee on “Economy of time in elemen- 
tary education—Minimum essentials of a course of study” was pre- 
sented by the chairman, Harry B. Wilson. The major portion of 
attention in the reports of the different members constituting the 
committee is devoted to a consideration of the essential content of the 
subjects of the elementary schools which are treated. 
The aim has been to determine, so far as possible, the content which is essen- 
tial to social efficiency and to suggest those standards of attainment in certain 
   
-P-A-G-E-635
    EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 615 
subjects from grade to grade which experimentation and current practice seem 
to justify. The attack throughout is positive rather than negative. The aim 
has been to determine what materials should enter into the curriculum in the 
light of social needs rather than to attempt to decide what should be omitted 
from the curriculum as it now stands, * * * The ideally constructed course 
of study for the elementary schools is clearly one stripped of all content not 
essential to the needs of modern life and organized so as to harmonize with the 
child’s growth in capacity and experience. 
Many interesting papers were read at the round-table conferences 
of State, city, and county superintendents. H. H. Wheaton, special- 
ist in immigrant education, United States Bureau of Education, dis- 
cussing the education of adult immigrants, presented some recom- 
mendations for a National, State, and city program for constructive 
work in immigrant education. “Tlliteracy and industrial efficiency 
in large cities” was discussed by Albert Shiels. 
Among the resolutions adopted by the department were the en- 
dorsement of the organization of bureaus of efficiency and educational 
measurement as adjuncts to the superintendent’s office; the more 
complete training of teachers; organization of night schools and 
continuation schools for the training of adults; the creation of a 
national university; and the bringing of popular, recreational, social, 
and civic activities within the jurisdiction of the school authorities. 
The work of the United States Bureau of Education in its various 
lines of endeavor was highly commended. 
The Department of Superintendence also met at Oakland, Cal., 
August 24, 1915, as the departmental congress on professional super- 
vision of public schools. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
The National Council of Education, under the guise of the de- 
partmental congress on educational investigations, held a meeting in 
Oakland, Cal., August 18, 1915. “The purpose of a national system 
of education” was presented by Carroll G. Pearse. The “ History 
and development of American education” was discussed by Ellwood 
P. Cubberly, Charles E. Chadsey, and Elmer E. Brown. Other inter- 
esting addresses were made by H. B. Wilson, Payson Smith, Frank 
Strong, Grace Strachan, J. Stanley Brown, and Y. P. Benton. 
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF INSTRUCTION. 
The American Institute of Instruction met in Cambridge, Mass., 
July 1-8, 1915. The opening address was delivered by Dr. Robert J. 
Aley, on the subject of “ Education and democracy.” In the confer- 
ence on school administration, presided over by Prof. Paul H. Hanus, 
many suggestive papers were read by well-known educators. Dr. Van 
Sickle presented an effective contribution on the “Superintendent 
and the school committee.” The work of the kindergarten evoked
-P-A-G-E-636
    616 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
great interest, the conference being under the leadership of Lillian 
B. Poor, assistant director of kindergartens, Boston, Mass. Dr. A. 
W. Edson, in his paper on “ Practical suggestions for child study,” 
emphasized the importance of not putting too strong pressure in any 
one direction in the training of the child. Addresses were also made 
by Catherine J. Tracey, Joseph Lee, and Prof. Henry W. Holmes. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ACCOUNTING OFFICERS. 
The fourth annual convention of the National Association of 
School Accounting Officers was held in St. Louis, Mo., May 18-20, 
1915. William J. Flynn, secretary and business manager school 
district, Erie, Pa., delivered an interesting address on “ Business 
administration in smaller districts.” William B. Ittner, architect, 
of the St. Louis board of education, discussing the “ Cost of school- 
house construction,” spoke of the strong tendency for a wider and 
more general use of school properties by the public. The material 
reorganization of schoolhouse plans was imminent. The need for 
adequate auditoriums in elementary schools was apparent. Dr. 
George W. Gerwig, secretary of the board of education, Pittsburgh, 
Pa., presented a paper on “ Units of service,” which provoked con- 
siderable discussion. Lewis E. Larson, secretary of the Chicago 
board, commenting on Dr. Gerwig’s paper, said that the time had 
arrived when the people desire to ascertain definitely what becomes 
of the money they expend in taxes. He asked: 
What can you show them, and how can you explain what you have gotten 
for their money? If you can show them by units of measurement, by stand- 
ards of service, definitely what your so-called school activities mean, then they 
will be satisfied and will gladly give you more money. 
A valuable paper was read by Edward C. Baldwin, secretary of the 
State board of education, Boston, Mass., on “Terminology of school- 
house construction and repairs.” 
A committee composed of Messrs. Lewis E. Larson, William T. 
Keough, and A. L. Clinite rendered a report on the subject of sta- 
tistical data to be used in arriving at the cost per hour of the various 
educational activities. The committee made the following recom- 
mendations: 
1. The unit cost of elementary, high, evening, special, and normal schools 
shall be computed by dividing the cost of each class of schools by the actual 
total number of pupil hours—60 minutes—of sessions held in each kind of 
schools. 
2. The total number of pupil hours’ instruction given shall be based on the 
actual total attendance and number of hours of instruction given in the build- 
ing, with the exceptions enumerated in paragraph 3 hereof. 
8. The time allowed pupils for recess, or to attend medical or dental clinics, 
shall not be deducted from the total attendance. 
4, Assumed attendance on all legal or school holidays shall not be recognized.
-P-A-G-E-637
    EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 617 
The secretary was requested to communicate with the United States 
Bureau of Education in order to secure its cooperation in carrying 
the above recommendations into effect. If such cooperation was not 
secured, the secretary was further directed to urge local boards of 
education to adopt the methods outlined. 
The report was unanimously adopted. St. Louis and Boston re- 
ported that the “pupil hour” unit had been in vogue in those cities 
for sometime. Dr. Gerwig proposed that a pupil hour be defined as 
“a period of 60 minutes in which each pupil is engaged in some 
school activity; and that an adult hour shall be a like period of 60 
minutes in which an adult may be engaged in some activity connected 
with the wider use of the school plant.” 
It was recommended and adopted that a central reference library, 
national in scope, be established to function as a clearing house for 
certain data relative to school administration. 
LEAGUE OF TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The third annual convention of the League of Teachers’ Associ- 
ations was held in Oakland, Cal., August 16-20, 1915. The president, 
Grace De Graff, summarized the work and purpose of the league 
in an effective address. The legislative committee, which has been 
making a collection of material and references pertaining to educa- 
tional legislation for the use of clubs desiring such data, reported 
progress in its work. Replies to a questionnaire, sent out during 
the year, show, among other things, that at least 14 States now have 
State-wide pension laws, while about 30 cities in other States have 
pension provisions. Twenty-eight cities report tenure of office pro- 
tection and 14 cities advisory councils. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS. 
The fourteenth annual meeting of the Association of American 
Law Schools was held in Chicago, Ill., December 28-30, 1914. Owing 
to the fact that Prof. Ehrlich was unable to be present, W. H. Page, 
of the Ohio State University College of Law, read a paper on the 
professor’s work. Prof. Ehrlich’s work has been accomplished at 
Czernowitz, in the Duchy of Bukowina, which lies to the east of 
Hungary, to the south and east of Galicia, and north of Roumania. 
The duchy is inhabited by nine different races. Said Prof. Page: 
This is the very place in which we would expect to find primitive institutions 
and customs and fragments of Archaic law preserved. Prof. Ehrlich tells us 
that in Bukowina “the old law still survives. The old law, which is the popular 
law and not the law of jurists, lives on under a thin veneer of modern statutes, 
and it dominates the transactions of people and their legal consciousness. The 
legal historian can find here not only much about which his sources are silent, 
but he can also get live points of view of many things which we generally be-
-P-A-G-E-638
  618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
lieve to belong to a time which has long passed away.” In actual practice, 
“the ancient principle of personality in law still operates; and it has been 
superseded by the principle of territoriality only on paper.” It would seem 
inevitable, therefore, that anyone who began to investigate the law of Bukowina 
as it actually is would be confronted first of all with the necessity of studying 
these surviving fragments of the old law which still persists among the people. 
What is the living law which Prof. Ehrlich studies and teaches? 
The term “living law” as used by him has a very different import from the 
same term as used by the student of the common law. If we speak of the living 
law and are thinking of the orthodox analytical meaning of the term, we mean 
the law which is now enforced by the courts as distinguished from the law of 
the past which is now obsolete, and which is of value only as a matter of 
history. 
Prof. Ehrlich speaks of the living law as that law which is not 
imprisoned in rules of law, but which dominates life itself. The 
term as used by him has a sociological rather than an analytical or 
historical sense. Prof. Ehrlich feels that— 
a study of the living law will convince the jurists of Germany that legal history 
did not end with the Romans nor with the Germans of the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries. A like study of conditions in America would convince all 
who are not already convinced that our legal history did not stop in the seven- 
teen hundreds or in the early eighteen hundreds. An enormous wealth of 
material for the student and teacher of the law, for the judge, and for the 
legislator would thus be brought to light. 
Prof. Page declared that in an undergraduate course of three 
years it was not possible to use Prof. Ehrlich’s methods directly, nor 
establish courses based upon them. Courses in pleading, evidence, 
or property could not be displaced, he said, in order to enable our 
students to investigate modern methods of production and distri- 
bution from a juristic viewpoint. “But we can, however, teach in 
Prof. Ehrlich’s spirit and modify our methods of instruction by his 
views of law.” 
A scholarly paper was presented by Prof. W. N. Hohfeld on “A 
vital school of jurisprudence and law: Have American universities 
awakened to the enlarged opportunities and responsibilities of the 
present day?” He advocated an enlarged program of work. The 
courses and activities of a true university school of jurisprudence 
and law should consist of three divisions, the latter, however, not 
being intended to be mutually exclusive or independent: (1) The 
systematic and developmental study of legal systems; (2) the pro- 
fessional and detailed study of the Anglo-American legal systems; 
and (3) the civic and cultural study of legal institutions. 
SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 
The twenty-third annual meeting of the Society for the Promotion 
of Engineering Education was held at Ames, Iowa, June 22-25, 
1915. The presidential address was delivered by Anson Mason, dean 
 
-P-A-G-E-639
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 619 
of the division of engineering, Iowa State College, his subject being 
“The relation of the engineering schools to the profession, the State, 
and the public.” He advocated the broader activities of engineer- 
ing schools, and emphasized the fact that such schools do not fulfill 
their duties by the training of “ efficient” engineers alone. He said: 
The real object of the engineering schools is to advance engineering science, 
and so to disseminate engineering knowledge throughout the world as thereby 
to increase production, to diminish its cost and the cost of distribution, to pro- 
mote health, convenience, safety, and enjoyment, and to educate and protect 
every citizen in all his rights which are in any way affected by engineering 
principles or practice. 
He recommended the formation of engineering extension depart- 
ments to assist local trade schools. In regard to State-supported 
engineering schools, the State has a right to demand effective assist- 
ance in the development of its industries. He said: 
Such assistance can most effectively be rendered through the medium of 
engineering experiment stations, devoted especially to the scientific investigation 
of the technical problems of their separate States. Such stations are already 
rendering invaluable service, which is provided for in no other way in America. 
One of the significant aspects of the meeting was the organiza- 
tion and formulation of the work of the institutional delegates, which 
make for the unifying and standardizing of engineering education. 
Dean C. L. Corey presented a paper on “ The education of the future 
engineer” and Prof. W. S. Bauer a paper on “ Class and laboratory 
work in engineering.” Dr. J. A. L. Waddell spoke on “Some im- 
portant questions in engineering education.” 
CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The twelfth annual meeting of the Catholic Educational Associa- 
tion was held in St. Paul, Minn., June 28 to July 1, 1915. The 
president general of the association, Bishop Shahan, reviewed the 
educational work of the year. Monsignor McDevitt, in discussing 
the relations of the state to education, dwelt on the school provi- 
sions of the Massachusetts Colony as early as 1642. He emphasized 
the fact that religious education was then deemed imperative, and 
he deplored the modifications that have crept in since that period. 
He spoke of the national ordinance of 1787, which declared that 
“religion, morality, and knowledge” were necessary to good gov- 
ernment. Rev. Edwin V. O’Hara presented a paper on the bearing 
of present social problems upon education in which he advocated 
the continuation school and industrial education. He said: 
Heretofore America has been a huge stevedore, a mighty longshoreman, 
bearing down to the ships of the sea crude and semicrude materials for the 
employment of the capital, labor, and intellect of foreign nations. But the 
limit of exploitation of our natural resources has been reached, and our un-

trained workmen are marching unemployed, empty handed, and sullen within 
the gates of every American city from Seattle to Baltimore. 
The seminary department, in its initial meeting, convened in joint | 
session with the college department for the discussion of the mutual 
relations between seminary and college. In the parish-school de- 
partment the content of the curriculum was discussed. Father 
Costello spoke of the unique plan of Gary, Ind., where children 
of Catholic parents are free to attend churches during the audi- 
torium hour for religious instruction. He urged the cooperation 
of pastors to further the movement. Among the resolutions passed 
was one exhorting Catholic parents— 
to make every sacrifice that children may attain the highest education in high 
school and college and may fill the ranks of every honorable profession. But 
as, for the larger number of our people, this higher education is unhappily 
not possible, the association deprecates the overloading of the curriculum, the 
multiplication of subjects, the introduction of new and untried methods and 
means to the exclusion of the solid essentials of education. 
The association recommends that every Catholic, especially our educational 
authorities, scrutinize carefully and limit strictly all attempts at legislation 
which would interfere with our educational liberties as citizens and would 
introduce class legislation under the guise of social welfare. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE—SECTION L, 
The American Association for the Advancement of Science— 
Section L—met in Berkeley, Cal., August 3 and 4, 1915. There was 
a joint session of Sections H and L and the American Psychological 
Association on August 8. Among the papers read were the follow- 
ing: “Some recent developments in the testing of intelligence,” by 
Louis N. Terman; “Test upon students of Reed College, with refer-

prospective students of stenography,” by Le Roy W. Fike; and 
“Various degrees of success in public-school training of mental de- 
fectives,” by Mrs. V. C. Hicks. 
The meetings of Section L were devoted to the scientific study of 
educational problems. Among the able papers presented were: 
“Measuring progress in Latin,” by Paul H. Hanus; “Management 
of the speech defect problem in the public schools,” by Walter B. 
Swift; “The vitalizing principle in education,” by Edward J. Kunze; 
“Ability of Porto Rican children in learning English,” by L. A. 
Robinson; “Survey of industries in mechanical occupations in New 
Orleans by the division of educational research,” by David S. Hill, ete. 
AMERICAN SCHOOL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION. 
The eighth annual congress of the American School Hygiene Asso- 
ciation was held in San Francisco, June 25 and 26, 1915. This was 
the first separate meeting of the association since 1912, the meeting 
 
-P-A-G-E-641
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 621 
for 1913 having been incorporated with the Buffalo International 
Congress of School Hygiene.. The convention of 1914 was to have 
been held in connection with the International Congress of Child 
Labor in Philadelphia, but subsequently was abandoned, owing to 
the European war. Papers were read giving the results of original 
investigation; accounts of recent developments in the practical con-- 
duct of school hygiene; and the best methods of securing effective co- 
operation of the home, the school, and the medical and dental pro- 
fessions. : 
Dr. Walter S. Cornell offered a plan for the grading of school 
buildings, which involves the use of a “point scale,” similar to the 
scales used in measuring intelligence. Dr. Samuel G. Dixon, com- 
missioner of health, Harrisburg, Pa., presented statistics showing the 
results of the most comprehensive study of rural school children 
which has yet been made in the United States. The data collected 
offer remarkable evidence that the generally accepted idea as to the 
superior physical conditions among rural children compared with 
urban children has no foundation in fact. 
Dr. D. C. Hall read a paper on the prevalence of goiter among 
school children in some sections of the Northwest, showing that it 
is a disease of the school period and entirely preventable. Dr. W. P. 
Lucas urged the necessity of cooperation of departments of pediatrics 
with the departments of education in universities. Education must 
go hand in hand with medical research. Dr. Elizabeth W. Allison 
gave the results of an interesting study of the health conditions 
among candidates for the teaching profession attending normal 
schools; and Dr. Anna W. Williams presented a paper on amebic 
infections in the mouths of school children of New York City. 
SOCIETY OF COLLEGE TEACHERS OF EDUCATION. 
The Society of College Teachers of Education met in Cincinnati, 
February 23, 1915. The committee on school survey was requested 
to furnish for the next meeting a formulation of the principles which 
should underlie the making of school surveys and to make a “sur- 
vey of surveys” for the current year. It was also decided to ap- 
point a committee to study and formulate guiding principles and 
standards relating to the requirements of teachers’ State certificates 
based on graduation from colleges and universities. It was under- 
stood that this committee should work from the standpoint of the 
institutions represented in the society. The society approved of the 
establishment of a committee on terminology, composed of six mem- 
bers representing respectively the spheres of administration, phys- 
iology, hygiene, and tests, secondary education, elementary educa- 
tion, and the technique of teaching and general educational theory.

ASSOCIATION OF HISTORY TEACHERS OF THE MIDDLE STATES AND 
MARYLAND. 
The meeting of the Association of History Teachers of the Middle 
States and Maryland was held in Trenton and Princeton, N. J., and 
New York City, May 2, and November 28, 1914. The subject of the 
teaching of local history in schools was discussed by Calvin N. Ken- 
dall and Edwin E. Slosson. Mr. Kendall thought that good supple- 
mentary reading as a part of the regular exercises in reading was a 
good way to acquire knowledge of local history. “Local history,” 
he said, “is the sort of history which functions in the life of every 
boy and girl in the community.” He also advocated the dramatic 
presentation of history. Arthur C. Howland read a paper on “ The 
teaching of military history in the schools,” in which he said that 
one of the great purposes of the teacher must be to stimulate interest 
in the subject. Military history does appeal strongly to the vast 
number of students, and satisfies a craving for action in history. 
Samuel Burnett Howe delivered an address on “Should military 
history be taught in our schools and colleges?” He thought too 
much emphasis was placed on military history, and made a plea for 
the economic and social phases of national development. “ History 
in the country church” was discussed by William H. Allison. In a 
paper on “ History teachers for secondary schools,” William Fairley 
dwelt on the complaint, nation-wide, of the difficulty of obtaining 
teachers of history for secondary schools, and gave a résumé of the 
qualifications necessary to succeed in this neglected field. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
STATES, 
The twentieth annual meeting of the Association of Colleges and 
Secondary Schools of the Southern States was held in Charlottes- 
ville, Va., October 22-23, 1914. The presidential address was de- 
livered by J. Carter Williams, who took as his subject “The pro- 
visional standing of teachers.” “For several years,” he said, “we 
have been at work making up a list of accredited schools. I propose 
the equally important work of making a list of accredited teachers.” 
He suggested the formation of a guild of teachers of the Southern 
States which shall be a sort of honor roll, primary conditions of 
membership being an academic degree from a college of good stand- 
ing, supplemented by not less than five years of successful teaching. 
The teaching of modern languages in southern colleges was dis- 
cussed by W. H. Faulkner and Glen L. Swiggett. Papers on economy 
of time in education were presented by Frederick P. Keppel and

William F. Russell.- The status of the private school in the South 
received attention from William H. Davis and Thomas S. Baker. 
The report of the representative of the association at the seventh 
conference of the national conference committee on standards of col- 
leges and secondary schools, held in New York February 28, 1914, 
was read. A resolution was adopted approving the plan of the Com- 
missioner of Education whereby the Bureau of Education will foster 
the promotion of secondary education and the standardization of 
high schools. The hearty cooperation of the association was pledged. 
The report of the commission on accredited schools was presented 
by the chairman, J. S. Stewart. Among the benefits resulting from 
the influence of the commission upon the schools the following may 
be cited: (1) There has been shown an improvement in the teaching 
force; (2) there has been marked improvement in decreasing the 
average number of students to the teacher; (3) an improvement in 
decreasing the number of classes to the teacher; (4) increased equip- 
ment of the laboratories, ete. 
The English committee suggested that— 
three units of credit for three years’ satisfactory work in English be allowed 
and four units for four years’ satisfactory work, the weak schools giving four 
years in English to be limited to three units, and that further study of contents 
of several subjects in the English department be made before definite require- 
ments are announced. 
The mathematics committee reported that no change should be 
made in the present unit requirements, but requested that a commit- 
tee be instructed to urge upon the national conference committee the 
advisability of giving algebra the value of two units. 
CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS TEACHERS. 
The fourteenth meeting of the Central Association of Science and 
Mathematics Teachers was held in Chicago, November 27-28, 1914. 
The address of welcome to the association was delivered by Dr. Ella 
Flagg Young, who dwelt on the development of greater power in 
scientific imagination to train minds to rise to the larger and greater 
things. The response in behalf of the association was made by 
Marie Gugle. The meetings of the various sections of the associa- 
tion were productive of many interesting contributions to knowledge. 
Carl Colvin’s paper on “'The fighting chance of agriculture” was 
followed by a spirited discussion. In the biology section an able 
paper was read by Prof. F. T. Ulrich on “The present status of 
botanical teaching in the normal schools.” The report of the com- 
mittee on practical experiments in chemistry was presented by the 
chairman, H. R. Smith. The point was emphasized that the teacher
-P-A-G-E-644

with questions of every-day interest. A suggestive paper on “ What 
chemistry should a girl have who expects to become a teacher of 
domestic science?” was read by G. C. Ashman. C. M. Wirick gave 
must have the student bring his study of chemistry into direct contact 
“A critical analysis of the merits of recent textbooks in chemistry.” 
In the earth science section, W. S. Tower spoke of “The purpose 
of political geography,” which is to show how the various elements 
in a country work together in the life of the nation which occupies 
that country. Political geography is really the geographic inter- 
pretation of peoples. 
A report was rendered in the mathematics section on “ vocational 
mathematics,” which term includes all branches of mathematics as 
applied to the problems of different vocations. The report embraced 
the work of the continuation schools of Wisconsin and the Chicago 
public schools. The following conclusions were drawn: 
(1) Specialized courses for different trades are being given at the 
present time in special schools or special courses. 
(2) Mathematics courses specialized in the trades are not given in 
academic high schools. 
(3) Specialization in public-school classes for those who have not 
chosen their life work is neither necessary nor desirable. 
(4) Specialization is necessary and desirable for those who have 
chosen their life work and are in attendance at trade, continuation, 
or evening schools. 
In the physics section an illustrated lecture on “ Sound waves,” by 
Arthur L. Foley, created a great impression. The pictures com- 
pletely verified Huygens’s theory. Every picture exemplified in a 
striking manner what is meant by “centers of disturbance,” “ wave- 
lets,” “radius of curvature,” ete. 
A number of interesting papers were read in the home economics 
section. A resolution was adopted to appoint a committee of five 
to deal with the terminology of courses in the high school in home 
economics, the report to be made at the meeting in 1915. 
CONFERENCE OF ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS IN RELATIONS WITH THE 
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 
The twenty-seventh conference of academies and high schools in 
relations with the University of Chicago was held in Chicago April 
16, 1915. “The relation of the organized library to the school” was 
the theme for discussion. The conference was subdivided into 15 
sections, organized, respectively, around subjects of mutual concern 
to colleges and to secondary schools. Following the sessions of the 
departmental sections a conference of school and university ad- 
ministrative officers was held, the following subjects being discussed : 
(1) The granting of college credit at the University of Chicago for
-P-A-G-E-645
         EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 625 
studies completed in the high schools in excess of the 15 units re- 
quired for entrance to college; (2) Excess credit for college entrance 
for high-school work done at a high level of excellence. The first 
topic was presented by Dean Angell, of the University of Chicago, 
and Principal Sims, of the high school at South Bend, Ind.; the 
second topic by Principal Johnson, of the University high school; 
Giles, of De Kalb, Tl.; and Newton, of Decatur, Ill. 
Arthur E. Bostwick’s paper on “ School libraries and mental train- 
ing” was an illuminating presentation of the subject. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
The nineteenth annual meeting of the National Association of 
State Universities in the United States of America was held in 
Washington, D. C., November 9-10, 1914. In his presidential ad- 
dress Dr. T. F. Kane, speaking of the demand by foreign students 
on our universities on account of war conditions in Europe, dwelt on 
the service a national university could have rendered to the cause 
of higher education at such a time. In regard to the problems of 
the junior college and the organization of the secondary school the 
committee on reorganization of education came to the following 
conclusion: 
If the purposes of the superintendents, who report at the Cincinnati meeting 
of the National Council of Education in February, 1915, can be brought about, 
the problems of the junior college and the organization of the secondary school 
are materially modified and must be approached from a different point of view 
than that now evidenced in the plans to make two years of academic college 
work the basis of admission to professional schools. * * * Should not this 
committee cooperate in the work of reducing the curricula content of the 
grades, while at the same time asking for the adoption of the senior and junior 
high school, the former assuming the two years now known as the freshman 
and sophomore years of college? 
In this process there are several steps that can be taken: (1) Cut down the 
work of the eight grades to six; (2) make the junior high school out of the 
first, second, and third years of the present high school; (3) create a senior 
high school of the present fourth year of the high school and the first and sec- 
ond years of college. The universities of this association can hasten this move- 
ment by getting out of the way of the senior high school and organizing the 
junior college. 
The topic of educational surveys was elaborately treated. Dr. 
P. P. Claxton discussed “College surveys.” President Edwin B. 
Craighead, of the University of Montana, speaking of “ State control 
of all higher education,” thought that Congress should appoint an 
educational commission, which, in conjunction with the great educa- 
tors of the country, would be of vast service. President Charles W. 
Dabney, of the University of Cincinnati, made a plea for the mu- 
nicipal university.

  SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE WOMEN. 
The twelfth annual meeting of the Southern Association of College 
Women was held in Atlanta, Ga., April 22-24, 1915. The report of 
the committee on standards of colleges was presented by Emily H. 
Dutton, chairman. The statement was made that “in the 17 States 
within the territory of the association there are still 375 or more in- 
stitutions calling themselves colleges, only 31 of which are members 
of the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern 
States, and, with the exception of a few others in the border States, 
i. e., Missouri, Kentucky, and also the District of Columbia, these are 
the only ones that can be said fully to meet the southern standards 
for a college.” 
Elizabeth Avery Colton, in her presidential address, dwelt on the 
misuse of the term “junior college.” “An institution,” she said, 
“that is merely a weak, struggling college, or finishing school, is not 
a junior college. With the exception of those in Missouri, there are 
really no junior colleges in the South.” Miss Colton stated that the 
_ association was preparing tables for high-school girls and their 
parents, grouping all institutions for women in each State under the 
following heads: 
1. Standard colleges—that is, those recognized by the Association of Colleges 
of the Southern States. 
2.’ Approximate colleges—institutions not fully coming up to the standard set 
by the Southern College Association. 
8. Finishing schools—institutions offering one or two years of work in advance 
of a high school, but not giving any real college courses. 
4, Nominal colleges—finishing schools claiming to be colleges. 
5, Normal schools—institutions whose main object is the training of students 
in methods of teaching. 
The topic of the “ Provision made by southern standard colleges 
for the education of women” was discussed by Dr. W. A. Webb, 
Emily H. Dutton, and May L. Keller. 
MUSIC TEACHERS’ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-sixth annual meeting of the Music Teachers’ National 
Association was held in Pittsburgh, Pa., December 29-30, 1914. The 
public school conference was devoted to two topics: “Credits in 
secondary schools for outside music study,” and “The high-school 
orchestra as a means of increasing interest in instrumental music.” 
Will Earhart, speaking of the high-school orchestra, advocated 
courses in harmony, musical history, and appreciation, in addition 
to orchestral ensemble, in the high schools. He said it would result 
in the bringing into our national life “a quality and a degree of 
musicianship that chorus-practice alone, even of a good kind, valu-
-P-A-G-E-647

able and beautiful as it certainly is, can never produce.” Mr. Me- 
Conathy dwelt on the necessity of regarding the work accomplished 
in music under private teachers as equivalent to work in other high- 
school subjects. Waldo S. Pratt spoke on “The problems of stand- 
ardization.” 
NATIONAL COMMERCIAL TEACHERS’ FEDERATION. 
The eighteenth annual convention of the National Commercial 
Teachers’ Federation was held in Chicago, Ill., December 28-31, 
1914. One of the speakers at the general federation session was Dr. 
S. P. Capen, of the United States Bureau of Education, who em- 
phasized the importance of commercial education and the problems, 
pedagogical and administrative, which are waiting solution in that 
field. He dwelt on the attempt of the bureau to obtain complete 
and reliable statistics from private commercial schools, and the diffi- 
culty experienced. He urged the federation to bring about a better 
cooperation between such institutions and the national bureau. 
The federation is composed of the following six constituent asso- 
ciations, the sessions of which were well attended: National Private 
School Managers’ Association, National Business Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, National Shorthand Teachers’ Association, National Penman- 
ship Teachers’ Association, National High School Commercial 
Teachers’ Association, and National Stenotype Teachers’ Association. 
A resolution was adopted directing the president of the federa- 
tion to appoint a committee of five to cooperate with other national 
organizations of business men and educators for the advancement 
of commercial education; to perfect standards that will be authori- 
tative; and to effect the establishment of a division of commercial 
education in the United States Bureau of Education. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE 
STATES AND MARYLAND. 
The twenty-eighth annual convention of the Association of Col- 
leges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland 
was held in New York, November 27-28, 1914. The general topic, 
“Has the unit system fostered or retarded sound education?” was 
discussed by Arthur H. Quinn, Henry C. Pearson, and W. A. Robin- 
son. Dean Quinn, of the University of Pennsylvania, said that the 
advantages of the unit system lie in its inflexibility, in its usefulness 
in accrediting students who transfer from one college to another, 
and the demand of students to graduate in three years. Heremarked: 
The basic evil of this system in the college lies in the effect it has on some 
students, who acquire the habit of looking upon their studies as so many 
“units ” which they must take before they can obtain their degrees rather than 
as elements of their education.  
-P-A-G-E-648
  | 
628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
j 
Prof. W. A. Robinson, of Lawrenceville School, declared that the 
adoption of the new unit has greatly simplified the work of the 
preparatory schools in planning the work of prospective candidates 
for college entrance, but it must not be forgotten, however, that such 
a standard has marked limitations. “It is true that the element of 
time is of great importance in fixing the relative value of a course 
of study. But, after all, it is only one factor, and the others are so 
elusive and various that they defy any attempt at standardization.” 
The unit system does not tell us what has been taught nor how the 
subject has been taught. In measuring units we are dealing with “a 
mechanical standard which takes no account of teachers or subjects 
or methods.” 
“ What standards should be used in the classification of colleges” 
was discussed by Samuel P. Capen, Rush Rhees, and James D. Mof- 
fatt. A resolution was adopted that the executive committee of the 
association appoint a representative to serve as a member of a com- 
mittee with other associations having to do with higher education, 
to discuss with the United States Commissioner of Education “the 
advisability of classifying colleges according to their standards and 
equipment, and, if deemed desirable, to decide upon a method of 
rating and to cooperate with the United States Bureau of Education 
in preparing classified lists.” 
The committee on comprehensive examinations reported that it 
had agreed upon the following definition: “A comprehensive exami- 
nation is understood to be one covering the whole field of a par- 
ticular subject, or group of related subjects, studied during a con- 
siderable period of time.” Recommendations were made as follows: 
1. Graduate and professional studies.—In the case of candidates for higher 
degrees the thesis submitted should be supplemented by a thorough and com- 
prehensive examination covering the entire field of the candidate’s study. 
In the case of certain professions, such as medicine and dentistry, a practical 
examination, testing the candidate’s ability to make use of his acquired knowl- 
edge, is desirable. In other professions it is desirable that there should be a 
comprehensive examination which may include problems that will test the 
practical power of the candidate. 
2. College and university studies—Comprehensive examinations are essential 
for honor courses such as have been recently established in Harvard, Yale, and 
Princeton, and they are desirable in major courses where any study is pursued 
for several years. The principle is applicable, also, to all studies that are pur- 
. Sued more than one term, in which case the examination at the close of the 
year would cover the essential points of the entire year’s work. 
8. Secondary school studies—In secondary school work comprehensive ex- 
aminations would be of two types: 
(a) In subjects completed in a single year. 
(b) In subjects carried on continuously through several years. 
In both cases the term examination should be supplemented at the close of 
the course by a comprehensive examination covering the important points of 
the entire course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-649
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 629 
In the case of pupils who might be able to do the work satisfactorily from 
day to day, but who might not have the power to pass a comprehensive ex- 
amination on the work of a year or several years, there should be a differen- 
tiation from the regular pupils doing full work. Such pupils may wisely be 
continued in the class, and receive at the close a certificate of faithful work 
and reasonable attainment, without being awarded the regular diploma of the 
school. 
4, Admission to college.—Attention is particularly called to the new method 
of admission recently inaugurated by Harvard and adopted with some modifi- 
cations by other institutions. By this plan a student who is certified as hav- 
ing completed a satisfactory school course is examined in only four subjects, 
the examinations in these being distinctly of a character that may be called 
comprehensive. The plan, though still only in the experimental stage, appears 
to mark a decided advance on the present method of piecemeal entrance ex- 
aminations, and is worthy of most careful consideration. 
The committee to investigate the comparative excellence of the 
records made in college by students entering upon certificate and 
upon examination, respectively, through the chairman, A. L. Jones, 
made a preliminary report. Five institutions coming within the field 
of the association were selected, three admitting on certificate and 
two requiring examinations. The results of the investigation, so 
far as a comparison of the two methods is concerned, is inconclusive ; 
but a few things are certain, namely: “ Lax administration of either 
entrance plan makes it almost worthless; low standards and care- 
less administration within the college will show unsatisfactory results 
whatever the method of admission.” 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL FACULTIES. 
The thirty-second annual meeting of the National Association of 
Dental Faculties was held in Ann Arbor, Mich., January 25, 1915. 
Dr. H. E. Friesell, in a paper on “Is it desirable to have a survey of 
the dental colleges; and if so, how should it be accomplished? ” advo- 
cated a thorough and impartial survey of the dental schools of the 
United States as a basis for formulating “a reasonable standard 
that any school must maintain to insure its right to existence or recog- 
nition as a reputable dental school.” 
Dr. Henry W. Morgan presented a plan for the supervision of re- 
quirements for entrance into dental colleges. 
LAKE MOHONK CONFERENCE OF FRIENDS OF THE INDIAN AND OTHER 
DEPENDENT PEOPLES. 
The Lake Mohonk Conference of Friends of the Indian and Other 
Dependent Peoples met at Mohonk Lake, N. Y., October 20-22, 1915. 
Samuel A. Eliot, member of the United States Board of Indian Com- 
missioners, presided. O. H. Lipps, superintendent of the Carlisle 
Indian School, discussed agricultural work among the Indians.  
-P-A-G-E-650
  630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Other speakers on Indian affairs were Frederick A. Cleveland, direc- 
tor of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research; Arthur C. 
Parker, New York State archeologist and secretary of the Society 
of American Indians; Robert G. Valentine, ex-Commissioner of In- 
dian Affairs; J. Weston Allen, of Boston, member of the Boston 
Indian citizenship committee; and Jewell D. Martin, supervisor of 
the United States Indian Service in charge of the Fort Belknap 
agency at Harlem, Mont. 
Gov. Arthur Yager, of Porto Rico, dwelt on social and political 
conditions in Porto Rico, and urged the passage of the new organic 
act to take the place of the temporary Foraker Act, passed by Con- 
gress in 1900, which became effective in 1901. Dr. D. W. May, 
superintendent of the Porto Rico Experiment Station, emphasizing 
the wretchedness of the agricultural laborer, suggested as a remedy 
education and the development of small industries which would 
enable the lower classes in the country district to support themselves 
in some other manner than working on the coffee and sugar planta- 
tions. Addresses were made also by Manuel V. Domenech, Porto 
Rican commissioner of interior; Jorge Dominguez, of San Juan, 
member of the insular board of health; Howard L. Kern, attorney 
general of Porto Rico; and the Rev, Dr. H. K. Carroll, resident 
Washington agent of the Home Missions Council and Federal Coun- 
cil of Churches, and formerly United States commissioner to Porto 
Rico. 
The subject of education in the Philippines was ably discussed 
by Frank L. Crone, director of education in the Philippine Islands. 
He dwelt on the courses of study, which are divided into units, 
permitting pupils to leave school, if compelled to do so, at certain 
periods with something definite accomplished which goes far toward 
meeting their life needs. Despite the progress made, there still re- 
mains a large number of Filipino children of school age unprovided 
for under the present system. 
THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The twelfth annual convention of the Religious Education Associa- 
tion was held in Buffalo, N. Y., March 3-7, 1915. Particular interest 
was manifested in the meetings of the commissions of the department 
of Sunday schools. Reports were read on Sunday school nomen- 
clature, psychological data, and on social relations of youth to the 
church. The meetings of the council were devoted to reports on 
“The training and supply of professional workers in religious educa- 
tion.” The findings of the council were presented in the following 
statement: 
A new profession, that of religious educator, is springing up—a profession 
which, like that of public education, has several branches. There are 135
-P-A-G-E-651
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 631 
directors of religious education; 304 full-time workers employed by religious 
bodies in editorial, administrative, and field work in religious education; 189 
full-time secretaries-in the International Sunday School Association; over 330 
boys’ work secretaries in Christian associations; and a score of instructors and 
professors giving their entire time to religious education in colleges, universi- 
ties, and theological seminaries. In addition, there is a large group of instruc- 
tors of religious education in training schools for lay workers, and there are 
several hundred part-time workers in various fields. 
But adequate training for professional work in religious education is rare. 
What is more serious, present opportunities for such training are utterly inade- 
quate to meet the need. Enormous waste of resources is one result. Buildings, 
equipment, and human labor are not controlled by knowledge that already exists 
and should be made available. The children, the church, and the society that 
is to be are the ultimate losers. 
We must free ourselves from the fallacy that the training of workers in 
religious education consists in transmitting to them_a set of cut and dried 
devices. Our problems require scientific methods for their solution; our leaders 
must have professional training and the professional spirit. Those who attain 
this standard should receive recognition as specialists; they should have dis- 
cretion and the right of initiative in their respective fields; they should receive 
professional compensation which must ever include provision for growth 
through books, travel, conventions, and study courses. Further, our churches 
must learn that religious education requires equipment in buildings, libraries, 
and teaching materials and apparatus, and that all expenditures in the field 
of religious education should be controlled by the best available knowledge as 
to what religious education is. 
For the training and supply of professional workers we must look chiefly to 
educational institutions that owe their existence to religious motives. We have 
repeatedly requested such colleges to give courses in the rudiments of religious 
education, to the end that our educated laymen may know something of real 
life in home and church. Many colleges have responded to these requests, and 
the responses are increasing. _We now urge a further step. It is that the 
privately endowed colleges adopt at once the policy of ultimately giving to re- 
ligious education as extended and thorough treatment as they give to public 
education. Whatever theories are held as to the proper aim of the college cur- 
riculum, the fact is that preparation for a license to teach in the schools of the 
State is now provided in a large proportion of the colleges that were founded 
in the interest of religion. Let these colleges prepare to offer equal preparation 
to teach religion. This will result not only in sending college graduates back 
to their home churches ready to do a layman’s work, but also in laying a foun- 
dation for advanced courses on the part of the few who should go forward to

The following declaration of principles, prepared by a committee 
consisting of George A. Coe, Francis G. Peabody, Frederick Tracy, 
and George B. Stewart, was unanimously adopted by the convention: 
This convention, called to consider “ the rights of the child,” is evidence that 
the conscience of the people is awakening to the fact that society is wronging 
its most defenseless members. 
Society does not yet effectively recognize the right to be well born. The pre- 
ventable physical defects with which multitudes of children start life are an 
invasion of rights more serious than attacks of highwaymen. 
Society does not yet effectively recognize the right of children to real mothers 
and real fathers, or the right to be trained through responsibilities. 
Society does not yet effectively recognize the right of the child to health. 
It does not fully recognize the right to grow. Powers for growth and for 
human happiness are being turned into commercial assets. 
Society does not effectively recognize the right of the child to be educated. 
Witness the insufficient accommodations in our schools, the elimination of pupils, 
the early entrance into industries. 
Society does not effectively recognize the right to character. We condemn 
certain people of antiquity for exposing infants to the natural elements, but we 
expose American children to moral contagion—and we do it for gain. 
Society does not effectively recognize the right of children to the religious 
heritage of the race. We are as yet at the beginning of the problem of pro- 
viding religious education for the children of the whole Nation. We rejoice 
at the multiplying efforts of churches to give to the children of whole communi- 
ties instruction in religion, comparable in method and in continuity to instruc- 
tion in the public schools. 
Our problem requires cooperation between the public school, the home, the 
churches, agencies of philanthropy and reform like the National Child-Labor 
Committee, the civic authorities, and right-minded individuals. 
We can not save ourselves unless we save the children. Everyone of our 
great social wrongs bears most heavily upon them. Militarism means bringing 
children into the world to hate one another, and then to be shot to death. Sexual 
immorality reveals the depth of its meaning in its ruthless effects upon all that 
is vital to healthy, happy, and morally growing childhood. The economic in- 
justice under which our people smart wrongs the children most of all, for it robs 
them at once of home and health and the right to be children until the normal 
period for assuming the responsibility of self-support. The inequalities of our 
laws as between the sexes imply this most of all—that a part of the natural 
protection and guidance of children is withheld. 
We declare that this situation calls upon our whole people to repent, and to 
resolve that, through homes and churches, through occupations and industrial 
relations, through civic and community life; through cooperation with child- 
helping agencies, and through the exercise of the rights of citizenship, the full 
rights of the child shall be recognized and secured.

CONFERENCE ON THE EDUCATION OF BACKWARD, TRUANT, DELINQUENT, 
AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN, 
The Conference on the Education of Backward, Truant, Delin- 
quent, and Dependent Children was held in Memphis, Tenn., May 
6-8, 1914. Franklin H. Nibecker summed up the results of 10 years 
of the conference. F. J. Sessions, in a paper on the “ Dependent 
child in the institution,” emphasized the point that the drink evil 
was the most prolific cause of juvenile dependency. Institutional 
experiences have large possibilities in determining the final success 
or failure of children subject thereto; much depends upon the “ fol- 
low-up” service rendered them. Calvin Derrick read a thoughtful 
paper entitled “The training of juvenile delinquents for citizen- 
ship,” in which he declared that the ideal as well as the practical 
training for institutional children demands that “they shall live on 
terms of almost social equality with the people in charge.” He con- 
demned the present reformatory system of training for delinquent 
boys— 
(1) Because it attempts to deal with too large numbers; (2) be- 
cause it is unnecessarily repressive and crushing, constantly dealing 
with the offenses rather than the offenders; (8) because the system 
and also the practice combine to render the boy’s industrial education 
problematical—it is not a certainty; (4) because it permits the boy 
to be paroled when it is well known that he can not honestly main- 
tain a decent standard of living, and that his inefficiency makes it 
probable that he can not hold his job; (5) because it tolerates an 
untrained low grade of employees, often little or no better than the 
boys themselves. 
Dr. H. H. Hart spoke on the “ Menace of the feeble-minded.” 
SOUTHERN CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY. 
The Southern Conference for Education and Industry met in 
Chattanooga, Tenn., April 27-80, 1915. The conference is the result 
of a merger of the Conference for Education in the South, the 
Southern Education Board, and the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion. The constitution adopted provides for maintenance from active, 
associate, and sustaining members. An executive board was elected 
for stated terms of service. The various groups dealing with agricul- 
tural problems organized the Southern Agricultural Association to 
form a constituent body of the conference. Largely attended meetings 
of the Southern Industrial Council resulted in a. permanent organiza- 
tion to further a “unit” program for the educational and industrial 
development of the South. Representatives of the leading women’s 
organizations, both social and religious, together with representative
-P-A-G-E-654
  634 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
women, organized the Conference of Southern Women to bring about 
the cooperation of clubs and other agencies in working out the “ unit ” 
program of the conference. For the first time, representatives of 
practically all of the greater denominational agencies—Sunday 
school, home and foreign missions—gathered in the Country Church 
Conference to formulate plans full of promise for cooperation in a 
movement for the country church and country life. The college con- 
ference, attended by representatives of practically all of the leading 
colleges throughout the South agreed upon a far-reaching plan for 
readjusting the college curriculum to meet the needs of modern in- 
dustry, and the teachers’ conference made provision for working out 
a scheme of home activities to be made a regular part of the school 
course. 
All the groups, meeting in a joint conference, heard accounts of 
community building by workers from all parts of the South that . 
inspired the audience with a constructive zeal that must needs yield 
widespread results. 
At its first session in June, 1915, the executive board formulated 
the conclusions and resolutions of the conference into a constructive 
program to bring the thought and experience of the entire South 
into the service of each community. It was the judgment of the 
board that the task of the hour centers largely upon the organization 
and development of community leagues for cultural and industrial 
development, looking to the creation of social units as sources of 
strength for the Commonwealth.

  CHAPTER XXVI. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE NATIVES OF ALASKA AND FOR 
INDIANS. 
EDUCATION FOR THE NATIVES OF ALASKA. 
By WiLtiaM Hami.ton, Alaskan Assistant, Bureau of Education. 
During the year 1914-15 the field force of the Alaska school serv- 
ice consisted of 5 superintendents, 1 assistant superintendent, 97 
teachers, 7 physicians, and 8 nurses. Sixty-seven schools were main- 
tained, with an enrollment of about 3,500; complete reports have not 
yet been received from the schools on the shores of Behring Sea and 
the Arctic Ocean. 
In addition to maintaining schools for the native children in 
Alaska, the bureau has continued its endeavors in behalf of the 
entire native communities by extending medical relief, by main- 
taining sanitary methods of living in the villages, by promoting the 
industries conducted by the natives, and by relieving destitution. 
Of the appropriation for “ Education of natives of Alaska for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 1915,” more than $25,000 was used in em- 
ploying seven physicians and eight nurses; in maintaining improvised 
hospitals at Nulato, Kotzebue, and Kanakanak; in payments under 
contracts with St. Ann’s Hospital at Juneau, with the Good Samari- 
tan Hospital at Valdez, with the Holy Cross Hospital at Nome, with 
the Fairhaven Hospital at Candle, and with the Children’s 
Orthopedic Hospital at Seattle, for the treatment of natives; also, 
as heretofore, in furnishing the teachers of the United States public 
schools with medical supplies and medical books in order to enable 
them to treat minor ailments. The efforts of the bureau to secure 
from Congress a specific appropriation to provide for the medical 
and sanitary relief of the natives of Alaska have met with suc- 
cess, $25,000 having been granted for that purpose for the fiscal year 
1915-16. 
Much of the sickness prevailing among the natives of Alaska is 
caused by the eating of food which has not been properly prepared. 
The waters of Alaska teem with fish, and wild berries grow in pro- 
fusion throughout its vast area, but in many villages, according to 
the ancient practice, fish for winter use are either dried in the sun, 
crudely smoked, or buried in the earth, while the berries are pre- 
served in oil. In order to replace these primitive methods, during 
635  
-P-A-G-E-656
  636 © EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
the summer of 1914 steam home canning outfits for use in preserv- 
ing fish and meat, as well as berries and vegetables, were sent to 
three of the largest villages. It is hoped that the use of such out- 
fits will become general in the native communities. 
One of the most effective agencies for the advancement in civiliza- 
tion of a native village is the establishment in it of a cooperative 
store owned by. the natives and managed by them, under the super- 
vision of a teacher of a United States public school, resulting in the 
securing of articles of food and clothing at equitable prices, the 
dividing among the natives themselves of profits which would other- 
wise go to a white trader, and in the acquiring by the natives of self- 
confidence and experience in business affairs. It is most encouraging 
to note the ability which the natives have shown in conducting these 
enterprises. According to the district superintendent, the income 
of the village of Atka has increased 150 per cent because of the 
establishment of its cooperative store. The cooperative stores at 
Hydaburg, Klawock, Klukwan, and on St. Lawrence Island have 
also met with success. 
In continuation of the policy of setting aside carefully selected 
tracts to which large numbers of natives can be attracted, and within 
which, secure from the intrusion of unscrupulous white men, the 
natives can obtain fish and game and conduct their own industrial 
and commercial enterprises, and within which the bureau can con- 
centrate its efforts, during the year reservation was made by Exec- 
utive order of a tract on the Kobuk River, in Arctic Alaska, also of 
a tract on the northern shore of Cook Inlet, including the village 
of Tyonek and its surroundings. The reservation of the tract on 
the Kobuk River was made in compliance with the urgent request 
of the natives of Deering on Kotzebue Sound, who wished to migrate 
from the village which had been their home from time immemorial, 
because life in it had become increasingly difficult, the development 
of mining and the influx of white men having resulted in the killing 
off of game animals and in great scarcity of fuel. Within their new 
reservation on the shores of the remote Arctic river these natives can 
secure an abundant supply of fish, game, and timber, and can build 
up a new village for themselves. 
In 1891, when setting apart Annette Island as a reserve for the 
use of the Metlakatlans and such other Alaskans as might join them, 
Congress empowered the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe rules 
and regulations for the reserve. However, this authority was not 
exercised, because it was felt that the advancement of the Metlakat- 
lans could best be secured by letting them develop under the sole 
leadership of Mr. William Duncan, the founder of that unique colony. 
‘When it became necessary in the best interests of the Metlakatlans 
to establish and maintain a United States public school in Met-
-P-A-G-E-657
  SCHOOLS FOR NATIVES OF ALASKA AND INDIANS. 637 
lakatla, and otherwise to assume responsibility in connection with the 
interests of the Metlakatlans, it was deemed advisable to prescribe 
a code of regulations for the government of the colony, which was 
put into effect by the Secretary of the Interior January 28, 1915. 
Under these regulations the government of Annette Islands Reserve 
is vested in an elective council of 12 members, with power to pass 
such ordinances for the local government of the reserve as are not 
in conflict with the laws of the United States, the laws of the Ter- 
ritory of Alaska, or the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of 
the Interior. 
At its recent session the Alaska Territorial Legislature passed 
two acts of vital importance to the Alaskan natives. The act to 
define and establish the political status of Alaskan natives, approved 
April 27, 1915, provides for the acquiring of citizenship by natives 
of Alaska. It empowers a United States judge to issue a certificate 
of citizenship to a native who has severed all tribal relations, adopted 
the habits of civilization, satisfied the teachers of a United States 
public school or a territorial or a municipal school of his qualifica- 
tions for citizenship, and obtained the indorsement of his claim by 
five citizens. The act to provide for local self-government in 
native villages in Alaska, approved April 21, 1915, provides that a 
United States commissioner, after a proper hearing, may authorize 
the organization for self-government of any native village in Alaska 
having not less than 40 permanent inhabitants above the age of 21. 
The form of government provided for such villages is similar to 
that prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior for Annette Islands 
Reserve.

THE ALASKA REINDEER SERVICE. 
The latest complete statistics regarding the reindeer. herds are 
those of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914, according to which 
the total number of reindeer in Alaska at that time was 57,872, dis- 
tributed among 65 herds. Of the 57,872 reindeer, 37,828, or 66 per 
cent, were owned by 980 natives; 4,118, or 7 per cent, were owned by 
the United States; 5,924, or 10 per cent, were owned by missions; and 
10,007, or 17 per cent, were owned by Lapps. The total income of 
the natives from the reindeer industry during the fiscal year, exclu- 
sive of the meat and hides used by the natives themselves, was $77,934. 
The total, 57,872, is a net increase of 22 per cent during the fiscal 
year, notwithstanding the fact that nearly 6,000 reindeer were killed 
for their meat and hides during the year. 
The reindeer enterprise in Alaska has successfully passed through 
two stages—the introduction of the reindeer to a new country and 
people, and the development of an administration which has estab- 
lished the industry in the coastal region from Point Barrow to the 
Aleutian Peninsula. There remains the successful commercializing 
of the industry, the advancement of the enterprise from a branch of 
industrial education to one of the industries of the country. 
Realizing that the establishment of an export trade in reindeer 
products is essential to the success of the enterprise, the bureau is 
encouraging the shipment of reindeer meat and hides from Alaska 
to the States. The last steamer to leave Nome before the closing 
of navigation by ice brought to Seattle in October, 1914, 25 carcasses 
of reindeer, which were placed on sale in Seattle, retailing at from 
20 to 35 cents per pound. The chief of the Alaska Division also 
brought from Nome 3 carcasses to be distributed among the five 
continental railway lines running out of Seattle, in order that rein- 
deer meat might be given a trial on dining cars, with a view to secur- 
ing for the natives contracts for the delivery of reindeer meat each 
season. 
During the winter of 1914-15 the bureau’s superintendent, who is 
situated at Nome, with the approval of the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, distributed among the Eskimo herders in northwestern Alaska 
a proposal from a cold-storage company operating between Seattle 
and Nome to market in Seattle for the Eskimos on a commission 
basis the reindeer meat consigned to said company. This action will 
probably result in the shipment of a considerable quantity of rein- 
deer meat from Nome during the summer. The responsibility of ac- 
cepting or rejecting the proposal of the cold-storage company will 
rest with the native owners of reindeer, the superintendents acting 
in an advisory capacity and assisting in making the necessary ar- 
rangements.
-P-A-G-E-659
    SCHOOLS FOR NATIVES OF ALASKA AND INDIANS. 639 
Soon after the inception of the reindeer enterprise certain Lapps 
were brought from Lapland to Alaska and employed by the bureau 
as instructors of the Eskimos in the care and management of the 
reindeer, each Lapp receiving a certain number of reindeer in pay- 
ment for his services. During the summer of 1914 a company, or- 
ganized at Nome, purchased about 1,200 reindeer from one of these 
Lapps. This company intends to purchase other herds now owned 
-by Lapps, and to engage in the exportation of reindeer meat and - 
hides. 
Under the supervision of the superintendent of the northwestern 
district a very successful convention, attended by about 200 of the 
Eskimos engaged in the reindeer industry on the Seward Peninsula, 
was held at Igloo from January 11 to 17. The main object of the 
convention was the exchange of experiences and opinions on matters 
connected with the raising and the utilizing of reindeer. The dis- 
cussions included such subjects as the best way to slaughter a rein- 
deer and prepare it for market, the most satisfactory forms of sleds 
and harness, and the best methods of driving reindeer. There were 
also shooting matches, rope-throwing contests, wrestling bouts, and 
many kinds of races with reindeer. The exhibits included sets of 
harness, sleds, halters, and clothing made of reindeer skin, for which 
prizes were awarded. The success of this convention will probably 
result in the holding of similar conventions annually in various 
centers of the reindeer industry. 
The reindeer industry is now extending from the mainland to the 
outlying islands. During August, 1914, upon the request of the 
Department of the Interior, the revenue cutter Manning conveyed a 
herd of 40 reindeer from Ugashik, on the Alaska Peninsula, to Atka, 
a remote island in the Aleutian chain, where it will be a valuable 
factor in alleviating the deplorable conditions which have hitherto 
prevailed upon that desolate island. The extension of the reindeer 
industry into southeast Alaska was begun during October by the 
shipment to Metlakatla, on Annette Island, of eight reindeer from 
the herd in the vicinity of Nome.

INDIAN EDUCATION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 1915. 
(Furnished by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the request of the Commissioner of 
Education.) 
During the year the Government maintained 35 nonreservation 
boarding schools, with an enrollment of 10,791; 73 reservation board- 
ing schools, with an enrollment of 9,899; and 208 day schools, with 
an enrollment of 7,270. In one or two cases during thé past year 
it has been possible to permit the use of Indian day schools by the 
public-school authorities to be conducted as district schools, on 
condition that Indian children were received therein on the same 
terms as white children. 
In extending the enrollment of Indian children in public schools, 
it has been found wise to direct inquiry as to the circumstances of 
each child now enrolled and each applicant for such enrollment. Each 
pupil has been required to show his reasons for not entering a pub- 
‘lic school, his home conditions, and all facts bearing upon his eligi- 
bility for enrollment in an Indian school. The advantages to be 
obtained from this information are twofold: First, children who are 
not in need of Federal assistance, or who by reason of attendant 
circumstances may derive greater advantage from enrollment in a 
public school, may be eliminated; and second, by the elimination of 
these children Indian school facilities are increased for those who 
have no other educational opportunity. ; 
The academic work at each Indian school follows, in general, the 
course of study in use in the public schools of that State. However, 
this course is modified in most schools so as to place special emphasis 
on essentials and to allow a greater amount of industrial training 
than would otherwise be possible. At boarding schools it is custom- 
ary to devote one-half of each day to academic work and the other 
half to industrial work. 
The day schools cover only the first few years of school life, and 
the industrial training is necessarily limited. However, mat weaving 
and simple sewing are taught, and at many schools the preparation 
and serving of a noonday luncheon, under the direction of the house- 
keeper, affords instruction in cooking and other simple household 
duties. A great deal of attention is being given the gardens at Indian 
day schools, and better results have been obtained by both boys and 
girls. In several schools the interest of the parents was enlisted, and 
by their assistance the gardening has been carried on during the 
summer vacation. The boys are also taught the use of simple tools 
and the care of stock. In reservation boarding schools the girls are 
taught the customary household duties, sewing, laundering, and bak- 
ing, and the boys are taught regular shopwork, the cultivation of the 
soil, dairying and stock raising, a farm being conducted at each res- 
ervation boarding school.
-P-A-G-E-661
    SCHOOLS FOR NATIVES OF ALASKA AND INDIANS. 641 
In order to emphasize the importance of agricultural training the 
school farms and their management are being given special attention, 
and it is believed that there will be a gradual improvement each year 
in both agricultural methods and instruction. 
It is possible to give a more extended course in domestic science at 
the nonreservation boarding schools, where a domestic-science cottage 
is provided and classes of girls take turns in doing the usual work of 
a household under the direction of an instructor. Twenty-nine 
schools have domestic-science teachers or housekeepers, and one 
school has a cooking teacher. At other schools this work is under the 
direction of the school employees in charge of the various depart- 
ments. 
During the past year especial attention has been given to the can- 
ning of fruits and vegetables, and, in addition, to instruction in the 
use of glass jars for canning in small quantities. Canning outfits 
have been provided and pupils instructed in preserving large quanti- 
ties of fruit and vegetables, produced for the most part in the school 
orchards and gardens. 
School papers and journals are published not only at the large 
nonreservation schools, but also at many of the smaller reservation 
schools. The publication of these papers furnishes valuable train- 
ing to the pupils in the use of English and in the printing trade as 
well. The papers also extend a helpful influence to a large number 
of pupils and adults on the reservation who otherwise can not be 
reached. 
Music is a part of the regular school work, and a band composed 
of students is supported at the larger schools. Phonographs are 
provided at some of the day schools and many of the boarding 
schools, and stereopticons are also furnished at day and boarding 
schools, both for the entertainment and instruction of the children 
and the adult Indians. 
At about 30 of the larger boarding schools an “ outing system ” 
is maintained, under which boys and girls are sent to carefully 
selected homes to assist with the farm and house work. These pupils 
are given careful oversight by the farmer and his wife and fre- 
quently have an opportunity to attend public school. Pupils having 
land are encouraged to take courses which fit them to cultivate it to 
advantage. However, some Indian boys have no land, or show more 
ability along other lines. The nonreservation schools give such 
pupils opportunity to learn various trades, such as carpentry, wood- 
working, blacksmithing, electrical and stationary engineering, brick 
and stone masonry, plumbing, tailoring, painting, printing, baking, 
shoe and harness making, wagon making, and cement work. Theo- 
retical industrial instruction has been systematized by requiring that 
fixed periods of time each day be devoted to instruction per se in 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——41 “
-P-A-G-E-662
  642 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
order that good results may be secured and that there may be full 
correlation between practice and theoretical training. To add inter- 
est to this phase of the school work an industrial competition has 
been planned for the whole Indian Service, prizes to be awarded for 
the best articles in each of certain classes of handicraft. A brief 
written history of the material used will provide a means of testing 
the pupil’s knowledge of the material and processes involved. 
The health of pupils in Indian schools receives constant oversight. 
A physician’s certificate showing proper physical condition is a re- 
quirement for transfer to a nonreservation school. All the larger 
schools number a nurse among the employees. Employees are re- 
quired to report to the physician any suspected case of infectious or 
other disease and, in addition, regular inspections are made. Indian 
children developing incipient tuberculosis may be sent to one of the 
three sanitoria, located, respectively, in Arizona, Idaho, and Iowa. 
Contracts for building six additional sanitoria were made during 
the year, and five more are to be constructed. Besides the physi- 
cians stationed at the schools, there are seven special physicians 
who give especial attention to trachoma work and seven dentists 
who visit the various schools. Three medical supervisors study 
health conditions at the different schools and agencies. At the 
larger hospitals some of the older Indian girls are given elementary 
instruction in nursing. Schools where homemade appliances were 
found insufficient to insure an adequate amount of vigorous outdoor 
play have been provided with playground apparatus. The use of 
screened sleeping porches is being steadily extended. 
Besides the help in getting started at farming or following his 
chosen trade which is given to returned students by the superin- 
tendent, a supervisor of employment who is in touch with various 
projects furnishing employment suitable for Indian young men and 
women finds work for many of these young people who have no land 
or do not wish to farm and enables them to become self-supporting. 
The reservation superintendents lend encouragement and assistance 
in the formation of associations of returned students for self-help 
and for social and intellectual improvement. 
In addition to giving the girls instruction in simple household 
arts, the housekeeper at the day schools can often give some time 
to instructing Indian women living near the school in household 
matters, care of children, home sanitation, etc., and in so far as 
practicable make the school a center of helpful influences among the 
older Indians. The school farms and gardens at some places have 
been quite successful in arousing the interest and emulation of 
parents, and school entertainments to which the parents and friends 
are invited are made a means of overcoming prejudice and securing 
support.

EDUCATION IN CANADA? 
By Anna Torman SMITH, 
Specialist in Foreign Educational Systems, Bureau of Education, 
Conrents.—Recent movements—Current problems—The bilingual question—Religious in- 
struction—University policies—Statistics of public schools. 
RECENT MOVEMENTS. 
Recent educational movements in Canada have followed in the 
main the same direction as in the United States, and the similarity 
is increased by their origin in private enterprise and final transfer 
to public control with support from local and central appropriations. 
The history of the Macdonald bequest of 1899, for the promotion of 
instruction in manual arts and agriculture, with its large results, has 
been reviewed in previous reports of this series. The Strathcona 
trust, formed in 1918, for promoting physical training and drill in 
the schools, has assumed special importance by reason of the war. 
The work of the Royal Commission on Industrial Training and 
Technical Education, appointed in 1910, and its recommendations as 
to large Dominion appropriations for this work, bear close resem- 
blance to the action of the Commission on National Aid to Vocational 
Education appointed by the Congress of the United States in 1914. 
The measures recommended by the Canadian commission were pend- 
ing when the war broke out. Meanwhile enormous impetus had 
been given to the movement for agricultural education by the passage 
of a bill submitted by Hon. Martin Burrell, minister of agriculture, 
appropriating $10,000,000 to be allotted in annual installments to the 
several Provinces for the encouragement of agricultural instruction. 
These events have determined the trend of recent efforts for the de- 
velopment of popular education in all the Provinces. Although the 
war has overshadowed all other interests, it has furnished new mo- 
tives for continuing local activity in the practical training intended 
to promote the industrial efficiency and the physical vigor of the 
people. 
  
tAs in previous years, the chapters in this report dealing with education in foreign 
countries have been prepared under the general direction of the specialist in foreign edu- 
cational systems from official reports and correspondence, and with the assistance of 
yarious collaborators.

CURRENT PROBLEMS. 
General interest attaches to certain additional problems that have 
agitated the Canadian Provinces during the past few years. Chief 
among these are the bilingual question, with the closely related 
denominational question, and the subject of university policies. 
THE BILINGUAL QUESTION. 
Ontario—tIn Ontario the agitation of the bilingual- question 
reached an acute stage in 1914. It was not in the main a religious 
question, but one of racial sentiment. The population of French 
origin in Ontario is small but devoted to the language of their race 
and their former motherland, which is also regarded by them as a 
means of preserving their religious faith against the pressure of 
opposing creeds. The people of Irish origin, however, who are 
nearly three times as many as those of French origin, and, like the 
latter, adherents of the Catholic faith, have no desire to see the 
French language made prominent in the school programs. 
The controversy in Ontario turned upon the Government’s policy, 
as set forth in regulation No. 17, issued by the education depart- 
ment in 1912, with the avowed purpose of improving and insuring 
“the use and efficient teaching of the English language in the public 
and separate schools of the Province.” The latter, it should be 
stated, have been specially provided for Catholics who are not will- 
ing to send their children to the ordinary public schools. The two 
essential clauses in the regulations were as follows: 
(1) Where necessary in the case of French-speaking pupils, French may be 
used as the language of instruction and communication, but such use of French 
shall not be continued beyond Form 1, excepting that, on the approval of the 
chief inspector, it may also be used as the language of instruction and commu- 
nication in the case of pupils beyond Form 1 who are unable to speak and 
understand the English language. 
(2) Instruction in French shall not interfere with the adequacy of the 
instruction in English, and the provision for such instruction in French in the 
time-table of the school shall be subject to the approval and direction of the 
chief inspector and shall not in any day exceed one hour in each classroom, 
except where the time is increased upon the order of the chief inspector. 
While the controversy proceeded, the Ottawa separate school 
board refused to follow the regulation cited and declined to receive 
the official inspector. As a consequence the grant of $5,000 a year 
from the Government for those schools was suspended. Political 
parties, the public press, and the educational associations entered 
upon a vigorous campaign over the question which eventually de- 
veloped in the legislature, where representatives of both sides of the 
controversy defended the opposite positions. The case of the sepa- 
rate school board of Ottawa was referred meanwhile to the Supreme
-P-A-G-E-665
  EDUCATION IN CANADA. 645 
Court of Gntario where a judgment was rendered adverse to the 
board. The bilingual question was involved with other political 
issues, especially the temperance question, and before legislative 
action was secured with respect to either the house was dissolved 
and a new election ordered for June 29; the language controversy 
was thus transferred to the political campaign. The election resulted 
favorably for the Government party and for the time, at least, the 
bilingual question was disposed of. 
It is of interest to note that ample provision is made in the four 
English-French model schools, which are affiliated with normal 
schools, for the preparation of teachers in the theory and art of 
organizing, governing, and instructing pupils in the English-French 
schools of the Province. These model schools graduated 42 bilingual 
teachers, chiefly French, the past year. 
The problem of bilingual instruction causes little agitation in the 
remaining eastern Provinces. In Quebec the schools are all sec- 
tarian, either Catholic or Protestant, and the affairs of each are 
under separate education boards which determine the courses of 
study and the appointment of teachers for the schools of their re- 
spective divisions. Bilingual (Acadian) schools are maintained in 
183 municipalities of Nova Scotia, comprised in five counties. : 
In the western Province of Manitoba the bilingual question was 
involved with a revival of the demand for separate schools, which 
became a prominent issue in the election that took place in June, 
1914. The results indicated that by a great majority the people of 
Manitoba are opposed to the restoration of the separate school sys- 
tem. At the same time the need of bilingual teachers for the non- 
English-speaking population is recognized and the normal schools 
at Winnipeg and Brandon maintain courses of instruction for this 
purpose. The St. Boniface Institution is especially intended for the 
training of French-English teachers. The Ruthenian Polish training 
schools at Winnipeg and Brandon graduated 22 teachers during 
the year. Altogether there are 132 bilingual schools in Manitoba 
for this class of the population, 65 for the French, and 30 for Ger- 
man settlers. During the past year 2,580 bilingual readers were in- 
cluded among the free textbooks furnished to pupils. 
In Alberta, where there are many Ruthenians, a protest was made 
during the year against a school ordinance which had been trans- 
lated for the use of the Ruthenians in a Russian dialect disliked by 
them. A convention of Ruthenian missionaries held in August 
dwelt upon the great necessity of schools among their people for the 
teaching of English and condemned the bilingual system. At the 
same time it was admitted that some provision must be made for 
teaching the mother tongue or using it as a partial medium of instruc- 
tion for children of their parishes.  
-P-A-G-E-666
  646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
In Saskatchewan, where separate schools are provided for, con- 
siderable opposition to this policy has been aroused chiefly in con- 
nection with the basis for the distribution of the school tax; but here, 
as in Alberta, efforts are made to supply the Ruthenian and other 
foreign settlers with some instruction in their native tongues. 
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. 
The subject of religious instruction in the public schools of On- 
tario was brought into prominence as the result of a memorandum 
issued by Dr. Seath, superintendent of education, outlining: 
A two years’ course in the most suitable parts of the Bible, with selected 
passages for memorization, and with special moral lessons in the primary 
schools; the religious instruction to be given at home or in the Sunday school 
and not as a part of the school courses of study; the examination to be a bonus 
one at the high school entrance; the scheme to be first submitted to the repre- 
sentatives of the various denominations of the Province, and, if favorably re- 
ceived, to be then submitted to the minister with such amendments as were 
necessary. 
The existing situation is described in the memorandum as follows: 
(1) The regulations. for both the public and the high schools provide that, at 
the option of the school boards, a clergyman of any denomination shall have 
the right to give religious instruction to the pupils of his own church at least 
once a week after school in the afternoon; such instruction may include denomi- 
national doctrine. (2) The regulations prescribe the reading of the Bible at 
the opening of school and leave it optional with boards to require such reading 
at the close; the repeating of the Ten Commandments and the memorization of 
passages from the Bible, such exercises must, however, be carried on without 
comment. (3) In the courses of study, provision is made for incidental in- 
struction in manners and morals. No provision, however, is made for syste- 
matic instruction in these subjects. 
Supt. Seath declared that, in his opinion, the teaching of abstract 
morality had not proved successful. 
UNIVERSITY POLICIES. 
The question of university relations to national affairs was forced 
upon public attention in Canada immediately after the outbreak of 
the European war by an apparent endeavor on the part of the Uni- 
versity of Toronto to maintain an impartial attitude with respect to 
the struggle. In the midst of public excitement caused by this event 
the charge was made that “no distinct note of high political action 
or thought” was sounded from this greatest university in the Do- 
minion. The provoking cause of the complaint was the protest ut- 
tered by professors in the university against a patriotic address by 
the principal of Toronto Collegiate Institute, a school attended by 
the sons of the associate professor of German at the university. 
Leading papers of Toronto called for the elimination of all German
-P-A-G-E-667
    EDUCATION IN CANADA, 647 
professors from the university, on the ground that it was largely 
maintained by public money. Eventually a deputation, headed by 
leading members of the legislature, waited upon the premier of 
Ontario and demanded a thorough investigation of the university. 
In reply to this deputation the premier, Hon. W. H. Hearst, declared: 
It is the supreme duty of the Government to take measures to direct the edu- 
eation of our youth along lines not only calculated to prepare them for the 
battle of life, but as citizens of our country and our Empire. We will not 
evade our duty in this matter nor side-step our responsibility. You quite fairly 
claim that what you have submitted requires careful investigation. 
The remaining universities of Canada all recognized the new re- 
sponsibilities placed upon them by the war, and academic discus- 
sions soon gave way to preparations for active service, in which 
Toronto bore its full part. McGill University, Montreal, had been 
the first institution in Canada to follow the example of the English 
universities by establishing an officers’ training corps. This was 
done in 1912 under joint regulation of the militia department and 
the war office, and when the war broke out there were 120 members 
having drill and lectures on tactics during the college term. Drilling 
was at once pushed, the membership of the corps increased, and a 
regiment was organized for the front. The Graduate Society col- 
lected funds to equip and train a thousand men for two years, and 
the university made provision for a stationary field hospital of 520 
beds and 200 trained doctors and nurses and officers, which was ac- 
cepted by the war office. The example was contagious, and at the 
close of 1914 every university in Canada had large companies, com- 
prising at least 5,000 students, and many professors under drill or 
in training. : 
The interruption of the usual course of college activities was ac- 
companied in many cases by diminished resources, due to the diver- 
sion of private funds and public appropriations in aid of the national 
cause. This was particularly felt by the University of Toronto, 
which by reason of its high standards and wide reputation had rea- 
son to anticipate the demand for much postgraduate work hitherto 
directed to European universities. In view of this possibility, Dr. 
Falconer said: 
Canada must be prepared, unless she is to lose her self-respect, to provide 
the most advanced kind of academic training for her own people. During the 
past decade we have been strengthening undergraduate work, and if we can 
get rid of the school standards of the first-year general course, this under- 
graduate work will be fairly well provided for. We are nearly ready for a 
further step. If it does not come soon, the university will lag behind her 
neighbors.   
-P-A-G-E-668
   
     
648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The universities, it should be added, have contributed greatly to 
the movement for practical training in vocational subjects, agricul- 
ture, home economics, etc., and in the enlarged provision for training 
teachers which have marked the recent record of education through- 
out Canada. In particular, the University of Toronto, Laval Uni- 
versity, and McGill University, Quebec, and the University of New 
Brunswick have promoted progress in these directions by organizing 
courses of instruction leading to degrees or diplomas for specialists 
in the branches mentioned and to teachers completing higher courses 
in education. The enrollment in all the provincial universities in 
1914 was about 13,000, of which number fully 8,000 are credited to 
the Universities of Toronto, Laval, Montreal, and McGill, Montreal. 
The following table summarizes the latest statistics pertaining to 
elementary and high schools supported wholly or in part by public 
funds. It should be noted that a very large part of secondary edu- 
cation is provided for by academies and colleges that are not sub- 
sidized.

CHAPTER XXVIII. 
EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 
    —Mexico, hopeful signs—The States of Central America and Panama ; current 
es; statistical summary—States of South America: Introduction; notes on 
individual States; statistical summary. 
MEXICO. 
The greater portion of Mexico has been so devastated by the revo- 
lutionary war that schools and higher institutions have nearly ceased 
their operations. Education played a very important part in the 
efforts at internal improvement made by President Diaz during his 
long term.of office, and the work thus started gives a basis for new 
operations as soon as quiet is restored. 
The minister of public education and finance, Dr. Felix Palavicini, 
appointed by Sr. Carranza, executive in charge of the de facto gov- 
ernment, has undertaken to reorganize education in the Federal 
District and also to restore schools in the States that were brought 
under the control of Carranza. Among the measures adopted by 
this minister was a system of traveling schools, in charge of com- 
petent teachers who formed classes and attempted to conduct 
schools at various points. A commission was also appointed to 
visit the United States and study educational systems and the 
conduct of individual schools, with the hope of eventually improving 
conditions in Mexico. Associations of philanthropic and patriotic 
women have earnestly labored to promote the welfare of teachers 
and to keep alive interest and enthusiasm in the cause of education. 
These facts give hopeful indications for the future development of 
the States that have been in the throes of revolution for the past 
two years. 
The system of schools organized in the City of Mexico and the 
Federal District under President Diaz included kindergartens, 
primary schools, and higher primary schools. These provided a con- 
tinuous course of elementary instruction covering eight years. Grad- 
uates from the higher primary schools were admitted to the normal 
school, where they passed five years in special training for the teach- 
er’s profession. Provision was also made at public expense for the 
education of professional men, doctors, lawyers, engineers, ete. 
649  
-P-A-G-E-670
  650 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Mission schools under the charge of different religious denomina- 
tions have contributed greatly to the enlightenment of the Mexican 
people. They were everywhere encouraged in peaceful times and have 
even succeeded in continuing their work in the midst of the general 
disturbance. In the States that have not been affected by the revolu- 
tion, schools have been maintained as usual. The private schools un- 
der foreign auspices, chiefly German and English, are generally 
flourishing. 
CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA. 
All the States of Central America have organized systems of pub- 
lic instruction comprising primary and secondary schools and higher 
institutions. The official regulations provide for the grading of 
primary schools as kindergarten covering the ages 3 to 6 years, 
elementary covering six years, and higher elementary covering a 
period of two years. The terms of classification differ somewhat in 
the different States, but the grading is arranged on the same general 
plan. Teachers are appointed by the minister of public instruction 
or by local authorities and, as in the United States, teachers of pri- 
mary schools remain in the same grade from year to year’ while the 
pupils are promoted. The general preference is for separate schools 
for boys and girls or separate classes in the same building, the teach- 
ers being chosen from the sex corresponding to that of the pupils. 
At the present time experiments are made in the different States 
looking toward more flexible grading, the adaptation of primary 
studies to local conditions, and the instruction of boys and girls in 
the same classes as a means of economizing both the supply of ma- 
terial appliances and the teaching service. 
According to a recent official statement, in some departments of 
Honduras mixed schools have been tried as an experiment. They 
have given so much satisfaction that it is probable the plan will be 
generally adopted for rural schools; in San Salvador, in addition to 
the ordinary six-year elementary school, rural schools are established 
which give a brief course of instruction covering three years. They 
provide not only for the children of the white population, but for 
native Indians. The same experiment has been tried in Panama, 
where attendance upon the rural schools is obligatory for three years 
only; in Costa Rica, which has made greater advance in respect to 
primary education than any other one of the Central American 
States, a very important movement in rural education has been 
started by the establishment of schools which are furnished with 
gardens, orchards, and fields, and which provide for rural industries 
carried on under a special program of instruction and with teachers 
thoroughly possessed of the community ideal.* 
1¥For an extended account of this experiment, see the Report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1914, vol. 1, pp. 665-667.
-P-A-G-E-671
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND PANAMA. 651 
As a consequence of the special interest manifested in rural educa- 
tion, a decree was issued in January, 1915, providing new regulations 
for the normal schools. These include specific instructions respecting 
the preparation of teachers for the new type of rural schools. 
Among proposed reforms in the system of public education are 
the consolidation of schools in the same vicinity, increased adaptation 
of the courses of study to meet local needs both in cities and the 
country, and the unification of primary and secondary schools. In 
reference to the last proposition, the secretary of public instruction 
says: 
The public school has a social and political mission in the country, and can 
not, therefore, be limited to mere primary education. It should include sec- 
ondary education also, since, without the latter, popular education is imperfect 
and does not promote ideals of public morality and citizenship which should 
prevail in the modern state. 
The minister of public instruction for Nicaragua, in his current 
report, dwells upon the hindrances to the spread of public education 
in that State. He recommends appropriations for the immediate 
construction of school buildings, which are sadly lacking, and ade- 
quate appropriations in order that salaries may be paid which shall 
insure the service of competent men and women in the primary 
schools. 
The commercial and industrial activities which have been stimu- 
lated by the closer relations with the United States resulting from 
the opening of the Panama Canal, have directed attention to the 
urgent need of provision for agricultural education. With ee to 
Honduras a recent consular report says: 
Of a total of $1,659,304 declared exports for 1914, 89 per cent consisted of 
bananas. The rich coast lands, favored with heavy rains and a hot climate, 
make an excellent location for the production of this fruit. Attention is now 
being given to closer cultivation. The market demands are sharper and many 
of the old plantations have outlived their power of production. Those who have 
given close attention to the raising of the fruit -have received increased returns 
in a finer grade of fruit. It is only recently that the planter has come to 
realize that rough handling of fruit is costly. 
The Tegucigalpa consular district is essentially not an agricultural country. 
The crop of corn, beans, rice, sugar, and a negligible amount of vegetables 
barely serve for local needs in the best years. The crops of 1914 were almost 
a total failure, making necessary large and continued imports of breadstuffs. 
The department of agriculture is endeavoring to create an increased interest in 
the cultivation of henequen and sugar cane, and also in irrigation in connec- 
tion with pasturage for cattle. 
The report concludes as follows: 
Honduras, with all varieties of climate, with its lowlands on the coast, its 
valleys and undulating plains, and its highlands in the interior, all covered 
with a rich and fertile soil, can produce all classes and kinds of fruit, grains, 
and vegetables, such as bananas, plaintains, coconuts, pineapples, mangoes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-672
  652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
aguacates, oranges, corn, beans, rice, wheat, oats, sugar cane, coffee, tobacco, 
indigo, ete., but most of these will never be produced on a large scale until 
highways are built and transportation facilities afforded the people. 
This is the situation the country presents. It is rich, but undeveloped. It is 
easily susceptible to great development, but its population is scant and they 
have not the means to develop it themselves. Capital must be imported with 
which to do it, and those furniShing the capital will control and receive the 
benefits of increased trade and commerce. 
The principal agricultural products of Costa Rica are bananas 
and coffee. With respect to the former an American consul writes: 
The decrease of more than a million bunches during 1914 was no doubt caused 
by the ravages of the banana disease and the falling off of the demand during 
the last five months of the year. Many of the banana plantations that formerly 
shipped fruit through Port Limon have now ceased producing, and others are 
no longer profitable. The presence of the disease has not entirely discouraged 
planters, but it is an established fact, and is by all acknowledged to be a serious 
menace to the industry. Its results are well known, but its origin and elimi- 
nation are as yet unsolved problems. The United Fruit Co. has spent large 
sums of money in scientific research endeavoring to find a way out of the 
difficulty, but no real progress has yet been made. 
These statements emphasize the need of agricultural colleges in 
the States of Central America. Measures for their establishment 
are, however, comparatively recent, whereas schools of arts and trades 
for both boys and girls are maintained in all the chief cities, and 
appropriations are called for to increase and improve their equip- 
ment. There is a tendency, also, to establish departments of man- 
ual training and commercial instruction in secondary schools and 
normal schools. 
A school of commerce is maintained at the capital of Costa Rica 
to which boys and girls are admitted, provided they have finished 
the first two years of study in a secondary school and have reached 
the age of 14 years. 
In Honduras the institutions for secondary education under public 
control are the National Institute of Tegucigalpa, the National Col- 
lege of Santa Rosa of Copan, “La Independencia” of Santa Bar- 
bara, and “La Fraternidad” of Juticalpa. An important school of 
commerce is annexed to the National Institute, occupying the same 
building and managed by the same director. 
The chief institutions for secondary education in Guatemala are 
the Central National Institute for Boys, with an enrollment in 1913 
of 553 pupils; the Central National Institute for Girls, with 385 
pupils; the National Institute and Normal School Annex for Boys, 
at Chiqumula, with 274 pupils; and a similar school for girls in the 
same city, with an enrollment of 80 pupils; the National Institute 
for Boys and Practical and Commercial School Annex at Quezalte- 
nango, with 40 pupils.
-P-A-G-E-673
    EDUCATION IN SOUTH AMERICA. 653 
Each one of the practical schools for boys is provided with com- 
plete workshops for ironwork, carriage work, carpentry, printing, 
binding, tinning, etc. 
The practical school for girls at the capital has been recently ex- 
tended and provided with a fine dining room and kitchen and the 
best sanitary appliances. 
PANAMA. 
The system of public education in Panama includes the kinder- 
garten, attended by children 5 and 6 years of age, and primary 
schools for children of the compulsory school period; that is, the 
ages of 7 to 14. The primary schools are organized in six grades, 
for which an official course of study is provided. The instruction 
may be given in private schools or at home, but in both cases must 
be under official supervision. In certain localities an obligatory 
course of only three years is established in rural schools. 
Teachers are appointed by the minister of public instruction to 
fixed grades or sections where they remain during satisfactory serv- 
ice, the pupils thus passing under different teachers as they are pro- 
moted from year to year. 
The minister has proposed that in the appointment of teachers 
they shall not be named for specific grades in the school in which 
they are to teach, but that it shall be left to the inspector of schools, 
or the director of each school, to decide upon the advantage or disad- 
vantage of having the same teacher for the same pupils from year 
to year.

SOUTH AMERICA. 
InrRopuction. 
All advices from South America show continued activity with 
respect to increase of the means of public education and the extension 
of its scope. These activities must be regarded as a feature of the 
awakened industrial and commercial spirit, which is indicated by 
railroad enterprises, improvement of ports, formation of industrial 
companies, and similar undertakings.
-P-A-G-E-674
    654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Every State of South America has legal provision for establishing 
primary schools throughout its area; among the many causes which 
have combined to prevent the accomplishment of this purpose must 
be included the lack of periodical school census, without which 
present conditions can not be known, nor progress measured. Several 
States have recently accomplished complete surveys and are able to 
present very full statistics relating to schools and higher institutions; 
other States have made similar surveys of particular divisions. 
Statistics derived from these sources, supplemented by the annual 
reports of the ministers of public instruction in the several States, 
are summarized at the close of this chapter. 
In general the official regulations provide for the grading of the 
primary schools, a grade corresponding to a year as in the United 
States. Flexible grading is provided for in nearly all the large 
cities, provision being made for semiannual promotions. Teachers 
are appointed by the local school authorities, and assigned some- 
times to the grades for which they are respectively best fitted and 
sometimes to the charge of particular subjects. 
The courses of study for primary and secondary schools are drawn 
up by committees or boards pertaining to the central or local depart- 
ments of education; the official programs are usually supplemented 
by lists of authorized textbooks. These lists are extensive and pro- 
vide as a rule for choice between different authors. In the area con- 
trolled by the authority prescribing the list it must be used; and, 
as a rule, when the list emanates from a central’ department, it is 
accepted as a model by local authorities and also by the managers of 
private schools. To the latter class, it may be said, belong the greater 
number of secondary schools. 
The textbooks for the usual branches of study in both elementary 
and secondary schools are in the Spanish (Castilian) language. 
Sometimes for use in the most elementary grades a primer or easy 
reader in the native dialect is allowed. 
In all secondary schools modern languages are taught, French be- 
ing universally required, and for a second language choice between 
English and German. It need hardly be said that the textbooks are 
in the language studied. 
The procedure with respect to the choice and supply of toxthanies 
is illustrated by the following citations from current official reports. 
The report for Uruguay says: 
The school textbooks are adopted by a committee appointed by the general 
board of primary instruction, which receives from the Government the corre- 
sponding authorization for indicating to the teachers the books that ought to 
be used in the State schools. The judgment of that committee for the adoption 
of textbooks is ample and liberal, avoiding annoying exclusiveness for authors 
and editors, so dangerous for education. Almost all the textbooks are in ac- 
cordance with the programs in force and with ruling pedagogical principles

and have been written by national authors. Their price is yet rather high, but 
it is hoped that competition will tend to make them cheaper. 
In Chile according to the report of the minister— 
the council of public instruction provides each year a list of the textbooks be- 
tween which the rector of each establishment for secondary education depend- 
ing upon the Government may choose, with the agreement of the professors of 
the several branches, books which shall be issued in the course of instruction. 
The council may add new books to the official list after it is issued. 
Great interest is manifested at the present time in all the leading 
States in the subjects of hygiene, sanitation, agriculture, and Eng- 
lish, and textbooks dealing with those subjects are in demand. 
NOTES ON INDIVIDUAL STATES. 
Salient educational interests and movements in individual States 
are covered by the statements which follow, derived either from offi- 
cial reports or official correspondence. 
BRAZIL. 
The extreme conditions comprised in the area and population of 
Brazil are well known. Its vast extent, unexplored regions, immense 
plantations, and populous cities exercise a fascination over the minds 
’ of travelers and explorers. The most important event in the recent 
history of education in Brazil was the decree of April 5, 1911, which 
created a Federal board of education with authority to establish pri- 
mary schools in the various States, which previously were entirely 
independent in this matter. It was proposed at the same time that a 
complete census of the country, including educational data, should be 
taken, but owing to lack of funds this survey has been postponed. 
The same lack of funds has interfered with the action of the Federal 
Government in respect to supplying the deficiency of schools in the 
backward States. From current advices it appears, however, that 
this measure, combined with the growth of public opinion as to the 
importance of education, has stimulated the action of the State au- 
thorities so that, in general, educational provision is increasing. The 
latest statistics on the subject (1910) are included in a summarized 
table at the close of this chapter. 
Brazil is essentially an agricultural country, although only a frac- 
tion of its soil has been brought under cultivation. It furnishes 75 
per cent of the entire coffee crep of the world and a very large pro- 
portion of the rubber crop. The exports of cacao are worth an- 
nually about $10,000,000. The main resources of the country—dye- 
woods, hardwoods, and minerals—are as yet scarcely touched. The 
fertility of the soil and the ease with which the natural products are 
grown explain in some measure the indifference to scientific agricul- 
ture and agricultural training which prevailed up to a very recent time.  
-P-A-G-E-676
  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
Tt was not until 1909 that the Government manifested a serious purpose 
to develop and direct this industry by appointing a secretary of agri- 
culture. In October of the following year a decree was issued provid- 
ing for the establishment of a superior school of agriculture and vet- 
erinary medicine at Rio de Janeiro, and the institution was formally 
inaugurated July 4, 1913. By a decree of April 15, 1914, there was 
created a class of practical schools of agriculture, and in accordance 
with successive decrees preparatory schools of agriculture were es- 
tablished in several places and experimental stations were created. 
Thus legal provision was made for a great system of agricultural edu- 
cation under Government control. 
The following particulars showing the actual results of these meas- 
ures are taken from the report of the minister of agriculture, indus- 
try, and commerce for 1914:

Additional preparatory schools have been authorized at Tubarao, 
in Santa Catharina; at Guimaraes, in Maranhao; at Igarape-Assu, 
in Para; and at S. Simao, in Paulo. 
Experiment stations have also been established at Canna de 
Assucar, in Campos, and Algodao, in Coroata. : 
Government action in respect to agricultural education was pre- 
ceded by a work of private initiative in the State of Sao Paulo. The 
following statement with regard to this institution was made before 
the Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science at Washing- 
ton, D. C., by Prof. Clinton D. Smith, who was called from the 
United States to assume charge of that enterprise. Prof. Smith 
said: 
The school of the State of Sao Paulo, most progressive of the States, is the 
result of the gift of a wealthy and patriotic citizen, Dr. Luiz Vicente de Souza 
Queiroz, who, in 1892, presented his plantation to the State government for the 
purpose. It was as director of this institution that I was appointed in 1908 
and had good opportunity to study the Brazili.n boy at close range. 
Many of the students were sons of wealthy planters and did not greatly 
relish the idea of personally handling a plow. This was a performance they 
had associated only with their fathers’ laborers—not with sons of gentlemen. I 
got them interested by doing it myself first. I tried to make it apparent that 
the proper handling of a plow was an art. I threw an “atmosphere” around

it and soon had them not only willingly but anxiously waiting their turn at the 
handles. On the other hand, many of the boys had never in their lives seen a 
plow in action or driven any sort of a team and the novelty made it attractive. 
As a rule, the work with cattle and horses proved a delight and the young 
men soon learned to judge both with a good degree of self-assurance. 
In connection with the exhibit of a series of handsome photographs, . 
Prof. Smith said: 
You can see by these pictures how really beautiful the campus is. The im- 
posing white buildings, the turf and the wonderful variety of plants, trees, and 
shrubs that decorate the grounds make it most attractive. The grounds are 
such a favorite resort for visitors on Sunday in automobiles and carriages that 
every Saturday the roads through them receive a thorough sweeping in prepara- 
tion for the event. 
This [indicating another] shows the students playing football. They are 
very fond of American games, and the playing fields are usually well occupied. 
The personal contact in the rugby game is not, however, relished, and the soccer 
game has the call. They are mighty good players, too.* 
ARGENTINA. 
Argentina comprises 14 Provinces and 10 Territories, with a popu- 
lation in round numbers of 7,500,000, which is nearly double the 
population of 1895. This growth is largely due to immigration, 
a large proportion of immigrants (at least 80 per cent) coming from 
Italy and Spain. 
The Government has published at intervals during the last two 
decades the results of comprehensive surveys of the educational pro- 
visions of the State and is, therefore, possessed of the data for show- 
ing progress as indicated by the following comparative statistics:

conditions made this necessary. As a result the more backward com- 
munities have been aided and stimulated to new endeavors in this 
direction. 
The development of technical and vocational education under the 
auspices of the Government is indicated by the following statements 
derived from a special report: 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Technical schools are a matter of recent development. Two distinct kinds of 
such schools have been organized and are now maintained in flourishing condi- 
tion. One kind provides technical training in the various trades for young men 
from 12 to 15 years, while the second type serves to train the young men for 
positions of foremen and superintendents. For this purpose these schools give 
a more extensive and intensive instruction along theoretical and practical 
science, as far as it applies to these various trades. There are four large schools 
of each one of these types, supported by the National Government at a yearly 
expense of 1,500,000 pesos ($630,000). In addition to these, there are 15 trade 
schools for girls, also under the control of the National Government, giving 
instruction in the trades in which girls predominate, such as millinery, dress- 
making, flower making, telegraphy, typewriting and stenography, glove making, 
and so forth. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
Of recent development and also under the control of the National Government 
are the commercial schools for men and women, which provide adequate modern 
instruction in salesmanship and bookkeeping. ‘These schools graduate pupils 
with the rank of bachelors of commercial science and train the certified public 
accountants. A more recent addition to the scope of these schools is the degree 
of doctor given for advanced work in economic sciences. The National Govern- 
ment spends about 1,500,000 pesos for this branch of education. 
MILITARY EDUCATION. 
Military education comprises seven army and nine neval schools for mechanics 
and machinists, for the officers of the army and navy, and for pilots and seamen, 
to which 2,000,000 pesos ($840,000) are devoted. Practical naval instruction is 
offered in warships and particularly in the training ship Presidente Sarmiento, 
which recently visited the Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Fran- 
cisco during her fifteenth cruise of instruction. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
Agricultural education in Argentina is of a twofold type, general and special. 
The special schools, so-called “regional schools,” look toward the education of 
future workers in special fields, such as those who engage, for example, in the 
sugar industries of Tucuman. These schools specialize on the development of 
industries all over Argentina. The curriculum of the schools is intensely prac- 
tical and covers a sufficient scientific background such as these practical studies 
require in the various fields. These schools are under the control of the National 
Government through the department of agriculture. 
The schools which provide for the thorough scientific instruction underlying 
all agricultural occupations are under the control of the National Universities of 
Buenos Aires and La Plata.

    EDUCATION IN ARGENTINA. 659 
The annual cost of all agricultural schools is about 3,500,0000 pesos 
($1,470,000), including the expenses incurred in the maintenance of experi- 
mental stations, excursions, and university extension teaching. 
The manner in which public authorities and private bodies are 
working to promote the agricultural interests of the State are illus- 
trated by the following statements from current consular reports. 
The President of the Republic, in his annual message to the Argen- 
tine Congress, says: 
The invasion of locusts which began in June, 1914, is considered the worst 
since 1910 and was scattered over an area of 1,000,000 square kilometers (386,100 
Square miles). In spite of this fact, the united efforts of the National and 
Provincial Governments and private individuals succeeded in reducing loss to 
an insignificant percentage. 
Formerly the locust plague was combated almost exclusively by the numerous 
permanent and special employees of the Defensa Agricola. This service main- 
tained in some years approximately 4,000 agents and spent as much as $3,800,- 
000 annually in salaries, traveling expenses, and freight. In 1914 the Govern- 
ment decided to enforce strictly the law which made the cooperation of property 
owners compulsory in the destruction of locusts. It was thus able to conduct 
a successful campaign with the 300 permanent employees of the Defensa Agri- 
cola, with an expenditure of approximately $260,000. 
In prevision of a still more important invasion of locusts in 1915 the Govern- 
ment is making arrangements to furnish gasoline and other supplies to farmers 
as cheaply as possible. : 
In view of the ravages caused in fruit groves and other vegetation by the 
diaspis pentagona, the Government decided in 1914 to adopt the method pre- 
scribed by Prof. Berlesei, which is said to have given satisfactory results in 
Italy and the United States. 
An honorary commission of leading fruit growers was appointed to introduce 
and propagate the Berlesei prospaltella. ’ 
The Government of the Province of Cordoba has proposed to the provincial 
legislature the establishment of a model farm, to include the agricultural indus- 
tries of the region—orcharding, dairying, poultry, pig and bee raising, and the 
preparation of fruit and vegetable preserves. 
Private societies—The Sociedad Rural, of Rafaela, Province of Santa Fe, 
expects to open in the near future a school which will give practical instruction 
in the handling of agricultural machinery. 
According to press reports an agricultural cooperative society, with 200 mem- 
bers, known as the Economia Agricola, has been formed at Casilda, in the 
Province of Santa Fe. The society proposes to store and sell the produce of its 
members, dealing directly with exporters. It has sheds and machinery for 
shelling corn.* 
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 
With respect to higher education the special report already cited 
says: 
The universities of Argentina maintain the traditional faculties of juris- 
prudence, belles lettres, philosophy, and pure and applied sciences, developing 
also the newer departments of university work, such as agriculture, pedagogy, 
etc. The enlargement of the activities of these universities, especially the crea-

-P-A-G-E-680
  660 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915, 
tion of the University of La Plata, is proof of Argentina’s advancement in this 
field. The La Plata University has been instrumental in the exchange of pro- 
fessors and has encouraged the visits of public men of note from Europe and 
the United States of America, thus recognizing the desirability of maintaining 
the most pleasant relations with Europe and North America. 
In connection with higher education in Argentina, it is a point of interest 
that the number of university graduates in the city of Buenos Aires is in pro- 
portion with the population larger than in other cities of the world. The budget 
of the three or four foremost important universities of Argentina reaches 
8,500,000 pesos ($8,570,000) a year, and their combined attendance was 9,100 
students in 1914. 
The budget of Argentina for the current year carried for ordinary 
expenditures a total of $136,781,723.. Of this amount $27,779,865 was 
appropriated to the minister of justice and education. 
PARAGUAY. 
The educational system adopted by the Government of Paraguay 
in 1902 provides for the following classes of elementary schools: 
Rural schools, with three grades; elementary schools, with four 
grades; and more complete schools having six-grades. Instruction 
of the same character is given in these different classes of schools, 
the last-named class carrying the student two grades higher than 
the elementary and three grades higher than the rural schools. 
Pupils who do satisfactorily the work of one grade in a scholastic year 
are promoted to a higher grade; the teachers remain in the same 
grade; the pupils therefore are under a new instructor with each 
change of grade. 
The number of scholars in the first three grades of the complete 
schools is limited to 50 for each grade, in the three upper grades 
the number is limited to 40. 
Classes in the subjects taught in the graded schools are held at 
night for the benefit of children who are employed during the day, 
the majority of the pupils of these night schools being newsboys, 
bootblacks, ete. 
The system of employing teachers for special subjects, which pre- 
vails throughout the secondary schools in South America, is applied 
to a certain extent in the elementary schools of Paraguay. 
URUGUAY. 
Uruguay is the smallest State of South America, comprising an 
area of 72,153 square miles and a population of 1,279,359 (census 
1913). Of the total, about 18 per cent were foreigners, the Italian 
and Spanish contingent making up nearly two-thirds of this number. 
The population, while varied, is really more homogeneous than that 
of the majority of the South American States. 
 
-P-A-G-E-681
  
  EDUCATION IN URUGUAY. 661 
As regards its economic and financial condition, Uruguay is 
regarded as one of the most fortunate of the South American 
Republics. The chief causes of its stable condition are (1) the char- 
acter of its main products, which are the necessities of life, the 
demand for which has been strengthened by the war; (2) the rela- 
tively slow and steady economic development of the country; (3) 
the relatively small amount of foreign capital and the fact that it has 
been conservatively placed; (4) the scrupulous care taken by the 
Government for over 20 years to maintain its credit and to keep its 
currency on a sound basis. 
In 1908 a very complete census of the State was taken, which dis- 
closed alarming conditions with respect to illiteracy. At that time 
the illiterates 5 to 14 years of age comprised above 50 per cent of the 
population, and the adult illiterates, that is, 15 or more years, 35 
per cent; even in Montevideo the ratio of illiterates 5 to 14 years of 
age was 27 per cent, and for adults above 15 years of age 21 per cent. 
These facts and the rapidly increasing interests of agriculture and 
trade gave a new impetus to efforts for extending and improving 
public education. 
Between 1908 and 1913 the enrollment of pupils in primary schools 
increased from 60,863 to 91,746, an increase. of 23 per cent, which 
was a little greater than the increase in population, showing that the 
deficiency in school accommodation which existed at the earlier date 
was reduced. The enrollment in 1913 was very nearly 8 per cent 
of the population. 
The law with respect to compulsory education has been well en- 
forced in cities, towns, and villages, and in rural districts having 
sufficient population to support a school. There has been no oc- 
casion for inflicting penalties upon parents for violation of the law, 
since applications for admission to the schools are generally far in 
excess of the school accommodations. The State is largely agricul- 
tural, and nearly half the population live in rural districts covering 
a territory of 74,000 square miles; under these conditions particu- 
lar interest attaches to the efforts for providing adequate schools 
for the rural population and maintaining their efficiency. The 
nature of these efforts is indicated by the following particulars 
drawn from the latest report of the minister of public instruction: 
The State has established mixed schools in almost all the rural districts which 
have sufficient number of children of both sexes to average an attendance of 
not less than 30 pupils. Scholastic obligation extends to all boys who reside 
at a distance not exceeding 4 kilometers from the school. For girls the distance 
is 2 kilometers. The pupils go to school on foot, in any vehicle, or on horse- 
back, which is the most usual way. 
The rural schools are almost all mixed and are installed in properties be- 
longing to the State, granted temporarily and gratis, or rented, and have a 
capacity for 40, 50, or 60 pupils, although there are some that have more. 
 
-P-A-G-E-682
  662 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Rural schools are directed by married schoolmasters or by schoolmistresses, 
married or single, who have their residence in the establishment they direct. 
When the attendance of pupils exceeds 60, an assistant is allowed. 
Since the permanence of pupils in rural schools never exceeds three years, 
a simple program has been outlined which can be developed in that short period, 
so that when the pupil leaves school, he knows how to read, write, to perform 
the principal arithmetical operations, and something of geography, history and 
the Constitution of the Republic, and he has been impressed with notions of the 
purest morality. Experience shows that the stay of the rural pupil in school 
can not be continued longer, because as soon as his strength permits he is at 
each moment required by the daily works of the country, with which he helps 
his parents procure their living. The struggle for life is the strongest reason 
for taking him so young from school. 
The number of rural schools rapidly increases; in 1906 it was 400, 
in 1910 the total was 760. This increase is partly due to a law of 
1906, which appropriated $1,000,000 for the erection and improve- 
ment of school buildings. In the application of this fund great 
attention has been paid by the general board of primary instruction 
to the choice of sites for the new schools and their suitable equip- 
ment. 
The system of school inspection is so ordered that every school in 
the State is visited three or four times a year by a principal or sub- 
inspector, who reports directly to the minister of public instruction. 
The spirit and method of this service are admirable, and most cordial 
relations exist between teachers and inspectors. The general in- 
spection is supplemented by medical inspection, which is well or- 
ganized and comprises at the present time six physicians. 
The obligatory course of instruction in the primary schools, as 
already explained, covers three years. Endeavors have recently 
been made to extend the period of instruction for children in the 
country, and to increase their advantages by changes in the system 
of secondary education which would enable pupils to enter the 
“liceos” (departmental secondary schools) upon the successful com- 
pletion of the brief course of the rural primary school. The law 
authorizing this relation was secured in 1912 and has hardly yet 
passed the experimental stage. It appears, however, that additional 
preparation would be required in order that pupils from the rural 
schools might keep pace in the liceos with those who enter from the 
urban schools.* 
The high degree of illiteracy to which reference has been made is 
the result of the scarcity of schools in the past, and also in great part 
of the scattered nature of the rural population. A serious endeavor 
has been made to overcome the evil by the establishment of schools 
for adults, incorporated with the educational system. This action 
was authorized by a law of 1907, which wa’ well supported by public 
1See Bu. of Educ. Bull., 1915, No. 26, ‘‘ Secondary Schools in the States of Central 
America, South America, etc.,” pp. 19-20.

  EDUCATION IN URUGUAY. 663 
opinion and has resulted in the establishment of about 50 evening 
schools at different centers. These have an average attendance of 
2,000 pupils. In the classes for women, instruction is given in sewing 
and cutting garments, and weekly conferences are held for both sexes, 
in which the teachers endeavor to impart ideas of-public affairs, good 
citizenship, etc. 
The importance of agricultural teaching has been recognized by 
including the subject in the curricula of the normal schools and in all 
‘examinations for public-school teachers. Unfortunately, however, 
the instruction in this subject has been largely theoretical. An im- 
provement in this respect is reported by the Department of Rocha, 
which has established a “park for schools” adapted for field and 
garden cultivation. The same Department has also established a 
higher commercial school, the only institution of the kind maintained 
by the State that has successfully adhered to the purposes indicated 
by its title. 
Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, is the seat of a university of 
the highest order of secondary schools and of several national in- 
stitutions which illustrate the broad conception of education that has 
been in the minds of the leaders of the State. Among the special 
institutions is the National Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, which 
was established in 1910. There are also two normal schools at the 
capital, one for boys and the other for girls, both of which are highly 
developed and well equipped with laboratories, drawing-rooms, and 
models for drawing, manual workshops, and the latest illustrative 
material. 
The normal schools sustain intimate relation to the rural schools of 
the country. The greater proportion of their students come from the 
interior Departments, and after obtaining the diploma of master of 
first grade the graduates are obliged to exercise their profession for 
at least two years in the Departments to which they belong. By this 
means it has been found possible to secure trained teachers for the 
public schools of the smaller villages, and even rural districts. The 
course of study in the normal schools is completed in four years, and 
during the period State pupils enjoy a pension of $15 a month in 
order to meet the expenses of residence in the capital. The average 
attendance at the institutions is 50 in the school for boys and 250 in 
that for girls. Normal institutes are also maintained in six Depart- 
ments of the State. 
The pedagogical library and museum at Montevideo has re- 
cently established a circulating section. By this agency teachers who 
do not reside in the capital can secure upon request pedagogical 
books which are loaned gratis for a stated term.

  664 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
CHILE. 
The latest annual issued by the Chilean bureau of statistics com- 
prises several volumes, of which one is devoted to public instruction. 
The survey is very complete as regards the schools and higher institu- 
tions of Chile and their classification and relations to public admin- 
istration, as will be seen by a summary of the statistics included in 
the tables at the close of this chapter. The Government has recently 
extended the provision for industrial and technical training and. 
has also adopted measures for unifying the courses of instruction 
for primary and secondary schools. 
In 1913 two commissions were appointed by the department of 
industry and public works—one to investigate and report upon the 
agricultural schools of the country, and the second a commission of 
mining experts, to advise as to the exploitation of unworked mines 
and increased provision for training mining engineers. The work of 
these commissions, although not yet completed, has excited discussion 
of their purposes in educational meetings and journals. This is par- 
ticularly the case in regard to instruction in agriculture, which has 
for many years been included in the official program for primary 
schools. 
A recent article in the principal educational journal declares that 
no practical results have come from the requirement as to elementary 
instruction in agriculture, but it has served to fix: the idea in the 
minds of educators and to prepare the way for more fruitful efforts in 
the future. The author of the article believes that reform must begin 
with the normal schools. The cooperation of the agricultural society 
and of the national education association has been sought in support 
of a plan providing for an agricultural normal school with experi- 
mental fields adjoining and for a few model rural scheols with 
gardens attached. It is also suggested that prizes be offered for 
articles on the subject written by agricultural experts in Chile.’ 
The budget passed by the Chilean Congress for the current year 
(1915-16) carries $122,450 (U. S. currency) for public instruction. 
This is less than 1 per cent of the entire budget and represents a mere 
fraction of the public expenditure for education, which is supplied 
mainly by the provincial governments. 
BOLIVIA. 
Bolivia is characterized by the large proportion of parochial and 
private schools which are subsidized by the State or municipal gov- 
ernments. The country has been slow to recognize the need of mod- 
ern education, although the normal school at Sucre is a recognized 
center of research and educational progress.

  EDUCATION IN PERU. 665 
During the present year the Government has sought information 
as to the conduct of schools and higher institutions in the leading 
foreign countries, as a preliminary step in plans for the improve- 
ment of the existing schools. The budget for 1914 carried nearly a 
million dollars for public instruction. 
PERU. 
Peru has an area exceeding 700,000 square miles, and a population 
estimated in 1908 at four and one-half millions, not including the 
uncivilized Indians. The State has been called the “treasure chest ” 
of South America, principally on account of its mineral wealth, 
although it is also rich in agricultural resources, the exported prod- 
ucts including rubber, cotton, cane sugar, and alpaca wool. The 
abundance and nature of these natural resources indicate the great 
importance to the State of scientific knowledge and its practical ap- 
plications to agriculture, grazing, mining, and engineering. 
Special provision for technical education was begun in 1874 by 
the establishment of a school of mines and civil engineering at Lima. 
This action was followed by the establishment of a national agri- 
cultural school and more recently a school of arts and trades. With 
this development the importance of enforcing the law making ele- 
mentary instruction obligatory became evident, and finally the need 
of modernizing the general scheme of public instruction and espe- 
cially the programs of the normal schools and the public secondary 
schools. The serious endeavor in this direction which was made in 
1909 and the influences that prevented its immediate success have been 
considered in previous reports; there are, however, signs of its 
effects in a gradual change in the prevailing ideals and methods of 
education. 
The current year has shown a revival of efforts for the general 
improvement of the system of public instruction. These efforts are 
taking the practical form of surveys of particular departments as 
a basis for improvement and progress. An important survey was 
conducted last year by the inspector of primary instruction for the 
Department of Lima and the Province of Callao. The results are 
presented in a report giving detailed statistics of primary education 
in the sections surveyed and extended discussion of the general con- 
ditions and the principles that should direct future activities. 
With respect to physical education, which is generally provided 
for in all public schools, the inspector says: 
No one system of physical education is followed, but methods are adapted to 
the different ages and conditions of the pupils, and are, therefore, somewhat 
diversified. Outdoor games and exercises such as football, basket ball, volley 
ball, and swimming are especially prominent. Physical exercises for girls are 
considered of no less importance than those for boys.

  666 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Vocational education in Peru is divided into technical, com- 
mercial, agricultural, industrial, and domestic. The training is in- 
tended to overcome the want of correlation between the education 
of the school and the demands of daily life. The inspector advises 
that a commission be appointed to investigate the conditions and 
plan the work before attempting to develop it on a large scale 
- throughout the country.’ 
ECUADOR. 
Ecuador has an area of 116,000 square miles, divided into 17 Pro- 
vinces. The estimated population is 1,500,000, of whom the great 
majority are Indians; inhabitants of pure European blood are few, 
and those of mixed blood are about one-third the total. Under these 
conditions the general diffusion of education has been impossible. 
The General Government has taken special measures during the past 
few years to promote the cause of primary education. Secondary 
and higher education are fostered by the church (Roman Catholic), 
and there are flourishing schools at Quito and Guayaquil. 
The superior council of public instruction has just created a school 
of commerce at Bahia de Caraquez, the second school of the kind 
organized by the department of education. 
The budget for primary education submitted by the department for 
1915 amounts to 1,250,000 sucres ($607,500), an increase of $57,000 
over the budget for 1913. 
COLOMBIA. 
The Republic of Colombia comprises a population of 5,071,000 
(census 1912), of whom 30,000 are uncivilized Indians. The State 
is organized in 14 Departments, 2 “ intendencies,” and 7 minor divi- 
sions. The control of education throughout the State is centralized 
in a cabinet officer, the minister of public instruction, who is repre- 
sented in each Department by a director general. This organization 
facilitates the general survey of educational conditions, although a 
complete census of schools and pupils is still wanting. In general, 
private schools are more flourishing than public schools; the former, 
however, draw their pupils from the better classes of society, while 
public schools offer the only provision within the reach of the poorer 
classes. In the more advanced Departments there has been a decided 
increase of school attendance within the last few years, and in two 
Departments, viz, Caldas and El Valle, the enrollment in schools ex- 
ceeds 10 per cent of the population, whereas in the State as a whole 
the percentage is only 5.3 per cent. The following particulars from 
a recent consular report showing conditions in the Department of

Bolivar, capital Cartagena, may be taken to illustrate the status of 
schools in the more advanced Departments. This report says: 
The private schools in this Department number 33, with a total enrollment of 
2,137 pupils. The four secondary schools have an enrollment of 520 pupils. 
A recapitulation of the number of schools and the attendance shows:

In the municipality of Cartagena there are 27 public schools as follows: 
1 boys’ high school. 
8 boys’ primary schools. 
10 girls’ primary schools. 
2 boys’ night schools. 
6 alternate (coeducational) schools. 
The average attendance is 1,024 boys and 871 girls (for the year 1918). In 
1914 the average attendance was about 2,000. The schools are maintained at an 
expense of $20,448 annually. Most of the school buildings are leased property. 
The teachers, numbering 54, receive salaries which average a little less than 
$27 a month, while the highest salary paid is $50 a month and the lowest is $15. 
Public instruction reaches its highest point in the University of Cartagena, 
which was founded by a decree of October 6, 1827, and formally opened 
November 11, 1828. 
The university comprises five departments, as follows: (1) School of philoso- 
phy and letters; (2) school of science; (3) school of medicine and natural 
sciences; (4) school of law and political science; and (5) school of mathematics 
and civil engineering.’ 
Theoretically, all schools and institutions in the Department are 
adjuncts of the university. For example, schools of fine arts and 
primary schools are regarded as annexes of the university school 
of philosophy and letters; schools of commerce, telegraphy, agricul- 
ture, etc., as annexes of the university department of science. 
A recent decree issued by the minister of agriculture provides for 
the foundation of a National Institute of Agriculture at Bogota, 
with an experimental farm annexed. The program includes normal 
courses to prepare students for teaching agriculture with practical 
demonstrations. The courses will be specialized as required for 
horticulture, floriculture, etc. 
One scholarship will be granted by the Government to each De- 
partment, and six at large to be assigned by the minister of agricul- 
ture and commerce. 
Bogota, the capital of the State, is the seat of the National Uni- 
versity,? comprising four faculties: Natural sciences and medicine, 
law and political science, mathematics, and dental surgery. The 
preparation for admission to the specialized courses of the university

is made in two affiliated colleges, San Bartolome and San Bernardo. 
Bogota is also the seat of two public normal schools, a national con- 
servatory of music, a school of arts and trades, and a school of fine 
arts. The two last named are in charge of private associations, but 
subsidized by the State. 
At Medellin, the capital of the Department of Antioquia, there 
is a school of mines which is maintained by the National Govern- 
ment. 
By a recent decree the Government has authorized the establish- 
ment of a national institute of agriculture and veterinary science at: 
the capital, and the choice of a location for an auxiliary school of 
agriculture and animal husbandry. A scholarship will be awarded 
in each department of the two schools. 
By a decree issued during the current year it is declared that 
physicians, graduates of schools not in Colombia, must submit to 
the following regulations: 
(1) Present a diploma or diplomas obtained from a foreign college well known 
for the thoroughness of its course. These diplomas must carry the certificate of 
the minister or of a consul general accredited by this Republic; 
(2) Submit to a clinical examination before a council composed of one pro- 
fessor of internal clinics, one of clinical surgery, and one of another member 
of the faculty ; 
(3) Present a printed thesis on some national medical theme, on which the 
medical council will require the author to explain orally what may seem to 
the council proper in a public examination; and 
(4) The councils of professors before which the clinical examination and the 
thesis be presented, and the fees which they may charge, will be in accordance 
with the regulations which the faculty may provide in the ordinary preparatory 
examinations. 
VENEZUELA. 
The systematic efforts on the part of the Venezuelan Government 
to extend the school provision and improve the entire system of edu- 
cation have been noted in previous reports of this series. These 
efforts are still continued, but under great discouragement by reason 
of the apathy of many of the States and the want of financial sup- 
port. The decrease of the customs receipts and the internal revenue, 
which is attributed to the European war, has forced the executive 
departments to cut down their estimates for the current fiscal year. 
The department of public instruction has reduced its original esti- 
mate of $736,447 to $442,897, or 40 per cent, and the appropriations 
by the several States are likely to fall off proportionately. 
The Federal Government has, however, indicated its intention of 
pushing a few practical measures for improving the elementary 
schools under its immediate direction. 
The latest report of the minister of public instruction dwells upon 
the need of a new order of rural education, but points out certain
-P-A-G-E-689
    EDUCATION IN VENEZUELA. 669 
difficulties in the way of attempting at once to distinguish between 
urban and rural conditions. On this subject he says: 
  
Rural schools.—Connected with the question of school construction is the 
foundation of rural schools provided with a special program. By the decree of 
February 10 this kind of institution was authorized. It is not, however, de- 
sirable to complicate the classification of the schools, programs, regulations, 
and laws, which would be the result of creating the special rural school. It is 
not enough, in effect, to establish a conventional distinction, calling “ urban” 
the schools situated within the limits of the population of the capitals of the 
States and other municipalities and “rural” those which are outside these 
same limits. 
Persons who have traveled in the interior of Venezuela and noticed the 
gradual transition between the different sections, between urban and rural 
groups; who have observed the capitals of States which are simply collections 
of humble homes and, on the other hand, rural centers of second order which 
have an importance greater than or equal to the capital of the State will 
easily comprehend that the proposed distinction is not practicable. It would 
only convert almost all the schools into rural ones. But there is another reason 
more weighty which is based upon the psychology of the people. Not one of 
the new small centers of populations would be reconciled to be treated as a 
village and to have its school called “rural.” On the contrary, all will aspire 
to apply the term “ college” to their schools, although only the first elements 
are taught in them. The term “rural” is understood as a disparagement. 
For this reason it is necessary to proceed in an inverse way in this matter. 
The first rural school should be established in the environs of Caracas under 
the immediate inspection of the minister of public instruction. There will be 
no difficulty in calling one of the new schools with only one teacher “rural” 
when there are added to its programs the principles of agriculture and for 
the instruction in the field work a small farm is attached, or, better, a model 
farm. The teachers on their part should know the fundamental principles of 
agriculture and how to teach them, and the pupils should cultivate the soil 
with their own hands. . 
If this plan is followed throughout the Republic and the small farm schools 
provided with competent instructors, the benefit in the development of agri- 
cultural industry, the basis of new public wealth, will be great.’ 
  NATIONAL SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND TRADES. 
The National School of Arts and Trades for boys maintained at 
Caracas offers a select course in the general subjects of primary edu- 
cation, together with training for various trades. In the general 
course mathematics is extended to include geometry, and lineal draw- 
ing forms a special feature. The trade courses are numerous, in- 
cluding typewriting, lithographing, industrial modeling, bookbind- 
ing, metal work, ironwork, carpentry, tapestry, woodwork, forging, 
electrical ‘engineering, telephoning, management of automobiles, ete. 
The monthly salaries range from 1,000 bolivars ($200) for the di- 
rector to 100 bolivars ($20) for the teacher of arithmetic. It is 
noticeable that the salaries for the trade teachers average higher than 
those for the general subjects.

  670 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The. Woman’s School of Arts and Trades, Caracas, is also a na- 
tional institution, under the control of the minister of public instruc- 
tion. The program of the school comprises at present the following 
subjects: Cutting out garments and needlework, making hats and 
artificial flowers, tailoring, white embroidery, washing and ironing, 
cooking, weaving hats, bookbinding, stenography and typewriting, 
bookkeeping, photography, gymnastics, drawing, gardening, and 
horticulture. The school year is divided into two semesters, the 
first from September 15 to February 15, and the second from Feb- 
ruary 15 to July 15. The school hours are from 7 to 11 a m. and 
from 1 to5 p.m. The arrangement of the course of instruction is 
as follows: Two semesters for photography, washing and ironing, 
and two school years, or four semesters, for the other subjects. 
Applicants for admission to the school as regular students must 
have completed the five years’ course of elementary instruction as 
shown by a certificate of proficiency. Pupils can enter the classes 
for washing, ironing, and hat weaving without the certificate, pro- 
vided they can read and write. 
Young women may come to the classes in the capacity of hearers, 
but without having the rights of the regular pupils in relation to 
examinations, certificates, and diplomas. 
SCHOOL FOR NURSES. 
A school for nurses was established by a ministerial order of Feb- 
ruary 25, 1914, as an annex to the School of Arts and Trades for 
Women, and opened with impressive ceremonies the 24th of March 
following. The minister calls attention to the fact that the importance 
of such a school is not generally recognized, as the social customs and 
sentiments of the country relegate women to private life and domestic 
duties. At the same time the action received the support of many 
representative men and women, and 17 candidates presented them- 
selves for admission. The course of instruction is arranged for two 
years, beginning with the 16th of September each year and ending 
with a general examination in the month of July. The subjects 
of the course and their distribution among the semesters are as fol- 
lows: 
First semester: General anatomy and pathology, their application to the more 
common diseases and treatment of the latter. 
Second semester: Practice of minor surgery—bandages, healing, operations, 
local applications, etc. First aid in case of accident. Care of ‘the sick in 
general. 
Third semester: Completion of the studies of anatomy and physiology applied, 
especially of the nervous system. General pathology and practical hygiene, 
special care of women at childbirth, and infants. 
Fourth semester: Elementary pharmacy and cooking for the sick; special care 
of the insane; economy, administration, and regimen of hospital.

Entrance conditions.—The candidate for admission must be not less than 
18 nor more than 40 years of age, and must have had at least an elementary 
education. She must be of good physique, healthy, and with no notable phy- 
sical defect, and must have been vaccinated and recently revaccinated. She 
must also present a certificate of good, moral character. 
Those completing the course will receive the title of “enfermera” (trained 
nurse). 
Relations were established between the school for nurses and the Hospital 
Vagas. 
LEADING NEWSPAPERS OF SOUTH AMERICA. 
Newspapers play a very important part in the formation of public 
opinion in South America, a fact which has not escaped the notice 
of travelers from the United States, several of whom have recently 
given extended accounts of this phase of intellectual activity in 
South America. The following notices of leading journals are cited 
from recent articles on the subject: 
A visitor from North America is struck by the peculiar conditions obtaining 
in the newspaper world of South America. With prices higher than our own, 
with a much more restricted circle of readers, circulations of 100,000 and 
150,000 daily are reached in such centers as Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. 
“La Prensa” (The Press).—One of the most remarkable institutions in the 
world is the Buenos Aires organ, “La Prensa” (The Press). It is housed in a 
$5,000,000 building, and besides its function of giving up-to-date news it sup- 
plies free medical service to all subscribers, offers prizes in many fields of 
intellectual endeavor, has its own weather bureau, a department of first aid 
to farmers, and what not. Its cable service is one of the best in the world, and 
despite its uninteresting appearance—a fault all too common in South American 
newspapers—it is the greatest journalistic power in the Argentine Republic. 
“La Nacion” (The Nation), also of Buenos Aires, performs a generous service 
by publishing, in cheap form, good translations of the best foreign books. 
“Bl Mercurio” (The Mercury), published simultaneously in Santiago and Val- 
paraiso (Chile), is more lively than its distinguished Argentine contemporary 
and every bit as influential. Founded by an Englishman in 1827, its career has 
been one of uninterrupted success. Under the editorship of Carlos Vildosola 
it has risen to a preeminence in the life of Chile which entitles it to the 
sobriquet, “The Times of South America,” and its career is quite as imposing, 
in its way, as that of any of Lord Northcliffe’s leading organs in England. Vil- 
dosola, by the way, has done excellent service as Paris and London corre- 
spondent for his paper, has written on the function of the press in modern 
society, and is the possessor of a charmingly simple, yet powerful, style. 
“O Jornal de Comercio” (Journal of Commerce), founded in the same year 
as the Chilean Mercurio, has had at its head some of Brazil’s most noted 
writers. Rodriguez, one of its greatest editors, is known in this country for 
his book (written in English) on the “Panama Canal.” 
Names like Coelho Netto, Joas do Rio, Olavo Bilae (prince of Brazilian 
poets), Machado de Assis, and others stand for men who are or have been 
intimately bound up with the country’s journalism. 
Machado de Assis, first president of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, and 
now some years dead, was one of the leading literary influences of the Republic. 
His Portuguese is of remarkable lucidity; whether as a journalist, critic, or

novelist, his work adorns the nation’s letters. Ruy Barbosa, who succeeded 
him as president of the academy, comes also from the field of journalism. 
Important technical journals and medical journals are also pub- 
lished in the leading cities.

ENGLAND. 
EVIDENCES OF PROGRESS, 
The last important official act on the part of Mr. Pease, president 
of the board of education, was his speech in committee of the House 
of Commons, May 18 (current year), supporting the demand for the 
sum of £9,906,378 ($49,531,890) to complete the amount necessary 
to defray the expenditure for public education for the year ending 
March 31, 1916. 
On account of the depletion of his staff, 321 members having 
joined the colors, Mr. Pease was unable to supply the statistics 
which generally accompany the presentation of the budget estimates. 
In place of these he dwelt upon the way in which the work of the 
board had been affected by the war during the nine months since 
its outbreak. His speech covers all salient particulars of the record 
of public education during this important period. 
Among the causes of the increased expenditures noted was the 
necessity of feeding twice as many children as the number reported 
a year ago. Immediately after the outbreak of the war the number 
was raised to 200,000 and in May was still 70,900. 
Intimately connected with this work is that of providing schools 
for mothers. During the year the board of education was helping 
151 schools of this character, and at the same time the local govern- 
ment board came to the assistance of the work by grants for ma- 
ternity and child welfare. 
In order to prevent overlapping and waste, the presidents of the 
two boards named entered into an agreement to the effect that all 
matters connected with institutions provided by a sanitary authority 
should be supported out of grants by the local government board, 
and all matters connected with schools for the collective instruction 
675 
 
-P-A-G-E-696

| 676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of mothers should be in the province of the board of education. In 
this connection Mr. Pease said:   
It is a platitude, I know, when I say that it is a waste of effort to try to 
educate children who are not physically fit. Our great object is to get children 
to the schools in a healthy condition. If we get them thus and maintain them 
. in a healthy condition, depend upon it they will learn a great deal more, and 
there will be much less waste of public money than there has been in the past. 
The demand for women in many directions has produced also a demand for 
women who have babies or very small children in their homes. One of the 
great social dangers in the country has been that these children should be not 
properly provided for when their mothers were at work. By a system of 
ereches which have been supported by the board of education, and by grants, 
we are doing a very good work. We have now 77 institutions in the country. 
During the past year we have contributed something like £5,000 in grants in 
helping to look after these tiny tots while their mothers were at work. I do 
not think the value of that kind of work can be easily overrated. 
In respect to the activities of the board in the province of higher 
education, it was announced that no moneys would be called for dur- 
ing the year to aid in building grants for training colleges. At the 
same time the need of additional aid for higher institutions was 
distinctly recognized. 
The number of secondary schools in relation with the board of edu- 
| cation increases rapidly with a corresponding increase of the grant 
allowed them by the Government. The total appropriation for this 
| purpose, which 10 years ago was only £163,000 ($815,000), in 1914 
reached £730,000 ($3,600,000). 
In regard to the future of the secondary schools, so liberally aided 
| by public money, the president of the board said: 
Improvement depends on five things: An earlier entry in the secondary 
school; the imposition of some test, so that those only of reasonable ability 
should go forward into these schools; an undertaking by the parents that the 
children shall attend the full course in the schools; a better system of scholar- 
ship, so that the ladder may be improved to enable more able children to go 
forward to the university; and more vocational courses should be attached to 
those schools. We have at the present moment eight of these secondary schools 
with engineering courses, which lead up to the technical institutions, and I 
think money can very well be spent by local authorities, assisted by the Gov- 
ernment in vocational courses in many of our secondary schools. 
  The education estimates for the year 1915-16 carry a total for the 
schools sharing in the annual grants of £15,481,378, as against 
| £15,245,621 for the financial year 1914-15, a net increase of £235,757 
($1,175,000). Additional grants for 1915-16 in favor of higher 
education, promotion of science, etc., amount to £740,807. 
Naturally almost every item of normal expenditure shows some 
increase. Special interest, however, attaches to the increase by 
£33,000 of the annual grants for the education of defective children 
and an increase of £145,000 ($725,000) for medical inspection and 
medical treatment. This includes $490,000 allowed for school meals.

ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR INDUSTRIAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. 
The most important event of the year as regards education is the 
formation of an advisory council in the board of education charged 
with the interests of industrial and scientific research. The causes 
and purposes of the council were explained by Mr. Pease in his 
address on the budget. In introducing the subject he said: 
The war has brought home to us and to our notice that we have been far too 
dependent for very many processes and many materials upon the foreigner, and 
we have realized that it is essential, if we are going to maintain our position in 
the world, to make better use of our scientifically trained workers; that we 
must increase the number of those workers; and that we must endeavor to 
secure that industry is closely associated with our scientific workers and pro- 
mote a proper system of encouragement of research workers, especially in our 
universities. The fault in the past, no doubt, has been partly due to the remiss- 
ness on the part of the Government in failing to create careers for scientific 
men. It has also, I think, been due partly to the universities, who have not 
realized how important it is that pure science ought to be utilized with applied 
science and brought into close contact with manufacturing interests. I think it 
was also partly due to the fact that the manufacturers themselves undervalued 
the importance of science in connection with their particular industries. It was 
partly due, too, to the fact that the ratepayers have been too niggardly in 
making provision in connection with their technical institutions and colleges. 
In support of his position Mr. Pease cited many cases which went 
to prove the vast importance of an appropriation for this purpose, 
and which starting at a comparatively small figure ought to develop 
into substantial sums of money in the future. The proposition ex- 
cited animated discussion in which eminent representatives of science 
and technical industries, now members of the House of Commons, 
participated. The scheme was approved by Parliament and the sum 
of £25,000 granted for the initial fund. The body to be responsible 
for this work is a committee of the privy council, which is to be 
assisted by a small advisory council composed mainly of eminent 
scientific men and men actually engaged in industries dependent 
upon scientific research. The administrative chairman of this latter 
body is Sir William S. McCormick, LL.D. 
In the subsequent reorganization of the Government Mr. Pease 
vacated the office of president of the board of education, and was 
succeeded by Mr. Arthur Henderson, M. P., for the Barnard Castle 
division of Durham and chairman of the Parliamentary Labor 
Party. The change afforded occasion for a review of the admirable 
work accomplished by Mr. Pease, which is universally recognized. 
It is particularly noted that schools for mothers received official 
sanction and grants through his efforts. His more recent endeavor 
to bring scientific knowledge to the service of conditions brought 
about by the war have given an immense impetus to this important 
work, and it is announced that his successor will give hearty sup- 
port to the work of the advisory council as outlined by Mr. Pease.

    678 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
THE OFFICIAL REPORT. 
The latest report of the Board of Education in England, issued 
early in 1915, is introduced by a brief summary of the important 
effects of the war upon schools and higher institutions within the 
province of the board. From this survey it appears that at the out- 
break of the war, when the majority of schools were having vacation, 
the authorities of some areas, notably London, thought it desirable 
to terminate the vacation and resume the work of the schools earlier 
than usual; in a few other cases it was suggested that the vacation 
might be prolonged in order that the elder children could help in 
harvest work; neither of these expedients, however, was found to be 
generally necessary. On the contrary, the resolution was expressed 
on all sides— 
That in the national crisis it was the first duty of all concerned in the public 
system of education to see that that system was carried om as far as possible 
without interruption and with undiminished efficiency, and this feeling was 
emphasized in a letter publicly addressed by the president of the board to his 
colleagues in the service of national education. 
The difficulties arising from the war are considered under the fol- 
lowing heads: 
Depletion of teaching staf.—Up to the 30th of September, 1914, 
8,877 men, or 9.2 per cent of the total number of men teachers, had 
been called to naval or military service and 5 women teachers to the 
duties of nurse. The great majority of the men were certificated 
teachers. Since the date named the numbers given have been greatly 
increased. In the elementary schools the gaps thus occasioned have 
been filled to a large extent by what are called the reserves of the 
profession. This includes many qualified teachers who left the 
service upon marriage and whose offer of service in this emergency 
has been gladly accepted. 
Decrease in number of students.—Returns relative to the 34 uni- 
versities and university colleges in England and Wales which are 
aided by Government grants show that 2,530 full-time students, or 
about 30 per cent of the total number of men students, had joined 
the forces by the end of January. In the training colleges for men 
about 645 out of a total of 1,420 students had joined the forces. It 
was anticipated that these numbers also would be greatly increased 
during the spring and summer. 
In regard to the technical, art, and evening schools which receive 
grants from the board the loss of students can not be exactly given, 
but appears to range at points up to 50 per cent and averaging for 
all these institutions about 25 per cent. 
Occupation of buildings—The school buildings occupied for hos- 
pital purposes which involved the transfer or discontinuance of the 
school activities, as reported in April, 1915, included 60 elementary 
 
-P-A-G-E-699
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 679 
schools, 17 secondary schools, 9 training colleges, 2 universities, part 
of one university college, and 4 technical schools. 
The occupation of school buildings for billeting has varied at 
different times according to the movements of the troops. The re- 
ports show that the premises of at least 705 elementary school build- 
ings, 33 secondary, 15 technical, and 4 training colleges have been 
so occupied at different times. 
So far as possible these exigencies have not been allowed to stop 
the work of the schools. 
Provision for special demands.—It was impossible at the time of 
the report to ascertain the number of Belgian and French children, 
whose families have taken refuge in England, that had been received 
into some of the schools within the province of the Board, but it was 
known that a very large number of such children were happily at 
work in the schools. The need of forming camp classes for recruits 
was recognized very early in the war and facilities both for instruc- 
tion and recreation of the soldiers were provided by many local 
authorities and assisted by voluntary bodies, notably the Young 
Men’s Christian Association. From a report issued in December, 
1914, it appeared that up to that time 41 local education authorities 
had maintained such classes and were entitled to the special grants 
offered by the board for this work. 
Administrative measures—The necessities of the war have caused 
various modifications in the conditions laid down by the board upon 
which various classes of schools share in the Government grant. The 
exceptional cases affecting the efficiency of elementary schools or 
training colleges will be taken into account in rewarding the grants, 
and training colleges and local education authorities have been noti- 
fied that trained teachers who are under an obligation to serve in 
approved schools for not less than 7 out of the 10 years following the 
completion of their training, and who proceed on military service, 
will be allowed to count the period of their military service during 
_ the continuance of mobilization toward the fulfillment of their obli- 
gation. Eventually, also, it is proposed to reimburse the schools and 
universities for loss sustained by the occupation of their buildings. 
NEW DEMANDS IN EDUCATION. 
The meetings of educational associations during the year have 
been marked by forecasts of new demands that must be met as a 
consequence of the war. In these discussions emphasis has been 
placed upon the need of larger provision for technical training, and 
in particular for a large extension in respect to the teaching of mod- 
ern languages and literature. The first of these considerations 
simply reiterated the convictions that have been pressed upon the  
-P-A-G-E-700
    680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
attention of Government and local authorities for the last decade. The 
question of modern languages has been brought into an entirely new 
relation to educational thought by the events of the war. It formed 
the chief subject of discussion at the July meeting of the London 
Education Committee, at which a resolution was moved and adopted 
that classes for foreign languages and literature should be at once 
formed in six institutes for young women. At the meeting of the 
Modern Language Association, held at the University of London in 
January of the present year, this subject gave the keynote to the 
inaugural address by the president, Mr. W. W. Vaughan, the master 
of Wellington College, who said, in part: 
Besides the stake that we as citizens and teachers have in the war, it touches 
us still more closely as teachers of French and German. The vast majority 
of our members have spent weeks and months, possibly years, not as tourists, 
but as residents in one or other, if not in both, of the countries that are the 
protagonists in this great war. We, if any, should understand the tragedy of 
what is happening, and we pay for that complete understanding by a deeper 
heartache. Some of us have sung “Deutschland uber alles” in a German 
Kneipe. Some have watched from the great Dresden River the Whit-Sunday 
sun gilding the Saxon highlands. Some have cheered, with their contemporaries, 
the burning eloquence of the Spanish democrat, Castelar, in the Collége de 
France. Some have enjoyed the freedom of the Quartier Latin and tramped 
with buoyant French students through the forest of Fontainebleau till the boots 
which were sold to us as students, with price and sole alike reduced, gave us a 
respectable excuse for calling for a halt and food. Some have felt the spell 
of Wagner in the opera house at Bayreuth. Some can never forget how they 
laughed with Jeanne Samary, how they cried with Bartet, how they thrilled 
at the voice of Got and le Bargy as they listened to Moliére or Racine or Emile 
Augier in the parterre of the Théatre Francais. Memories such as these—im- 
perishable sweeteners of national bitterness—have been crowding into my mind 
while thinking of those days when I tried to qualify as a teacher of modern 
languages, and therefore as a member of this association; and as they come 
in their battalions I find it hard to compose a fitting presidential address. The 
great subjects that might have appealed to me, if not to you, in an ordinary 
year seem trivial now. Questions, merely academic, have lost their savor. 
SCOTLAND. 
The report of the education department of Scotland for the school 
year 1914-15 shows that local school boards generally endeavor to 
carry out the provisions of the education act of 1908 extending the 
field of their activities. These extensions relate (1) to the enforce- 
ment of compulsory school attendance and the prolongation of the 
period of school life; (2) to welfare services for promoting the health 
of children and their social and industrial conditions. : 
Under the first head the report considers particularly the need of 
adequate school provision in districts presenting exceptional condi- 
tions, such as large cities where unforeseen demands arise from the
-P-A-G-E-701
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 681 
influx of workers required for new or increased industries and 
sparsely populated sections of outlying districts. In cities, apart 
from the demands created by shifting population, are those arising 
from the improved standards of sanitation and comfort and the 
altered conditions of school organization and courses of instruction. 
Buildings which were regarded as ample and excellent at the time 
they were built are now condemned because they fall below the re- 
quired standard in regard to lighting and ventilation or do not pro- 
vide facilities for the physical exercises and manual training which 
nave become indispensable. 
In order to reach the school children in remote districts two 
methods have been adopted. Under one a teacher is engaged to 
instruct the children in or near their own homes; in the other case 
arrangements are made for the conveyance of children to and from 
school. The latter plan, which has proved successful in the United 
States, has proved to be nearly impracticable in Scotland, where 
the children are generally not conveyed daily, but at the beginning 
and end of the week, thus obliging them to be away from home for 
five nights in the week. .To this plan parents naturally object. With 
regard to the instruction of children in or near their own homes 
by a temporary teacher the report says: 
The arrangement is, at the best, a makeshift; a certificated teacher is rarely 
procurable for this class of school, and, generally speaking, it must be admitted 
that the education given is distinctly inferior, both in quality and quantity, to 
that which the children would obtain by regular attendance at the ordinary 
classes of a fully recognized public school. 
Some improvement in this method of instruction has been secured 
by increasing the salaries offered to the temporary teachers. 
It will readily be seen that the conditions explained prevent the 
complete enforcement of compulsory school attendance; at the same 
time steady improvement in this particular is reported and clearly 
indicated by the. high percentage of average school attendance. 
The education law of 1911 fixes 14 years as the age for leaving ele- 
mentary schools. Children above 12 years of age may, however, be 
exempted from attendance at an earlier age at the discretion of the 
local school board with the approval of the department. Systematic 
efforts are made to retain all children up to the leaving age, and 
longer so far as possible. For this purpose supplementary classes 
and high schools are established, the programs in both cases pro- 
viding for continuance of the elementary branches with the addition 
of special subjects having an industrial bias. 
The supplementary classes reach children who are not able to 
meet the conditions for admission to the higher grade schools. These 
classes are most successful in the large cities, and experience shows 
that the best results are attained by their centralization. In respect  
-P-A-G-E-702

682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
to Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland (population 784,500), the 
official inspector says: 
In the large town school, and especially in the school in which supplementary 
work is concentrated or centralized, the problem of classification and differen- 
tial treatment of the pupils is much less complicated, and in some cases, as in 
the recently opened Onslow Drive School, Glasgow, the provision made for a 
number of separate classes may even contribute to the rapid promotion of the 
mptiss. +e * 
It is interesting in this connection to observe that in recent years, while 
the stream to higher grade schools in Glasgow has practically not varied in 
volume, there has been the very marked and gratifying increase of no less than 
50 per cent in four years in the number of children who have entered supple- 
mentary courses. 
During the period 1910-1913 the average attendance of pupils 
in the supplementary courses in Glasgow rose from 4,047 to 6,061; 
at the same time the attendance in higher grade schools remained 
very nearly stationary, about 2,500. 
Govan Parish, a suburb of Glasgow, having a population of about 
90,000, is following the example of the larger city and as rapidly 
as possible centralizing the supplementary classes. 
In Dundee concentration of classes has also proved advantageous. 
This city or burgh is situated in the northern and highland divisions 
of Scotland, which form one inspection area comprising 13 counties 
and a population of 1,021,572 largely rural in character. The school 
districts of this division are generally small and scattered, and there- 
fore present peculiar difficulties in the way of maintaining the sup- 
plementary classes. Peculiar interest therefore attaches to the re- 
port of one district in this division, comprising North Forfarshire and 
two smaller counties. With respect to supplementary classes, the 
inspector reports:   According to the returns at the end of the schvol financial years the per- 
centage of supplementary scholars to the total enrollment is 9.4 in North For- 
farshire, 10.9 in Shetland, and 11.4 in Kincardineshire. The following table 
gives (a) the number of pupils who left school, (6) the number of these who 
spent more than one year in a supplementary course, and (c) the percentage of 
(b) to (a).

During the past session there has been a further increase in the number of 
schools in the district in which provision has been made for instruction in prac- 
tical subjects. The progress made in the three sections of the district is shown

The subjects for the supplementary classes are indicated by the 
table already given. In addition the Scotch code requires that 
every school shall make adequate provision for physical exercises, 
singing, drawing, nature knowledge, geography, history, and (for 
girls) sewing, all of which are regarded as auxiliary and to be so 
conducted that they will not interefere with, but will “subserve in 
large degree the purposes of the main instruction in English and 
arithmetic.” 
In regard to the relation between the usual branches of elementary 
instruction and the practical branches which find place in the ex- 
tension courses, the official report says: 
At no time has primary education been regarded in Scotland as simply a 
matter of instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and at the present 
time less than ever is it so regarded. The problem is how to use the various 
subjects of instruction so as to develop all the faculties of the child, to elicit 
his sympathies, regenerate his impulses, cultivate his faculty of observation, 
exercise his intelligence, and improve his powers of expression. This is a 
high and difficult art, demanding for its practice thoughtful, devoted, and well- 
trained teachers. Provided the art be skillfully employed, proficiency in read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic will be secured as a matter of course, as an inci- 
dental result, within the usual limits of school life in the case of normal chil- 
dren. But to aim at this incidental result, principally or directly, may well be 
to stultify the whole educational process without securing more than an 
evanescent, because mechanical, proficiency in the subjects on which instruction 
has been concentrated. 
Still, for practical purposes, reading, writing, and arithmetic may be taken 
to be the main subjects of instruction in the primary-school curriculum. All the 
others are to be regarded as auxiliary. That is, they are valuable for the dis- 
cipline they afford and the variety of means they offer for exercising the in- 
telligence of the children, rather than for the amount of positive knowledge or 
of proficiency acquired, even although that may not be inconsiderable. 
   
-P-A-G-E-704
  684 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
Organization of the service.—The service is conducted under the 
general supervision of Dr. Lewis D. Cruickshank, medical officer of 
the Scotch education department. The local authorities directly re- 
sponsible for the work are the county education committees formed 
in accordance with the education act of 1908. These committees 
represent the education authorities in each county, including school 
boards and secondary school and the general health authority for 
the county, namely, the county council. Asa rule the county medical 
officers of health is at the head of the school-inspection service in his 
area, and the medical men appointed to carry on the examination of 
the children and schools are assistants to this officer. In a very few 
counties the school medical officer is independent of the county medi- 
cal officer of health, but in all counties the health service and the 
medical inspection are coordinated. The county education com- 
mittees frame schemes for medical inspection which must be ap- 
proved by the department. If a scheme is accepted by a school 
board, that board receives from the Government one-half of the 
cost incurred for the medical examination and supervision of the 
pupils. Z 
Assistants.—In connection with the work of medical inspection, 56 
school nurses are employed. Of this number, 26 are employed by 
12 counties and 30 by 10 cities or towns. With the single exception 
of Ayr, all the “burghs” that have separate schemes of medical 
inspection now employ nurses. There are also part-time school 
nurses employed in several counties, and it is recognized that. this 
branch of the service is of the utmost importance in following up 
the results of advice given by the medical officers and in the con- 
tinued supervision of defective cases. The success of this service 
leads to the hope that secondary education committees will make 
arrangements for the employment of nurses and thus bring about 
closer relations between schools and homes throughout the country. 
Invaluable assistance is also rendered by teachers whose attention 
to the physical well-being of the pupils increases in a most encourag- 
ing manner. They not only take great interest in defective children, 
but show constantly increasing appreciation of the careful hygienic 
supervision of all the children under their charge. The medical 
officer says: “It is through the medium of the teacher that we must 
look for the success of any scheme of school-health administration.” 
Conduct of the inspection—The systematic medical inspection of 
the school children is carried on during the school hours. The 
attempt is not made to examine all the children annually. Ex- 
perience indicates that such examination three times during school 
life, together with an examination of all special cases selected by
-P-A-G-E-705
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 685 
the teachers or the parents, is sufficient to enable the medical officer 
to detect and keep under supervision all defective children. The 
great purpose of the service is “to discover those ailments of sub- 
acute or chronic nature that may render the child physically or 
educationally inefficient.” As a rule, cases of acute illness are easily 
recognized by parents and teachers and the urgency of such cases 
usually leads to the necessary medical treatment. 
Three age periods are selected for systematic inspection, namely: 
(1) From 5 to 7 years, or “entrants”; (2) from 12 to 14 years, or 
“leavers”; and (3) an intervening age group taken from about the 
middle of the school period, or “ intermediates.” 
Summary for the year.—F or the latest year reported (ending July 
31, 1913), systematic inspection was applied to 236,169 children, the 
number of special cases was 158,550, total 414,429 children inspected 
out of a total average of attendance of 839,049; that is, nearly 41 
per cent of the school children were examined by the medical in- 
spectors. The activities of the members of the medical service are 
indicated by the following examples: 
In Edinburgh the medical officers, four in number, paid no fewer than 2,480 
visits to the schools of the city for the purposes of systematic and special 
examinations, while the nurses, four in number, paid 2,656 visits to homes in 
connection with the supervision and “following up” of defective cases. In 
Govan, where a somewhat different procedure is followed, the medical officers 
paid approximately 1,572 visits to schools, and the nurses 5,800 visits to the 
homes. In Dundee, 579 visits were paid by the medical officers and 1,251 
visits by the nurses during the year. In each of these towns there are also 
arrangements for the inspection of “special” cases at appropriate centers, 
which are usually known as “attendance clinics” or “inspection clinics.” 
The above figures do not therefore convey anything more than an approximate 
idea of the work of the school medical service in the towns. * 
The work in counties is illustrated by the following particulars: 
In Lanarkshire the medical inspectors, four in number, paid 288 visits to 
schools for the purpose of systematic inspection, and 472 special visits, while 
the nurses paid no fewer than 414 visits to homes in connection with ver- 
minous children. In Clackmannan the medical inspector paid approximately 
180 visits to schools, and the nurses, three in number, paid 225 visits to schools 
and 550 visits to homes, in addition to assisting in the work of treatment at the 
school clinic. In Stirlingshire seven nurses are reported to have paid 4,949 
home visits in connection with defective children, and in Linlithgowshire onc 
nurse paid 625 visits to homes. : 
The opinion is expressed that similar activity has been displayed 
in all the medical inspection districts. 
The medical officer expresses the opinion that approximately 4 
per cent of the school children suffer from defective nourishment, 
which he regards as the most important cause of general physical 
and educational inefficiency and its prevention as one of the first and 
most important steps in child hygiene. The principal causes of mal- 
 
-P-A-G-E-706
  686 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
nutrition he summarizes as follows: (1) Insufficient or unsuitable 
food; (2) insanitary surroundings; (8) out-of-school occupation; 
(4) insufficient sleep; (5) other causes. 
Each of the above topics is extensively discussed and illustrated 
by impressive instances. The conclusions of the medical officer are 
as follows: 
With the exception of the relatively small percentage of cases which are the 
direct result of poverty, it seems evident that the majority of cases of malnutri- 
tion arise from parental ignorance—ignorance of the relative value of foods, 
ignorance of the value of a clean and wholesome house, ignorance of the value 
of quiet refreshing sleep, ignorance of the value of play during out-of-school 
hours. Where parental neglect is the cause the outlook is less hopeful, but 
neglect is also too frequently the result of ignorance. 
While education authorities may do a good deal to meet the immediate needs 
of the situation by providing meals and by regulating the employment of chil- 
dren outside of school hours, and while nurses and school doctors may help 
by visiting the homes of the school children and giving lectures to the parents, 
the principal factor in the campaign against physical inefficiency must be edu- 
cational, information must be disseminated through the homes, and the rising 
generation must have a practical training in the methods of healthy living. But 
as one medical officer says, ‘‘ Education may point the way, but society must 
make the journey itself.” 
Following up and treatment—The report emphasizes the great 
importance of following up children found defective at the medical 
inspection, and the difficulties of this part of the service are con- 
sidered in detail. In addition to the medical officer, school nurse, 
and teacher, the attendance officers and voluntary workers give 
large assistance in this work. The percentage of defects remedied, 
treated, or improved given for 29 areas varies from 26.9 per cent in 
Forfar County to 75 per cent in Ross and Cromarty Counties. 
School clinics.~During the year school clinics or centers for special 
treatment were maintained at 14 places, and in addition 159 school 
boards provided a certain amount of medical treatment. Of this 
number, 124 made provision for treating defects of vision, 62 for 
dental treatment, 58 for minor ailments, and 9 for the treatment of 
ringworm by means of X-rays. In closing this section of the report, 
the medical officer says: 
It seems clear that defective vision and defective teeth can not be treated, 
either economically or efficiently, upon a parochial basis, and the only hope of 
their successful treatment in the rural districts would appear to rest upon the 
establishment of efficient organizations under the secondary education com- 
mittees (appointed for counties).

IRELAND. 
CENTRAL AUTHORITIES FOR EDUCATION. 
Education in Ireland is fostered by public funds which are ad- 
ministered by the following bodies: The commissioners of national 
education, the intermediate education board, and the department of 
agriculture and technical instruction. A fourth body, styled the com- 
missioners of education in Ireland, constituted under provisions of the 
educational endowments (Ireland) act of 1885, is charged with the 
supervision of education endowments, their management, accounts of 
schools and boards sharing in them, and the approval of the schemes 
of education adopted by these schools and boards. The schools 
themselves may pertain to the national system of elementary edu- 
cation or to the class of intermediate schools. 
THE COMMITTEE OF INVESTIGATION. 
The chief complaint that has arisen in connection with the national 
system of education in Ireland relates to the status of teachers, in- 
cluding their salaries and the system under which they have been 
graded and promoted.’ This subject was committed to a special com- 
mittee appointed in January, 1913. This committee consisted of 
representative men and by the terms of the reference they were 
directed— 
To inquire and report whether the rules, regulations, and practice of the com- 
missioners of national education in Ireland with regard to the inspection of 
schools and to the awarding of increments and promotion to teachers and the 
methods adopted by the inspectors in carrying out their inspection are condu- 
cive to sound education, to efficiency on the part of the teachers, and to fairness 
and uniformity in their treatment; and whether any, and if so what, changes 
are desirable in the system of inspection; and also to report upon the relations 
of the commissioners and their inspectors to the teachers and upon the rules 
and regulations of the commissioners with regard to the conduct of the teachers, 
and especially as to whether such rules and regulations unduly restrict the 
liberty of the teachers in any respect, and whether in any cases some notice 
of the intention to make new rules should be published, and whether due 
facilities for appeal and means of access to the board are allowed to the 
teachers. 
The investigations and inquiries of the committee were continued 
for over a year, testimony was heard from persons representing 
every phase of the question under consideration, and the conclusions 
of the committee are embodied in a series of recommendations which 
promise, if adopted, to remove many of the disabilities under which 
the teachers of Ireland have worked. The liberal spirit of the com- 
mittee is indicated by the final resolution, which is as follows: 
That in the interests of education in all parts of the country all responsible 
proposals to vary the program to suit the special circumstances of each locality 
should be met with a generous as well as a careful and discriminating consid- 
eration. The committee note that in England there is no such thing as a com- 
pulsory subject.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
One of the greatest contributions to the development of public edu- 
cation has been made by Ireland in the system carried on by the de- 
partment of agriculture and technical instruction. The main fea- 
tures of this work as adopted under the direction of Mr. (now Sir) 
Horace Plunkett are still continued. A central department develops 
the general plan of action and disburses the Government fund for 
the work. In respect to agriculture the department has the advice 
of a council constituted for that branch of the service, and with 
respect to technical education the advice of a technical instruction 
board and a consultative committee of education. The income of 
the department consists of an annual appropriation of £166,000 
($830,000) and the interest on an original endowment of £205,000 
($1,025,000), together with such additional appropriations as are 
allowed from time to time. The distribution of the funds is deter- 
mined by an act of 1899 [agriculture and technical instruction (Ire- 
land) act]. 
A few central institutions are maintained by the department, but 
its great objects, namely, the promotion of scientific agriculture 
throughout the country and of technical industries under favorable 
conditions, are pursued by means of a well-developed plan of coop- 
eration with local authorities and agents. This principle is steadily 
maintained in the educational work of the department. 
SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION. 
The principal features of the system of agricultural instruction 
fostered by the department are as follows: Itinerant instruction, 
agricultural schools and classes, the training of instructors and 
teachers, and the maintenance of higher agricultural institutions and 
experiment stations. These various agencies were all in successful 
operation throughout the year 1914. The scope of work in charge 
of the itinerant instructors and its increase over the preceding year 
are indicated by the following table:

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
Courses of training for appointments under the schemes of itinerant instruc- 
tion and in agricultural schools and colleges were continued in the agricultura] 
faculty of the Royal College of Science, Dublin, at. the Albert Agricultural Col- 
lege, and at the Munster Institute. Arrangements were made to enable students 
of the Ulster dairy school to complete at that school the course of training for 
teacherships in agricultural schools for girls. Twenty-one students completed 
their training during the year and obtained appointments in connection with the 
agricultural work of the department. No less than 166 students trained at the 
institutions mentioned are now employed on the department’s staff or as county 
instructors or teachers. 
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
In accordance with section 16 of the act of 1899, the annual sum of 
£55,000 allowed for the purposes of technical instruction is to be 
divided into two parts, one part of which must be distributed, in pro- 
portion to their respective populations, among the county boroughs 
in aid of approved schemes of technical instruction, and the other 
part is applicable to schemes of technical instruction elsewhere than 
in county boroughs and for certain other purposes mentioned in the 
act, such as the collection of information for the purposes of technical 
instruction. 
At the meeting of the board of technical instruction held on May 
81, 1912, the question of the fifth triennial division of the funds was 
considered, and the board unanimously concurred in the department’s 
proposal that the arrangements made in respect of the fourth trien- 
nial period should be renewed for the fifth triennial period. Accord- 
ingly the allocation of funds for the three years ending March 31, 
1915, is as follows: For technical instruction in county boroughs, 
£26,000; for technical instruction elsewhere than in county boroughs 
and for central purposes, £29,000. 
The board therefore controls the expenditure of an annual sum of 
£29,000, which is applicable for technical instruction elsewhere than 
in county boroughs and for certain central purposes. The balance of 
the £55,000, viz £26,000, allocated, with the concurrence of the beard, 
for technical instruction in the six county boroughs, is applied in aid 
of schemes in these boroughs subject to the approval of the depart- 
ment alone. 
The year reviewed was marked by extensions of the work, every 
urban district of importance having framed a scheme for technical 
instruction approved by the central.board. 
The system of itinerant instruction in domestic economy, ance 
training, etc., received new impetus from the regulation under which 
grants are paid for single subjects at @ lower rate than those appli- 
cable to courses of instruction. The time seems to have come when 
12084°—xp 1915—vor 1——44

    690 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the county schemes must be intrusted to organizing secretaries having 
qualifications for the work and able to devote their whole time to it. 
The department insisted upon the employment of such a secretary in 
a particular county during the year, and will undoubtedly adopt this 
as a settled policy as rapidly as circumstances permit. 
Progress is also reported in the work of the organized technical 
schools in county boroughs and urban districts, an effect, apparently, 
of the increased adaptation of the courses of instruction to local needs 
and the system of examinations recently adopted. Special difficulty 
is experienced in the effort to maintain technical schools in small 
centers. In this connection the report says: 
One of the disadvantages under which we labor is due to the absence of the 
industrial atmosphere that characterizes and encourages the efforts of technical 
educators in other countries. A youth not unnaturally seeks to know how he 
can apply the knowledge he acquires in the téchnical school. In this connection 
it is encouraging that employers are taking greater interest in the work of 
technical schools than was forrierly the case. Undoubtedly much more requires 
to be done in this direction. The strain thrown upon young employees who 
work during the day and attend the technical school for several hours on several 
evenings in the week is considerable. The instruction they receive is certainly 
such as to make them more efficient and more valuable to their employers, and 
these should be prepared to bear their share of the strain. * * * 
In parts of the country, as, for example, County Cork, the smaller technical 
schools are without responsible head teachers, the work being done by traveling 
teachers, who undertake instruction in a group of schools. Such a system has 
in many cases been the only possible arrangement in the past. Its drawbacks, 
however, are obvious. Not only is it difficult or impossible to secure local 
enthusiasm for a school worked wholly by visiting teachers, but “ intensive ” 
organization is impossible. For the due development of many of these schools 
“we must look forward to the appointment of responsible teachers for each 
school. 
The opinion is expressed that the only satisfactory remedy for 
these difficulties would be a compulsory-attendance law applicable to 
both employees and apprentices. 
The arrangements for training teachers carried out by the co- 
operation of the department with the national education board and 
local technical committees have been extended during the year. 
Recently the department have undertaken the training of national 
teachers in rural science (including school gardening), and by ar- 
rangement with the national board have undertaken the inspection 
of this’subject wherever taught in the national schools.

CENTRAL INSTITUTION. 
The Royal College of Science for Ireland completed its forty- 
seventh annual session in June, 1914. This institution comprises 
both technical and agricultural departments, and during the year 
under review took possession of new buildings which provide for 
the extension of many branches of the college work which were in 
need of necessary accommodation and up to date apparatus. ‘The 
engineering division has been supplied with the most recent ma- 
chines, engines, and testing appliances and is now very completely 
equipped. The plant of the chemical division has also been greatly 
extended. The total registration of students in the year was 133, 
including 49 in the agricultural faculty. The summer course of 
instruction maintained in the interests of teachers of secondary and 
technical schools was attended by 397 students.

INTRODUCTION. 
The Scandinavian countries are all characterized by the complete- 
ness of their educational provision and the attention paid to prac- 
tical training without the sacrifice of cultural ideals. Primary educa- 
tion is compulsory in the three Kingdoms referred to, covering the 
period 7 to 14 years of age; its enforcement is facilitated by the 
combination of official agencies, parental interests, and the adapta- 
tion of schools to the industrial needs and social conditions of differ- 
ent classes of pupils. At the opening of the European war, measures 
were pending in both Sweden and Norway looking to improvements 
in the general scheme of elementary education through an extension 
and readjustment of the provision for training teachers. The seri- 
ous purposes of the two Governments in this matter were indicated 
by the increased appropriations for elementary education. Although 
not directly involved in the war, its effects in these neutral coun- 
tries are indicated by the interruption of many plans looking to the 
general welfare, including those relating to education. 
The following particulars relate to current conditions in the 
separate Kingdoms, as reflected in official documents and periodicals: 
SWEDEN. 
The educational system of Sweden was described in detail in the 
Commissioner’s report for 1913+ and a survey of more recent activi- 
ties in the report for 1914.2. By reference to these accounts it will 
be seen that the development of the elementary schools, and more

particularly that of the normal schools, in view of modern condi- 
tions has become in Sweden, as in other countries,.a matter of great 
interest. The entire province of teacher training was the subject of 
investigation by a royal committee which was appointed in 1906 and 
continued its investigations down to 1911. As a result of the report 
of this body, three Government bills were-laid before the Riksdag in 
1913. The bill relating to the improvement of normal schools or 
teachers’ training colleges was passed essentially as submitted, and 
its provisions have occupied the attention of the teachers’ associa- 
tions and educational journals down to the present time. 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
Primary instruction is given in the lower schools (smaskolor), 
having two or three classes, or in the ordinary primary schools 
(folkskolor), having three or four classes; and in some districts 
in schools combining the lower section and the more extended sec- 
tion. Intermediate between these two classes of schools are special 
schools for children living in isolated villages or on farms. These 
schools, which may be ambulatory, are found almost exclusively in 
the districts of the extreme north. In the larger cities the primary 
schools are generally completed by upper grades comprising from 
five to eight classes. For children who only finish the obligatory 
period of four years, continuation courses are maintained for six 
months in the year. Attendance upon the latter, as also upon the 
higher division of the primary schools, is optional. 
Distinct from the primary schools, properly so called, there are 
also higher primary schools which generally offer courses of prac- 
tical training differing slightly in that respect from the higher 
grades of the schools with eight or nine classes. 
As a rule a separate teacher is employed for every class both in 
the lower primary schools and in the complete primary schools. 
At the end of 1912 the number of primary schdols of the various 
classes indicated above was ‘15,345, of which 1,568 were ambulatory 
schools and 33 organized as higher primary schools. The total num- 
ber of teachers was 20,634, of whom 5,927, or 287% per cent, were men. 
The number of children of school age (7 to 14 years) was 892,327; 
of this total 774,873, 868, per cent, were enrolled in the various 
classes of primary schools. The children attending secondary 
schools, schools for special classes, private schools, or instructed at 
home raise the total number under instruction to 819,438. The 
remaining number, 72,889, includes 51,518 who had finished the 
obligatory course of instruction; 3,269 sick or infirm; 14,408 were 
temporarily prevented from attending school by family conditions, 
including poverty, extreme distance from school, etc. The close su- 
pervision of the school population shows that only 3,694 children, 
 
-P-A-G-E-715
  EDUCATION IN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 695 
525 per cent, were without instruction. The total expenditure for 
primary education was 44,788,092 crowns ($12,003,208). Of the 
total the State contributed 28 per cent; the remainder was provided 
by local authorities. 
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The principle of adaptation, which is clearly shown in the classi- 
fication of primary schools, is equally marked in the provision for 
secondary education. The schools of this order comprise the lower 
secondary school (realskola), which has four one-year classes and 
leads to the higher secondary school examination (studentexamen). 
The course of the higher secondary school (gymnasium) comprises 
four years in continuance of the fifth year of the realskola. Thus 
the complete course of the higher secondary schools covers nine years 
of study. The gymnasium itself is divided into two parallel sec- 
tions, one a Latin section, the other modern. In 1913 there were 77 
public secondary schools, 39 belonging to the ‘lower class (realskola) 
and 88 to the higher. Of the latter, 4 offered only the Latin 
course, 7 only the modern course, and 27 were organized with par- 
allel sections. The registration in both classes of secondary schools 
was 24,129. Of this number about 73 per cent were in the lower 
schools, 15 per cent in the modern section of the gymnasium, and 12 
per cent in the Latin course. 
The universities were attended in 1913 by 3 ,734 students; 2,419 at 
Upsala; 1,815 at Lund. There are also a State faculty of nedicias 
in Stockholm (395 students) and private universities in Stockholm 
(philosophical and law faculties with 675 students and 97 auditors) 
and Géteborg (philosophical faculty with 224 students). 
The growing importance of increased provision for technical and 
commercial education led to the appointment of the technical com- 
mission already referred to and measures are pending for increasing 
the number of schools of this order. 
NORWAY. 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN SCHOOLS. 
The special need of government intervention and support in re- 
spect to rural schools has been recognized in Norway by making 
them the subject of laws and regulations distinct from those appli- 
cable to urban schools. The official statistics continue the distinction 
and thus emphasize the principle of local adaptation. For the latest 
year reported (1910) the elementary rural schools numbered 5,987, 
with 280,121 pupils and 5,838 teachers (men, 4,297; women, 1,541). 
The urban schools were organized in 3,241 classes, with 96,602 pupils 
and 2,725 teachers (men, 923; women, 1,802).
-P-A-G-E-716
  696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The expenditure for both classes of public schools amounted to 
Kr. 15,845,302 (about four and one-fourth million dollars). Of this 
total Kr. 8,972,666 (a little more than two and one-half million dol- 
lars) went to the rural schools. Thus it appears that the public 
rural schools in 1910 enrolled 74 per cent of all elementary pupils, - 
employed 68 per cent of the teachers, and expended 56 per cent of the 
public funds allowed for the service. These proportions differ little 
from those of 1905.1. As regards the number of years, the period of 
compulsory school attendance is the same for all schools. The period 
of annual attendance, however, is much shorter in the country than 
in the cities. Recent efforts of the Government have been particu- 
larly directed to extending the school life of country children and 
improving the qualifications of rural teachers.- 
.The adaptation of the rural schools to the conditions of country 
life is accomplished in two ways: (1) By the organization of a 
school in two or more classes attending separately; (2) by means of 
ambulatory schools. The former arrangement makes it possible to 
meet the needs of children of varying degrees of advancement or 
differing in industrial needs. Ambulatory schools are for the chil- 
dren of isolated farms, the traveling teacher passing from one to an- 
other according to a fixed schedule. In 1910 the schools of 4,380 dis- 
tricts were organized in sections for separate classes corresponding to 
half-time schools in the United States. There were also 91 ambula- 
tory schools reported. The remaining district schools, 1,607 in num- 
ber, were conducted as full-time schools. The-period of compulsory 
school attendance covers the ages 6} to 14 in rural districts as against 
7 to 14 in the cities; the annual term in the country school, however, 
is only from 12 to 15 weeks against 40 weeks in the cities. A large 
proportion of the children (52 per cent) in 1910 attended the rural 
school for the shortest period; the average number of days of school 
attendance for each pupil in the country was 73.8 as against 235 days 
for each pupil in urban schools. The corresponding figures for 1905 
were 72 days for the rural pupil and 231.3 for the urban. 
Distinction between rural and urban schools is indicated by the 
difference in the salaries of the teachers, which is the more noticeable 
because practically all the teachers have special preparation for their 
work. For instance, in 1910, of the whole number of rural teachers 
only 118 (66 men, 52 women) had not secured the State diploma. 
In the cities the annual salaries, as reported in 1910, ranged for men 
from 1,200 crowns ($321) to 5,200 crowns ($1,393), and for women 
from 800 crowns ($214.40) to 2,150 crowns ($576.20) ; for the rural 
schools the average salary only was reported, namely, 935 crowns 
($250), an increase of 204 crowns ($54.67) since 1905. 
  
1 The statistics are published quinquennially.
-P-A-G-E-717
  EDUCATION IN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 697 
The particulars given show plainly the need of improvement in 
the system of primary education. A movement in this direction 
was begun by the law of 1909, effective January 1, 1910, which pro- 
vided for the increase of all salaries with a further augmentation 
after a certain term of service. This law also raised the contribu- 
tion from the State treasury for this purpose from 33 to 45 per cent 
of the amount locally raised for salaries. For the year 1914 the State 
appropriated 4,400,000 crowns ($1,258,400). Of this amount a little 
more than one-half, 2,340,000 crowns, was assigned to rural schools. 
The obligatory subjects of instruction are the same for all primary 
schools. They include religion, Norwegian, arithmetic, writing, 
geography, history, natural sciences, and singing. Every school is 
obliged also to furnish instruction in manual work, physical exer- 
cises, or drawing. Provision is also made for optional branches, 
which are taught in extra hours. In 1910 about one-fifth of the 
pupils in rural schools availed themselves of this provision. 
As regards the language of instruction, it is stated that in 1910, 
4,630 districts had adopted the ordinary language (riksmaal) ; the 
remaining 1,360 districts used the literary language (landsmaal). 
CONTINUATION AND HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Endeavors were also made to increase the number of continua- 
tion schools and county (amt) high schools accessible to children 
in the country, and to adapt the courses of instruction to their 
special requirements. The number of county high schools having 
subventions from the State in 1910, was 63, of which 25 were pri- 
vate. These schools are all coeducational and have courses of in- 
struction lasting from six to seven months in the year. Short 
courses of two to three months are also arranged for young women. 
: The enrollment in the year referred to was 2,996 (1,630 boys, 1,366 
girls). Continuation schools were also maintained in connection 
with 182 rural schools. The courses offered were followed by 1,893 
boys and 1,071 girls. 
While the need of equalizing school provision for country and city 
children is apparent, the instruction is so excellent that illiteracy is 
practically eliminated from the Kingdom. Great attention has also 
been paid in Norway to industrial or vocational education. The 
schools of this class, however, have recently been placed under the 
department of agriculture and do not come within the scope of the 
report here considered. 
Liberal provision is also made for secondary education leading to 
specialized courses of the university of Christiania. The road to 
these higher advantages is open to all classes of the people.

DENMARK. 
SPECIAL AGENCIES OF EDUCATION. 
The system of education in Denmark and its main features have 
been the subject of extended accounts in recent publications of this 
office. Attention has been particularly called to the Danish folk 
high schools, maintained by private enterprise and State subsidies, 
which have had a remarkable effect in preserving among the country 
people the spirit of patriotism and the sense of their public relations 
and responsibilities. Extended accounts have also been given of the 
agencies for promoting scientific agriculture and distributive coopera- 
tion. It is recognized that these agencies have depended for thcir 
success upon the general intelligence of the people. Public efforts in 
Denmark, however, have not been limited to the elements of industrial 
prosperity and the means of intellectual development, the physical 
well-being of the people has also been a subject of great interest. 
WELFARE SERVICES. 
Relation to school hygiene——The service of school hygiene and 
medical inspection in Denmark is supplemented by various agencies 
concerned in the welfare of the home and the continued promotion 
of the health of the young after the school period is completed. The 
school physician and sanitary expert act as intermediaries between 
the school, the home, physicians, hospitals, and other institutions. 
The agencies for promoting the physical well-being of children out- 
side of school include sanatoriums for scrofulous and tubercular chil- 
dren, fresh air colonies for anaemic and underfed children, and char- 
itable societies and institutions for the care of poor and needy chil- 
dren while they attend school. 
Of the entire population of Denmark (two and one-half million) 
nearly one-third live in Copenhagen, where all forms of poverty are 
encountered. Naturally, here, too, are located the principal charitable 
institutions for the care of children. As the winters in Denmark are 
humid and not adapted to outdoor sports as in Norway and Sweden, 
efforts for giving poor and sickly city children the benefits of out- 
door life are necessarily limited to the summer months. 
Sanatoriums and open-air colonies.—The maritime hospital of 
Refsnes is so organized that the children admitted may be kept out 
of doors whenever possible. For those too feeble for such exposure 
open balconies are provided where they lie and breathe the tonic air 
of the sea. The open-air treatment is combined with good food, regu- 
lar walks, and other exercises. For children who remain long, school 
instruction with appropriate gymnastics is provided; manual 
work, carpentry, brushmaking, etc., are also taught, the purpose 
being to amuse and divert the children while their minds and bodies 
are developed. Similar in organization are the maritime hospital
-P-A-G-E-719
    EDUCATION IN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 699 
of Juelsminde and the maritime sanatorium for scrofulous children 
of the commune of Fredericksburg. 
The movement for establishing open-air colonies was started in 
Copenhagen in 1905 by private effort and has become the object of 
four or five flourishing societies. Among them is a colony founded by 
the journal Politiken, of Copenhagen, and a second by the public- 
school teachers of the city. The colonies have steadily developed and 
accommodate at present about 500 children every year. 
School lunches.—The work of providing school lunches at a very 
small cost, or free if necessary, is carried on very systematically in 
Copenhagen. It was started by a public school teacher whose sym- 
pathies were excited by the appearance of poor children in her own 
classes, and at present is maintained by several societies. The city 
grants subsidies for this work, and the King and Queen both contribute 
liberally to its support. It is estimated that in the winter about 17 per 
cent of the school children of Copenhagen are thus nourished. Other 
societies give aid in the way of clothing and shoes. From Copenhagen 
this charitable work has spread to other cities of the Kingdom. 
Public gardens for children—In agreement with the idea of 
Froebel that a child should be educated according to the natural 
faculties and tendencies, 12 public gardens for children are main- 
tained by local societies. The majority of the gardens are situated 
in the suburbs of Copenhagen; instruction is given in them four 
hours daily (ordinarily from 9 to 1 p. m.) by women teachers 
specially prepared in the Froebel Normal School. Children from 3 to 
6 years of age are admitted to the gardens, and mothers may come 
with them, bringing their sewing and similar work. Meetings of the 
parents are also held when lectures are given on educational subjects 
and the care of children. : 
School gardens——The Danes are an agricultural people and the 
idea of school gardens has been adopted by them with great en- 
thusiasm, State, commune, and private citizens all cooperating 
for its promotion. Each pupil receives a plat to cultivate; the 
teacher furnishes the seeds and plants, gives advice, and maintains 
order. Special lectures in agriculture prepare teachers for the work. 
The children go to their gardens regularly at appointed times each 
week, without compulsion; if, however, a child is absent a certain 
number of times he loses his plat of ground. The main point, and 
that which constitutes the attraction of the garden, is the sense of 
being a cultivator and proprietor, for all that is raised belongs to the 
young gardener. This healthful and easy work imparts new im- 
pressions to the children and a taste for simple pleasures. It is for 
them a “return to nature.” :

from the city. Through its efforts places in the public parks of the 
city are generally reserved for the sports of children, and also in 
the large athletic park which was opened to the public in 1908. 
Swimming is universally taught and is compulsory in 18 public 
schools of the capital. Ample facilities for this exercise are provided 
even in small communes. Besides instruction in gymnastics in the 
public schools, voluntary societies are formed throughout the King- 
dom for encouraging the practice of shooting and gymnastic exercises. 
There are at least 200 gymnasiums in Denmark, maintained at an aver- 
age annual expenditure of about 6,500 crowns ($1,700). In 1907 the 
legislature passed a law providing that one-half the cost of gymna- 
siums created by the communes should be borne by the Government. 
School-excursions.—School excursions are arranged for periods of 
two to eight days, and even for longer periods. In the latter case 
they become extended itineraries into adjoining countries, occupying 
two or three weeks. Generally 30 boys, accompanied by three or 
four professors, make up the excursion party; they travel on foot 
or by bicycles. One of the main purposes of these excursions is to 
give the boys familiarity with matters that can not be learned at 
school, such as the operations of industrial establishments, works of 
art, etc., all of which are explained by the professors in an informal 
way, the pedagogical results of the excursions being considered more 
important even than the physical exercise. For the smaller boys 
and for girls, vacation excursions to the country are arranged, or 
longer visits when the children may remain from four to five weeks, 
living in families which offer them hospitality. Excursions to the 
capital city, lasting from one to four days, are fostered by a society 
which receives a grant from the Government. 
A school association—The Voluntary Union of Boys is the most 
notable of school societies and resembles both in its organization and 
purposes the Boy Scouts. The union brings together boys of all 
classes; all submit to the same discipline; smoking and the use of 
alcoholic drinks are prohibited. Boys are admitted from the age of 
11 to 12 and are advanced each year to a higher grade or class. 
Every 15 days each section meets to sing, hold iegntecehees or hear 
instructive lectures. 
This association promotes gymnastics and walking exercises, row- 
ing and swimming, and extended excursions. Several sections have 
ambulance classes for instruction in first aid to the sick and injured. 
The society has 45 branches in different parts of Denmark; the 
membership is about 6,000. 
The underlying principle of all hygenic efforts in the interests of 
the youth of Denmark, whether related directly to the schools or 
carried out by agencies outside of the school, is that of assuring the 
future welfare of the Kingdom by protecting and providing for the 
rising generation.

CHAPTER XXXT. 
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE COUNTRIES OF 
WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. 
GENERAL CONDITIONS. 
Since the breaking out of hostilities in August, 1914, no compre- 
hensive reports dealing with education have been published in the 
countries of western and central Europe involved in the war. The 
current educational journals in all the countries referred to are al- 
most entirely given over to discussions of the struggle and records of 
the devotion and bravery of students and teachers who have gone to 
the front and the roll of the honorable dead whom their surviving 
comrades pledge themselves to keep in perpetual memory. Under 
these circumstances it must suffice to note here significant events and 
activities pertaining to education that occurred in the scholastic year 
1914-15. 
FRANCE. 
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. 
The budget for the minister of public instruction in France for 
the year 1914 carried a total of 345,040,245 francs (in round numbers 
$69,000,000), not including 21,526,064 francs ($4,300,000) for fine 
arts. The estimates for education proper exceed those for 1913 by 
above $7,000,000, irrespective of a special grant of 168,000 francs 
($33,000) to be used in relief of men of letters disabled by the war 
and in aid of the widows and minor orphans of teachers who have 
given their lives for their country. Of the total amount for edu- 
cation proper above 77 per cent was for the service of primary 
instruction. 
Great efforts have been made during the year to maintain and in- 
crease the attendance upon elementary schools as a means of guard- 
ing children against the dangers arising from the disturbed con- 
dition of nearly all communities. These efforts seem to have been 
successful in respect to the children of very tender years, but in- 
dustrial necessities have forced a large proportion of the older boys 
and girls of school age to take up work in shops, on farms, ete. It 
need hardly be said that the majority of professors and students in 
the higher institutions and in the upper classes of the secondary 
schools have been called to the seat of conflict. 
701  
-P-A-G-E-722
  702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
According to a report of April, 1915, 184 colleges in France out of 
a total of 200 (not including those of the Academy of Lille) had been 
occupied for hospital purposes either wholly or in part. It was 
therefore necessary to provide temporary accommodations for the 
pupils, which was accomplished by the hearty efforts of the com- 
munal authorities and private citizens and associations. 
At the same time it was reported that the places of a large propor- 
tion of professors who were serving in the army were supplied from 
various sources. Professors that had been retired on account of age 
were called back to the service, and in places where there were col- 
leges for young girls the women professors assisted freely in the 
classes of the colleges for boys. The same willingness to serve was 
shown by men in various lines of professional life who had passed 
the age for service in the army. Engineers became professors of 
mathematics, and pharmacists and dentists professors of chemistry 
and natural sciences, and lawyers and judges revived their classical 
studies and took classes in Latin and history. In a few cases young 
university students also gave their services as teachers in the colleges 
and pursued their studies in the evenings. 
The annual meeting of the Institute of France convened under the 
presidency of Dr. Paul-Emile Appell, one of the most distinguished 
scientific men of Europe. In his inaugural address Dr. Appell char- 
acterized as follows the extraordinary circumstances under which the 
meeting was held. He said: ; 
The greatest honor of which a savant can dream is that of presiding at a pub- 
lie session of the Institute of France, that illustrious society which among all 
groups of academies existing in different countries presents a unique feature 
of uniting in one letters, arts and sciences, grace, beauty, truth—a union essen- 
tially French, a characteristic of the genius of our nation. 
By chance it has happened that under circumstances the most tragic which 
the modern world has known this presidency is occupied by an Alsatian, a citi- 
zen of Strassburg. Thus Alsace finds itself in the person of one of its sons in 
the first place in this august assembly. 
For three months our country has been engaged in a gigantic drama without 
precedent in the history of the world; this has brought into a desperate struggle 
two opposite conceptions of the future civilization of our planet, this little globe 
lost in space whose ephemeral inhabitants have nothing to live for apart from 
that vision of the ideal which they carry in their souls. 
Among the scientific events of the year which were specially noted 
by Dr. Appell were the following: 
The unveiling of the monument of our colleague, Marey, one of those men to 
whom modern physiology owes so much. 
The construction by French physicists of a huge electromagnet, in which the 
intensity and dimensions of the field were to be much greater than those of the 
most powerful apparatus in current use. 
Struck with the importance of this work the council of the 
Faculty of Science of Paris contributed a sum of 50,000 francs to
-P-A-G-E-723
    SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. 703 
its support, and Prince Bonaparte, who has always responded gener- 
ously to every demand of this nature, secured the appointment of an 
official committee to study the conditions necessary for the comple- 
tion of this undertaking. The results of the consideration of this 
study were summed up by Dr. Appell’as follows: 
Without quoting any names, the conclusions may be summarized thus: It is 
desirable that an important laboratory of magnetic research should be created; 
this laboratory should be placed under the patronage of the academy and ad- 
ministered by the University of Paris; in this laboratory should be installed 
the most powerful electromagnets of the types chosen. 
The opening address was followed by an eloquent discourse by M. 
Henri Bergson, president of the Academy of Moral and Political 
Sciences, who traced the movement of the German mind from the 
idealism of Kant to the influences which have precipitated the 
present struggle. 
The union of Latin countries was celebrated with brilliant cere- 
mony at the Sorbonne, February 12, 1915, under the direction of M. 
Paul Deschanel, the president of the French Chamber of Deputies. 
In his opening address M. Deschanel characterized as follows the 
nations represented in that assembly: 
Here in our ancient Sorbonne behold the Latin family reunited. 
First, the eldest, the grand initiator, Greece, source of all light, Pallas 
Athene, who saved European civilization from Asiatic barbarism; then Italy, 
who saved it from the African. invasion—Italy, which sends us to-day its great 
historian, its great poet, its great soldier Fcrrero, who vivifies history by 
sociology, pictures the men of antiquity as if they were alive, and recently 
celebrating at the capitol the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, evoked 
with pious fervor the Latin tradition ; d’Annunzio, the fervent poet of the Eternal 
City, born upon the shores of the Adriatic and mourning Trieste exiled; Ric- 
ciotti Garibaldi, whom Paris honors to-day, whose father fought in 1859 in the 
Alps while we were struggling at Magenta and Solferino; Ricciotti Garibaldi, 
who has generously given for us his own son. 
Then our other sister, glorious Spain, the soul of chivalry, teacher of valor 
and honor, represented here by its courageous romancer, Blasco Ibanez; and 
Portugal, who also has borne to distant shores the ardor of the Latin spirit. 
Belgium and Roumania were included in similar characteriza- 
tions, and the Latin countries were described as a “family united in 
its magnificent diversity, united to-day because the ancient rivalry 
between the Latin peoples has no longer reason for existence, the 
shadows have disappeared, all the interests are united.” 
SWITZERLAND. 
NATIONAL EXPOSITION AT BERNE. 
In the summer of 1914 a national exposition was held at Berne, 
Switzerland, to celebrate and exploit the progress of the nation. 
An important feature of the exposition was the educational exhibit
-P-A-G-E-724
  704 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
which set, forth in a very striking manner the chief elements of 
national strength in the confederation. Deprived of great natural 
resources, this country has succeeded by its determination and in- 
genuity in creating national industries which have secured for it an 
important place in the world’s trade. These industries have been 
fostered and developed by the aid of industrial and technical schools. 
More important yet are the social institutions for mutual aid and 
succor and the labor legislation and bureaus which are worthy of 
imitation by all other countries. In few countries of the world is 
public education so highly developed, but the dangers of official 
routine have been avoided by the encouragement everywhere given 
to private initiative, fo rit is in private schools that scientific educa- 
tion finds a fruitful field for its experiments and new departures. 
One of the most instructive divisions of the educational exhibit 
referred to was that in which the private schools were displayed. 
Among the collections that excited special attention were a series of 
charts contributed by the College of Geneva, illustrating the use of 
pictures in the teaching of literature. They included movable pic- 
tures comprising portraits, caricatures, views of buildings, costumes, 
monuments, etc., relating to the author or the period studied. In 
this collection naturally pictures relating to Rousseau were promi- 
nent. The scientific college of Lausanne contributed a collection 
formed by the pupils themselves, illustrating the development of 
artistic glassware. Similar collections were shown by other schools, 
indicating the manner in which the pupils are induced to develop 
the subjects that they are studying by illustrative collections. The 
prevailing interest in educational psychology was indicated by mono- 
graphs from different institutions treating of modern psychological 
methods and features. Among the subjects thus elaborated were 
the tests of Binet and Simon, experimental tests of memory, and psy- 
chologic observation of pupils from 12 to 15 years of age: Gymnastic. 
training, which has been carried to high perfection in Swiss schools, 
was illustrated by a chart from the secondary school of the Canton 
Thurgovia, and a program of school excursions by a chart from the 
school for boys in Fribourg. 
The Society for the Promotion of Manual Training made a 
graphic exhibit of its admirable methods as applied to pupils of dif- 
ferent ages in the schools for both general and vocational education. 
A NOTABLE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE. 
One of the most remarkable meetings held during the year was 
the International Conference of Socialist Women, which convened 
at Berne in March, 1915. It is a forecast of the new responsibilities 
that are coming to women as a consequence of the war.
-P-A-G-E-725
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. 705 
The meeting furnished an occasion for reviewing the measures 
planned and carried out by organized bodies of women for meeting 
present social exigencies in the several nations. In these efforts 
teachers have been especially active; their knowledge of the child 
population has enabled them to direct relief services in the most 
practical and economical manner, while at the same time their pro- 
fessional training has been of great value in the work of instructing 
women of the humbler classes in various forms of remunerative labor. . 
The conference called together representative women from the 
neutral States of Holland, Italy, and Switzerland, and from the 
belligerent countries, England, France, Germany, and Russia. Reso- 
lutions were passed denouncing war and calling for a solid basis of 
peace. 
EDUCATION FOR COLONIAL SERVICE AND ACTIVITIES. 
In that era of expansion which preceded the catastrophe of war 
and which found its highest expression in scientific researches and 
their practical applications to social and industrial activities which 
promised to bind all men together by the sense of their common 
humanity and needs, preparation for colonial service and activities 
occupied the attention of humanitarians and statesmen in the leading 
countries of. Europe. This interest led in several quarters to an ex- 
amination of the existing agencies for this special purpose. The im- 
portance of the subject has been enhanced by the war and it still 
holds a place in public discussions of future Government policies. 
A brief consideration of existing centers for this work may, there- 
fore, well claim attention. 
Although the colonial possessions of the British Government 
greatly exceed those under any other power, England has no insti- 
tution devoted entirely to the preparation of candidates for service 
in the colonies. The need of such an institution, particularly in the 
interests of the Indian Empire, has been prominent in discussions and 
projects for the organization of London University and was fore- 
shadowed by the establishment of the Imperial Institute. 
At present the higher civil administration of British India is re- 
cruited from the following sources: (1) Open competitive exami- 
nation in England; (2) the Indian army; (3) the patronage of the 
secretary of state; (4) the patronage of the local governments. The 
universities and higher technical schools of Great Britain and Ire- 
land bear a part in the preparation of candidates for this service. At 
Oxford there is a special delegacy for superintending the instruction 
of India civil-service candidates, and one of the most important 
adjuncts of the university is the India Institute, which has a corps 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——45 
 
-P-A-G-E-726
  706 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of curators all of whom are specialists in some one of the depart- 
ments in which are comprised the collections of the institute. 
At Cambridge a board of Indian civil-service studies is consti- 
tuted, the principal function of which is— 
to provide from time to time, for Indian civil-service students resident at 
Cambridge, such assistance in preparing for their final examinations, and also 
such special supervision, as they may think necessary, applying for that pur- 
pose such funds as may be assigned to them from time to time by the senate. 
Trinity College, Dublin, is on the list of institutions in which se- 
lected candidates for the civil service of India are permitted to reside 
during their year of probation which follows the passage of the open 
competition examination for the Indian civil service. During this 
period the students at Trinity have facilities for completing their 
studies in Oriental languages and Indian law and history. 
In France provision for the preparation of men for colonial service 
has grown out of the passion for knowledge which developed in the 
early part of the eighteenth century and which led to the establish- 
ment of highly specialized schools. Among these were the School 
of Living Oriental Languages, the Museum of Natural History, a 
great school of research equipped with facilities for instruction and 
investigation in every department of organic and inorganic matter, 
and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which in the departments 
of history, philology, and the section on religion added in 1885, pro- 
moted comparative study of the sciences relating to the social and 
spiritual development of the human race. These schools were main- 
tained in the interests of savants and not for administrators, directors 
of industry, or agriculturists. The more recent extension of the uni- 
versities by means of faculties, laboratories, libraries, etc., has vastly 
multiplied the provision for these various orders of specialized study. 
The possession of Algiers awakened the French Government to 
the importance of the practical preparation of young men for the 
development of that tropical country, but provision for this purpose 
was directed to preparation for the climatic conditions and changed 
environment and for the direction of agricultural enterprises. The 
modern colonial policy of France originated with Jules Ferry, min- 
ister of foreign affairs from 1883 to 1885, and represented in Indo- 
China by Paul Bert, governor general. Under this administration 
a system of education for the natives was organized, having for one 
of its purposes their preparation for official positions; in 1885 a com- 
pany of young Cambodians specially selected was sent to the Ecole 
Coloniale at Paris in order that they might be prepared for public 
service upon their return. The school, which is maintained in part 
by subventions from the State, has had large development in the last 
decade, and at present comprises sections for the study of matters 
pertaining to Indo-China and to Africa, including special courses
-P-A-G-E-727
  SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. 707 
in penitentiary administration and the customary forms of native 
civil tribunals. 
Among other centers in France affording a high order of prepara- 
tion and the direction and administration of colonial affairs and 
enterprises should be mentioned the colonial institutes auxiliary to 
the Universities of Bordeaux and Nancy; the Institute of Colonial 
Medicine at the University of Paris and the School of Colonial 
Medicine of the University of Marseille; the Higher School of Co- 
lonial Agriculture at Nogent-sur-Marne and the Colonial Schools 
of Agriculture at Tunis and Phillipeville in Algeria. The higher 
commercial school at Paris (Ecole des Hautes Etudes commerciales), 
which requires the same preparation for admission as the universi- 
ties, includes an important section of colonial commerce. 
In the development of this work in France there was a noticeable 
lack of attention to administrative science. This deficiency was met 
by the establishment at Paris of the Ecole Libre des Sciences Poli- 
tiques, which from the first directed its efforts toward this higher 
purpose, emphasizing in its program the matters relating to colonial 
conditions. The course of study for the colonial section is compre- 
hensive and the scope of each subject precisely defined. The school 
was founded by M. E. Boutmy, and includes in its faculty many dis- 
tinguished French pubilicists and economists, among them Pierre 
Leroy-Beaulieu, R. Georges Levy, René Pinon, and Emile Bourgeois. 
The colonial possessions of the Dutch in Malaysia form the great- 
est empire of dependent people in the world, excepting only that of 
the British Empire in India. The preparation of officials for the 
East Indian administration and of managers for plantations, etc., 
has long occupied the attention of the Netherlands Government; 
measures recently adopted for the education of the natives of East 
India have increased the services for which special preparation is 
required. 
The Polytechnic School at Delft has been distinguished by the 
number of its graduates who have been appointed to posts in the 
East Indies. These young men generally complete their preparation 
by a post-graduate course of two or three years in the school main- 
tained at Leyden for this special work. Here they are taught the 
Java, Malay, and Boegine languages. This institution is under the 
direct control of the minister of the interior, and the head master 
and teachers are appointed by the sovereign. The State Agricultural 
College at Wageningen offers a thorough course in colonial agricul- 
ture, which is intended for students who desire to go out to the East 
Indies as assistants or managers of great plantations and who re- 
quire, in addition to the knowledge of the products to be cultivated 
and marketed, i. e., sugar, coffee, tea, etc., an elementary knowledge 
of colonial laws and customs. -
-P-A-G-E-728
  708 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
In 1892 the Government organized a complete system of education 
in the East India possessions, which includes two divisions, one for the 
colonists modeled upon the home system and the other for the natives. 
An important feature of the system of native education is the estab- 
lishment of training schools for native officials. As a rule these 
schools include a normal department for training native teachers, 
and a higher section, with courses in jurisprudence, public and ad- 
ministrative law of the Indies, political economy, land surveying, 
waterways, etc. In 1909 a professional school intended to prepare 
native magistrates was opened at Batavia. 
The last event in the history of colonial education in the Nether- 
lands is the establishment of a university of commerce at Rotter- 
dam, which was opened with imposing ceremonies on November 8, 
1913. The university offers extended courses of training for consular 
and diplomatic examinations and has already applied to the Govern- 
ment for the right of instituting a doctorate in commercial science. 
This will be open also to students taking the course mentioned. The 
university is maintained by private funds. 
The Hamburg Colonial Institute, Germany, was founded in 1913 
largely through the efforts of citizens whose wealth and enterprise 
gave Germany a place among colonial powers. The project for rais- 
ing this institute to the university plane has been delayed, but in its 
equipment for its specialties and in the scheme of study it is unsur- 
passed. The elaborate scope of instruction may be indicated by an 
outline of the main subjects comprised in the fourth year of study. 
These are as follows: 
(1) General colonial history of the present time. (2) Colonial historical exer- 
cises.—Bookkeeping and knowledge of balances.—Plant nourishment, cultiva- 
tion and principles of fertilizing.—General zoology, with special study of the ani- 
mals of different colonial possessions.—Utilization of fishing waters on the coast 
and in the interior—Experimental chemistry, particularly concerning the 
technic of agriculture—Geological conditions in the German protectorates.— 
Geography of the German colonies.—Economical geography of Mexico, Central 
America, and West Indies.—General knowledge of Islam, including the law of 
Islam.—Ethnology of German colonies.—Studies of English colonial territory.— 
Hygiene in the Tropics.—Introduction into general phonetic languages, espe- 
cially considering the African, followed by courses in specified languages.—Con- 
struction of houses, roads, and bridges in the colonies. 
This comprehensive program is worked out in elaborate detail, 
each topic being arranged for successive or parallel courses under 
different professors. For instance, colonial law is treated in three 
separate courses comprising principles, their application to various 
situations, and court methods, and extending to administrative prac- 
tices in colonies under different European Governments. The most 
original work in charge of the institute is research carried on by 
the branch for ship and tropical diseases. Of equal importance, 
and greater popular interest is the systematic study by phonetic
-P-A-G-E-729
  SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. 709 
methods of various African and Asiatic languages existing hitherto 
in unwritten form. Grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks are be- 
ing compiled for the study of such languages, with the aid of natives 
resident in Hamburg and of professors who make frequent visits to 
the countries where such languages are spoken. The broad spirit 
in which the curriculum has been developed is indicated by the per- 
manent place given to the study of missionary work, which is con- 
sidered in respect to its intrinsic importance and its relation to 
national undertakings. The budget of the institute in 1913 amounted 
to 105,833 marks (about $26,000) and its faculty comprised 21 pro- 
fessors with 14 assistant instructors; the students numbered 83. 
GERMANY. 
Among the manifestations of vigor on the part of Germany dur- 
ing the past year those relating to education are important, al- 
though overshadowed by military affairs. The appropriations by 
the Prussian Government for education for 1914 amounted to 
281,103,937 marks (in round numbers $70,000,000). This was an 
increase of nearly 10,000,000 marks over the appropriations for 1913. 
These appropriations form a comparatively small part of the entire 
expenditure for education, which falls largely upon local authorities 
or is supplied by the income of invested funds. It is stated that 
the budget for 1915 shows no decline in this particular. 
The amount carried in the budget of 1914 for elementary schools 
was 180,897,761 marks, which is a little more than one-third of their 
annual cost. How far local contributions promise to meet the bal- 
ance is not known at present, excepting in the case of the large cities, 
which are not only liberally supporting their schools, but providing 
also for extra welfare services in behalf of children. 
Advices indicate that both cities and rural districts have made 
strenuous efforts to maintain their elementary schools and to insure 
the attendance of all children not forced by industrial exigencies 
into various fields of labor. As regards secondary and higher insti- 
tutions the situation is depressing. It is estimated that 70 per 
cent of the students of the German universities and at least 80 per cent 
of the students of the technical high schools are in the conflict; every 
educational journal recounts deeds of heroism performed by teachers 
and students, and mourns the losses that are decimating their ranks. 
The condition of children bereft of parental guardianship by the war 
has excited the sympathy of teachers, many of whom have planned 
excursions, improvement clubs, and social recreations for their pupils 
out of school hours. In Berlin a kindergarten has been established to 
care for children from 2 to 6 years of age whose mothers are either 
unable to support them or must neglect them for their daily work. 
In the events of the year the opening of the new university at 
Frankfort on the Main (Oct. 18, 1914) challenges special attention.
-P-A-G-E-730
    710 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The institution marks a departure from old ideals scarcely less 
notable than that accomplished by the establishment and operations 
of the great technical universities. In particular the provision for 
medical research places the new university among the foremost cen- 
ters of the world in this respect. It comprises no less than 10 
scientific institutions, amply endowed for research and instruction, 
among which are the Royal Institution of Experimental Therapy 
and the George Speyer House, under the direction of Dr. Paul 
Ehrlich. The university starts with an endowment of $2,000,000, 
and will probably receive liberal annual appropriations from the 
city. It is estimated that Frankfort already expends above half a 
million dollars a year on higher education, and the amount could 
easily be increased. This sum with the original endowment would 
enable it to rival the chief universities of the ancient type. 
Peculiar complications affect the new institution from the fact 
that the wealth of the city is largely in the hands of Jews and its 
future depends somewhat upon equal recognition for them in the 
faculty appointments. 
This situation and the civil purposes which have determined in a 
measure the proposed scope of the university curriculum present a 
problem of unusual interest in university movements in the Kingdom. 
Probable changes in the drift of educational effort as a result of 
the war have formed the subject of numerous and extended discus- 
sions in the educational press of Germany. An article contributed 
to the Archiv fiir Pidagogik dwells upon the subjects that will be 
emphasized in the education of the future, supporting the conten- 
tion in each case by impressive argument. In the opinion of the 
writer, technical education will assume new importance; in the 
teaching of ethics greater stress will be placed upon the rights of the 
State; and larger recognition, he predicts, will be given to the 
philosophical elements of the Herbartian pedagogics.

ITALY.’ 
The past year has been noteworthy in Italy for the destruction 
of elementary schools by the earthquake that devastated large por- 
tions of central Italy and the subsequent efforts to provide school 
facilities for the pupils, by the attempt to make the higher insti- 
tutions attractive to foreigners, and by discussion of the need for 
practical experimental schools of agriculture, both of inferior and 
superior grade. Finally, the war has led to a readjustment of 
teachers and students to the new conditions. 
After arguments by various professors and the Associazione Uni- 
versitaria Italiana the minister of public instruction has given au- 
thority to superior institutions to issue to students inscribed as simple 
auditors with single courses a certificate for certain sciences or 
groups of sciences which will be without any legal value in Italy. 
This is as far as the laws of the country permit him to go. A Jaw 
is now being sought that will give authority to the superior institu- 
tions to confer the doctor’s degree in science on anyone who has 
followed a course for a number of years and has sustained before a 
university committee a scientific thesis on any subject whatever. 
The proposed law is apparently intended to permit a foreign 
student to make a selection of studies directed toward work of his 
own liking or work that is more suited to the conditions of his own 
country, and to make this selection count for him as full credit for 
the degree of doctor of science. It is contended that while a few 
Italians may take advantage of this privilege—which is not regarded 
as altogether desirable in the present state of affairs—certainly all 
foreigners will do so, and more foreign students will be attracted to 
Italian institutions of higher learning for the very reason that the 
privilege of selecting their own studies is granted to them.

  712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
As early as July, 1914, numerous requests were being received at 
the Ministry of Public Instruction from communes desiring to obtain 
autonomy in the administration of their schools. At least 4,000 such 
requests were made. Agitation by the clericals also has been made 
in the past year for-the same purpose. 
The preponderance of women over men in the position of teacher 
is demonstrated by the fact that in conformity with the law of 
June 4, 1911, and the regulation of April 6, 1913, out of 10,179 vacant 
positions 8,911 were for women and 1,268 for men. No position for 
men was vacant in Sardinia. 
A change in the ministry took place in November of last year when 
Signor Grippo, who had been minister before, was given the port- 
folio again. One of his first acts was to issue a circular to the offi- 
cials of his department urging them to promote the institution of 
infant schools. : 
Moving pictures are now coming to be used in Italy for educa- 
tional purposes. A moving-picture establishment was opened last 
November in Rome in the “ Calidarium” of the Thermal Baths of 
Diocletian under the auspices of the national institute “ Minerva.” 
Various educational congresses have been held in Italy during the 
past year. On July 26 and 27 an important congress was held at 
Naples for the purpose of discussing in detail questions relative to the 
economic condition of teachers and to the organization and daily 
program of the classes. Teachers’ congresses were held in September 
in Calabria, the Marches, and Piedmont, and in December one was 
held at Terni in Umbria. 
NEW COMMERCIAL SCHOOL AT MILAN, 
With the first days of January, 1915, there was opened at Milan 
a special autonomous commercial school, which is intended to furnish 
rational medico-pedagogical assistance to the real abnormal students 
(weak-minded and those of unstable nervous systems) who are ex- 
cluded from the elementary commercial schools. The school was 
founded by the efforts of a private committee and is assisted by the 
commune. It is named in memory of Prof. Zaccaria Treves, who in 
the short time that he devoted to the studies of pedagogy and ap- 
plied psychology during his term of office as director of the Civic 
Laboratory of Psychology and Pedagogy of Milan had applied him- 
self sincerely and seriously to the problem of assisting abnormal 
pupils and had laid the fundamental bases for the creation of the 
first school. The committee, taking its inspiration from Prof. 
Treves’s ideas, pushed the work forward, and now, in due recogni- 
tion of his work, the school rises with his name. 
Children of both sexes, from 6 to 12 years of age, will be received 
up to the limit of 50 pupils. They will be selected by a suitable
-P-A-G-E-733
  
  COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE. 713 
commission. The school will give accurate medical assistance, with 
the application of the hygienic ideas of work, gymnastics, life out- 
doors, feeding, baths, medicinal treatments, electrical applications, 
ete.; the education of defectives in the matter of language, of atten- 
tion, etc.; the instruction to those judged capable of receiving it. 
For this purpose the school includes a preparatory course. The vari- 
ous categories of students will be instructed by the De Sanctis 
method of scholastic rotation. 
The control of the school is entrusted to the school physician of 
the office of hygiene, Dr. Alfredo Albertini, and the instruction to 
two teachers of literary subjects, two extra teachers, and also a 
teacher of physical education. The treatment for correct phonetics 
is entrusted to Prof. Giulio Ferreri, director of the National Insti- 
tute for Deaf Mutes, who, with the personnel of that institute, will 
assist in the special commercial school. 
INTERNATIONAL PRIZE CONTEST. 
The Ministry of Public Instruction has been enabled through the 
generosity of Emilio Treves, an Italian civil engineer, to offer a 
prize of 10,000 lire to the successful contestant in an international 
contest to be held with the view of combating racial and religious 
hatred, and especially antisemitism. Conditions governing the con- 
test have been established by the Minister of Public Instruction in a 
decree issued during the past year. The contest will close on Febru- 
ary 1, 1916.

ILLITERACY. 
Between 1872 and 1911 illiteracy was reduced from 68.8 per cent to 
37.6 per cent. The highest rate of illiteracy in 1911 was found in 
Reggio di Calabria (70.6 per cent) and the lowest was in Torino 
(7.8 per cent). Forty-eight and a half per cent of the population of 
Italy over 6 years of age was illiterate in 1901. The actual number of 
illiterates over 6 years of age was reduced from 13,351,058 in 1901 to 
11,050,454 in 1911. Recent advices indicate that the decline in illit- 
eracy since 1911 has been accelerated, but no statistics are available.

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR PEDAGOGICAL STUDIES. 
The first part of the year 1915 witnessed a two-day convention of 
the National Association for Pedagogical Studies (Associazione 
Nazionale per gli Studi Pedagogici). The president of this organi- 
zation is Prof. Luigi Credaro, and the vice presidents are Profs. P. 
Vecchia and S. de Sanctis. Among the councilors are such well- 
known Italian educators as G. Vidari, F. Orestano, T. Armani, P. 
Grossi, R. Resta, L. Sferra-Carini, and G. Cabrini. 
Plans for the administrative reorganization of the association were 
discussed. The suggestion was made and widely supported that the 
association put into action a program of ideas which might be a 
common policy for those filling the office of president, or otherwise, 
it was claimed, the presidency would remain the expression of a 
simple administrative organization.
-P-A-G-E-736
716 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Discussion then followed regarding the purposes of the associa- 
tion. Prof. De Sanctis proposed the immediate resumption of the 
study of certain problems, vital to the school, which have hitherto 
been opposed unjustly or poorly applied—for example, the question 
of school physicians, of afternoon instruction, and of children’s 
gardens. Prof. Vecchia urged that the association contribute in the 
work of the revision of the programs of instruction in secondary and 
normal schools. : 
Prof. Armani, at the instance of the president, set forth the 
program proposed at the preceding convention of the association. 
The salient points of this program that he regarded as still valuable 
are the following: The internal reorganization of the association 
with a view to renewing the membership of the associates and ex- 
tending the term of the committees; the compilation of an inventory 
of the property belonging to the association now deposited in the 
Pedagogical Museum of the Royal University ; the distribution of the 
work of the committees in such a way that each councilor would be 
responsible for the progress of a group of committees; the plan to 
entrust the committees with historical studies concerning the local 
scholastic institutions; and the study of the science of educational 
motion pictures, to which Prof. Orestano has given the benefit of his 
learning and experience. 
Prof. Vidari dwelt especially on the theme of agreeing on a fixed 
policy for the association. He maintained the necessity for attract- 
ing into the ranks of the association the professors of secondary 
schools, who had remained away from it perhaps because it had 
seemed that the work developed by the association had not till then 
touched on problems vital to the secondary school. He ended by 
proposing that the association should seek to arouse the consciousness 
of the Italian people concerning the importance of national culture, 
to reorganize the committees, and to study what connections the 
association could have with allied associations which are continually 
coming into existence. 
Prof. Orestano urged the association to formulate a program with 
themes and relative rewards to be proposed to the various committees 
and to students of scholastic and pedagogical subjects. In this con- 
nection he suggested the following: The history of Italian pedagogy 
and the study of scholastic institutions in the various regions before 
the unity of Italy in 1870. He considered it desirable to come to an 
understanding with the university supervisors of pedagogy to en- 
trust to doctorate students themes concerning studies of local schol- 
astic institutions, and recommended that they agree with some pub- 
lisher for the reproduction of the classical works of Italian pedagogy. 
The subject of the expense involved in this undertaking was not 
   
-P-A-G-E-737
  COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE. 717 
considered serious, because, it was argued, publication would bring 
economic advantages to the association in the future. 
The president, Prof. Credaro, concurred fully in the need of having 
the history of pedagogy in Italy studied and affirmed the desirability 
of beginning these studies with the Renaissance. He then spoke of 
the national and scientific value of a history of Italian pedagogy 
and maintained that along with these studies of historical research 
others of an experimental and scientific character ought to be culti- 
vated, which Prof. De Sanctis could indicate. He proposed the 
nomination of a committee which would prepare the program for 
work in the direction set forth by the various speakers. 
After some discussion it was agreed to prepare a circular contain- 
ing these ideas to be sent to the committee and to the members. The 
preparation of this paper was intrusted to Profs. Vidari and 
Orestano. On the second day of the convention this circular was 
submitted by Prof. Orestano, and approved. The purpose of the 
association, as set forth in the circular, is— 
to maintain the consciousness of national ideals and of the civil duties which 
belong to the people, especially in an hour like the present; to unite the teachers 
of every order around the standard of conscious, vigilant, and strong national 
education; to promote by publications, congresses, and historical studies the 
sense of national work and cordial sympathies toward other people; in short, to 
fuse all the living though dormant elements of the rising national consciousness 
into a strong, compact unity of spirit. 
To this end the directing council invites the cooperation of all 
leaders in education thought and activity and in particular seeks to 
promote the publication of an ample history of Italian pedagogy, a 
work requiring researches that have never yet been attempted, but” 
which promise rich returns. 
PORTUGAL. 
Portugal was declared a Republic October 5, 1910, and the new 
government formally recognized by the powers in September, 1911. 
The reform of primary education and its extension throughout the 
country were made prominent in all announcements of the purposes 
of the new government. A decree providing for the rigid enforce- 
ment of the compulsory provision of the school law was one of the 
first measures adopted, but the continued internal disturbances have 
made it difficult to carry into effect reform measures. An educational 
survey authorized by the Government in 1911 disclosed the fact that 
there were in operation at that time 7,120 primary schools, of which 
6,320 were public; neither the enrollment nor the number of teachers 
employed was ascertained. The lack of school buildings and the 
totally unsuitable condition of many showed the impossibility of 
enforcing compulsory school attendance until these conditions should
-P-A-G-E-738
    718 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
be remedied. On the contrary secondary schools (numbering 32) 
were reported as in a flourishing condition. They enrolled in 1911 
9,749 students, increased to 10,621 in 1912. The number of university 
students in 1913 was 2,373, distributed as follows: Lisbon, 823; Coim- 
bra, 1,350; Oporto, 200. The technical school registered 232 students, 
and the higher school of agriculture 87, both at Lisbon. 
SPAIN. 
The population of Spain, estimated in December, 1913, at 20,355,986, 
is comprised in 49 Provinces, varying in population from 97,692 in 
the Basque Province of Alava to Barcelona with 1,163,242 inhab- 
itants. Prior to 1900 each Province had independent control of pri- 
mary education, which was so little encouraged that above 40 per 
cent of the population were at that date illiterate. The alarm ex- 
cited by this condition caused the Government to intervene as a con- 
trolling authority in this interest; in 1900 a ministry of education 
was created; in 1902 the State assumed the payment of teachers’ sal- 
aries and provided for the erection of school buildings in cities or 
districts neglecting this duty; in 1909 a law was passed increasing the 
authority of the State in respect to the appointment of teachers and 
the internal conduct of schools; and in 1911 a decree was passed cre- 
ating the office of general director of primary education. That these 
measures have had the effect of increasing the number of primary 
schools and improving their general condition is evident from occa- 
sional reports pertaining to particular areas. The latest statistics 
dealing with the country as a whole are for the year 1908, at which 
time there were 24,861 public primary schools and 5,212 private pri- 
maries, with a total enrollment estimated at about 2,100,000. The 
total number of schools was an increase of 6,000 over the number 
given in the census of 1900. 
The great industrial and commercial activity in the more progres- 
sive Provinces, and particularly in the Province of Barcelona, has 
stimulated local and private enterprise in respect to the establish- 
ment of commercial and industrial schools and led to an increased 
appreciation of the need of primary education as a factor in the 
public welfare, and it is believed that the next census will show very 
decided increase in respect to all the agencies of popular education. 
The movement for modern education proceeds slowly, as the edu- 
cated classes adhere tenaciously to their preference for the long- 
established literary studies. Secondary education is supplied by 59 
institutions, with a registration of about 88,000 pupils. The great 
purpose of these schools is preparation for the universities. 
The Government also supports special schools of engineering, agri- 
culture, architecture, fine arts, music, etc. The development of tech-
-P-A-G-E-739
  COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE. 719 
nical education is hindered by the want of adequate preparation of 
students for the higher orders of this special training. 
Efforts have been recently made to increase the interest of for- 
eigners in the favilities for study offered by the higher institutions of 
Spain. Under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction and 
Fine Arts holiday courses for foreigners were opened in the summer 
of 1912, and the experiment proved so successful that a third course 
was announced for the summer of 1914, at which time arrangements 
were made for a continuance of the work in 1915. The holiday 
courses were organized in general and special sections, the former 
providing for the study of grammar, literature, history, and the 
social life of Spain, with intensive study of the nineteenth century. 
The special section was intended for persons wishing to specialize in 
the philology and literature of the Spanish language. Visits to the 
principal museums and art collections of Madrid and other centers of 
art form a part of the general program. 
GREECE. 
As a result of changes brought about by the wars with Turkey 
and Bulgaria nearly 17,000 square miles were added to the territory 
of Greece and the population very nearly doubled. In 1907 the esti- 
mated population of the old territory was 2,765,000; including the 
new territory it was estimated in 1914 at 4,821,000. This expansion 
greatly increased the difficulty of making elementary education uni- 
versal throughout the kingdom, and subsequent events have prevented 
the carrying out of plans for this purpose. Before these events the 
compulsory education law, which covered the years 6 to 12, had not 
been well enforced, as appears from the fact that 30 per cent of the 
army recruits were illiterate and an additional 15 per cent could only 
read. In 1912 the Government appropriated some 10,000,000 drach- 
mai (about $2,000,000) for elementary schools. The secondary 
schools of Greece included 41 gymnasia modeled after those of Ger- 
many, 284 middle schools, and 6 commercial schools, having a total 
enrollment of 31,399, of whom 1,221 were girls. There were also at 
Athens and Patras Government trade schools, well equipped and sup- 
ported. 
The education of girls has been for a decade or more the subject of 
great effort on the part of private associations, and this interest - 
gradually engaged the attention of the Government, in view of the 
growing demand for teachers and the industrial conditions in the 
chief cities. Early in 1915 arrangements were completed for the 
construction in the suburbs of Athens of an important school for 
girls to be known as the Charocopeion Trade School. The proposed 
course of studies included those usually taught in a high school, 
with special classes in domestic sciences, household economy, and
-P-A-G-E-740
  720 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
trades for which women are especially qualified, such as weaving, 
spinning, etc. It was expected that the institution would draw ~ 
pupils from all parts of Greece and that in turn they would instruct 
their neighbors in the practical arts thus acquired. The patronage 
of the Queen of Greece seemed to assure the success of this enter- 
prise. : 
Greek Macedonia, acquired as a result of the recent wars, includes 
a population of a million and a quarter. Agriculture is the princi- 
pal industry of this region and yields rich returns in spite of primi- 
tive methods of cultivation. The Greek Government immediately 
took measures for developing this industry and improving the con- 
dition of the tenant farmers. 
During the year 1914 the ministry of national economy of Greece 
expended more than $16,000 for repairing and equipping the so- 
called “Model farm of Saloniki,” and it was understood that this 
institution would be designated by the minister as the principal 
agricultural school in Greece. The school was established about 20 
years ago but was little developed under the Turkish régime. 
The model farm has three buildings for scholastic purposes (one 
of which contains a museum and also a chemical laboratory), a 
station for stock-breeding purposes, and several outbuildings. The 
new plans include on the material side the construction of a large 
school building, the supply of modern agricultural machinery and 
chemical fertilizers; on the industrial side the improvement of the 
farm: lands, the development of the nursery, ae provision for a 
model dairy and vineyards. 
An official in charge of the viticulture visits the surrounding 
villages to give advice to the vine growers. He may also officially 
quarantine fields infected with phylloxera by directing that no 
plants from the infected regions shall be brought in contact with 
healthy plants. 
The Thessalonica Agricultural and Industrial Institute. is an 
American mission school and was incorporated in October, 1904, 
under the laws of the State of New York. The object of this mis- 
sion school is to give to Macedonian boys an ideal education, which 
shall include agricultural and industrial as well as_ spiritual 
training.’ 
The particulars above given relative to movements in Portugal, 
Spain, and Greece have been derived chiefly from official corre- 
spondence. Even this source of information, for obvious reasons, 
has failed in the case of the Balkan countries.

ADMINISTRATION. 
The peculiar system of educational administration in Russia was 
described by Prof. A. Netschayeff, of the Petrograd Laboratory of 
Experimental Pedagogical Psychology, in a recent address as 
follows :? 
Schools in Russia have no administrative center. The various ministries 
among which, over a hundred years ago, the administration of Russia was di- 
vided, have each their own educational institutions. Owing to a long series of 
complicated historical conditions, the distribution of educational institutions 
among separate ministries is not subjected to any strict and logical plan. The 
polytechnic institutes are under the jurisdiction of the ministry of commerce 
and industry, and the St. Petersburg Technological Institute is under the min- 
istry of public instruction. The schools for agricultural education are, inde- 
pendently of one another, controlled by the ministry of agriculture and the 
ministry of public instruction. The medical faculties of the universities and 
the Women’s Medical Institute are controlled by the ministry of public instruc- 
tion; but the Imperial Medical Academy, which, until recently, has trained our 
most eminent scientists, is under the ministry of war. The Imperial Alexander 
Lyceum, the purpose of which is to train candidates for the diplomatic service 
and for the higher administrative positions, is under the department for benevo- 
lent institutions. One part of the primary schools is controlled by the ministry 
of public instruction, and the other of the administration of the Orthodox 
Church. 
The curricula of educational institutions under the various ministries diverge 
greatly from one another, and consequently the passing over of a pupil from a 
school of one type to one of another type is attended with great difficulty. Es- 
pecially difficult is the passage from a primary school to a grammar school 
(classical or modern side). 
As a consequence of the too early specialization in education many 
Russian educators and public men advocate the idea of one sole 
school of general education as being the necessary foundation for 
the subsequent special education.

Prof. Netschayeff observes, however— 
that this dispersal of Russian schools under different ministries has also had 
its good side. * * * Fortunately for the Russian schools, the courses fol- 
lowed by separate ministries on educational questions have often differed one 
from the other; that which was forbidden to schools under one ministry was 
allowed to the schools under another; that which one minister considered to 
be untimely, another minister regarded as necessary. In view of this, publie 
men and pedagogues succeeded, through one ministry or another, in introducing 
gradually their ideas into educational life. In this respect the great importance 
of the ministry of commerce and industry in the history of the latest period 
of Russian school life is particularly noteworthy. This ministry, by allowing 
public organizations willing to open commercial schools to exercise serious 
influence over the general work of their schools, by granting liberty for the 
creation of the educational staff, and by assisting a close rapprochement be- 
tween the family and the schools, has spread over Russia within the course of 
some 25 years an entire network of educational institutions, maintained exclu- 
sively by social and private means. Many reforms recently carried through 
in the programs of the schools under the ministry of public instruction have 
been the result of those accepted in the commercial schools. 
The difficulty of obtaining a complete view of education in the 
Empire on account of its enormous extent and vast heterogeneous 
population is greatly increased by the distributed administration. 
Although the minister of public instruction has oversight of the 
great body of elementary and secondary schools and of higher 
schools of liberal education, still the reports of this official, pub- 
lished at intervals, do not cover the entire province of education. 
Even with respect to the schools under this ministry complete sta- 
tistics are seldom obtained, as will readily be understood when it is 
considered that for purposes 6f local educational administration the 
Empire is divided into 15 districts, each comprising a number of 
governments varying from 8 to 15; the average density of popula- 
tion in the governments of European Russia is only 64.6 inhabitants 
per square mile and falls in Siberia to 1.8. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARY. 
The latest summary comprising all classes of schools and higher 
institutions was published by the statistical commission of Russia 
January 1,1911. According to this authority there were at the time 
in the 15 educational districts of the Empire, with the eight Finnish 
governments, a total of 7,901,477 pupils and students. Of. this 
number— 
6,322,725 (83.2 per cent) attended elementary schools; 446,186 (5.9 per cent) 
secondary schools; 241,495 (3.2 per cent) special elementary and secondary 
schools; and 67,863 (0.9 per cent) higher educational establishments.. The 
remaining 518,400 (6.8 per cent of the total number) attended private schools, 
foreign church schools, and various non-Christian schools of religious character.

Thus it appears that out of every 1,000 inhabitants of both sexes 
in the Empire, 46.2 pupils were under instruction. In Finland the 
proportion was 69.3 per cent; in European Russia, omitting Fin- 
land, 53.1 per cent; in Siberia, 35.6 per cent; in central Asia, 21.7 
per cent. Omitting Finland, the percentage of illiterates for the 
population above 9 years of age was 73 per cent for Russia as a 
whole; in the Vistula Provinces, 59 per cent; in central Asia, 94 per 
cent. As regards the sexes, the number of illiterate females is twice 
as great as the number of illiterate males. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The following particulars pertain to institutions of higher educa- 
tion under the minister of public instruction:

A popular university, the General Alphonse Shaniavsky, was 
opened at Moscow in 1908, the expenses of which are defrayed from 
a fund left by Gen. Shaniavsky for that purpose. 
An institution, founded by the munificence of Peter Makoushin, 
which aims at the instruction on a large scale of the people of 
Siberia, has been inaugurated in Tomsk. The institution in question 
is called the House of Science, and is meant to be a popular university 
where anyone may obtain instruction, from the elementary to the 
secondary standard, free of charge. It includes also a section for 
instruction of the kind usually given at universities. 
Admission to the universities is confined to those who have obtained 
the leaving certificate (attestat zrelosti) from the gymnasium. 
Attendance at the universities is promoted by scholarships and 
funds in aid. The value of the former as reported in 1914 was 
556,597 roubles ($284,000), and the value of the funds in aid, 117,821 
roubles. The treasury estimates of appropriations for the university 
amounted in 1913 to 7,652,000 roubles (about $5,000,000). 
The universities of Russia are closed to women, but education of 
the university standard is provided for them in classes maintained in 
Petrograd and Moscow, which together have an annual attendance
-P-A-G-E-744
    724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of about 11,000 students. The medical institute for women estab- 
lished at the capital has about 1,400 students. In 1910 a department 
of medical science for women was opened in the University of 
Kharkof. 
Similar classes for women, but not on the same permanent basis, 
are maintained in nearly all the university towns of the Empire. 
Among the most striking signs of intellectual activity are the efforts 
made by private agencies to meet the universal demand of Russian 
women of the middle and upper classes for education of the higher 
order. 
The increasing regard for women is indicated by the appointment 
during the current year of Mme. Staraiszewska as privatdocent in the 
chair of pathology of the University of Odessa. The appointee com- 
pleted her studies in France at the faculty of medicine of Nancy 
in 1899. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Russia has given important lessons to the world in respect to the 
organization and management of higher technical institutions in- 
tended to prepare experts for the service of the State. The de- 
velopment of technical schools for artisans and the directors of in- 
dustries is of comparatively recent date. Schools of this class were 
first established under private auspices and gradually brought under 
the direction of different ministers, but in 1881 these schools were 
all transferred to the minister of public instruction, and under this 
direction a graded system of technical education has been organized, 
comprising (1) lower technical schools which combine with the 
elements of knowledge technical training required for the ruder kind 
of mechanical work—for machinists, draftsmen, etc.; (2) technical 
schools which provide for general education of the secondary order, 
combined with technical training required for assistant engineers or 
foremen in the smaller industrial enterprises. 
As a result the scope of the higher institutions has been increased 
and additions made to their number. Attendance at these schools is 
fostered by scholarships and grants in aid, as in the case of the 
universities. The following table pertains to these higher technical 
‘schools which are of university grade having advanced entrance re- 
quirements and the right to confer degrees.

There are also three mining schools supported by the Government, 
situated, respectively, at Petrograd, Ekaterinoslav (Donetz mining 
district), Ekaterinburg (Urals mining district). 
APPROPRIATIONS FOR EDUCATION. 
The State appropriations for education in 1912 were: Ministry 
of public instruction, 114,436,072 rubles ($58,934,577) ; other minis- 
tries, 17,289,039 rubles ($8,903,855); total, 181,725,111 rubles 
($67,838,432). The estimated appropriations for 1913 were as fol- 
lows: Ministry of public instruction, 136,734,000 rubles ($69,734,- 
840); other ministries, 58,339,000 rubles ($29,752,890). Of the 
increase for the ministry of education, one-half was intended for 
elementary education. It is noted in this connection that, during 
the whole period of the 100 years prior to the establishment of the 
Imperial Duma, the budget for public instruction only increased by. 
85,000,000 rubles (about $17,000,000). In the five years since the 
session of the first Duma the appropriations to education have ex- 
ceeded the amount allowed for that purpose during the entire century 
preceding. 
At the opening of the European war it was apparent that Russia 
had entered upon an era of industrial and educational development 
in which the Government was bearing an important part, in coopera- 
tion with the zemstvos (local administrative authorities) and private 
enterprise." 
WORK OF THE LABORATORY OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 
The passion for scientific investigation for which Russian scholars 
have been distinguished has been manifested not only in the exact 
sciences but in respect to the departments of knowledge which have 
to do with man and the social institutions that he has developed. 
This innate tendency, intensified by the protest against the formalism 
of the schools, has resulted in important ‘researches bearing directly 
upon the work of education. The work of Ushinsky, who was called 
“the father of Russian pedagogical psychology,” has been continued 
by a series of notable savants whose ideas found concrete expression 
in the educational pamphlets and experiment by Count Leo Tolstoy. 
The laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology which was 
opened at Petrograd in 1901 is one of the chief centers of that class 
of investigations in Europe. In his address before the British asso- 
ciation already cited, Prof. Netschayeff, who was intrusted with the 
organization of this work, described in detail the nature and methods 
of the investigations there conducted. These comprise tests of mem- 
  
1¥or particulars relative to the recent activities, see Repts. of Commr. of Educ., 1912, 
vol. 1, ch. 23; 1913, vol. 1, ch. 39; 1914, vol. 1, ch. 36.  
-P-A-G-E-746

ory, of processes of association, stability of attention, conditions of 
fatigue, response to suggestions, the hygiene of intellectual work, the 
relative advantages of visual, auditory, and motor memory, and the 
relative value of object teaching and of the so-called natural method 
of teaching foreign languages as compared with book instruction. 
The investigations outlined above follow, it will be seen, the usual 
course of similar work in the United States, but the work at Petro- 
grad has been characterized by its steady direction toward the eluci- 
dation of certain well-recognized educational problems. Most promi- 
nent among these is that of “the changes in the moral life of chil- 
dren dependent on their age and sex,” and as auxiliary to this the 
problem of coeducation. In respect to the last-named the conclusions 
stated by Prof. Netschayeff are of unusual interest. He says: 
The comparison of the results of tests on association, conducted simultane- 
ously in schools of the same type, both with separated education and with 
coeducation, revealed the favorable influence of coeducation on the general 
tendency of the imagination of the pupils. In coeducation the general tendency 
of association among girls loses that extremely emotional character which is 
observed in girls’ schools. In this case the inspiring influence of boys is quite 
obvious. This is particularly noticed in the first stage of the transitional age, 
when there is generally observed in children an easy yielding to the suggestions 
of environment. Seeing that the period of sexual ripening begins earlier with 
girls than with boys, then, while submitted to the psychical influence of their 
boy comrades of the same age, who have not yet entered into that period, girls 
in coeducation retain longer the general tendency of imagination natural to a 
child’s age, and do not display that acute tendency toward concentrating their 
attention on organic sensations and indefinite emotions, which are so often no- 
ticed during the period of ripening in separate education. A study of associa- 
tion in boys revealed the favorable influence of coeducation over the purity of 
their imagination, and the calmer course of the first period of sexual ripening. 
In regard to the relation of teachers to research work the address 
presents the following suggestions: 
There is no doubt that in studying the problems of pedagogical psychology, 
over and above other data, the daily observation of the children by pedagogues 
is of great importance. In order, however, that one could with certainty bene- 
fit by the results of such observation, it is required to study the degree of their 
objective authenticity, and to ascertain the sources of the pedagogical illusions 
possible in this respect. In characterizing the pupils, the teachers describe them 
often as “attentive” and “ inattentive,” “progressing” and “ non-progressing,” 
“interested ” or “not interested.” What do such descriptions signify, and on 
what first impressions of the teacher are they mostly founded? 
Certainly the elucidation of such questions brings great difficulty. Two con- 
ditions before all are required—(1) that the teachers who characterize their 
pupils should have reached the level of conceiving the child’s psychology; and 
(2) that the pupils characterized should be submitted, independently of their 
teachers, to psychological study, the results of which should be submitted to 
statistical treatment. 
In order to create the conditions for the successful study of such complicated 
problems of pedagogical psychology, I organized, in 1910, a special school (at
-P-A-G-E-747
    EDUCATION IN RUSSIA, 727 
the St. Petersburg society of experimental pedagogics), the whole personnel of 
which consisted of persons who had received well-grounded psychological train- 
ing of the same type (they were my male and female classes at the Pedagogical 
Academy). At the same time a school hygiene cabinet and a psychological 
laboratory were organized at the school, where the pupils (and latterly the 
pedagogues of the school also) were submitted to systematic observation. This 
experimental school serves at pregent as the center point of my psychological 
pedagogical research. We endeavor as much as possible in this school to carry 
into life those methods of upbringing and education which seem to us at present 
to be the most perfect. 
SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS. 
The laboratory of experimental psychology is an interesting addi- 
tion to the group of special institutions for the promotion of scientific 
research in different departments of knowledge. The most important 
of these institutions are as follows: 
. Historico-Philological Institute, St. Petersburg. 
. Bezborodky Historico-Philological Institute, Nezhin, 
Demidoff Lyceum for Study of Law, Yaroslaff. 
Lazareff Institute of Oriental Languages, Moscow. 
Institute of Oriental Languages, Vladivostok. 
. Imperial Lyceum of the Tsarevitch, Moscow. 
Archeological Institute, St. Petersburg. 
. Imperial Alexander Lyceum, St. Petersburg. 
. Imperial School of Law, St. Petersburg. CKHAMMARWNH 
Russia is also noted for associations and academies which encour- 
age research by prizes for the results of original investigations and 
by their publication. At the head of these institutions is the Im- 
perial Academy of Sciences. Russia also possesses 633 public libra- 
ries: In European Russia, 509; in Polland, 40; in Caucasus, 35; and 
in Siberia, 49. These libraries usually receive grants from the 
zemstvos; only 11 are subsidized by the Government. The Imperial 
Public Library is one of the most important in Europe.

I. BRITISH INDIA. 
EXTENT AND ORGANIZATION. 
British India extends over an area of 1,093,000 square miles, with 
a population exceeding 2444 millions; it comprises 15 Provinces, 
within which local self-government is maintained through the 
agency of elected boards, rural and municipal. The supreme execu- 
tive authority is vested in the governor general, or viceroy, appointed 
by the Crown and assisted by a council, the ordinary members of 
which are also appointed by the Crown; additional members may be 
nominated by the viceroy. The governors of the chief Provinces 
are appointed by the Crown. The chief executives of the smaller 
Provinces are appointed by the governor general, with the approval 
of the Crown. 
INCEPTION AND PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM OF MODERN EDUCATION. 
The system of modern education in India is not of native or spon- 
taneous origin, like the corresponding work in Japan and China, but 
imposed upon it by external force. It presents, therefore, lessons of 
great import to all nations that must endeavor to bring into intel- 
lectual sympathy and practical cooperation with themselves a people 
of alien civilization and traditions. This work was assumed directly 
by the British Government in 1853, with no precedents to guide and 
no centers of support excepting scattered missionary schools and a 
few institutions established under the rule of the East India Co. 
The fundamental principles by which the system was governed 
down to a late period were set forth in the Dispatch of 18542

-P-A-G-E-750
    730 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The educational commission appointed in 1882 to inquire into the 
workings of the system confirmed these principles in the main, but 
dwelt upon the need of more vigorous efforts to bring the mass of the 
vast population under instruction and of more positive activity on 
the part of the central government for the accomplishment of this 
purpose.t' The report of this commission led to the creation of the 
office of director general of education for India. A third stage in 
the development of this system was marked by the report of the edu- 
cation commission appointed by Lord Curzon, which disclosed the 
weakest points of the system and led to the resolution issued by the 
governor general, March 11, 1904.? 
The resolution of 1904 imparted a new impetus to the work of 
elementary education, efforts for the education of girls, and measures 
for promoting industrial and technical education. 
RECENT EVENTS. 
Progress in the directions indicated has been greatly stimulated 
since the announcement of the new Government policy with respect 
to education in India, which was made on the occasion of the Delhi 
“ durbar” December 12, 1911, and by the address of the British King 
delivered before the Calcutta University in 1912, during his visit to 
his eastern empire. The new purposes of the Government were 
eventually defined by a resolution (published in the Gazette of India, 
February 22, 1913) which set forth large plans for the extension of 
primary education, the improvement of the condition of teachers, 
and the adjustment of technical education to the special conditions 
of India. The declaration was confirmed by the increased grants 
for education from the public treasury. These increases amounted 
to 50 lakhs of rupees ($1,620,000) for popular education and an 
extra grant of 10 lakhs ($324,000), which have had’ the effect of 
stimulating the provincial governments to new efforts.* 
The tendency to central control excited much opposition in pro- 
vincial centers of great influence, but fortunately the direction of the 
work was entrusted to Sir Harcourt Butler, appointed as member of 
the council of the governor general of India in charge of education 
in 1910. His judicious administration completely disarmed all oppo- 
sition, and the announcement of his retirement from the post brought 
forth universal expressions of regret. = 
It has been the policy of the British Government in India to leave 
the actual control of education to the provincial governments, and 
consequently the success of plans for the general diffusion of ele- 
mentary education and for promoting technical education depends

upon the support which they receive from those governments. The 
central government, however, both by the increased aid from the 
public treasury and by the activities of the director general, gives 
‘a constant impetus to the local efforts. 
Higher education was for a long time the supreme interest of the 
central administration, and in the latest plans it still holds promi- 
nence. These plans comprise projects for the establishment of 
teaching and residential universities at four centers: Dacca (Prov- 
ince of Bengal), Patna (Provinces of Behar and Orissa), Nagpur 
(Central Provinces), Rangoon (Province of Burma), and in addition 
the Hindoo University at Benares (Northwest Provinces). These 
universities will supply a force in India life that has been wanting 
in the previously existing universities of India, which were almost 
exclusively examining bodies. The university projects which have 
been somewhat severely criticised in England have been warmly sup- 
ported by the British Government in India, and accord with the 
aspirations of the provincial authorities. Sir Harcourt Butler, who 
made a brief visit to England before his final retirement from the 
Indian council, returned to his post to pilot the Hindoo University 
bill, which passed October 2 of the current year. 
The sincerity of the oft-repeated purpose of the British Govern- 
ment to advance Indians to prominent positions in the civil service 
has been signally attested by the appointment of Sir C. Sankaran 
Nair, an Indian distinguished for his “breadth of view and sanity 
of judgment,” as the successor of Sir Harcourt Butler in the Indian 
council. The latter has been appointed lieutenant governor of 
Burma. 
IMPORTANT REPORTS. 
One of the chief outcomes of the commission of 1882 was the 
reduction of provincial reports on education to a general scheme of 
statistical presentation. This scheme, carried out in a succession of 
quinquennial reports, has made it possible to form some conception 
of the state and progress of modern education in India. The office 
of the director general (created in 1902) has issued a series of occa- 
sional reports dealing with particular phases of education, pointing 
out defects, furnishing suggestions, and recording the results of 
expert inspection. To these important publications there has just 
been added a report on Indian education in 1913-14, the first of a 
promised series of annual reports pertaining to the Empire. From 
this latest publication it appears that even statistics give decided 
proofs of progress. Between 1911 and 1914 the extra grants (termed 
nonrecurring grants) from the imperial exchequer for educational 
extension amounted to £3,161,000, and the additional recurring grants 
to £826,000. The total expenditure on education in 1913-14 amounted 
to £6,681,000, as compared with £4,588,000 in the year before the ap-

182 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1915. 
pointment of the education member of the council and a little over 
£3,000,000 ten years ago, an increase of over 120 per cent in the 
decade. 
The number of persons under instruction is rapidly rising; seven 
years ago the total number of children in the elementary stage of 
instruction was 4.7 millions; at the end of the year under review it 
was 6.6 millions. The figures quoted show that instruction is im- 
parted to no less than 28.7 per cent of the boys and 5.4 per cent of 
the girls of school-going age. In regard to the growing demand for 
free primary education for boys, it may be noted that public funds 
are taking an increasing share, amounting last year to seven-tenths 
of the whole cost of elementary schools. 
The chief characteristic of secondary education, says the report, 
continues to be the surprising increase in the number of those who 
seek it. 
Meanwhile, as pointed out by Lord Hardinge, in an address as 
chancellor of the University of Calcutta, there has been a phenom- 
enal increase in the number of students in arts colleges. He stated 
that the number of matriculates within the area of his own university 
had grown during his viceroyalty from 3,000 to 7,000 annually, and 
that the number of graduates had trebled. 
PROOFS OF SUCCESS, 
The success of this work in India can not, however, be measured by 
statistics; this critical period of the world’s history has afforded 
other proofs of its stability and effects, which are admirably summed 
up by Zhe Times as follows: 
The experiment upon which the British rulers of India embarked when they 
introduced western education is without a parallel in the world’s history. 
* * * This wonderful experiment has produced wonderful results. West- 
ern education has not only fulfilled its original purpose, which was to train up 
Indians capable of rendering efficient help in the work of administration. It 
has created an entirely new caste of Indians, still small in numbers, but of 
growing influence, more or less familiar with western thought and western 
methods, who have found in the English language a common medium of ex- 
pression which the many different races inhabiting a vast subcontinent had 
hitherto lacked. It has produced not a few distinguished thinkers and philos- 
ophers, and at least one great poet; some able judges and lawyers amongst.a 
whole legion of astute barristers and pleaders; many keen politicians and too 
many political journalists; and, of late years especially, a few men of real     
  
scientific attainments, as well as men of business who have made their mark 
in commercial and industrial pursuits. If we were to appraise the value of 
western education in India only by its best products, we might rest satisfied 
with such an achievement. But the real test is not to be sought in the brilliant 
successes of a select minority, but in the effect upon the mass, and if we apply 
this test to our educational

STATISTICAL SUMMARY. 
The total number of scholars in public institutions in 1913-14 
was 6,854,324, and in private institutions 681,241, making a total of 
7,535,565, or an increase of 21 per cent in the last quinquennium. 
Male scholars were 6,431,200 in 1913-14, as against 5,883,041 five 
years ago; female scholars in the same year were 1,104,365, as against 
831,954 five years ago. This is an increase of 19 per cent in the case 
of the former and 33 per cent in the case of the latter. The total 
number of institutions in 1918-14 was 185,584, of which 145,725 were 
public. Of these institutions only 18,370 were for female scholars. 
The total number of villages served by these schools was 569,761, 
and the number of towns (i. e., towns with 5,000 inhabitants or 
more) was 1,596. The number of students in each class of school

II. CHINA. 
GENERAL TREND OF EFFORTS. 
The effort in China to establish “western learning” on a firm 
basis, as authorized by the imperial decree of September 5, 1905, is 
one of the most striking events in the history of education. In a 
measure the Empire was prepared for such an undertaking through 
the long-continued influence of mission schools and the rude awaken- 
ing from delusions of national security caused by the issue of the 
Boxer War and the overthrow of the long-established régime. There 
was for a time an irresistible reaction against the traditional educa- 
tion and a feverish haste to grasp the new intellectual forces that 
gave success to foreign armies and ideals. In a measure these were 
transient experiences and in many Provinces a reactionary movement 
had set in before the revolution of 1911 which resulted in the decla-

dissolution of Parliament by the mandate of President Yuan, Janu- 
ary 11, 1914, the educational fevor has abated, and at the same time
-P-A-G-E-754
  734 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
the system of education formally organized by decree of December 
6, 1905, has been the subject of radical changes. - 
General statements, it is true, convey only a partial idea of condi- 
tions in this vast country, which comprises 18 Provinces and 7 de- 
pendencies, with a population estimated at 325,000,000. By the 
decrees of 1905 the provincial authorities were given independent 
control of education in their respective areas and naturally they 
varied greatly in respect to their support of the new system. The 
greatest change effected in this system by recent presidential mandates 
is the provision for a high degree of centralization in the ministry 
of public instruction. In the opinion of many authorities this 
transfer of responsibility is unfortunate, since it has caused a decline 
in provincial activities which the Government has no means of re- 
placing. A contrary opinion is expressed by many others familiar 
with the Government policies. Dr. Jeremiah W. Jenks, who ren- 
dered expert services in connection with the reform of currency in 
China, expresses the opinion that the measures adopted by President 
Yuan “for the unification of finance, justice, and education” are of 
great importance for the future progress of this vast country. The 
provincial boards, he says, “for centuries kept the people in the 
Chinese Provinces absolutely apart from the Government at Pekin.” 
REPORTS FROM PROVINCES. 
An intimate view of the effect of changing policies and current 
conditions in the chief Provinces of the Republic is furnished by 
consular and other official reports from which the following survey 
is derived: 
PROVINCE OF KWANGTUNG.* 
Kwangtung (estimated population, 23,700,000) has long been famous for its 
political, commercial, and industrial leadership; but although Protestant mis- 
sions and hence also modern education first began there, Kwangtung is to-day 
in many respects considerably behind some of the more northern parts of 
China in respect to education, either under the Government or under the 
missions. 
September 2, 1915, is the tenth anniversary of the abolit’on of the old-style 
literary examining system. Since then the educational policy of Government 
has suffered many variations. First, there was a time of great enthusiasm for 
popular education of the new style and all through the country, especially in 
south China, temples were dismantled, temple and monastery funds were 
diverted and heavy taxes were levied—all for the new schools. Some modern 
school buildings were erected and much apparatus secured from Japan and 
elsewhere. ‘The Government and the people seemed to think that in providing 
the building and apparatus the problem was solved. Schools were opened by 
the hundred and an elaborate curriculum was prepared on paper; but there

president of the Canton Christian College. Forwarded by F. D, Cheshire, American 
consul general, Canton.

were no teachers who could impart the new knowledge. The people were 
soon undeceived and a great reaction set in. Riots ensued when tax collectors 
and census enumerators came around. The monastery and temple priests 
protested with much popular approval, and the old-style school seemed en- 
trenched again in the hearts of the people. Then came the revolution when a 
very large number of the schools were closed, and education fell to a low ebb. 
The revolution successful, the people, recognizing that western learning and 
western-trained men had been the main spring, were aroused to another burst 
of enthusiasm for the learning which had done these wonderful things. This 
time also, at least in Kwangtung, there was a strong man at the head of the 
educational office, W. K. Chung, a Kui Yan, and trained in the Canton Christian 
College. 2 
Since the second revolution and the resultant centralizing of power in the 
hands of the governor, the office of commissioner of education has been abolished 
and a secretary for education has an office in the yamen of the civil governor 
of the province. The scholarships have not been discontinued for the students 
already abroad, but no new scholarships have been issued. The lecturships have 
been discontinued. But the work for the elementary schools has been kept up 
as well as the smaller income and influence of the present office will allow. Each 
district has now an educational committee with the magistrate at the head. 
There are inspectors appointed to oversee the schools and to collect statistics. 
The fact of reactionary tendencies is noted also in a report by 
Consul-General Heintzleman, under date of June 19, 1915, with ref. 
erence to the Fengtien Dependency (population, 5,830,000). He says; 
Since the revolution of 1911 educational work in this province has suffered 
greatly through lack of funds to pay the salaries of instructors and for the 
maintenance of school buildings and equipment. The commissioner of educa- 
tion informs me that the annual grant for education in this Province has been 
reduced in two years from $1,400,000 to $700,000, an amount which he states is 
totally inadequate for the satisfactory conduct of the educational work in this 
Province. 
The opinions above cited are confirmed by the following statement 
from the China Yearbook for 1914: 
The system of education promulgated by the Manchu Government was fully 
described in the 1912 issue of this yearbook, and tables were given showing the 
extent to which the scheme had been realized. The revolution of 1911-12 com- 
pletely disorganized the entire system. All Chinese universities and colleges 
closed their doors, partly on account of lack of funds wherewith to continue; 
but mainly because the disturbances throughout the country led the students ta 
throw up their studies and leave for their homes. With the great majority of 
the schools it was the same. If they were not compelled to close by the desertion 
of their pupils, they were only able to continue their work for so long as funds 
lasted. Consequently, in education, as in many other fields, the Republican 
Government has to start completely anew. Schools reopened as conditions be- 
came settled, but for the last two years educational affairs in China have been 
in a transition stage. The main principles which are to govern education in 
China were set forth anew, and during 1913 some progress was made in giving 
effect to them.

  736 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
PROVINCE OF YUNNAN. 
In the Province of Yunnan (population about 9,000,000) recent 
reactionary tendencies have been less noticeable. A report’ by an 
American citizen long resident in the capital of this Province says: 
The first steps looking to the organization of a system of modern education 
in this Province were taken about 10 years ago, following a series of edicts 
issued by the then Empress Dowager upon the subject of modern education. 
The present educational system is greatly in advance of the industrial develop- 
ment of this Province. Yunnan, with a great territory of rugged, mountainous 
country and a population variously estimated at from 9 to 13 millions, has less 
than 300 miles of railroad. Hundreds of students, who each year come to 
Yunnanfu to attend the schools at the capital, have to travel, by chair or on 
foot or horseback, anywhere from two to four weeks from their homes in 
distant parts of the Province. When it is remembered that a modern system 
of education has been grafted upon social institutions and industrial conditions 
somewhat corresponding to those which existed in England in the days of 
Queen Elizabeth, the progress thus far made is quite commendable. Further- 
more, this Province has less than 20 schools under missionary or other foreign 
patronage, so that the present state of advancement has been effected by the 
Chinese themselves. 
The Government public schools are supported by the revenues of the Province 
or of the district in which the schools are located. They are subject to certain 
rules and regulations laid down by the ministry of education at Peking, par- 
ticularly relating to the courses of study prescribed. For students whose homes 
are not located in the town in which they are attending school free lodging is 
provided. Two school uniforms are supplied each year and some of the text- 
books are furnished free. Certain of the schools supply uniforms, shoes, and 
all articles of clothing free, but charge a small tuition fee. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION CONFERENCES. 
The most important event in the domain of national education that 
has taken place since the Revolution of 1911 was the meeting of the 
national education conference assembled at the invitation of the 
minister of education. With respect to this conference the China 
Year Book for 1914 states: 
The minister invited 96 delegates, all of whom were graduates of normal 
colleges in China or abroad, were teachers of three years’ standing, or were 
educators of some renown. Of these 96, 44 were deputed from the Provinces, 
including Mongolia and Thibet; 1 represented Chinese residing abroad; 15 
came from colleges under the direct control of the ministry of education; 10 
were delegated by the ministries of interior, finance, agriculture and forestry, 
commerce and industry, war, and the navy; and the remainder were specially 
invited by the minister. 
The conference opened at the ministry of education on July 12 and was 
formally closed on August 11. Mr. Wang Shao-lien was chairman. While in~ 
session the conference discussed upward of 48 bills upon various matters con- 
nected with education submitted by the ministry, of which 23 were approved 
in their original or a modified form. The conference was summoned in an ad- 
visory capacity only, and it was left to the Government or Parliament to give 
effect to its recommendations.

MODERN EDUCATION IN BRITISH INDIA AND CHINA. FST 
MINISTERIAL ORDER. 
September 5 of the same year an order was issued by the ministry 
of education setting forth the general principles to guide in the 
conduct of schools, the classes of institutions authorized, etc. The 
following citations indicate the scope of this order: 
1, DISCIPLINARY REGULATIONS. 
A, Educational aim.—The educational aim of the Republic of China is to 
pay special attention to the development of morals, supplementing it with tech- 
nical and military training, and completing it with a cultivation of the esthetic 
powers. 
B. School discipline-—1. This order contains principles on which school disci- 
pline should be based. 
2. The rules of discipline, which are intended for the building up of charac- 
ter, should be strictly observed by all students. 
8. All principals, schoolmasters, and proctors have educational responsibili- 
ties, and their precepts and advice should be respected by the students. 
4, All principals should, in accordance with the nature and the peculiar cir- 
cumstances of their own school, draw up a number of rules to maintain disci- 
pline. The rules for classrooms, preparation rooms, drill grounds, dining rooms, 
dormitories, and other matters of discipline should be carefully and separately 
stipulated. The rules for the government schools should first receive the sanc- 
tion of the minister of education, while those for private schools and schools 
maintained by local funds should be submitted to the local governmental 
authority. 
5. Students, during their leisure hours, may be permitted to organize asso- 
ciations of athletics, of physical training, of music, and of other useful and 
literary purposes. These associations, however, should receive the approval 
of the principal, and be under the direction of the officials of the school. 
6. When students have some really valuable suggestions concerning the meth- 
ods of teaching, discipline, or any other matters in the school, they may submit 
them to the principal and the faculty either in writing or in person, and they 
should leave them free to act. The students should not be obstinate, nor 
should they find any pretext to impede the educational progress of the school. 
7. When a student’s conduct is in violation of any of the rules of discipline, 
the principal should inflict due punishment on him. 
8. When a student has, on account of serious breach of discipline, been dis- 
charged from school, and if he shows no real evidence of repentance and of 
eager desire to reform, and has no reliable guardian, he will not be allowed 
to reenter any other school. 
9. This order is applicable to all kinds of schools with the exception of ele- 
mentary schools, whose principals should rewrite the same in simple written 
style, and explain the same orally to the students. 
10. This order shall take effect on the day when it is promulgated.

  738 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
GENERAL POLICY OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. 
Accompanying the above order an announcement was made of the 
administrative policy of the ministry of education of which the 
main features are as follows: 
The ministry should exercise direct control over all branches of special 
education. 
For general education the ministry will prepare schemes to be carried out by 
the local educational organizations, but will send inspectors to supervise the 
methods adopted. 
Private schools shall be promoted and protected by the ministry. 
Funds for education.—Funds for special educational institutions shall be 
provided by the Central Government or by utilizing Government property as 
capital. 
Funds for general education shall be supplied by local taxation or by utilizing 
local common property as capital. 
Educational policy in the Peking district—The Peking educational bureau 
shall have control over general education in the district, and the expenditure 
upon this organization, and the schools and colleges under it, shall be tem- 
porarily borne by the ministry of education. 
High schools and colleges having similar courses of studies shall be amal- 
gamated in order to economize expenditure and increase the number of students. 
The ministry will endeavor to develop and reform the university and the 
public library. , . 
Policy in regard to students abroad.—As higher education is to be controlle 
by the ministry direct, arrangements in regard to the sending of students 
abroad shall be in the hands of the Central Government. Students sent abroad 
shall have qualifications which will enable them to enter a college, or a special 
educational institution, or shall have completed a course, and be duly qualified, 
in a college or special educational institution in China. 
Education of Mongolians, Tibetans, and Mohammedans.—As the five races 
have been combined into one nation, each must receive an equivalent training 
except the Manchus, who have become accustomed to the written and spoken 
Chinese language, and do not require special treatment. For the Outer Mon- 
golian,* Tibetan, and Mohammedcx tribes, which continue to use their respec- 
tive dialects, special educational methods will be adopted, in order to train 
them for the union of the five races. 
SCHOOLS FOR MODERN EDUCATION. 
CLASSIFICATION AND SUMMARIZED STATISTICS. 
Modern schools at present existing in China are classified as Gov- 
ernment schools—that is, established by the provincial or local au- 
thorities, mission schools, and private schools. According to the 
latest statistics published by the board of education (Peking), there 
are 35,998 Government schools of all grades, with 875,760 students. 
These figures are proof of the decline that has been reported since   
2Quter Mongolia has since declared its independence under the Hutukhta of Urga.

the second revolution. In the Province of Chekiang, however, there 
has been, it is stated, an “increase of threefold both in the number 
of schools and students in the last three years, and a corresponding 
advance also in school expenditures.” This is attributed to the 
richness of that Province, which is the chief silk and tea producing 
region of the Republic and noted for the intellectual spirit of its 
people. 
The present Government places special stress upon the need of 
primary education for all the people. This is an enormous under- 
taking, not only on account of the immense population to be reached 
but the difficulty of raising the necessary funds. In 1913 the Govern- 
ment appropriated only $5,207,215 for education, the rest must be 
raised by local appropriations and private subscriptions. The effort 
which this would imply is indicated by the fact that in 1910 the total 
income for educational purposes in China was 23,331,171 taels (about 
thirteen and one-fourth million dollars). At that time the educa- 
tional property owned by the Government amounted to 70,367,882 
taels (about $40,000,000). 
Apart from the financial difficulty, the greatest problems resting 
upon the Government arise from the need of supplying teachers for 
at least a million schools, and the very complicated language problem.+ 
All reports agree in respect to the importance of the mission 
schools in the Republic, the extent of their patronage and influence, 
and the confidence they inspire. Statistics for 1912 showed that 
under the Protestant missions alone there were 3,798 primary and 
day schools with an enrollment of 86,241 pupils, and 5,537 intermedi- 
ate and high schools with 31,384 pupils, and as many as 42 institu- 
tions that had assumed the name of university or college. Statistics 
of the Catholic missions are not available, but their educational 
activities are scarcely less important. It has been estimated that 
there are at least 100,000 pupils enrolled in all the mission schools. 
Private schools are also highly esteemed and well patronized, but no 
general statistics of these are attainable.

Catholic missions in Kwangtung report 67 schools for boys and 39 
for girls. Their primary aim is to provide instruction in Catholic 
doctrine to the children of Christian villages. There is also one 
middle school for boys and one for girls. There is also a theological 
seminary. Except in the middle schools and in the seminary, the 
teachers are all Chinese. The numbers of foreign teachers and of 
pupils in these higher schools have not been reported. The Sacred 
Heart College, Canton, enrolls 305 students, and the Holy Ghost 
School, for girls only, 40 students. Both are under the French 
bishop of Canton, who also has control of the Shin Tak Chinese 
Primary School for girls only. 
The total number of schools under Protestant missions (American, 
British, and German) is 658, with 928 teachers and 22,483 pupils. 
As in other Provinces, the Protestant mission schools are gradually 
evolving a unified system and combining in a Kwangtung educa- 
tional association. 
The outstanding feature in education in Kwangtung is the Canton 
Christian College, which not only antedates any efforts of the 
Chinese Government at providing modern education, but is the first 
and best-developed school under. mission auspices. The institution 
was started by Rev. A. P. Happer, D. D., an American missionary, in 
1885, on the earnest solicitation of over 400 Chinese officials, gentry, 
literati, and merchants. 
The college is unique among the educational institutions of China 
in that, while it is a Christian missionary enterprise, it is strictly non- 
denominational and depends entirely for its support upon individuals 
| who appreciate the kind of work it is doing. Yet it has a larger for- 
eign staff and has received larger financial support from the Chinese 
| than any other school in China. It is chartered under the regents of 
the University of the State of New York.t

dent of the board is Charles A. Stoddard, D. D., LL. D.
-P-A-G-E-761
    MODERN EDUCATION IN BRITISH INDIA AND CHINA. 741 
The college has received signal proofs of the appreciation of the 
Chinese themselves for this American institution. To quote a recent 
report from Dr. C. K. Edmunds, the president of the college: 
Not only have the students always paid relatively high fees for tuition, which 
have amounted to about half of the total budget for current expense, but since 
1907 Cantonese at home and abroad (notably those in America) have con- 
tributed no less than $160,000, Chinese currency, with which all four of the 
permanent dormitories for students and two primary school cottages have been 
built. Chinese friends have also provided a launch and telephone line to con- 
nect the college with Canton City. 
During the spring recess, 1915, the students themselves undertook a cam- 
paign for the college and secured from Chinese in Hongkong, Macao, and Can- 
ton $19,100, Chinese currency. A general association in China for helping this 
college has just been inaugurated and already over 30 prominent and wealthy 
physicians, merchants, and others in Hongkong have formed an organizing 
directorate of a Hongkong chapter. A Canton chapter is also being formed, with 
the civil governor, a nephew of the famous Li Hung Chang, as honorary 
president. 
KIANGSU AND CHEKIANG PROVINCES. 
University education.—Of schools of strictly university grade there are none 
in this district (consular). There are two educational institutions of college 
grade in the Shanghai district, namely, that of Soochow, under the control of 
the board of missions of the Southern Methodist Church of America, and St. 
John’s University, at Shanghai, under the Methodist Episcopal Church of 
America, known in China as the American Church Mission. The most im- 
portant innovations in connection with these two schools are the establishment 
by the former of a graduate law school, which is to be opened in Shanghai dur- 
ing the coming autumn, providing for instruction in both Chinese and foreign 
law, and the establishment of the “ Pennsylvania Medical School” by the latter 
one year ago. St. John’s University, previous to the inauguration of this new 
medical department, had a school of science and a school of theology. 
In addition to the foregoing, the “ Harvard Medical School” has been estab- 
lished in Shanghai in connection with the Red Cross hospital. This school has 
been selected by the Rockefeller Foundation for Medical Research in China for 
financial aid during the coming year. 
A report by Crawford M. Bishop, American vice consul in charge, 
Shanghai, dated August 4, 1915, describes education in the Kiangsu 
and Chekiang Provinces, as follows: 
The Shanghai Baptist College and Theological Seminary of the American 
Baptist Mission, the Christian College at Hangchow, and Trinity College at 
Ningpo, in Chekiang Province, are the remaining institutions of college grade 
under foreign missionary control. 
To provide for technical education there is at Shanghai “The Government 
Institute of Technology,” formerly known as the “ Nanyang College,” which 
employs as teachers several graduates of American colleges, and the “ Nanyang 
Railway and Mining College.” 
Of purely graduate work, greatest progress has been made in the establish- 
ment of schools and hospitals for medical work. The recent China medical 
conference, held in Shanghai in the spring of the present year, gave great
-P-A-G-E-762
    
  742 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
impetus to this work, while the carrying out of the plans there formulated has 
been powerfully aided by the Rockefeller Foundation recently established with 
former Consul General Greene as the resident director in China. Theological 
schools have been established for a long time, but they do not appear to be 
on the increase. Graduate instruction in law will be offered for the first time 
in China in the coming fall. 
Preparatory education.—In schools of academy and high-school grade con- 
siderable progress has been made both in the number and the standard of the 
schools opened. Noteworthy is the recent opening of the Shanghai American 
school for both sexes, the teachers of which are all graduates of American 
colleges. This school, however, is open to children of foreign parentage only. 
Of preparatory schools for Chinese, in addition to those already established by 
various missions in Shanghai, the Young Men’s Christian Association have re- 
cently built a dormitory in connection with their high school (day) and even- 
ing school work. The educational work of the Y. M. C. A. is directed toward 
training Chinese for practical business life and its curriculum corresponds to 
that of the city “business colleges” in America. The Y. M. C. A. conduct an 
evening school also at Hangchow. 
In addition to the foregoing there are high schools in the foreign settlement 
and in the French municipality of Shanghai, which are maintained by the 
respective municipalities and are open only to children of foreign parentage. 
There is as yet no institution of college grade in this district for children of 
foreign parentage of either sex. 
By far the larger part of educational work for Chinese, aside from that con- 
ducted by the Government of China, is done by American missionaries or 
American colleges, the entrance of Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale into the 
China field constituting the most notable recent innovation, 
Foreign educational institutions for Chinese women.—Of foreign educational 
institutions for Chinese women there are in Shanghai the school conducted by 
the Y. W. C. A.; the Bridgeman Memorial School, located in the Chinese native 
city ; the St. Mary’s Hall, the women’s department of St. John’s College; and the 
MacTyiere School for Chinese Girls, all of preparatory grade. There is no 
institution of college grade for women in this district except the Women’s 
Medical College at Soochow. Educational facilities for Chinese women are as 
yet far behind that provided for the men, both in number and grade of schools. 
The most important steps that have been taken in recent years toward the im- 
provement of the educational system in this part of China have been the move- 
ments among the various missionary bodies represented here looking toward 
the establishment of union institutions representing the various organizations 
in any given locality, and the adoption of a uniform curriculum with uniform 
entrance requirements and grade of examinations in the various schools.

There are 16 Government schools in this district. One normal 
school has an enrollment of 250 students and receives an allowance 
of $4,000 monthly, or $6,000 for each class annually, there being 
eight classes in the school. One normal school for girls, with an en- 
rollment of 100, receives $1,000 per month, or $3,000 for each class 
per annum, there being four classes in the school. Tuition and board 
at both these institutions are free. One law school having an en- 
rollment of 800 students receives an allowance of $3,000 monthly, or 
$4,500 for each class per annum, there being eight classes in the 
school; an annual tuition of $14 is charged in this school. 
An average monthly allowance of $1,000, or $3,000 for each class, 
there being four classes in each school, is granted to three middle 
schools, four industrial schools of a higher grade (technical, com-

mercial, agricultural, and sericulture), and one girls’ industrial 
school of a lower grade; the number of students in these schools runs 
from 100 to 200, a tuition of $14 per annum being charged. Five 
primary schools receive a monthly allowance of $300, or $600 for 
each class, each school having six classes; the tuition at these schools 
is $6 per annum, the number of students at these schools ranging 
from 60 to 150.1 
Private schools——In addition to the Government schools, there are 
one private law school and 100 primary schools. Altogether the 
Government expends annually in this district the sum of $220,000 
in its support of the Government and private schools. 
Mission schools—The American Board of Missions has an exten- 
sive educational work in this district, including the Foochow Col- 
lege, with 280 students. The American Methodist Episcopal Mission 
also supports many schools, with an estimated enrollment of 8,110 
pupils in primary schools, 1,197 in intermediate schools, 257 in nor- 
mal schools, and 115 in colleges. The Union Theological School 
represents a combined effort of three different local Protestant mis- 
sions, viz, one British and two American. An Anglo-Chinese col- 
lege is also maintained by the two British missionary societies in 
the district, which also carry on many day schools. The total num- 
ber of students under their charge, as reported in 1915, was 4,164 
(boys, 2,247; girls, 1,917). 
Tn this consular district, as in nearly all others from which reports 
have been received, attention is called to the important educational 
work carried on by the Young Men’s Christian Association in the 
chief cities of the respective districts. 
LEASED TERRITORY OF KIAOCHAU. 
The Territory of Kiaochau, which has been prominent in the 
recent history of China, was acquired by the German Government 
in 1898, and passed under the control of the Japanese November, 
1914. During the German occupation modern education was im- 
parted in a few schools under German and American missionaries 
and in schools of low grade maintained by the local government and 
designed principally to fit pupils to earn their living in the various 
German enterprises. The most important institution established 
during this period was the Government German-Chinese high 
school, which was opened October 25, 1909, and gradually supplied 
with a fine group of buildings, admirably equipped for the purposes 
ofa high school. At the time of the capture of Tsingtau by the 
Japanese, the preparatory department (course five years) of this

institution contained 332 students, and the advanced department 
(courses three and four years), 88. The latter were enrolled in the 
following courses: Medicine, law, agriculture, engineering. The 
latest plans of the present government outlined in July, 1915, relate 
to the establishment of a university at Tsingtau.t

By reference to the statement of the administrative policy of the 
Government it will be seen that the control of education in Peking is 
centralized directly in the ministry. The following table pertains to 
conditions in the year 1910:

UNIVERSITIES UNDER FOREIGN AUSPICES. 
The Imperial University, named in the table, should not be con- 
founded with the Peking University maintained by Protestant mis- 
sions. 
Special reference should be made to the Tsing Hua College, 
founded by the Government near Peking for the preparation of 
students to be sent at the Government’s expense to America, in ac- 
cordance with the undertaking given by China when the United 
States Government announced its intention of returning a large part 
of the Boxer indemnity claim. This college was closed as a result 
of the revolution of 1911, but resumed operations in May, 1912. 
The latest addition to higher institutions in China is the Uni- 
versity of Hongkong, which was opened in 1912 and which, although 
on British territory and under British influences, is destined to 
exercise a great influence on progress in China. Measures have also 
been taken for establishing Hankow University in central China 
under the auspices of an Oxford and Cambridge committee.

IMPORTANT PENDING MEASURES. 
The Government has under consideration three important propo- 
sitions suggested by the national conference: (1) Attendance at pri- 
mary schools to be made compulsory; (2) determining the relation 
of mission schools and private schools to the Government; (3) the 
appointment of scholars versed in phonetics, and representative of all 
the Provinces, to invent or adopt an alphabet for the Chinese lan- 
guage. 
AMERICAN ACTIVITIES IN RESPECT TO THE WELFARE OF CHINA. 
Through the action of the Rockefeller board, China has in pros- 
pect a remarkable system of medical education. This purpose is the 
outcome of the work of a special commission appointed last year to 
investigate and report upon the needs of China. The members of the 
commission were Harry Pratt Judson, president of the University 
of Chicago; Roger S. Greene, United States consul general at Han- 
kow; and Francis W. Peabody, of the Harvard Medical School. The 
commission met in Peking in May, 1914, and spent four months in a 
study of the existing medical schools, hospitals, and dispensaries in 
China, and in conference with Government officials, missionaries, 
and other competent advisers. 
As a result of this preliminary investigation the foundation has 
established a Chinese medical board, of which the director is to be 
Dr. Wallace Buttrick, executive secretary of the General Education 
Board, and Roger S. Greene, resident director in China. A plan of 
action recommended by Frederick T. Gates and tentatively adopted 
by the board is briefly outlined in the report of the foundation as 
follows: : 
Within the chosen area the plan organizes into one present organic whole 
the work and growth of many decades, every man, every dollar, every institu- 
tion, every item of equipment now existing for medical work without loss or 
waste. 
As the system proves practicable and efficient, we may extend it to other 
similar centers, or it will perhaps extend itself and China will be in a fair way 
to lead the world in medicine, for to-day no land, whether in America or Europe, 
has any system of medicine at all comparable in efficiency or promise.* 
CHINESE INDEMNITY STUDENTS. 
According to the Chinese educational mission, there were 325 
Chinese students in the United States, in 1915, maintained from the 
indemnity fund. Colleges and universities enrolling 10 or more of 
these students were as follows: Cornell University, 35; Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, 35; Columbia University, 32; University of

Michigan, 22; Harvard University, 20; University of Wisconsin, 16; 
University of Illinois, 15; University of Pennsylvania, 11; and Uni- 
versity of Chicago, 11. The remaining students were scattered 
through 52 colleges and secondary schools; 1 was attending the 
United States Military Academy at West Point. Full scholarship 
students ($960) numbered 250; partial scholarship ($500), 58; special 
students, 17. 
As to courses of study pursued by the indemnity students, it ap- 
pears that 388 were taking academic courses; 104, various branches of 
engineering; 11, medicine; 5, railway administration; 8, business ad- 
ministration; 10, law; 17, chemistry; 3, forestry; 19, agriculture;

  INTRODUCTION. 
The system of public instruction in Japan has long commanded 
attention because of the remarkable power shown by the Government 
in adapting features derived from western systems to an oriental 
nation. This interest has been greatly increased since Japan has been 
recognized as a world power, with a voice in the solution of many 
international problems and destined to exercise enormous influence on 
the development of China. 
The present system of education was developed for the most part 
during the reign of the late Emperor Meiji. The main features of 
the system were established by a series of ordinances which showed at 
first the predominant influence of French ideals and models; later 
these were replaced by those of England and America; finally Ger- 
man influences prevailed. After the Treaty of Portsmouth, in 1905, 
which brought to a close the war between Russia and Japan, there 
was a marked tendency in the latter Empire to rise above foreign 
influences and to exalt the national spirit in the conduct of all 
institutions. 
While foreign influences prevailed, attention was repeatedly called 
to the fact that, although the modern system of education in the 
Empire was European i in its spirit and organization, the code for that 
Oy adopted in 1872 provided for a course of instruction in morals ~ 
“which was then unknown in any American or European school.” 
The importance of this subject-was set forth in the imperial rescript 
749 
 
-P-A-G-E-770
  750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of 1890, and:still more impressively in the rescript of 1908, which is 
as follows: 
Know ye, Our subjects: 
Civilization is advancing day by day and progressing month by month, and the 
nations of the whole world, east and west, through mutual dependence and help, 
alike share in its benefits. We confidently anticipate a lasting enjoyment of its 
blessings, along with other powers, by improving our relations and strengthening 
our friendship with them. But in order to move onward with the main current 
of the world’s progress and to share in the blessings of civilization, it is obvious 
that we must depend upon the developmnt of our national resources. Our coun- 
try has not yet had time to recover from the effects of the late war, and improve- 
ment and expansion are necessary in various branches of our administration. 
Therefore, with one mind, let all men, high and low, faithfully pursue their 
callings, be diligent and frugal in the acquisition and management of their 
property, maintain good faith, continue in righteousness, live simple and sincere 
lives, shun ostentation and cleave to reality, mutually warn one another against 
negligence and idleness, and brace themselves to ceaseless activity. 
The precepts of Our Sacred Imperial Ancestors and the facts of our glorious 
history shine like the sun and the stars. Indeed, the development of our national 
resources has its root in reverently hearkening to these precepts, learning the 
lessons of these facts, and steadfastly acting up to them. In view of the circum- 
stances of the present time We purpose, relying on the cooperation of Our good 
and loyal subjects, to enlarge the Imperial Plan of the Restoration and to exalt 
the august virtues of Our Imperial Ancestors. Ye, Our subjects, take to heart 
these Our wishes.

The 18th day of the 10th month of the 41st year of Meiji. 
[Coun.er-signature of the Minister President of State.] 
Loyalty to the Emperor, morality, industry, and thrift, the neces- 
sary qualities of good citizenship, are the purposes toward which 
the instruction in all schools and higher institutions is constantly 
directed, and this final purpose is kept steadily in view in the ad- 
ministration and organization of the system of education. The main 
features of this system have been described in publications easily 
accessible to American students of education. They are briefly stated 
here in order that certain particulars which will be emphasized may 
be seen in proper perspective. This purpose is facilitated by a hand- 
book of the system recently issued, from which the particulars given 
are derived.* * 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The system of education is under the control of a department 
created in 1871. This department comprises three bureaus, to which 
are assigned, respectively, special education, general education, and 
religions. The bureau of religion, transferred in 1918 from the de- 
partment of home affairs, is charged with the supervision of the 
ecclesiastical affairs of the country. These, however, are kept en- 
tirely distinct from educational affairs.

International Exposition, 1915.

PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. TB 
At the head of the department is the minister of education, who is 
assisted by a cabinet which deals with the financial and business side 
of the educational institutions. Each of the bureaus mentioned is 
organized under a director, who is assisted by councillors, secretaries, 
etc. To the central department belong superintendents appointed for 
local areas, and inspectors either permanent or temporary. An educa- 
tion investigation committee, under the control of the minister of 
education, was appointed in 1913. The duty of this committee is: 
To investigate important matters relating to education, to express an opinion 
upon questions submitted to it by the minister, as well as to present to him its 
own opinion upon various matters. The committee is composed of representa- 
tives not only of educational authorities, but also of all circles outside of them, 
and consequently it is many-sided in its nature. 
The 47 Prefectures into which the Empire is divided are local agen- 
cies of educational administration. The governor of each Prefecture 
is at the head of its educational affairs, and is represented in the civil 
districts of his Prefecture by inspectors. Within the jurisdiction of 
the Prefecture are districts, cities, towns, and villages; the heads of 
these civil divisions control schools established by them. Educational 
committees are appointed which help in securing the legally required 
attendance of children at school. In all Prefectures, districts, or 
cities there are also educational societies; and though these are private 
institutions, they help in the advancement of education in the locali- 
ties to which they belong. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
The elementary schools are regulated by imperial ordinances, but 
are under the immediate direction of the local authorities. Provision 
is made for kindergartens and for special elementary schools under 
private control which are sanctioned by the authorities. The present 
consideration of elementary education will be limited to the public 
schools, which are classed as ordinary elementary and higher ele- 
mentary. 
Teachers—The law prescribes explicitly the conditions under 
witich teachers may be employed, their qualifications, and the duties 
which they must perform. An elementary-school teacher must have 
a license testifying to his qualifications for the service. The license 
is granted by the local governor to the graduates of the normal 
school or other schools appointed as such by the minister of educa- 
tion, or to persons who have successfully passed the elementary teach- 
ers’ test examination; such a license is available all over the country 
and for life. 
A teacher is authorized to conduct the business of the school under 
his care without any other interference than the supervision of the 
proper controlling authorities; that is, the local governor or the dis-
-P-A-G-E-772
    [52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
trict headman; to inflict necessary punishment upon the children for 
purposes of education (corporal punishment being forbidden by 
law) ; to suspend from attendance children suffering from contagious 
diseases or exposed to such, and also children who are unmanageable; 
to arrange the school hours, and in general to adjust the program 
of the school to local conditions. 
The power of appointing or dismissing a teacher is vested in the 
local governor, but the appointment in each case is made on an appli- 
cation from the mayor or chief magistrate of the town or district 
which is in need of a teacher. The law makes special provision con- 
cerning the cases in which a teacher may be temporarily suspended 
from duty or permanently dismissed. 
The importance of liberal provision for teachers is fully recog- 
nized, but the difficulties in the way of adequate salaries are similar 
to those experienced in other countries. Present salaries and emolu- 
ments are as follows: 
By the law now in force a regular teacher of the regular course is paid a sal- 
ary varying from 12 to 95 yen ($6 to $47) per month (for distinguished services 
it may be raised to 120 yen-—$60) ; a regular teacher of the special course gets 
from 8 to 50 yen ($4 to $25) ; and an assistant teacher from $8 to 25 yen ($4 
to $13). 
In addition to the above salaries paid from the city, town, or village revenues, 
increased salaries for long service, and special additional salaries, are paid 
from the State treasury. The former are given to those who have served satis- 
factorily for more than five years in a public elementary school within the same 
Prefecture, while the special additional salaries are paid to such regular teachers 
as belong to single-classed schools, or have under their charge a class formed 
of children from the first to the fourth, fifth, or sixth school year in many- 
classed schools, or have to carry on their work as teachers in some out-of-the- 
way place. Besides the above, the law provides that an allowance shall be 
granted to those teachers who teach over 32 hours per week; a bonus may be 
given to those who have rendered distinguished service, and also to those who 
take night duty; medical expenses are allowed to those who are taken sick 
during the performance of their duties, and an official residence may be pro- 
vided according to local circumstances. 
An elementary-school teacher is entitled to a retiring pension and family 
pension. The pension on retirement is a life pension granted to such regular 
teachers of an elementary school of the city, town, or village establishment 
as are ordered, after 15 or more years of service, to retire on account of old 
age, illness, abolition of the school, etc., or to those who, though with less than 
15 years’ service, have retired on account of physical disability owing to wounds 
inflicted or some disease contracted in the discharge of their duties, assistant 
teachers having the same privilege in this latter case. Even those who are not 
entitled to a retiring pension, but who retire after over one or more years of 
service, are granted a lump sum of money according to the number of years 
of the service. A family pension is granted to the surviving members of the 
family in the case of the death of regular teachers of an elementary school of 
public establishment who were in receipt of, or were entitled to, a retiring 
pension, or who, though not having completed 15 years of service, have died in 
the discharge of their duties.
-P-A-G-E-773
  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. 753 
School year.—The tendency toward flexible arrangements suited to 
local conditions is shown by the fact that whereas the school year 
begins as a rule on the 1st of April and ends on the 31st of March 
of the following year, it may begin as late as the 1st of September 
and end on the 81st of the following August. This matter is left to 
the discretion of the local governor. The number of holidays in ele- 
mentary schools must not exceed 90 per annum, exclusive of Sundays. 
The most important holidays are the anniversary of the accession 
of the Emperor Jinmu, the imperial birth celebration day, and New 
Year’s Day. On each of these days the schools are assembled for a 
solemn ceremony, which consists of exercises intended to excite the 
national spirit and feelings of loyalty. The program includes the 
national anthem sung in chorus by all the school; homage done to 
the portraits of the Emperor and Empress; recitation by the school- 
master of the imperial rescript on education; the schoolmaster’s re- 
marks respecting the foregoing; singing in chorus of some song 
proper for the occasion by the whole school. 
Textbooks.—The State system of textbooks adopted in 1903 pro- 
vides that the copyright of the books and charts to be used in an 
elementary school shall belong to the department of education. 
When there are several books on the same subject the local governor 
is to use his own discretion in making a selection. The minister of 
education may sanction books in a few subjects other than those 
copyrighted by the department. A special committee appointed in 
September, 1908, has the entire subject of textbooks under investiga- 
tion, with the purpose of exciting competition between book sellers 
and the authors of textbooks. 
School organization——The imperial ordinance requires that there 
shall be one regular teacher for each class, but when circumstances 
do not allow this, the system of one regular and one assistant teacher 
for every two classes or two regular teachers for every three classes 
may be resorted to. The ordinance also requires that, except in some 
special cases, the number of classes in an elementary school shall be 
not more than 18, and that when local circumstances make it neces- 
sary to establish a branch school, the classes in each branch school 
shall not exceed 3. 
The law places the highest limit to the number of children in one 
class at 70 in the ordinary elementary school, and 60 in the higher 
elementary school. Under special circumstances an addition, not 
exceeding 10 pupils, may be made to the normal number. 
Discrimination is made in regard to sex. Girls are generally kept 
in a separate class from boys in the ordinary elementary school, 
when a class can be formed of girls of the same school year, and in 
the higher elementary school, when a class can be formed entirely 
12034°—xp 1915—vor 1——48

  754 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
of girls. The younger children, however, of both sexes, belonging 
to the first and second school years in the ordinary elementary school 
may be formed into one class. 
Where circumstances require, the pupils of the school may be 
divided into two sections, so as to be taught at different times of the 
day. Care is taken, however, that this half-time system shall not 
be carried to excess, and in all cases permission to make this arrange- 
ment must be obtained from the local governor. 
An elementary school may provide a supplementary course of in- 
struction, the aim of which is the maintenance and extension of the 
results attained during the course of elementary education and pro- 
vision for practical instruction. There are two supplementary 
courses, one for the ordinary elementary school and the other for the 
higher elementary school; the course of supplementary instruction 
must not extend over more than two years. 
Schoolhouses—The law requires that the schoolhouse in each 
district shall be a plain strong building well suited to the require- 
ments of instruction, control, and sanitation. The use of the school 
building, ground, furniture, and playground for other than their 
proper purpose is forbidden, except in the case of public calamities 
or for some special purposes which cause no hindrance to education. 
Thus the schcolhouse is occasionally used for public meetings, and 
the playground is sometimes open to the public for the purpose of 
exercise. 
The teacher’s residence shall be attached to the school, whenever 
local conditions permit. 
Compulsory attendance-—The earliest ordinances made elementary 
education compulsory for all children for a brief period; by an 
ordinance of 1907 this period was extended to six years. The legal 
school period begins the day after the child reaches its sixth year of 
age and ends when it reaches its fourteenth year. Exemptions from 
the compulsory provisions are allowed for sickness, feebleminded- 
ness, etc. Elementary instruction may be given either in a public 
school or at home or elsewhere, but in the latter cases permission 
must be secured from the chief magistrate of the city, town, or 
village. A register of all children of school age is kept by the mayor 
or headman of every community, and the names of children who 
should enter the school are communicated to the local teacher at the 
beginning of each school year. An attendance register is also kept 
by the teacher, and if any of the children whose names have been 
given to him do not appear within seven days after the day appointed 
for their entrance, the fact is reported to the chief executive of the 
district. Similar notification is lodged-in case of the absence, for 
seven successive days, of children who have entered the school. 
Measures are taken to impress the parents or guardians with the
-P-A-G-E-775
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. 755 
necessity of correcting this delinquency, and if no notice is taken of 
this first warning, the matter is carried to the higher authorities. 
That this system is effective is shown by the fact that in 1912-13 the 
rate of school attendance throughout the Empire was 98.23 per cent 
of all children of school age, and the rate of daily average attendance 
92.47 per cent. 
Sources of income.—The support of elementary schools is derived 
from the community (city, town, or village), the larger areas of local 
administration (counties and Prefectures) of which the community 
forms a part, and from the national treasury. The initial cost of 
establishing elementary schools must be borne by the city, town, or 
village. If the resources of the community are not adequate, aid 
must be given from the larger area, the amount being determined by 
the governor of the Prefecture, and in cases of uncertainty submitted 
to the decision of the minister of education. The amount of money 
to be disbursed from the national treasury is fixed at 2,000,000 yen 
($1,000,000) per annum, which is distributed to all the Prefectures 
of the country. 
Further contrtbutions are received from the “educational stock 
fund,” 10,000,000 yen ($5,000,000), the amount from this source being 
determined in making up the annual budget. This money is applied 
to the equipment of schools and for the encouragement of general 
education by means of lectures, bonuses for teachers, etc. Each Pre- 
fecture is obliged to maintain a special account for this fund. 
With the enforcement of compulsory education, measures are taken 
to do away with tuition fees, but these are still allowed in localities 
in which the sudden abolition of the fees would greatly reduce the 
school income. At present only 3 per cent of the ordinary elementary 
schools make a charge for tuition. 
The higher elementary schools do not come within the compulsory 
period; therefore it is left to the option of the city, town, or village 
whether or not tuition fees shall be charged in these. In any case, 
however, the fees must not exceed 60 sen (30 cents) in a city and 
30 sen (15 cents) in a town or village; the rate must be uniform 
through all the years of the school course. 
Programs.—tn the ordinary elementary school the following sub- 
jects are continued throughout the entire course: Morals, the Jap- 
anese language, arithmetic, drawing, singing, and gymnastics. Addi- 
tional subjects are manual training, which may be given as local 
circumstances require, sewing for girls introduced the third year, 
Japanese history, geography, and science, introduced the fifth year. 
The Japanese language occupies the most time, from 10 to 14 hours 
a week being assigned to it; arithmetic follows, with 4 to 6 hours a 
week; morals have 2 hours a week throughout the entire course and 
also the same in the higher elementary schools which continue the “

  course of the lower schools as arranged for the fifth and sixth years. 
The higher elementary schools are of two classes, schools having two- 
year courses and those having three years, the courses being identical 
for the first two years. The following conspectus shows the complete 
course of the three-year higher elementary schools:

be deducted from manual training, agriculture, and commerce for boys, and these hours may be given to other subjects of study according to the local circumstances.
-P-A-G-E-777
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. 757 
By reference to the conspectus given above, it will be seen that the 
girls have two more school hours a week than the boys. This is 
allotted to sewing and an extra hour in science. The same arrange- 
ment is made in the course of the lower elementary school after the 
second year. The regulations prescribe that although in special 
cases some deviation in the number of school hours a week is allowed, 
they shall in no case exceed 30 or be less than 18 in the elementary 
school, and in the higher elementary not more than 32 nor less than 
24, except in half-time schools and in the case of younger children. 
For the latter school hours may be reduced to 12 a week in the ele- 
mentary course. 
The standard of the courses of instruction and the number of 
school hours having been determined, the schoolmaster must arrange 
the details of instruction for each subject of study. Previous to 
1900 the results of the school instruction were tested by examination, 
but since that year this has been accomplished by considering the 
daily work of each pupil. The change was made with the hope of 
avoiding— 
excessive application just before the examination on the part of children whose 
mental and physical development was still incomplete, but who were often 
driven thereto by the strain of competition, with results highly injurious to both 
mind and body. At the end of each school year, when the course has been 
completed in the ordinary as well as in the higher elementary school, the school- 
master must give a certificate to each of those who have passed through the 
course satisfactorily. 
SCHOOLS FOR SPECIAL CLASSES. 
Provision for the education of the blind and the deaf and dumb is 
made by both public and private schools, and great attention is given 
to the practical training of the pupils in order that they may be pre- 
pared for industrial life. At Tokyo there is a school for the blind 
and a school for the deaf, both maintained by the General Govern- 
ment and under the direct supervision of the department of educa- 
tion. The former is noted for the successful adaptation of the 
Braille svstem to the Japanese “syllabary ” which was worked out 
by Mr. K. Ishikawa, an instructor in the school. In this institution, 
which has naturally become a model for others in the Empire, there 
are two industrial courses, music, acupuncture, and massage. The 
course of general study extends over five years, with an additional 
year for those who specialize in music. With respect to acupuncture 
the report says: 
Acupuncture being a medical art peculiar to our country, and having been 
for a long time the occupation for the blind, it has, together with massage and 
Koto playing, been introduced into the industrial course for the blind, along 
with some principles of anatomy, physiology, and hygiene.  
-P-A-G-E-778
  
  758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The institution provides a training course of one year for students 
who show ability as teachers. 
The Tokyo school for the deaf also serves as a model for institu- 
tions of this order throughout the Empire. The curriculum is di- 
vided into ordinary, industrial, and training courses. The industrial 
courses are drawing, woodwork, and sewing. With regard to the 
system of teaching speech the report says: 
Reading, pronunciation, and conversation are taught by Bell’s system of 
visible speech to those dumb pupils only in the ordinary course who show quick- 
ness enough in learning. It is not taught to all of them for the following rea- 
son: Our characters in common use having been originally introduced from 
China and subsequently developed in this country, have each of several pro- 
nunciations and almost as many or more meanings, and each has three forms 
in writing; moreover, the spoken and written languages are entirely different, 
and a great variety of styles are used in composition, so that the task of teach- 
ing the language is beset by overwhelming difficulties, and some of the pupils 
would make little or no progress in pronunciation and reading. 
The institute for the blind and dumb maintained by the city of 
Kyoto has achieved much distinction. Its teachers have made many 
improvements in the methods of imparting instruction to young 
people deprived of their normal senses. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
Provision for the training of teachers is made in normal schools, 
which in accordance with the latest ordinance on the subject must 
be established by each Prefecture throughout the Empire, within 
its own jurisdiction. The number of these local normal schools is at 
present 90—45 for young men, 34 for young women, and 11 coeduca- 
tional. The course of study is divided into two parts: The prepara- 
tory and the regular. The regular course is again subdivided into 
a first and second section. The preparatory course, which covers 
only one year, forms a link between the higher elementary schools 
and the regular normal schools. The official regulations prescribe 
the subjects of instruction and the distribution of time among them, 
but modifications are allowed according to local conditions. The 
following conspectus pertains to the first section of a typical normal 
school for men. The figures in parentheses show the changes in the 
curriculum adapting it to the normal schools for women.

The maximum number of students in each of the schools is 500, 
all of whom reside in dormitories. The majority secure scholar- | 
ships, and after graduation they are required to serve for a certain 
number of years as teachers in normal schools, middle schools, or 
high schools for girls. A middle school and an elementary school 
are attached to each normal school, serving as practice schools for 
the students, and also as model schools for the benefit of the entire 
country. 
The higher normal schools for women are organized in three sec- 
tions, viz, literature, science, and domestic science. The subjects in- 
cluded in the curriculum of the domestic science section are morals, 
pedagogics, domestic science, science, sewing, the Japanese language, 
a foreign language, manual arts and drawing, music, and gymnastics. 
The arrangement of the curriculum as regards sequence of subjects 
and time assigned is modified according to circumstances. Candi- | 
dates for admission must be graduates from the normal school for 
women or from the high school for girls. The maximum number of 
students is 300. As in the case of the schools for men, the students 
reside in dormitories; they have the benefits of scholarships and are __ 
pledged to teach after graduation. Model schools attached to the ! 
higher normal schools for women include a high school for girls, | 
an elementary school, and a kindergarten. | 
The second section of the regular course in the normal schools for 
men extend over one year, and the corresponding course in the schools 
for women over a period of one or two years. These sections are in- 
tended for more advanced students than those who enter the first 
section, and in them more time is given to professional training in 
pedagogics or the theory and art of teaching.  
-P-A-G-E-780
    760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
HIGHER NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Higher normal schools are maintained to prepare teachers for the 
ordinary normal schools and also for the service of middle schools 
and the high schools for girls. The normal schools of this class com- 
prise two for young men exclusively and two for women. For ad- 
mission to the schools for men, students must be graduates either of 
the ordinary normal schools or of middle schools and must pass 
successfully a test of physical strength, proficiency in studies, and 
must have testimonials showing their high moral character. 
The higher normal schools for men include a preparatory course 
and the regular course, the latter organized in five sections as follows: 
Japanese language and Chinese classics; English language; geography 
and history; mathematics, physics, and chemistry ; natural history. 
A postgraduate course extending over one or two years is provided 
for the benefit of those graduates of the regular course who wish to 
pursue their studies in scientific and educational subjects. 
The higher normal schools rank next to the imperial universities, 
their faculties consisting for the most part of university graduates 
who have pursued their studies in Europe or in America. 
The need for teachers of technical subjects both in secondary 
schools and secondary technical schools has created a demand for a 
different order of training, which is temporarily met by professional 
courses given in the technical schools of high grade. 
MIDDLE SCHOOLS. 
The system of education established in 1872 comprised provision 
for secondary education. For this purpose the country was divided 
into 8 university districts, each of which was subdivided into 32 
middle school districts. In each of the latter it was proposed to 
establish a school of general education for pupils who had finished 
the elementary course. The purposes and scope of the middle schools 
were not clearly defined at the outset and they were the subject of 
experiment and changes for nearly 30 years. Eventually it was de- 
7 termined to limit the middle schools to the general education con- 
sidered as a preparation for the ordinary duties and responsibilities 
of life and to provide, in a still higher grade of schools, courses of 
instruction preparatory to the universities. In accordance with the 
provisions of the law now in force, boys who have completed the six 
years’ course of the elementary schools are eligible for admission to 
middle schools. The course of study for the latter is arranged for 
five years, with a supplementary course of not more than one year. 
The teachers of the middle schools have special training for their 
duties and a higher range of salaries than those paid in the elemen- 
tary schools.

  By comparing the above conspectus with the program of the higher 
elementary schools the distinctive character of the middle schools is 
clearly seen. The practical subjects of the higher elementary schools 
are represented in the middle school by an optional course in indus- 
try occupying two hours in the fourth and fifth year each. The ele- 
mentary branches are more highly developed. Foreign languages are 
introduced, election being allowed between English, German, and 
French. Natural history occupies two hours a week from first to 
fifth year. Physics and chemistry are introduced in the fourth year, 
with four hours a week, as in the fifth. 
HIGH SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
High schools for girls, like the middle schools for boys, have passed 
through various modifications and at present are regulated by ordi- 
nances of 1907, 1908, and 1910. The first of these ordinances provided 
for a four-year obligatory course, to which was added an optional 
course of one year. The ordinance of 1908 extended the scheme of 
optional study, and the ordinance of 1910 authorized a course in 
which the chief subjects throughout should be such as relate to house- 
hold management. As a result of these regulations, secondary educa- 
tion of girls is now provided for by high schools established by the 
Government or by local authorities, by private high schools of the 
same character, and by domestic high schools either by public or pri- 
vate origin. The subjects of instruction in the girls’ high schools are 
similar to those in the schools of corresponding grade for boys, with 
less time given to mathematics and the sciences and special stress 
placed upon morals, the Japanese language, and sewing. The domes- 
tic high schools offer a three years’ course in which domestic science 
and sewing occupy half the time; provision is also made for schools
-P-A-G-E-782
  762 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
having a two years’ course in which domestic science, sewing, and in- 
dustries of various kinds occupy nearly all the time. 
In 1912-13 the number of high schools for girls was as follows: 
Public schools having the general course, 162; private, 55; domestic 
high schools, public, 115; private, 15. They registered about 65,000 
pupils. 
HIGHER (SECONDARY) SCHOOLS. 
The “higher schools” prepare students for admission to the uni- 
versity colleges. They are organized in three departments, varying 
in their programs according to the division of the university for 
which the students intend to enter. 
The scope of the higher schools is shown by the accompanying 
conspectus of the studies of the three departments. So far as re- 
ported, there are eight higher public schools, which are named from 
the towns in which they are located (see list). There are many pri- 
vate schools in the Empire of the same general character.

Curriculum.—The great importance attached to the teaching of 
foreign languages is indicated by the number of hours assigned to 
them. This is necessary, because books that must be used in the 
courses preparatory to university education are found only in Euro- 
pean languages. Throughout the entire period of study in the 
higher schools great attention is given to the moral and spiritual 
development of the students, and also to their physical training. 
This purpose is fostered by the provision of dormitories, which en- 
able the faculties to keep constant oversight over the students. 
Students.—Candidates for admission to a higher school must be 
graduates of a middle school, or give proof of equivalent attainments. 
The pressure for admission is so great that in many cases a com- 
petitive examination is ordered as a means of keeping the number 
admitted within the limits of the accommodation. The report calls 
attention to the fact that although the number of special schools of 
every kind, public and private, has been greatly increased as a result 
of the recent wars, this fact has not interfered at all with the num- 
ber of middle-school graduates applying for admission to the higher 
schools. This shows the growing appreciation of general education, 
and is regarded as a direct result of the spread of primary education. 
PROFESSIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. 
Among the notable developments of recent years is the demand 
for the services of women in different departments of life requiring 
‘special preparation either directed to earning a livelihood or to 
meeting the needs of various forms of. public service. In response 
to these demands there have arisen various classes of special schools, 
among them schools for training kindergarten teachers, sewing 
schools, schools for teaching the feminine arts—such as weaving, dye- 
ing, cookery, and manual crafts—and also schools for music and the 
fine arts. A feature of this development is the provision of special 
medical schools in which women are prepared to secure licenses to 
practice, and also diplomas as nurses and sanitary experts. 
Up to the present time no provision has been made by the Govern- 
ment for the higher education of women. The Japanese Woman’s 
University, a private institution at Tokyo, has made remarkable 
progress and given special impetus to the general cause of woman’s 
education. An advanced school for women of the nobility was estab- 
lished at Tokyo by the “ Noblemen’s Association,” but in 1884 it was 
placed under the control of the imperial household department. This 
institution comprises a kindergarten, elementary and secondary de- 
partments, and a course for special study. In 1913 the students num- 
bered 616, including 10 members of the imperial family.

UNIVERSITIES. 
Generd characteristics —At the head of the elaborate system of 
general, liberal, and professional education fostered by the Govern- 
ment of Japan are the four imperial universities. These institutions 
are intended to provide instruction in literature, science, and art, and 
to provide facilities for modern research. They are organized in col- 
leges, with the addition of a university hall, which is common to the 
students of all the colleges who are engaged in special lines of 
scientific research. 
The universities have all been established and are maintained by 
the Government. The control of each is vested in a president and 
council. The latter body consists of the deans of all the colleges 
and one professor from each who is chosen by vote. 
Admission requirements, fees, ete—Graduates of the preparatory 
schools are admitted to the universities without further examination. 
Other applicants must prove equivalent attainments; in case of ex- 
cessive candidates for admission, competitive examinations are held. 
Students pay their owa college expenses, the admission fee being 5 
yen and the tuition fee 50 yen annually. Students distinguished for 
their attainments enjoy the privilege of exemption from the fees, and 
there are also scholarships and loan funds for the benefit of promis- 
ing students whose private means are insufficient to meet the college 
expenses. 
A university student enjoys the privilege of postponing his army 
conscription or of becoming a one-year volunteer. : 
Graduates from the professional colleges are admitted to practice 
in the Empire without further examination and may also be granted 
licenses to teach special branches in secondary schools. The univer- 
sity diploma is inscribed with the special degree corresponding to the 
course pursued by the student. 
The following table shows the personnel and student body of the 
several universities and their distribution in the constituent colleges

Supplementary establishments—The Tokyo Imperial University 
has been in existence for many years, and its equipment has been 
brought to a high pitch of perfection. 
In addition to the ordinary lecture rooms, there is a library 
attached to the university, a large supplementary hospital is attached 
to the college of medicine, an institute for historical compilation is 
attached to the college of literature, and the Tokyo astronomical ob- 
servatory, the botanical garden, a seismological laboratory, and a 
marine laboratory are attached to the college of science. The 
college of agriculture has four large forests—in which the students 
are trained in the science of dendrology—a pomological garden, a 
college farm, etc. 
There are also laboratories of various kinds belonging to the 
colleges of medicine, engineering, science, and agriculture. 
The Imperial University of Kyoto has a comparatively short 
history, but the equipment of each of its colleges has been almost 
completed. A library is attached to the university, and a supple- 
mentary hospital to the medical college. Laboratories are pro- 
vided where necessary, so that nothing is lacking to the students of 
the university to assist them in their researches. 
The college of agriculture in the Tohoku Imperial University has 
had a long history of 40 years as the Agricultural School of Sapporo, 
and has consequently become an institution of considerable impor- 
tance. It has eight farms and three extensive forests, where the 
students may receive practical lessons in agriculture and forestry. 
Besides these, the university has specimen rooms, a botanical garden, 
a library, and a museum. 
The Kyushu Imperial University, though of recent establishment, 
has had a remarkable development. There is a large hospital 
attached to the college of medicine, as in the Tokyo and Kyoto 
Universities. 
The work carried on at the astronomical observatory belonging to 
the college of science of the Tokyo Imperial University consists of 
astronomical observations and the compilation of almanacs, from 
which the public derives great benefit. : 
The object of the institute for historical compilation, belonging 
to the college of literature of the same university, is to collect and to 
compile materials for Japanese history. Forty-three volumes of the 
Dai-nihon-shiryo (Japanese historical materials) and 40 volumes 
of the Dai-nihon-Komonjo (old Japanese documents) have already 
been published, and continuations of these two works will be pub- 
lished from time to time. The copies made of materials collected 
from all quarters, and the matter compiled, amount to 46,000 volumes 
in all. In addition, there is an enormous mass of pictures of his- 
torical personages and old maps, all copied from originals, and of
-P-A-G-E-786
  766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
photographs taken from old pictures of noted personages, from old 
historical illustrations, from old documents, etc. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Interest in technical education was of comparatively slow growth 
in Japan until after the close of the Japan-China War. Since that 
time technical schools have increased in all the principal Prefectures, 
their progress having been greatly accelerated by the war with Rus- 
sia. As a consequence of this development, the Government has 
issued a special school ordinance, bringing all schools of this charac- 
ter under public supervision. The classification and specific pur- 
poses of the schools of this character are indicated by the following 
tabulation:

MEASURES FOR PROMOTING TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
The following citations from the official report pertain to special 
measures for the promotion of technical education : 
State aid—The Government allows pecuniary aid as an encouragement to 
those public technical, agricultural, commercial, nautical, apprentices’, and 
technical continuation schools which are acknowledged to have done much 
toward the advancement of technical education. The aid is given for three 
years; but at the expiration of this term it may be renewed if this is thought 
necessary. 
The sum thus given is at present 276,000 yen ($55,200) and the number of 
the schools amongst which the money is distributed is as follows: 
  
    Special technical schools. SS ee 
Technical schools of secondary grade. 145 
Technical schools of primary grade__ 246   
Privileges—Amongst the special technical schools and technical schools of 
secondary grade, whether public or private, those schools receive official sanc- 
tion, according to the regulations, in which the discipline is good and firmly 
maintained, and in which teachers and equipment are alike adequate to the 
task of instruction in the various fixed courses of study. In the case of these

sanctioned schools the students enjoy the privilege of postponing their period 
of conscription and the graduates may become civil-service officials of hannin 
(ordinary) rank. 
These sanctioned schools, classified according to privileges, are as follows:

  RELATION OF TECHNICAL SCHOOLS TO MEN OF BUSINESS. 
The relation between technical schools and men engaged in business has 
lately been becoming closer and closer, scientific theory has been brought into 
harmony with practice, and the two have been exerting a mutually beneficial 
influence, the result being on both sides progress and improvement. Business 
men of every kind have paid visits to technical schools, have seen the students 
at study or doing practical work; have handled articles of the students’ manu- 
facture or the products of school farms; have wondered at machines, imple- 
ments, and tools of the newest kind; or have asked questions regarding the 
experiments and investigations carried. on in the schools. Thus they have 
been enabled to appreciate the importance of this kind’ of education. The 
schools have furthermore sent out invitations to business men and have ex- 
plained to them what things have an important bearing on practical business; 
have published the results of experiments and investigations, have lent or 
distributed implements, machines, manufactured articles, specimens, seeds, 
ete., and have thus greatly assisted various branches of industry, or have 
exhibited to the public what has been manufactured in the school or been 
produced on the school farms. Thus the schools have endeavored both directly 
and indirectly to assist and promote all branches of industry. Further, the 
schools have sent out teachers, at the request of different bodies of business 
men, to deliver important lectures; they have invited educators or business 
men of much learning and experience to deliver lectures which have been 
open to the public; the teachers have taken the students to workshops, farms, 
banks, companies, or private stores, where they have given practical lessons 
to students; and when they have found some things in these places open to 
improvement, they have kindly pointed them out to the people of the work- 
shops, etc. In this way, as time goes on, the schools and men of business will 
be a help to each other. 
AUXILIARY AGENCIES. 
Auxiliary agencies for promoting education are supported both by 
the General Government and local governments. The most important 
of these agencies are as follows: 
Libraries —The Imperial Library, which is the only one estab- 
lished by the Government, was opened in 1872 and has kept pace with 
the progress of education in the country. It contains 437,414 volumes 
of Japanese and Chinese books and 85,473 volumes of (orcen books, 
making a total of 522,887 volumes. 
The number of readers in one year, according to the latest returns, 
was 225,325, giving an average of 696.9 per day. 
The public and private libraries number about 700. They are 
scattered over various parts of the country and contribute much to 
the diffusion of knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-788
  768 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
Local governments and public or private schools affording a higher 
course of education also have their own libraries. Of these the most 
extensive and completely equipped is the library attached to the 
Tokyo Imperial University. This library contains 274,000 volumes 
in Chinese and Japanese and about 230,000 volumes of foreign 
books, making a total of 504,000 volumes. 
Museums.—The largest of the educational museums belongs to the depart- 
ment of education. As explained in the official report, the object is to collect 
and to display for public inspection various educational articles, together with 
books and pictures, obtained both at home and from abroad, in such a manner 
as shall best afford means for the improvement and development of education. 
The articles as at present collected and exhibited are those illustrating school 
architecture, school equipments, apparatus for teaching, and specimens of work 
done by pupils, etc. ‘ 
Together with the Educational Museum, there is a Museum for Popular 
Education. In this museum are collected and exhibited simple apparatus, 
specimens, models, pictures, photographs, etc., that relate to natural sciences, 
accompanied by explanations of their application, with the object of imparting 
useful knowledge to the public at large. In connection with this institution a 
public libary is provided with 25,000 volumes, besides magazines and newspa- 
pers. The number of visitors to this institution was about 150,000 during last 
fiscal year, among whom about 11,000 were readers in the library. 
The college of agriculture in the Tohoku Imperial University has 
a large museum admirably classified for the display of the products 
of the country for purposes of study, and also for illustrating the 
historical development of agricultural industries. While its main 
purpose is to serve the needs of students, it is open to the general 
public for a certain period each day, in order to diffuse a general 
knowledge of the productions of that section. 
There are also three imperial museums situated, respectively, at 
Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara. In these museums exhibits are displayed 
principally of historical relics and specimens of the fine arts and of 
arts and industries, so arranged as to illustrate the changes that have 
taken place in both the fine and industrial arts. 
Educational societies and scientific associations—The Imperial 
Educational Society, which was founded in Tokyo in 1883, is the 
most important organization of its class in Japan. The society pub- 
lishes a journal, maintains a popular library, lecture classes, and 
general conferences, and also confers honors upon persons of educa- 
tional merit. 
The department of education maintains a system of lecture insti- 
tutes or summer schools in the interests of teachers. These are gen- 
erally in charge of professors of some one of the universities and 
deal in the main with the subjects taught in the higher schools. 
The Imperial Academy has for its object the advancement of sci- 
ence and the encouragement of learning and culture; it also serves as 
an organ of inquiry for the minister of education on all matters re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-789

lating to its specialties. The number of its members is fixed at 60. 
They are elected from the general body of candidates by the mem- 
bers of the respective departments, and are appointed by the Em- 
‘peror himself on the recommendation of the minister of education. 
Foreign scholars who have rendered distinguished service in the 
advancement of learning in this Empire may be appointed as honor- 
ary members. 
The science of meteorology is fostered through the agency of the - 
Central Meteorological Observatory and its stations, and is supple- 
mented by local meteorological stations, which number at present 
118. The latter are maintained out of the local budgets and con- 
trolled by the local governor under the supervision of the minister 
of education. 
Japan has contributed to the interests of science throughout the 
world through the agency of the earthquake investigation commit- 
tee, the geodetic committee, the special observatory for the measure- 
ment of latitude, and the committee for the compilation of cata- 
logues of scientific literature. These are all Government institutions. 
Agencies for promoting popular education—Popular lectures are 
found to be the most efficacious means of reaching adults and young 
people who have passed the school age. The magic lantern and the 
cinematograph are widely used in connection with these lectures, and 
in aid of this work the department of education has a committee for 
examining books and pictures, magic-lantern slides, and cinemato- 
graph films. 
Instruction by correspondence is maintained by private profes- 
sional schools, the lessons relating chiefly to politics, law, and eco- 
nomics, though literature, language, mathematics, and the natural 
sciences are also taught by this means. Some of these schools hold 
periodical examinations for promotion, and to such of their corre- 
spondents as successfully pass the examination certificates of quali- 
fication are issued. 
EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM TO CHOSEN. 
The Government of Japan has developed a school system in Chosen 
modeled after its own system with adaptations to the native condi- 
tions. According to statistics for 1914, the total number of educa- 
tional institutions maintained in that Province was, for the Japanese, 
_ 286, with 1,169 teachers and an enrollment of 31,636 pupils. For 
Koreans the number of educational institutions was 1,729, with 7,119 
teachers and 129,919 pupils. The annual expenditure for the Japa- 
nese schools was 928,086 yen ($464,000) and for the Korean institu- 
tions 2,193,116 yen ($1,096,000).

  770 EDUCATION REPORT, 1915. 
The practical spirit which has characterized the development of 
education in Japan is equally marked by the work in Chosen. Par- 
ticular attention has been paid in that peninsula to the promotion of 
agriculture and the encouragement of afforestation, both of which are 
being systematically developed. 
ART EDUCATION, 
From the earliest times art has played a very important part in the 
religious, social, and industrial life of Japan, and naturally under 
the present conditions great attention is paid to art education. The 
administrative division to which this interest is committed is charged 
with preserving the specimens of ancient art and the general super- 
vision of the system of art education. In addition to maintaining the 
principles and methods which have distinguished the national sys- 
tem of art, provision has been made under the direction of the 
minister of education for introducing the principles and methods of 
European art. The Tokyo Fine Art School is the only institution 
of the kind maintained by the Government. It comprises at present 
eight courses of instruction, as follows: 
Japanese painting, European painting, sculpture, designing, engraving on 
metals, metal casting, lacquering, photomechanical printing, and the training 
course of teachers. The length of each course is five years, preparatory course 
included, while the last two courses extend over three years. Applicants for 
admission must be graduates of middle schools, and are admitted after an 
examination. 
Kyoto was formerly the captial of the Empire, and is still regarded 
as the center of fine arts. A school of painting was established in that 
city before the Government school existed. In 1908 the standard 
of the Kyoto school was raised, and it has since been known as the 
special school of painting. In addition to these two institutions, 
Japanese painters maintain art studios (kajuku), in which students 
practice under the guidance of great artists. 
Public interest in art works and art education is promoted by the 
Japanese Fine Art Association and by several associations for the 
promotion of industrial art, among them the Tokyo Metal Workers’ 
Association, the Tokyo Lacquer Ware Association, and the Tokyo 
Sculptors’ Association. 
In 1907 the first public exhibition of works of fine art was held 
under the auspices of the educational department, and a similar 
exhibition has been held in each succeeding year with ever increas- 
ing success. 
Provision for art education is completed by the Tokyo Academy 
of Music, which receives an annual endowment from the Government. 
The curriculum is divided into two courses, one for training pro- 
fessional musicians and the other for the purpose of training teachers
-P-A-G-E-791
  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. T71 
of music. The teachers of music in normal schools and girls’ high 
schools are mostly graduates from the normal course of this academy. 
The music in the elementary schools improves steadily under the 
instruction of teachers who have profited by the special training. 
It is an interesting fact that the Tokyo Academy of Music was called 
into existence by the desire to introduce western music into the 
schools. There is no school, however, for teaching Japanese music. 
This art is preserved by the efforts of private music teachers. A 
very recent extension of art education is in the form of schools for 
actors and actresses, and at these native music is taught somewhat 
after the school system.

EXPENDITURES. 
The actual amount of ordinary expenditure for the department of 
education for the year 1912-13 was yen 9,481,047 ($4,740,000) ; the 
amount of extraordinary expenditure was yen 1,311,042 ($655,000), a 
total increase over the previous year of yen 348,758 ($172,000). Of 
the entire amount for ordinary expenditure, the imperial universities 
and their dependent institutions received yen 5,717,257 ($2,857,000). 
The amount of ordinary expenditure for public schools of Prefec- 
tures, districts, cities, towns, and villages was yen 64,365,352, and of 
extraordinary expenditure, yen 16,502,240, the total being yen 80,867,- 
592 ($40,484,000). Of this total expenditure, yen 11,392,740 were de- 
rived from tuition fees and other income for educational purposes; 
the balance was defrayed by prefectural taxes, local rates, district 
rates, city, town, and village taxes, and other sources of income.

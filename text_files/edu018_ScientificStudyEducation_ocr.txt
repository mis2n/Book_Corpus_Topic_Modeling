PREFACE 
This book is the result of eight years of experimentation. 
In 1909 the Department of Education of The University 
of Chicago abandoned the practice of requiring courses 
in the History of Education and Psychology as introduc- 
tory courses for students preparing to become teachers. 
For these courses it substituted one in Introduction to 
Education and one in Methods of Teaching. This move 
was due to the conviction that students need to be intro- 
duced to the problems of the school in a direct, concrete 
way, and that the first courses should constantly keep 
in mind the lack of perspective which characterizes the 
teacher-in-training. 
In the years that have elapsed since 1909 the conviction 
has gained almost universal acceptance in normal schools 
and colleges of education that the History of Education is 
not a suitable introductory course. Psychology has grown 
in the direction of a scientific discussion of methodology, 
and the demand for a general introductory discussion of 
educational problems from a scientific point of view has 
often been expressed by teachers in normal schools and 
colleges. In this period the writer has had frequent op- 
portunity to try out various methods of presenting such an 
introductory course. The results of this experience are 
presented in this volume, which is designed as a textbook 
for students in normal schools and colleges in the first 
stages of their professional study.

  iv THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The teacher who uses this book can expand the course 
to double the length here outlined by introducing school- 
room observation and supplementary reading. The ques- 
tions and references offered at the end of each chapter and 
the references in the footnotes are intended to facilitate 
such further work. A set of questions is given in the 
Appendix as a guide to classroom observation. 
The obligations which the author has incurred in the 
preparation of the book are numerous. Almost every mem- 
ber of the Department of Education of The University of - 
Chicago has at some time or other given the course to a 
division of students, and all have contributed suggestions 
and criticisms with regard to the organization of material. 
Special obligations should be noted in this connection to 
Professors J. F. Bobbitt, S. C. Parker, F. N. Freeman, 
H. O. Rugg, and W. S. Gray. To Professor E. H. Cam- 
eron the author is under obligation for suggestions made 
, after reading the manuscript. To the authors and publishers 
whose works have been drawn upon for extensive and nu- 
merous quotations, special thanks are due for courteous per- 
mission to use their material. Finally, it is to the students 
who have from year to year passed through this course that 
the largest obligation should be acknowledged beeause of the 
suggestions which their reactions have given to the writer.

  THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF 
EDUCATION 
CHAPTER I 
EXTENDING THE PUPIL’S VIEW OF THE SCHOOL 
Tue Purit’s View Limirep 
Most people think of school matters from the pupil's 
point of view. When they learned arithmetic and grammar, 
or later when they studied algebra and Latin, each course was 
presented to them as though it were a perfect system. The 
teacher did not confide in them that arithmetic probably 
ought to be revised by the omission of many of its topics, 
that formal grammar is a very doubtful subject, and that both 
algebra and Latin are on the point of losing their places as 
required subjects. The pupil sees the front of the school 
scenery ; the machinery behind is known only to those who 
conduct the performance. 
It would be possible to multiply indefinitely examples 
which show that the pupil’s view of the school is very 
limited. What pupil understands the duties of the princi- 
pal or the superintendent, or of the still more remote and 
mysterious board of education? Where does the daily pro- 
gram come from? Who decides about textbooks? Why 
are school buildings commonly planned with large study- 
rooms? Most of these questions are never thought of by 
pupils. Everything in school life seems to have a kind 
of inevitableness which raises it above question or even 
consideration, 
r
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
CONSERVATISM IN THE CoMMUNITY AS A NATURAL 
CoNSEQUENCE 
The narrowness of the pupil’s view woud have less serious 
consequences if it were not for the fact that the pupil be- 
comes in mature life a member of a board of education or 
adopts teaching as his profession. Then trouble results, 
because there is machinery which must be kept running if 
schools are to be efficient, and this machinery suffers if 
intrusted to the hands of those who do not understand its 
complexities. i 
One school superintendent, who encountered vigorous 
opposition to the introduction of changes in the course of 
study, wrote as follows: 
The average American citizen whose schooling was limited to 
the primary and grammar grades looks with reverence upon the 
subjects there taught, and refuses to concur in a change of the 
course of study for the elementary school. Associated with 
the average citizen is a heavy percentage of the teaching faculty 
of both elementary and high schools throughout the country.* 
Another superintendent, who was more successful in 
bringing about reforms, makes this statement : 
People are more conservative in their attitude towards educa- 
tional innovations than toward new adjustments to meet the 
demands of changing modern life in any other field of activity. 
Each adult is inclined to overvalue the particular type of training 
he received and to regard with suspicion any change which will 
tend to discredit this sort of training received at such an expendi- 
ture of time and money. The schools are, therefore, the last insti- 
tution to respond to the changing demands of modern life.?

  EXTENDING THE PUPIL’S VIEW 3 
DEMAND For A Broap Scientiric Srupy 
If schools are to be progressive and efficient, they must 
be studied very much more broadly and comprehensively 
than they can be from the pupil’s point of view. The sug- 
gestion naturally arises that this broader study is a part of 
the professional duty of the teacher. So it is; but it will 
not be enough merely to exhibit the intricacies of education 
to teachers. The whole community must be shown by scien- 
tific methods that the school is a complex social institution, 
and that its conduct, like the conduct of every other social 
institution, requires constant study and expert supervision. 
is movement of opening the eyes of the community to 
€-: and nature of education, the school officers must be 
I€%ders; but their methods must be impersonal and exact. 
BEGINNINGS OF THE SCIENCE OF EpDucATION 
During recent years the demand for a thorough and com- 
prehensive study of schools by scientific methods has led to 
a number of investigations which can be offered as an opti- 
mistic beginning of a science of education. It would, indeed, 
be far beyond the truth to assert that science has settled all 
the problems of teaching and of school organization. There 
is, however, a very respectable body of fact which has been 
clearly enough defined so that it can in no wise be set aside. 
In certain details the requirements of a scientifically valid 
educational scheme are known and can be described. The 
method of studying schools can safely be said to be estab- 
lished. It is the work of the future to take up, now this 
problem, now that, and by progressive stages to work out 
a complete science of school management and classroom 
organization. 
It will be the purpose of subsequent chapters to define 
fully certain of the leading problems with which the science 
of education deals, The remainder of this chapter will be
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
devoted to a brief statement of certain typical studies, which 
will make more concrete and definite the contention that 
the pupil’s view of schools is narrow and that the teacher’s 
view must be extended, as must also that of the community 
at large, if educational conditions are to be improved. 
EFFECTIVENESS OF STUDIES OF RETARDATION 
First, we may refer to investigations which have been 
made of the rate of promotion of pupils through the grades. 
Whenever a pupil fails to complete the work of a grade 
in the appointed time, it is evident that there is some kind 
of maladjustment. The pupil may be incompetent to do 
the work required of him because he is mentally deficient. 
On the other hand, it may be that the work is ill chosen 
and in need of revision. The following statement from: 
one of the leading students of education in the United 
States describes with clearness the problem and the progress 
made in meeting it. 
Just ten years ago the distinguished superintendent of schools 
of New York called attention to the fact that 39 per cent of the 
children in the schools of that city were above the normal ages for 
their grades. This aroused widespread investigation, which showed 
that similar conditions obtained in other cities throughout the 
country. Soon studies of this phase of educational efficiency 
showed that the same conditions which resulted in our schools 
being crowded with retarded children also prevented a large propor- 
tion of these children from ever completing the elementary grades. 
About seven years ago this became one of the most widely 
studied problems of educational administration, and in the past 
four it has been one of the prominent parts of the school surveys. 
During the entire period hundreds of superintendents throughout 
the country have been readjusting their schools to better the 
conditions disclosed. 
In these seven years the number of children graduating each 
year from the elementary schools of America has doubled. The
-P-A-G-E-17
  EXTENDING THE PUPIL’S VIEW 5 
number now is three quarters of a million greater annually than it 
was then. The only great organized industry in America that has 
increased the output of its finished product as rapidly as the public 
schools during the past seven years is the automobile industry. 
It is probable that no other one thing so fundamentally impor- 
tant to the future of America as this accomplishment of our public 
schools has taken place in recent years. There is every evidence 
that this is the direct result of applying measurements to education, 
If the school survey movement now under way can produce other 
results at all comparable with this one, we need have no fear for 
the outcome.* 
The quotation does not tell us how the reform has been 
worked out. That is a long story. In some cities better 
teachers were needed and have been employed. In a great 
number of cases the course of study has been revised. 
Sometimes smaller classes have been provided. So on 
through a long list of details, one might enumerate the 
reforms which have resulted from a careful study of the one 
fact that pupils in the schools were older than they normally 
should be. 
A Srupy or Hicu-Scuoot Courses 
A second type of study can be borrowed from the reports 
of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools. This Association has as its practical purpose the 
inspection of the secondary schools and colleges of the 
northern states from Ohio to Colorado. The inspectors of 
high schools in seventeen states brought together in the 
report of 1916 a number of exact statistics regarding 1128 
approved schools.? One set of these facts may be selected 
for special comment.

Fic. 1. Average number of high-school units in the approved schools of 
the various states of the North Central Association 
The full-drawn lines are proportional in length to the number of units offered in 
academic subjects ; the dotted lines, to technical subjects
-P-A-G-E-19
EXTENDING THE PUPIL’S VIEW 7 
The number of units, or courses, offered in high schools 
has increased rapidly in recent years. Especially marked is 
the addition to the school program of technical subjects, such 
as home economics, manual training, and commercial courses. 
The report here under discussion states that in all the ap- 
proved schools of the association there is an average of 21.13 
academic units, that is, units in such subjects as languages, 
history, mathematics, science, and English; and an average 
of 9.41 units in technical or vocational subjects. 
When we examine the individual states, we find that 
Minnesota, which has a large state fund, much progressive 
legislation on high schools, and a vigorous state department 
of education, shows averages of 23.87 academic units and 
12.65 units of vocational subjects. South Dakota, where 
the school system is new and economic conditions are much 
less favorable, has averages of 17.62 academic units and 
6.46 vocational units. The more striking differences are 
those which arise not from economic conditions but from 
clearly indicated differences in educational policy. Ohio has 
an average of 22.24 academic units, which is high, and an 
average of only 7.26 vocational units, which is low. On the 
other hand, Kansas has 22.9 academic units, or just about 
the same as Ohio, and 10.13 units in vocational subjects. 
Finally, if we carry the comparison into still further detail 
by examining the schools in a single state, we find in Ohio 
one city with a high school of 870 students offering 18 
academic units and 5 vocational units, while in another city, 
where the student body numbers 710 students, the school 
offers 24 academic units and 22 vocational units. 
The comparisons are illuminating in several respects. It 
is probable that most communities are ignorant of the fact 
that their own high schools differ from others. The publica- 
tion of definite facts with regard to the practices of schools 
would stimulate wholesome thinking on school problems. 
The whole life of a school depends in very large measure on

An ExPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF A FUNDAMENTAL SUBJECT 
As a third type of scientific study we may take certain 
recent laboratory investigations of reading. Reading is the 
most important subject taught in the schools; yet there

The numbers below the vertical lines, Figs. 2A, 2 B, indicate the duration of each 
pause in fiftieths of a second. (To reduce these figures to the unit adopted in the 
text multiply by twenty) 
are the widest differences in the results secured with differ- 
ent pupils. It is the duty of the schools to find out what 
constitutes the difference between good readers and bad 
readers, in order that both classes may be improved. 
The method of these studies consists in photographing 
the reader’s eyes as they travel along printed lines. The 
number and length of the pauses are thus determined. It 
is found in general that competent readers see more at a 
glance than do poor readers. Furthermore, it is found that 
different types of reading are radically different ; thus there 
is a marked difference between oral and silent reading. 
The importance of distinguishing these two types of reading  
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  10 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
lies in the fact that most of the teaching of reading in the 
elementary schools is by means of the oral method. Most 
of the demands of later life, and all of the demands made 
upon pupils when they study textbooks in geography and 
history and the other subjects of the school.course, call for 
ability in silent reading. The results of investigations can be 
briefly stated in the following averages: the average numbers 
of pauses per line in oral reading for adults, high-school 
pupils, and elementary-school pupils, reading passages of 
different grades of difficulty, are 8.2, 8.6, and 8.1, while 
the corresponding averages for silent reading are 6.5, 7, 
and 6.3. These figures mean that the eye makes more 
pauses along a printed line when the reader is reading orally 
than when he is reading silently. Oral reading is therefore 
a more laborious, difficult form of reading. Furthermore, 
the time spent in each pause is greater in oral reading. 
The averages in thousandths of a second for oral reading 
for the three classes of readers are 380.8, 372.9, 398, while 
the corresponding figures for silent reading are 308.2, 311.1, 
and 314.1 These figures show that oral reading is.slow 
as well as laborious. 
It would require more discussion than is appropriate at 
this point to bring out the full meaning of such facts as 
these. Enough appears on the surface of the results, how- 
ever, to make it quite evident that the school ought not to 
emphasize oral reading in the upper grades as it does to-day. 
The daily oral-reading drill in the seventh and eighth 
grades imposes on the pupils a slow, clumsy form of reading 
at a time when they ought to be cultivating the power of 
rapid silent reading. 
It is by means of investigations of this kind that each of 
the subjects of instruction is being examined, and as a result

EXTENDING THE PUPIL’S VIEW II 
school work is increasingly developing effective methods 
of cultivating children’s intellectual powers. The work of 
analyzing each of the subjects will be slow and will require 
the codperation of many investigators, but in several sub- 
jects, especially in the elementary schools, an encouraging 
beginning has been made. 
A Stupy oF THE RELATION oF EpucaTION TO GENERAL 
SocraL Lire 
A fourth and final example can be borrowed from studies 
made in the city of Minneapolis of the opportunities for 
trade training in that city, of the number of workmen 
needed in each of the trades, and of the kind of prepara- 
tion required for efficiency in each branch of labor. An 
industrial and educational survey of the community was 
undertaken for the specific purpose of adapting educational 
organization to the practical needs of the community.! 
Such a study recognizes the fact that the school is but one 
among many social institutions and that the school must 
find its proper place in community life through a thorough 
scientific study of other more general social activities. 
Tue Screntiric Strupy oF EpucaTionAL PRoBLEMS 
Here, again, it is by no means asserted that the solution 
of the problem of training workers for the industries has 
been found, It can, however, be stated with complete 
assurance that both the school and the community will 
proceed with greater intelligence if the facts are carefully 
canvassed in advance. 
The spirit of patient, detailed scientific study is more 
and more dominating the schools. There are some who,

  12. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
impatient at the labor involved in such studies, would rush 
forward to radical experimentation. Fortunately, even such 
rash reformers are becoming convinced that they need to 
keep records of their results in order to prove the success 
of the changes which they have made. As a result, they 
too are taking on some of the forms of science, though they 
do not adopt the full program of patient study of conditions. 
The result of a scientific movement such as is under 
way in education will be the cultivation of a broader con- 
ception than was ever possible from any individual point of 
view. The pupil’s view is narrow because he comes in 
contact with the school only at the point of application of 
educational methods to his own life. The scientific view of 
education is broad because it places the school in its proper 
relations to other social activities, because it defines the 
relation of the pupils and teachers to one another and to 
the material used for instruction, and because it opens up 
all the results of school work to full inspection and evalua- 
tion. This broad scientific view is the one which the 
teacher and the community at large should adopt. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
In every school certain changes are introduced from time to 
time in spite of the conservatism of the community. Let the 
student find examples of (x) new courses of study, (2) new 
methods of appointing or promoting teachers, or (3) new forms 
of organization, such as the junior high school or departmental 
teaching. After discovering innovations, let him find how they 
were brought about. 
What are the usual forms of school records and reports known 
to the student? How could records be made of more value? 
Suggest methods of presenting the facts of daily attendance so 
that they can be readily interpreted by a community. What are 
some of the interpretations that ought to be put on failures and 
nonpromotions in different kinds of cases? Is repetition of a  
-P-A-G-E-25

course desirable for a pupil who has failed? Are failures more 
common in required courses than in elective courses? When a re- 
quired course is described as essential to the education of everyone, 
what is meant? 
Let the student test his own rates of reading. How should a 
college class differ from a high-school class in ability to read? Go 
to a library or study-room and watch the people read. Report the 
-differences between individuals. 
The readings which are most stimulating to students who have 
never faced the problems of school organization are those which 
call in question present school practices.

* CHAPTER II 
SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND OF OTHER 
TIMES 
Tue CoMPARATIVE AND HisroricAL METHODS 
The scientific methods of studying school problems, which 
were illustrated in the last chapter, can be supported and 
supplemented by a comparison of the schools of the present 
with the institutions of earlier times, and by a comparison of 
the schools of different countries with one another. Such 
comparisons seldom serve as an adequate basis for the re- 
organization of school practices, because the conditions in 
one generation and in one country are so unlike those of 
others that direct transfer of methods of procedure is dan- 
gerous. Comparison serves, however, to set in clear per- 
spective the characteristics which distinguish each situation 
from every other. If an American wishes to see the school 
system with which he is familiar from a new point of view, 
the comparative method furnishes a kind of outside station 
from which he may look back and see facts which were by 
no means clear in their meaning when viewed from near — 
at hand. 
Tue AMERICAN TExTBook METHOD or TEACHING 
  One very impressive difference between the schools of 
the United States and the schools of Europe is to be found 
in the fact that class exercises in our schools are commonly 
based on assignments in textbooks, while in Europt the 
chief method of instruction is oral exposition by the teacher. 
The word “recitation,” which is often employed in describing 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES ~ 15 
a classroom exercise, is an American term. It originated 
at the period when devotion to the textbook was even 
greater than it is now, —when the pupil was expected to 
repeat verbatim the passage from the text. In British books 
on education the word “recitation” appears only when re- 
ferring to American practices, and usually takes the form 
“the American recitation.” In the German educational 
vocabulary the word has no equivalent. 
The unique American method of reciting lessons learned 
out of a book can be contrasted with the European method 
by taking a concrete case. If one goes into a geography 
class in a German school, one finds in the hands of the 
pupils no book, except that in the schools for the richer 
classes there may be an atlas; commonly the. wall map 
serves, The teacher lectures on some section of the coun- 
try, and follows the lecture by questions which the pupils 
answer. The advantages of the European method are that. 
the pupils become trained, attentive listeners, and are able 
in answering questions to talk coherently for long periods, 
imitating the continuous discourse of the teacher. The dis- 
advantages are that the information supplied is limited by 
the individual teacher’s training, and the pupils cultivate 
little or no independence in the collection and sifting of 
information. The influence of the teacher is always domi- 
nant — often oppressively so. 
INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT BASED ON READING 
The contrast here pointed out is one of fundamental 
importance, It can be adequately understood by a study of 
the history of American schools. When the colonists came 
to New England they were bent on securing for every indi- 
vidual independent ° personal contact with the truth. They 
had left their European homes because there dominating y 
authority always stood between the individual and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    
    16 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
sources of truth. One of the first acts of the colonists, a 
therefore, was to provide for the training of every boy and 
girl in that power which would make him or her independent, 
especially in religion. The early legislation shows unequiv- 
ocally this motive. Thus in 1650 Connecticut passed a law 
which had a preamble very much like that of the Massachu- 
setts law of 1647. The preamble is as follows: 
It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep 
men from a knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times, keep- 
ing them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times, by per- 
suading them from the use of tongues, so that at least, the true 
sense and meaning of the original might be clouded by false 
glosses of saint-seeming deceivers; and that learning may not be 
buried in the grave of our forefathers [the court decreed that 
whenever a township increased to fifty householders they should 
employ someone] to teach all such children as shall resort to him, 
to write and read. 
So strictly did the early schools devote themselves to 
reading that arithmetic and, in some cases, even writing 
were neglected in the exclusive cultivation of the one art of 
reading. Later generations of American teachers and pupils 
have experienced a great expansion of the content of the 
course of study, but the method of instruction has always 
been predominantly the reading method. The large number 
of supplementary readers used: in history, in geography, and 
in nature study keep up the traditions of a school which was 
from the first a reading school. 
The social consequences of this emphasis on reading can 
be seen in the fact that public opinion in America is con- 
trolled largely by an appeal to the people through reading 
matter. The importance of this kind of public opinion can 
hardly be overemphasized. In a democracy there must be 
ability to form independent opinions, and this is possible 
only where there is the widest training in reading.

European ScHoots Caste Scuoors, AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
TRuLy Pusiic 
A second characteristic of the school system of the United 
States which distinguishes it from the systems of Europe 
is described by the phrase, coined in England, “ the educa- 
tional ladder.” There is no limit in the American system 
to the possibility offered the individual pupil of going on to 
higher institutions. The boy or girl who has completed the 
elementary course can go on to the high school and from 
the high school to the college and university. This is not 
true anywhere in Europe. There the school systems are 
sharply divided into two wholly different and distinct lines 
of advancement. The children of the common people go 
to one school ; the children of the aristocracy and richer 
classes go to a different school. The school for the common 
people is limited in time and opportunity, and does not lead 
into the universities.) Thus the Volksschule of Germany, 
which gave instruction before the war to 92 per cent of 
the total school population, is an eight-year school, teaching 
only the common branches. The pupil who enters the 
Volksschule cannot look forward to entering any one of the 
professions or any civil-service position. He cannot be trans- 
ferred from the upper grades of this common school into the 
secondary school. The common school of Germany is a 
social instrument for the perpetuation of a caste system. 
The common people know their place because they learn 
it when they enter school. 
The European school for the aristocracy, on the other 
hand, is organized from its eailiest years with a view to 
preparing its pupils for the higher callings. It is difficult 
for the American to understand how distinct this school is‘ 
from the common school. The term “secondary school” 
is sometimes applied in educational writings to both the high 
school of the United States and the aristocratic schools of

Europe. But the secondary school of Europe is entirely 
different from our high school. It takes little children in 
the lower grades and carries them through. Thus the 
German Gymnasium takes boys of the age of six. These 
are received into what is called a Vorschule, or preliminary 
school. After three years in the preliminary school the pupil 
begins his nine-year course in preparation for the university. 
In some of the states of the German Empire the pupil 
may be’ transferred into the Gymnasium from the earliest 
grades of the common school, but from this point on there 
is no commerce whatsoever, in teaching staff, in course of 
study, or in pupil constituency, between the common school 
and the school of the aristocracy. The division in France 
is quite as strict. In England transfer in the later years of 
the common-school course can be made, but only on the 
basis of examinations. 
The social consequences of such a division within the 
school system need no detailed exposition. The hard-and- 
fast lines of caste are drawn very deep in any country where 
the boys and girls are marked from the beginning of their 
training by separation in opportunity. 
INFLUENCE oF European ScHoots oN THE EDUCATIONAL 
System or Tus Country 
It is not enough that we should see this contrast, how- 
ever ; we must learn its fuller meaning by looking into the 
history of our own school system. The fact is that we have 
not broken entirely away from the traditions of Europe. 
Our elementary school was borrowed directly from the Volks- 
schule of Germany, and many of the readjustments which 
we are making to-day are nothing less than efforts to shake 
ourselves free from that disjointed scheme of education, 
The time of this borrowing of the German Volksschule 
is clearly marked in our history. In the first three decades
-P-A-G-E-32
  20, > Tot SCIPNITEIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
of the nineteenth century American schools were at a low 
level of development. A vivid picture of conditions in 1801 
can be given by quoting from one of the earliest school 
reports that we have. The superintendent of the city of 
Taunton, Massachusetts, in a recent report reproduced this 
interesting historical document, of which we may quote cer- 
tain sections in order to show the kind of school organization 
which prevailed at that date. 
REPORT OF THE VISITING COMMITTEE OF TAUNTON 
IN 1801 
The committee chosen by the town to inspect the schools beg 
leave to report their situation and examination. . . . 
January 6th, 1801. Your committee visited a school kept in 
Rueben Richmond’s house instructed by Mrs. Nabby Williams of 
32 scholars. This school appeared in an uncultivated state the 
, greater part of the scholars. 
On the 26 of Feb., visited Mrs. Nabby Williams’ school the 
second time and found that the scholars had made great proficiency 
in reading, spelling, writing and some in the grammar of the 
English language. 
Nov. roth, the committee gisited and examined two Schools 
just opened; one kept in a “fie house, near Baylies works, of 
the number of yo scholars, instructed by Mr. Philip Lee. This 
School we found to have made but small proficiency in reading, 
spelling and writing, and to be kept only six or seven weeks ; 
upon inquiry why it should be taught no longer, we were informed 
that the ratio of school money for this School was and had been 
usually expended in paying the Master both for his service and 
board, and in purchasing the fire wood which is contrary to the 
usual custom of the town. 
The other School, visited the same day, was kept near John 
Reed’s consisting of the number of between 30 and 4o Scholars 
instructed by Mr. William Reed; This School, being formed into 
regular classes, appeared to have made a good and pleasing 
proficiency in reading, spelling, writing, some in arithmetic and 
others in the Grammar of the English language. This School’s
-P-A-G-E-33
SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 21 
share of school money is expended to pay the Master for his 
service only, so that the School will be continued three months. 
On the 8th day of December they visited a School kept in a 
School house near Seth Hodges, in number 30 Scholars instructed 
by Mr. John Dunbar. This School appeared in a good way of 
learning, and to be keep four months. 
On the 22nd of December your Committee visited two more 
Schools just opened, one in a School house near Samuel Pett’s of 
the number of 40 scholars instructed by Mr. Rufus Dean, and to 
be kept three month. This School appeared to be in a promising 
way of learning in reading spelling and writing and to be regularly 
taught. 
The other School is kept in the home of Mr. Paul Chase and 
taught by Mr. Nicolas Stephens, consisting of 30 Scholars, and 
appears quite in a good way of learning especially in Spelling for 
scarcely a word passed a scholar misspelled, in writing some did 
very well and others in arithmetic appeared attentive. 
January 8th, 1801 visited two Schools for the first time, one in 
the home of Mr. William Hodges of the number of 37 Scholars, 
instructed by Mr. Lovet ‘Tisdale, the other in the home of 
Mr. Daniel Burt, of the number of 25 Scholars, instructed by 
Mr. Benjamin Tubbs. These Schools appeared in good order and 
attentive to their learning. 
Feby. 26th, visited Mr. Dean’s School 2 time, the Scholars were 
crowded into a small room, the air was exceedingly noxcious. 
Many children were obliged to tarry at home for want of room 
and though the school was kept only a few weeks they were 
deprived of its advantages. .A want of books was the complaint. 
The committee were anxiously desirous that this evil might have 
a remedy and were of opinion it may be easily done. The Scholars 
appeared to increase in knowledge & claim our approbation. 
March sth, visited two schools, one kept at Mr. Aaron Pratt’s 
of the number of 3o scholars instructed by Mr. Philip Drown. 
This school gppeared quite unimproved and uncultivated in read- 
ing and spelling, some of them did better in writing. ‘This 
uncultivated state did not appear to be from a fault in the children

but, as your committee were informed, from the disadvantage of 
having had masters illegally qualified for their instruction ; of which 
class is their present master unauthorized by law.* 
The situation here described was typical of all the settled 
towns. How much worse it was in sparsely settled districts 
one can easily imagine. Briefly put, one can say that up 
to 1830 schools throughout the country held short sessions 
in the middle of the winter when the pupils were otherwise 
unoccupied with home demands. There was no supervision 
except by visiting committees, no course of study, little or no 
material equipment, and small outlook for a higher education. 
ApopTion oF THE GERMAN MODEL 
During the decade 18 30-1840 there was an effort, especially 
in Massachusetts under the leadership of Horace Mann 
and in Michigan under John Pierce, to improve the common 
schools. In an illuminating historical treatise on this subject 
Mr. F. F. Bunker has reproduced some of the evidences 
that the changes made at that time in the schools of America 
were largely influenced by German models. The following 
quotations indicate how the movement began : 
Charles Brooks, a man whose influence in Massachusetts was 
great, and who maybe said to have prepared the way for the 
work of Horace Mann, did very much to disseminate knowledge 
respecting the Prussian system. He was primarily interested in 
establishing a normal school after the Prussian model, yet, during 
the campaign which he carried on for this purpose between the 
years 1835 and 1838 he did not limit himself to the consideration 
of the normal school alone, but sought to acquaint the people with 
the details of the German system of elementary education as well. 
His account of the return trip from England, which he made in 
company with Dr. H. Julius, of Hamburg, indicates the esteem 
in which he held the Prussian system : 4 oe

Massachusetts, for the Year Ending December 31, 1915, pp. 68-73.  
-P-A-G-E-35
SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 23 
A passage of 41 days from Liverpool to New York (with Dr. Julius) gave me time to ask all manner of questions concerning the noble, philosophical, and practical system of Prussian elementary education. He explained it like a sound scholar and a pious Christian. If you will allow the phrase, I fell in love with the Prussian system, and it seemed to possess me like a missionary angel. 
Just at the time that Charles Brooks was laboring so diligently to incorporate in the Massachusetts system the results of Prussian experience, another man, John D. Pierce, in Michigan, also an enthusiastic believer in the preéminence of the Prussian organiza- tion, was laying the foundation for an educational system in his own State and building into it the best features of Prussian practice. It was mainly because of his suggestions to the chairman of the committee on education in the convention that framed the State government in 1835 that the article in the constitution respecting education was framed and provision made for the office of superintendent of public instruction. Mr. Pierce was appointed to the superintendency in 1836 and at once began the work of preparing a plan for a complete school system. 
Before framing his recommendations, which were submitted in 1837 and which were approved for the most part, he visited the schools of New England, New York, and New Jersey. Prior to this, however, he had learned of the Prussian system through an English translation of Cousin’s report. This report of Cousin’s was first made known to the English-speaking people by Sir William Hamilton, who, in the Edinburgh Review, July, 1833, commended the report highly and quoted at considerable length therefrom. The next year (1834) that part of the report which treated of Prussian practice was translated into English by Mrs. Sarah Austin and appeared in London, A New York edition of the same translation was issued in 1835 and widely distributed. It was a copy of this edition which, falling into Mr. Pierce’s hands, profoundly influenced him in framing the system he later submitted to the Michigan Legislature. In describing his entrance into public life Mr. Pierce speaks of this circumstance « 
About this time (1835) Cousin’s Teport of the Prussian system, made to the French minister of public instruction, came into my hands and it 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
24 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
was read with much interest. Sitting one pleasant afternoon upon a log 
on the hill north of where the courthouse at Marshall now stands, Gen. 
Crary (chairman of the convention committee on education) and myself 
discussed for a long time the fundamental principles which were deemed 
important for the convention to adopt in laying the foundations of our 
State. The subject of education was a theme of special interest. It was 
agreed, if possible, that it should make a distinct branch of the govern- 
ment, and that the constitution ought to provide for an officer who 
should have this whole matter in charge and thus keep its importance 
perpetually before the public mind. 
Mr. Pierce’s indebtedness to Prussia for many of the ideas 
which he worked out in the system which he organized is thus set 
forth by a later superintendent of the Michigan system, Francis 
W. Shearman, who, writing in 1852, sdia® 
The system of public instruction which was intended to be established 
by the framers of the constitution (Michigan), the conception of the 
office, its province, its powers, and duties were derived from Prussia.’. .. 
RESULTS OF THE ADOPTION OF THE GERMAN EXAMPLE 
It is a striking fact that all this borrowing had to do 
with the common school. Nor was it inappropriate at that 
period that emphasis should be on the school for the cu.n- 
mon people. In the young states there was relatively little 
higher education, and the need was great for an improve- 
ment of the common schools. 
The consequences of this borrowing were momentous for 
our history. There are two characteristics which our Amer- 
ican schools of elementary grade took on in imitation of 
the German model, which characteristics have u2termined 
in large measure their subsequent development down to the 
present.\ In the first place, the German common school 
was strictly a vernacular school, and, in the second place, it 
dealt only with rudimentary subjects. The Gymnasium, or 
the school for the aristocracy, was not a vernacular school.

  SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 25 
Latin and Greek and modern foreign languages were taught 
in even the lower grades of the Gymnasium. Furthermore, 
the Gymnasium alone taught such “ higher ’”’ subjects as the 
higher mathematics, while the common school confined itself 
exclusively to arithmetic as the rudimentary branch of math- 
ematics. In point of time the German Volksschule, as noted 
above, conducted a course eight years in length. The pupils 
completed this course at fourteen years of age, when they 
were confirmed in the Church. 
The common school was the institution which America 
borrowed in 1830-1840, The common school was set up in 
the United States as av eight-year school devoted exclusively 
to the vernacular and to rudimentary subjects. But the 
American system developed. The length of the school 
year increased, and the number of pupils who are am- 
bitious to go on into the higher schools has enormously 
increased. In 1917-we were told by the Commissioner of 
Education of the United States that more than 1,300,000 
of the young people in this country were in the high schools. 
Even now, however, the eight-year vernacular rudimentary 
school of Germany has its stamp on our American life. 
As a rule our American schools do not permit a pupil to 
study foreign languages in the lower school, even when we 
know that he is going on to high school. The general 
exclusion of languages is due to the tradition that the ele- 
mentary school is a vernacular school, not to inability on 
the part of pupils to learn languages. We will not permit 
algebra t6 be taught in the elementary school, because 
algebra is not a rudimentary subject. To be sure, we have 
had a hard time trying to keep arithmetic in its position 
of exclusive domination of the elementary course. We have 
grafted into the arithmetic all kinds of economic informa- 
tion about insurance and banks and foreign exchange. We 
have exercised our ingenuity to the limit in inventing 
examples of a complicated sort in order to keep the pupils
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
in the upper grades at work in arithmetic. But through it 
all we have been kept from a rational development by ad- 
herence to the tradition of the German common school, 
“— the tradition which treats higher subjects as the exclusive 
property of the aristocracy. 
THE REORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
The day of reform is, however, at hand. Social pressure 
has gradually been making it evident to all that in America 
the elementary school cannot be a caste school. The people 
are demanding that pupils who are to have only,a limited 
schooling be admitted to some of the higher subjects. Fur- 
thermore, there are enough pupils who go on into the high 
school to make it evident that the American scheme should 
be organized not with a view to distinguishing between the 
elementary school and the high school, but with ‘a view to 
combining the two into a continuous institution. 
i . the last five years there has spread rapidly a 
movement known as the junior-high-school movement, or 
the intermediate-school movement. This is essentially a re- 
form of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, and consists, 
first of all, in the introduction into the course of study of 
material which formerly belonged to the high school. In 
the second place, this movement recognizes the maturity of 
pupils in a variety of ways. It adopts a form of discipline 
which throws responsibility on them. It departmentalizés 
the teaching and offers electives, thus securing the advan- 
tages of specialization. The movement promises to reor- 
ganize our whole schdol system in such a way as to give 
us a new kind of national education. America has at the 
present moment a closer approximation to a continuous 
educational ladder than any other country, but the ladder 
needs a little splicing. With the present enthusiasm for 
national development the splicing is likely to be facilitated.

‘SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 27 
OrIGIN oF THE HicH ScHooL 
The foregoing statements extracted from the history of 
the elementary school may be supplemented by reference$ 
to the history of the high school. (he first schools of 
secondary grade in this country were patterned after the 
classical secondary schools of England. The Boston Latin 
School and the Hopkins Grammar School of New Haven 
are examples of early foundations of the kind in question! 
These schools were vestibules to the colleges, and the boys 
who attended them — for they were. schools for boys — 
were looking forward to one of the learned professions, 
usually, in the early days, to the clergy. 
(Che Latin school charged tuition, as do all the European 
secondary schools to-day. It was an exclusive school.) It 
was not a part of the popular movement toward general edu- 
cation. In an important sense it was a vocational school 
and illustrates the general fact of history that higher schools 
always had a vocational motive back of their organization, 
whereas the people’s schools of elementary grade were at 
first always missionary enterprises intended to spread religious 
training rather than vocational training. 
(Parallel with the Latin school and growing out of an 
entirely different motive was another institution which was 
very much more genuinely American in its character, This 
was the academy.) The academy was often a_ boarding 
school to which boys and girls alike went for an extension 
of their education. Later the village in which the academy 
was situated took it over or made arrangements to pay for s 
all the pupils, and it became a free academy. 
There were some other experiments in the extension eo 
school opportunities. In New England, the oldest ai 
economically most forward section of the country, a ninth 
grade was added to the elementary school. “There are 
to-day in Maine, and to some extent in other New England

states, elementary schools with a nine-year course. . Lut the 
ninth grade never succeeded. It was cramped by the German 
definition of the elementary school as a vernacular and rudi- 
mentary school. To try to spend nine years rather than eight 
on the three R's was not productive. The academy, on the 
other hand, knew no limits of this kind. It reveled in such 
subjects as French and music and literature and history. 
t last the Latin school and the academy fused in the 
American high school, and the high school took-its place 
at the end of the elementary-school course. The influence 
of’ the academy in determining this form of organization 
was very great, for the academy was from the first connected 
with the elementary school, while the Latin school was in its 
early days an institution quite separate from the common 
school both in its organization and purpose. 
EpucaTION OF GIRLS 
These sketches of school history could be supplemented 
by other discussions. Perhaps it will be well to comment 
briefly on the unique American attitude toward the educa- 
tion of girls. (In Europe girls have only very recently been 
given opportunities of higher education, and even now the 
opportunity is limited to the few. We have undoubtedly 
made the mistake in this country, in our enthusiasm* for 
equality of opportunity, of administering to girls a course 
of study originally designed for their brothers. In due time 
we shall learn how to give to girls an education suited to 
their needs, but faere can never be any question among 
bout the wisdom of a higher education for apne    
HicHer EpucatTion FREE 
Tt has also been noted incidentally that with us all edu- 
cation is free. This has not been attained without much 
discussion and much legislation. We shall later have an
-P-A-G-E-41
SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 29 
opportu.sity to treat more at length the fiscal policies of 
American schools. At this point it is enough to note that 
American schools are what they are because they are free. 
An interesting contrast can be drawn here between the 
practice in England and in the United States. In England 
vast sums of money make a free education accessible to 
certain selected individuals. The higher schools are not free | 
to all comers, as ours are, but a bright boy — it is usually 
only the boy —who can pass a competitive examination is 
given a stipend, which provides his tuition and often enough 
more to get books and, if necessary, pay for transportation. 
The English theory is that it is the duty of the public to pay 
for selected boys, but not for boys in general. To the Ameri- 
can it seems a little hazardous to select the leaders of the 
nation by competitive examinations given to eleven-year-old 
boys. On the other hand, the English think of our plan 
as wasteful because we postpone selection longer than they 
think we should. The contrast here pointed out is enough to 
draw our attention to the unique attitude of American schools, 
’ which are free to all and in this sense far more democratic 
than the higher schools of any European country. y 
t AMERICAN PusBLic SCHOOLS SECULAR 
Finally, we may point out that our schools are secular. 
Some of our own fellow countrymen do not believe in 
secular schools. We are familiar with the practice of organ- 
izing ‘parochial schools. France and England have in recent 
years purchased secularization of their schc Is after long and 
bitter controversy. Germany gives instruction in religion 
as an important part of every course of study. In som 
sections of Germany the distinction between religious belie 
is carried into the school organization in such a way that 
one finds public schools set aside for the children of this 
and that sect. In all schwols the pupil has a right to 
instruction in his own particular type of religion.

30 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
In the United States the complete democratization of the 
schools has been possible because differences in religion have 
been rigidly excluded. There is a common body of knowl- 
edge which can be administered in public schools without 
involving religion. The decision for such a separation was 
made long ago in this country and is one of the characteristic 
facts in our school system as well as in our general civic life. 
Tue ScHooL System anp irs DoMINATION OF THE 
TEACHER 
The facts outlined in this chapter ought to create in the 
mind of the reader a vivid notion of what is meant by 
the words “school system.”” The schools of America or any 
other country have a kind of colossal personality. The 
teacher who teaches a fifth grade or a sixth grade or a 
high-school class does not determine the character of the 
education given at these points in the system. To be sure, 
the teacher can do his or her work effectively or inefficiently. 
The special methods employed may be well or ill adapted 
to their ends, But above and beyond the individual teacher 
is the system which controls the pupil’s progress in many 
subtle ways and determines all the main lines of his train- 
ing. The teacher who would succeed must understand this 
larger influence. Especially is it necessary that the teacher 
who aims to contribute to the rational development of the 
system through the scientific study of detailed problems 
become acquainted with the present characteristics of the 
system and comprehend something of the conditions which 
have produced these characteristics. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
Among textbooks there are such striking differences that the 
student will be able after even a superficial analysis to see that 
their authors had very different ideas about the use of texts, Find  
-P-A-G-E-43
        SCHOOLS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 
am a textbook which is intended to give the pupil a start in a study” : 
rather than a complete discussion of the subject. Find a text 
which is intended to be learned rather than merely read. What 
parts of a textbook are addressed to the teacher and constitute 
teaching devices rather than material for students ? 
Contrast the ways in which different teachers use textbooks. Are 
there teachers who neglect the book very largely? When should 
a teacher lecture? Find specific examples of lessons which can 
best be taught (1) by questions and answers, (2) by written work, 
and (3) by lectures. 
With regard to a given high school it is important to find out 
when it was established. What was its first course of study ? 
With regard to courses for girls, it is interesting to inquire 
how far classes in an elective system are chosen by boys and 
how far by girls. Why are conditions as they are? 
The foregoing questions are asked on the assumption that the 
contrasts presented in the chapter are of value only when they 
make students keenly aware of the facts in their own environ- 
ment. The facts of history are valuable chiefly because of the 
light they throw on the present.

CHAPTER III 
EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 
Tue PRIMITIVE ATTITUDE ONE OF NEGLECT 
One does not have to go far from the door of any edu- 
cational institution. to find people who look on reading and 
writing — to say nothing of higher forms of education —as 
luxuries rather than necessities. There is the parent who 
is willing to take his child out of school for the sake of the 
wage which the child can earn. There is the negligent 
parent, often himself illiterate, who is utterly unconcerned 
about the education of his sons and daughters. Another 
kind of example appears in the boy or girl who goes out 
into the trades after a limited schooling and fails to keep 
up the type of intellectual activity which was cultivated in 
the school. Many a child who has been taught through 
years of instruction how to read makes very little use of 
his training in mature life. 
An appeal to the history of civilization reveals the fact 
that there was a time when the opinion prevailed that edu- 
cation was unnecessary for the common man. The earliest 
schools were for the aristocracy and for the professional 
classes. Schools for all the people are of comparatively 
recent date. 
Computsory EpucATIOoN 
In striking contrast with this attitude of neglect and 
indifference is the fact that to-day there are laws in all the 
civilized countries of the world compelling children of every 
social grade to attend school. Society as a whole does not 
32 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 33 
share the slight esteem of reading exhibited by the man who 
takes his child out of school. Indeed, society has gone so 
far as to set aside that man’s judgment and to assume con- 
trol of the child to the extent of insisting that the rudiments 
of an education shall be made universal. 
Society still leaves it to the individual to decide whether 
he is to study higher branches. One may take algebra or 
not as one elects, but not so with arithmetic. The common 
interests of our common life dictate that everyone shall be 
able to count and to make accurate numerical statements. 
People must know some arithmetic; they must be able to 
read, or they are a menace to public comfort and safety. 
COMPULSION OF COMMUNITIES 
The full acknowledgment of the fact that education is a 
public necessity has developed gradually. History shows us 
the steps by which this fact has been recognized in legisla- 
tive action. The first step was the adoption of laws requir- 
ing communities to provide schools. We may put the matter 
in terms of contemporary conditions by referring to commu- 
nities which would to-day be backward in this matter if it 
were not for state control. Thus there are sparsely settled 
districts or poor districts which cannot afford good schools, 
or, indeed, any kind of a school. The state is vitally inter- 
ested in seeing to it that the untoward conditions in these 
regions do not deprive the children of an education. In the 
later years of their lives the children from these districts 
will surely scatter to other parts of the state. They will 
be less productive than they would have been if they had 
been educated. It is much more economical for the state 
as a whole to take a hand in the training of the children 
than to have to support even a small number of dependent 
adults during the unproductive period of later life when the 
consequences of poor schooling appear.  
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
In some cases the delinquency of a community is due not 
to economic stress but to shortsighted frugality. Here again 
the higher authority of the larger community must take con- 
trol and force the backward group to give the children such 
training as will bring them to reasonable productivity. 
The earliest legislation on this matter is of the type which 
was quoted in the last chapter, where reference was made to 
the Connecticut law of 1650. Such legislation was addressed 
to the community and enjoined on it the obligation to pro- 
vide schools. 
Later STAGES OF ComMPuULsoRY LEGISLATION 
Such compulsion of the community was followed, but at 
a’ much later date, by legislation compelling the child to 
attend school ; and finally the period was reached in the midst 
of which we live to-day, when the state is taking a hand in 
the supervision of schools for the purpose of insuring as 
high and as uniform a grade of education as it can afford. 
American Epucation To 1850 
The first period of our national life, during which we were 
very gradually evolving the conception of a need for public 
education and were setting up the requirement of schools in 
every community, extended down to the decade before the 
Civil War. _ Professor Cubberley has given a very illuminat- 
ing description of this period, from which we may quote 
the following extracts : 
During the early decades of the nineteenth century, schools and 
the means of education made little progress. There were among 
the founders of our states certain far-seeing men who wished for 
general public education, but ét was well along toward the middle 
of the century before these men represented more than a hopeful 
minority in most of our states, and in the South little was done 
until after the Civil War....  
-P-A-G-E-47
  EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 35 
To be illiterate was no reproach, and it was possible to follow 
many pursuits successfully without having received any other 
education than the education of daily work and experience. A 
large proportion of the pe ple felt that those who desired an 
education should pay for it. As the Rhode Island farmer expressed 
it to Henry Barnard in 1844, it would be as sensible to propose 
to take his plough away from him to plough his neighbor’s field as 
to take his money to educate his neighbor's child. Others felt that 
at most free education should be extended only to the children of 
the poor, and for the rudiments of learning only. Still others felt 
that all forms of education would be conducted best if turned over 
to the various religious and educational societies of the time. A 
system of public instruction maintained by general taxation, such 
as we to-day enjoy, would not only have been declared unnecessary, 
but would have been stoutly resisted as well. The best schools, 
and often the only schools, were private schools supported by the 
tuition fees of those who could afford to use them, and most of 
these were more or less directly under church control. 
Not until after the beginning of the nineteenth century was 
education regarded at all as a legitimate public function. . . . 
The different humanitarian movements which arose after 1820, 
and which, among other things, demanded public tax-supported 
schools for all, had not as yet made themselves felt. The people 
were poor, and indifferent as to education. 
Gradually, and only after great effort, this condition of apathy 
and indifference was changed to one of active interest, though the 
change took place but slowly, and differed in point of time in dif- 
ferent parts of the country. The Lancastrian system of monitorial 
instruction (by which a single teacher with the assistance of his 
best students, called monitors, taught hundreds of pupils), intro- 
duced into this country from England about 1806, for the first 
-time made an elementary school training for all seem possible, 
from a financial point of view. . . . 
The idea that free education was a right, and that universal 
education was a necessity, began to be urged and to find accept- 
ance. The land grants of Congress to the new states for the 
benefit of common schools greatly stimulated the movement... The 
published reports ‘of those who had visited Pestalozzi’s school in
-P-A-G-E-48
36 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Switzerland, and had examined the new state school system in 
Prussia, were extensively read. The moral and economic advan- 
tages of schools were set forth at length in resolutions, speeches, 
pamphlets, magazines, and books. 
Just when this change took place cannot be definitely stated. 
Roughly speaking, it began about 1825 and was accomplished by 
1850 in the Northern states. It was a gradual change rather than 
a sudden one, though rapid advances were at:times made. ‘The 
movement everywhere was greatly stimulated by the educational 
revival inaugurated by Horace Mann in Massachusetts in 1837. 
In the Southern states, with one or two exceptions, little was 
accomplished until after the Civil War and the Reconstruction 
Period were over. Almost everywhere it took place only after 
prolonged agitation, and ofttimes only after a bitter struggle. The 
indifference of legislatures, the unwillingness of taxpayers to assume 
the burdens of general taxation, the small sense of local responsi- 
bility, the satisfaction with existing conditions, the old aristocratic 
conception of education, the pauper and charity-school idea, and 
frequently the opposition of denominational and private schools, — 
all of these had to be met and overcome. The referendum was 
tried in a number of states, and sometimes more than once; in 
others, the question of free schools became a vital political issue. . . . 
By 1850, the principle of tax-supported schools had been 
generally accepted in all of the Northern states, and the beginnings 
of free schools made in some of the Southern states. Six state 
normal schools had been established, a number of states had pro- 
vided for State Superintendents of Common Schools and for ex- 
officio State Boards of Education, and the movement for state 
control of education had begun. It may be said that it had not 
become a settled conviction with a majority of the people that the 
provision of some form of free education was a duty of the state, 
and that such education contributed in a general way, though just 
how was not at that time clear, to the moral uplift of the people, 
to a higher civic virtue, and to increased economic returns to the 
state. A new conception of free public education as a birthright of 
the child on the one hand, and as an exercise of the state’s inherent 
right to self-preservation and improvement on the other, had taken 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  
\ EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 37 
the place of the earlier conception of schools as merely a coépera- 
tive effort, based on economy, and for the instruction of youth 
merely in the rudiments of learning.’ 
Computsory ATTENDANCE 
The second stage in the development of a public educa- 
tional system was reached when the states began to see 
that children must be compelled to ge to school. In 1852 
Massachusetts passed the first compulsory-education law. 
In 1864 the District of Columbia followed. In 1867 came 
Vermont; in 1871, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Wash- 
ington.? From that time on the other states have been 
enacting such laws. The Southern states, which before the 
Civil War had practically no public-school system and after 
the war were economically depressed, were the last to pass 
compulsory-attendance acts. 
Without attempting to deal with the remoter historical 
development of such legislation, it is possible to show by 
reference to contemporary reports the difficulties in securing 
and enforcing such laws. Two quotations from the reports of 
the Commissioner of Education of the United States indicate 
the present conditions with regard to compulsory attendance. 
The report of 1915 makes the following statement : 
The year 1915 was a notable year for the cause of compul- 
sory school attendance. Four States— South Carolina, Florida, 
Alabama, and Texas — which did not have laws on the subject, 
enacted laws at the last sessions of their legislatures. This new 
extension of the compulsory attendance area carries required 
attendance at school into the section where it has hitherto met the 
most stubborn resistance; the area now practically includes the 
entire United States, Georgia and Mississippi alone remaining 
without laws on the subject.*

  38 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The report of 1916 supplements this statement as follows: 
Efforts were made to secure the enactment of attendance laws 
in both of these States [Georgia and Mississippi] in 1916, and in 
the former the effort was successful) The new law of Georgia, in 
brief, requires the attendance of every child between 8 and 14 years 
of age for four months each year. Exemptions from this require- 
ment apply to those who have completed the fourth grade of 
school work ; those upon whom needy members of the family are 
dependent for support; those whose parents or guardians are 
unable to provide the necessary books and clothing, unless the 
_same are otherwise provided ; those whose services are needed 
for farm emergencies ; those who are mentally or physically inca- 
pable; and those who reside more than 3 miles from school. 
Boards of education of counties and of cities and towns are 
intrusted with the enforcement of the law in their respective 
jurisdictions." 
V 
OxsTACLES TO ENFORCEMENT OF COMPULSORY 
ATTENDANCE 
The enactment of laws is only one step in securing 
attendance. Especially is there difficulty where local authori- 
ties are intrusted with the enforcement of the laws. The 
records of school operations in the Northern states show that 
compulsory education was not really enforced until in the 
’80’s and later. The sort of difficulty encountered is clearly 
illustrated by a clipping from the Statesman, a daily paper 
of Austin, Texas, which sets forth the situation late in 
1916 under the Texas law, which was then just beginning 
to be effective. 
The compulsory school attendance law will be effective during 
the coming year. The compulsory term of the first year of the 
law’s operation will be three months, or 60 school days, and the 
board of trustees of each school has the authority to specify 
1 Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1916, Vol. I, p. 24.
-P-A-G-E-51
EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 39 
the months during which attendance shall be compulsory. The 
Austin City School Board has ruled that the compulsory term shall 
begin January 1. 
The matter of providing truant officers has not yet been dealt 
with, either by the City School Board or by the County Board of 
Education. The law provides $2 a day as remuneration to the 
truant officer for the time actually served by him. The City Super- 
intendent believes that the logical procedure for the city will be to 
secure the services of the county probation officer, provided it is 
found practicable for him to take on the additional duties. 
The County Board of Education meets next Monday and will 
probably discuss this matter. It cannot act, however, except on 
the petition of fifty citizens. In case no such petition is presented, 
the County Superintendent says that it will devolve on each school 
principal to report to the County Superintendent those children 
who are not in school, and she can call on any peace officer to 
execute the law. It is not thought likely that the probation officer 
will find it possible to act as truant officer for the county. 
The reason why the beginning of the compulsory period was 
placed so late as January 1 is that many of the children likely to 
be affected —largely Mexicans and negroes —will be needed in 
the cotton patch during the fall. Also in the city, many poor boys 
and girls will be able to earn something during the Christmas 
holidays. There are serious objections to the plan, however, since 
the child who enters school so late in the session will be at a serious 
disadvantage, and the extra attention he will demand of the teacher 
will work a hardship on the other pupils. Moreover, in the city the 
school session is divided into two equal periods, the first of which 
ends only a month after the child is required to begin attendance. 
This will involve serious difficulties. 
The compulsory attendance law applies to children eight to 
fourteen years of age, with certain exceptions. The compulsory 
term the second year will be eighty days, the third year 100 ‘days. 
’ Defective children are exempted ; also rural children more than 
24 miles from a school, and on the written statement of a parent 
that the services of her child of twelve years or more who has 
reached the fourth grade are needed for the mother’s support, 
such a child may be exempted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  40° THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Even a casual reading of this quotation calls attention to 
the fact that there is the keenest competition between 
employment and education. The modern industrial system 
finds children profitable for certain purposes and uses them. 
If society is to enforce its judgment that these children 
ought to be in school, that judgment will have to express 
itself in mandatory terms. The federal government has 
recently taken a hand in the matter. It is difficult or 
impossible in some states to get suitable legislation against 
the exploitation of child labor by unprincipled employers. 
State legislatures have too often shown themselves subser- 
vient to the dictates of such employers. In 1916 the 
Congress of the United States passed a law restricting child 
labor in all trades which produce commodities intended for 
use in interstate commerce. This federal law is another 
expression of the judgment of civilization that childhood is 
a period which should be devoted to education. 
It is also shown in the Texas quotation that the machin- 
ery for keeping account of children is complicated. The 
ordinary school authorities cannot deal with the matter with- 
out adding attendance officers to their staff. These. officers 
must be supplied with adequate information. This in turn 
calls for a special school census, because the ordinary na- 
tional enumeration and even the state and city enumerations 
are not frequent nor complete enough. One of the most 
progressive of the New England states has recently adopted 
legislation looking to the creation of a more adequate system 
of records. This new law is described in the Commissioner's 
Report of 1916 as follows : 
In order to facilitate the enforcement of its attendance law, 
Massachusetts provided in 1916 for the registration of minors. 
City and town school committees are required under the new law 
to ascertain the name, age, and other essential facts respecting 
every child between 5 and 7, between 7 and 14, and between 14 
and 16 years of age, and respecting minors over 16 years of age

who cannot read and write. A card giving these data must be 
kept for every child or minor. The attendance officer is required 
to examine these cards and see that children attend school as 
required by law. Supervisory officers of private schools must 
within 30 days report the enrollment of children of compulsory 
attendance age, and when any child withdraws from school must 
report the same within ro days. 
Newer LEGISLATION RECOGNIZING COMPLEXITY ‘OF 
' PROBLEMS OF ATTENDANCE 
Definitions of the period of compulsory attendance are 
usually based on the number of grades in the elementary 
school. Laws commonly specify the age of beginning as _ 
six and fix the age of fourteen as the upper limit. Some- 
times the age of beginning is higher. For example, the 
1915 law in South Carolina is thus described by the 
Commissioner of Education : 
The 1915 act of South Carolina is a local option law. Upon 
petition of a majority of the qualified electors of a district or 
“aggregation of districts,” the county board of education is 
required to declare the law in effect in such district or districts, or, 
on petition of one-fourth of the electors, an election must be held 
to determine the matter. All children between the ages of 8 and 
14 who are physically able and who reside within 24 miles of school 
are required to attend for the full term, or at least for four months. 
Children between the ages of 14 and 16 are required to attend 
unless lawfully employed or if they can not read and write simple 
English sentences,” 
The provisions of this law show how complicated is the 
social situation with which the community deals in its com- 
pulsory laws. The assumption that it is simple to define 
the necessary schooling for a future citizen is easily refuted 
by a little consideration.

  42 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
In the first place, pupils do not go through the elemen- 
tary schools without interruption ; hence the mere specifying 
of a given age such as fourteen is not enough. Non- 
promotion, or the removal of the family to another town, or 
some misfortune such as sickness may delay the pupil so 
that he reaches the age of fourteen in one of the lower 
grades. Intelligent legislation is, accordingly, taking this 
into account. In some states it is required that the child 
shall finish a certain grade, — usually the sixth, — otherwise 
he must go to school until he is sixteen. Or, as in South 
Carolina, he must stay in school until he has acquired the 
ability to read and write. 
In this connection a complication in legislation may be 
pointed out which is of profound social significance. The 
definition of adulthood which is given in labor legislation 
has usually set the age at which a boy may be regularly 
employed, at sixteen, while the education law of the same 
state often requires school attendance only up to fourteen. 
The result is that the youth between fourteen and sixteen 
has been sadly at sea. He has not had the judgment to stay 
in school after he was freed by the compulsory-education 
law, and he has not had the opportunity to enter on regular 
employment. He has therefore drifted about, working at 
odd jobs and learning the bad habits of the unproductively 
employed. 
Supervision A NECESSARY COROLLARY TO COMPULSION 
Such considerations as these lead to a clear understand- 
ing of the reasons why the state is undertaking in increasing 
degree the supervision of the details of school work. It is 
snot enough that communities should open schools or that 
pupils should be compelled to attend; the quality of edu- 
cation must be such as to justify the expenditure of public 
money and the investment of the pupils’ time and energy 
in the business of schooling.
-P-A-G-E-55
  EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 43 
Compulsory education implies obligations both on the 
side of the pupil and on the side of the community. It 
would manifestly be inequitable to compel children to go to 
school if the community failed to provide suitable, safe, and 
sanitary buildings. Because local wisdom in such matters is 
often limited, and local judgment biased by considerations 
of expense, the state has dealt with the matter both through 
general legislation and through vigorous inspection. 
In like fashion it would evidently be indefensible to 
require pupils to go to school and use inferior textbooks or 
be instructed by unqualified teachers. Here again the larger 
community has found it necessary to take a hand. State 
adoption of textbooks is not uncommon, and state certifica- 
tion of teachers is becoming universal. 
More important, perhaps, than anything else is the choice 
of the subject-matter of instruction. To the ordinary man, 
as indicated in an earlier chapter, subject-matter seems to 
choose itself ; but it does not. Nor can the local community 
be expected to know the larger needs of its children. A 
very striking example of this is furnished by the fact that 
the federal government has recently set aside vast sums of 
money for the purpose of subsidizing and directing agricul- 
tural and industrial education. The theory back of this 
action is that even the states, and more certainly cities and 
towns, are unable to deal with the problems of adequate 
training for practical life. The largest unit, namely, the 
whole country, is so much concerned with the efficiency of 
its citizens in industrial matters that it has’ undertaken to 
subsidize and supervise this phase of education. 
Such examples make clear the principle under which 
state laws define the minimum course of study and under 
which state departments of education are erected to super- 
vise the administration of the course of study. They make 
clear also the justification for the statement that the control 
of education ought to be increasingly centralized,
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
HicHER EpucaTION AND PuBLIC CONTROL 
There is one aspect of the educational demands of a 
community which is usually thought of as lying entirely 
outside the scope of the compulsory-education law. It is 
ordinarily thought that higher education is a purely indi- 
vidual matter. In the older parts of the country the state 
has been slow to provide higher schools. Colleges have 
often been provided for by denominational organizations or 
by purely private endowments. Even in the field of higher 
education, however, it is becoming evident that public inter- 
ests are involved. In medicine, in law, and in training of 
teachers, the state has been obliged to assume increasingly 
supervisory powers, and of late the financial provision for 
such education has been more and more accepted as a public 
obligation. The result of this evolution is the broader pro- 
vision out of the public purse for all kinds and all stages 
of education. 
Pustic ConrroL ADEQUATE ONLY WHEN DIRECTED 
BY SCIENCE 
Enough has been said to show that much is involved in 
the establishment of a public-school system, The problems 
which arise in the teaching of pupils are intricate ; but when 
one thinks of education as a public necessity, to be purchased + 
with public funds and to be administered in the interests of 
the broader community, one sees new justification for the 
demand that all school problems be managed with wisdom. 
This demand can be met only when school problems are 
made subjects of exhaustive scientific study. 
FiscaL PropLem TYPICAL 
The subsequent chapters will take up briefly the prob- 
lems involved in organizing a school system. The first and 
most general problem is one of securing funds for the
-P-A-G-E-57
  EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY 45 
maintenance of the schools. It will be well to reiterate the 
statement with which the first chapter began. The pupil 
seldom thinks of costs. The teacher usually overlooks the 
fact that the community is interested in what schools cost. 
Yet funds are a prime necessity in organizing a public-school 
system. We turn, accordingly, to fiscal problems as among 
the first and most concrete examples of educational problems 
which must be studied by one who would be intelligent about 
the school system. 
‘EXERCISES AND READINGS :- 
Whose duty is it to enforce school attendance in the community 
in which you live? When was the last school census taken? What 
is the ordinary ratio of school population to the total popula- 
tion? What percentage of children of high-school age are in high 
school? What percentage of eighth-grade pupils go on to high 
school? What percentage of high-school graduates go to college? 
The ordinary reader will perhaps find it difficult to get answers 
to these questions. He should make himself a student of the 
reports of the Commissioner of Education of the United States 
and of the superintendent of schools in some city which pub- 
lishes an annual report. 
From some school record find out what percentage of enrolled 
pupils attend school regularly. 
If there is a school nurse or a school physician, find out what 
time in the year is most likely to exhibit small attendance. Verify 
the finding from the school record. 
What substitutes for attendance on public schools are per- 
mitted? How many children in the town attend schools other 
than public schools, and why ?

  CHAPTER IV 
INVESTING PUBLIC MONEY IN A NEW GENERATION 
Tue Cost oF Epucatine AN INDIVIDUAL 
We all know something about how much the family in- 
vests in its sons and daughters. The provision made by the 
father for his children is recognized as an expression of 
the parent’s willingness to give to the second generation as 
good a start in life as the family can afford. We are less 
likely to realize the extent to which the community is draw- 
ing on its material resources for a similar purpose. The city 
of Chicago —to choose a single example — gives to each 
boy or girl who goes through elementary school and high 
school an aggregate of six hundred and thirty dollars. If 
a child were notified to go to the city hall when he is 
eighteen years of age and receive this sum of money, we 
should recognize what it means for a community to pay for 
the education of its new generation. We should understand 
that the children of a city are its wards. When the matter 
is obscured by the complexities of the social machinery 
through which this bonus is distributed, we lose sight of 
the magnitude and directness of public expenditures for 
education. 
The example of Chicago can be pursued even further. 
The sum stated above is too small, for it is based on the 
annual expenditures for conducting the schools; it does not 
include the large outlay for school buildings and for real 
estate which the city is called upon to make in order to pro- 
vide rooms in which the education may be given. Nor do 
the figures cover irregularities. If the pupil does not get 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
         INVESTING PUBLIC MONEY 47 
through each year’s work in regular order, the city is often 
called upon to provide more than the normal number of 
years of training. 
One further item is to be added to the calculations above 
given, in the case of those who go to the city normal college. 
For these teachers-in-training the city pays an additional two 
hundred and twenty-eight dollars a year, raising the aggre- 
gate expended on such a student to nearly eleven hundred 
dollars.1_ Such students are typical of a vast number of 
young people who are attending at public expense state 
normal schools, state universities, and public technical 
schools, Indeed, even where students attend endowed insti- 
tutions and pay tuition, the actual cost of their education is 
commonly borne in very large measure by the community, 
which in the last analysis is the source of the endowment. 
Torat Scoot ExpenpDITURES IN THE Unirep States 
Another method of presenting the facts is to deal with 
totals. The figures which represent the expenditure for 
public education in the United States are so large that the 
individual who reads them usually passes them over with 
little comprehension unless he is given some background 
for comparison. Perhaps this background can be furnished 
by recalling the statement quoted in the last chapter, where 
it was pointed out that a century ago there was practically no 
conception of the principle of free public schools. Schools 
were supported in large measure by charity or by tuition,

  48 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Most communities provided only a very short term and col- 
lected a rate bill, or personal tuition, from the pupils to sup- 
plement the small fund secured from taxation. During the 
quarter of a century before 1850 there was a widespread 
movement in the Northern states which gradually secured in 
the face of much opposition full public support for schools. 
Rate bills did not disappear entirely until 1871, the last 
state to abolish them being New Jersey, but at that date 
the principle of support through general taxation was com- — 
pletely established. 
In 1870, as we are told by the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, the total expenditures for public elementary and 
secondary schools had reached sixty-three million dollars.? 
Nineteen years later, when the population had increased 
about 60 per cent, expenditures had more than doubled, 
reaching one hundred and forty millions. Since that time 
expenditures have increased by leaps and bounds, far sur- 
passing increases in population, as indicated by the fol- 
lowing table :

These gross figures indicate a growth in schools that has 
never been paralleled in the history of any country. The 
doubling of expenditures between 1900 and 1910 is due in 
part to the rapid evolution of high schools. Elementary 
schools, however, have shared in the development. Teachers 
are more highly trained than ever before, new courses have 
been added to the curriculum, and better hygienic condi- 
tions have been provided in school buildings. There can 
be no mistaking the evidence that American communities 
are willing to support schools in a program of expansion 
and improvement. 
Cost a DETERMINING CONSIDERATION IN SCHOOL 
ORGANIZATION 
An adequate comprehension of the meaning of the sta- 
tistics of educational costs will make it impossible for the 
teacher of Latin to sit apart and say that it is not his duty 
to think of the community. The teacher of science cannot 
ask for unlimited equipment for laboratory exercises; the 
teacher of music or arithmetic cannot say that he is inter- 
ested merely in spiritual and intellectual affairs and that he 
has no reason to consider material matters. The impressive 
fact is that a great public trust has been committed to the 
hands of teachers. The community has erected schoolhouses 
and taxed itself to the point where school expenditures have 
come to be looked upon as a serious burden in many a 
section of the country. It is a professional obligation resting 
on the teacher, be he of high or low degree, to think of 
his relation to this matter of public expenditures. The pub- 
lic is likely to become more. and more insistent in the 
demand that public expenditures be absolutely purged of 
waste of any kind, either the waste that arises from extrava- 
gance-or the waste that results from inefficiency.

RELATION OF ScHooL ExPENDITURES TO OTHER PuBLIc 
EXPENSES 
There is still another way in which the facts regarding 
the magnitude of the public investment in education can be 
formulated. In 1913 the Bureau of Census secured figures 
to show what proportions of the total funds spent by cities 
are devoted to various departments, such as general govern- 
ment, police, fire, and so on. For the larger cities it appears 
that about one quarter of the public revenues go to main- 
taining schools; in cities of smaller size the fraction is 
larger, reaching in some cases nearly one half, For purposes 
of our present study a few examples will suffice. These are 
given in Table II. Two cases are exhibited in Fig. 4.

These figures show why it is that the business man and the taxpayer are addicted to criticisms of school expendi- 
tures. It is difficult for the ordinary citizen to get this great     1 Bulletin No. 126, Table II, United States Bureau of Census, 1913.

52 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
expenditure of public money out of the center of his vision. 
He can, perhaps, be interested by some enthusiast in the 
introduction of domestic science or civics or some other 
new course of study; he may even become convinced of the 
need of improvements in the equipment of school buildings ; 
but sooner or later, when the enthusiast has ceased to speak, 
the persistent fact that it costs a great share of the revenue 
of the city to conduct the schools will reassert itself as a 
dominant item in his thinking. 
Urcent DEMANDS FOR Economy AND EFFICIENCY 
In not a few cases the problem of financing schools has 
in recent years become especially acute. Communities are in 
many cases at the limit now permitted by state laws con- 
trolling the levying of taxes. The maintenance of schools 
even at their present level is very difficult, and all the time 
there is the urgent push within the system for enlargements 
and improvements, Other communities which see the rapid 
increase in school expenditures, even while they are willing 
to tax themselves more for schools, are asking for clear 
evidence that school work is being done efficiently. 
Such an attitude appears, for example, in a resolution 
passed by the citizens of Portland, Oregon, at a regular 
annual meeting of the voters held December 27, 1912: 
Whereas, the average daily attendance at the public schools of 
this district has increased from 10,387 in 1902 to 23,712 in 1912, 
and the annual disbursements have increased during the same 
period from $420,879.61 to $2,490,477-28; and whereas, it is of 
the utmost importance that the public schools should be kept at 
the highest point of efficiency, 
It is hereby declared to be the sense of this meeting that a full 
and complete survey be made of the public school system of this 
district."

by Ellwood P. Cubberley. Published by the World Book Company, 1915. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  INVESTING PUBLIC MONEY 53 
Many other examples could be given of school inquiries 
which have grown out of the demand for either better ad- 
ministration of finances or more efficient training. In 1910 
the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of New York 
ordered a survey of the schools of that city because the 
Board did not believe itself to be in possession of adequate 
information on which to base appropriations for education 
and because, to use the words of the resolution, 
It is the sense of this Board that efficient and progressive ad- 
ministration of the schools . . . is indispensable to the welfare 
and progress of the city and that generous appropriations . . . 
are desirable in so far as assurance and evidence can be given that 
such appropriations will be expended for purposes and in a 
manner to promote the efficiency and welfare of the schools and 
to increase the value and effect of the instruction given therein.! 
Such quotations show the intimate relation between 
finance and teaching, between the attitude of the com- 
munity toward expenditures and the modern demand for a 
scientifically conducted school system. 
EXPENDITURES IN RELATION TO WEALTH 
Returning to the detailed study of school finance, it may 
be laid down as a fundamental principle that in general . 
school expenditures are related to the ability of a com- 
munity to pay taxes. Taking for purposes of illustration 
the three largest cities, we find that they have different 
degrees of wealth. New York City has an average wealth 
of $1765.28 per inhabitant; Chicago has only $1604.20; 
Philadelphia, $953.65. Evidently the capacity of these 
cities for supporting schools is very different. The dif- 
ferences in wealth correspond roughly to the varying scale 
of expenditures for elementary schools in these three cities. 
1 Report of Committee on School Inquiry, p. 61. Published by the city 
of New York, 1911-1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
New York expends $45.67 per pupil; Chicago, $37.58; 
and Philadelphia, $32.22. The less wealthy cities commonly 
spend less on schools. 
There is a certain equity in the variation in expenditures 
above noted. But there are conditions under which the vari- 
ations in wealth are so great that if expenditure depended 
on the ability of a community to pay for schools, the chil- 
dren would suffer. In such cases the state must take a 
share of the costs and must, in the interests of the general 
community, pay for better schools than the city or district 
can itself afford. 
If one thinks of a mining town, for example, where the 
population is made up entirely of laborers with large families 
and where the homes are crowded together in a small area, it 
will be recognized at once that the ability to support schools 
is very different from that of a well-to-do manufacturing city 
or of a sparsely settled, fertile farming region where the 
children are few and the taxable wealth is comparatively great. 
In the case of the mining town the state must step in to 
equalize in some degree the educational opportunities of the 
children. It is not to the advantage of the state as a whole 
that the many children of that town should be seriously 
limited in their schooling, because they will in due time 
scatter to other communities, and the safety and progress of 
these other communities require that there shall be adequate 
educational opportunities in the mining town. 
This one example is enough to suggest the problems 
which arise in the study of support for schools. The sources 
of these funds and the equitable distribution of state school 
taxes constitute one of the large problems of public finance 
and call for careful scientific study. Such questions as the 
following arise and must be answered: Shall state grants 
be determined by the pupil enrollment, by the average 
attendance, by the aggregate attendance, or by the number 
of teachers employed ?

Turning to details of expenditure, we find a new set of 
problems. Perhaps the most impressive fact is that there 
is a wide discrepancy in every city between the average ex- 
penditures per pupil in elementary schools and high schools. 
Again, we may select as typical the facts for the cities re- 
ferred to in an earlier table. These average figures are less 
striking than some which could be cited. In Los Angeles, 
California, the cost per pupil in the high school, at the same 
date as that for which the figures in Table III were com- 
piled, was $285.67 as contrasted with the cost of $59.41 
per elementary pupil.

It requires very little consideration to explain why there 
is a difference between these two types of expenditures.

more consideration to justify the difference. There are some 
who hold that the elementary school is being sacrificed to the 
high school. Indeed, there are some people so extreme in 
their views that they would make all high schools tuition 
schools. They hold that Boston is in expenditures much 
less open to criticism than St. Louis. In St. Louis, on the 
other hand, it is pointed out that a most elaborate scheme 
of high schools’ has been organized with a view to providing 
every high-school student in every section of the city with 
the broadest possible opportunities. By way of further answer 
to the critics of the high school, it is asserted that the com- 
munity gets back in public service from the student who has 
taken higher courses more than such courses cost. Certain 
it is, as the figures in Table III show, that cities are making 
expenditures on a most generous scale for the maintenance 
of high schools; and the total amount of this expenditure 
is greater than the table indicates because there are large 
initial appropriations for school buildings which are not taken 
into account in these statements of current expenses. 
Costs oF DirFERENT SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION 
Pursuing the matter further, we find that there are the 
widest discrepancies in costs due to differences in the sub- 
jects taught, to differences in the number of pupils assembled 
in class, and to other less conspicuous differences, 
In order to bring out the differences between subjects in 
the same school, Professor Bobbitt has calculated the’ cost, 
per thousand student hours, of instruction in twenty-five 
medium-sized high schools, and presents in Table IV the 
median! cost of each subject. 
1The median is that figure above which and below which fall half the 
cases. It is, therefore, a suitable sample of the whole group. It is a better 
representative figure than the average.

Translating this table into the form of a series of ques- 
tions which school authorities and communities must face, 
we may ask: Is it desirable that shopwork be supplied in a 
school when it costs nearly twice as much as English? Is 
Latin enough better than modern languages to justify its 
retention in the program of a school when it costs eight 
dollars more per unit of instruction ? 
Like series of facts for the elementary schools can be 
borrowed from an unpublished study by Mr. G. Lee Fleming 
of Hibbing, Minnesota, and are reproduced in Table V. 
Certain selected facts are also exhibited in Fig. 5. The 
table shows that reading absorbs nearly two thirds of the 
expenditures of the first grade, while in the third grade 
the same subject gets a little less than one third of the ex- 
penditures, and in the sixth grade about one sixth. Opening

Costs oF CLAssES OF DIFFERENT SIZES 
A second determinant of costs is the size of the class. 
One of the simplest ways of reducing expenses is to give a 
single teacher a large number of pupils to care for. In 1916 
the superintendent of schools in St. Louis calculated that

60 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
the reduction of elementary classes in the schools of that 
city by an average of one pupil per class would cost the city 
$65,000 per year. Los Angeles and Indianapolis have small 
elementary classes, the averages being 23.7 and 24.7 mem- 
bers per.class respectively. The cost of elementary instruc- 
tion is very high, being $59.41 and $50.45 respectively. 
St. Louis and Chicago have much lower costs, namely, $37.21 
and $37.58 respectively. These low costs are secured in a 
very large measure by grouping children in large classes of 
37.6 and 40.3 average membership per class. 
SALARIES 
Teachers’ salaries differ in different cities and affect the 
problems of cost; the number of hours that teachers teach 
is another cause of variation. 
Books AND SUPPLIES 
Certain cities supply the pupils with books and materials, 
while other cities require the children to bring their supplies 
from home. In the long run, the cost falls on the com- 
munity in either case, but it is differently distributed. In 
the first case, the taxpayers pay for the supplies as they do 
for school buildings, each taxpayer contributing according 
to the assessed value of his property. In the second case, 
parents pay for supplies according to the number of their 
children and without regard to their property. 
In regard to general supplies, there are also differences 
in policy. Some cities are lavish in furnishing maps and 
reference books and specimens for nature study, while 
others are very economical in these respects, sometimes 
justifying their policy by saying that they put all they can 
afford to expend into teachers’ salaries. The question is 
thus raised: How far is it legitimate to spend moncy in 
providing material equipment, and how far should it be 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  INVESTING PUBLIC MONEY 61 
devoted to the payment of high-salaried teachers ? Is it well, 
for example, to ask a teacher of good training in geography 
to instruct a class without any wall maps? Is it economical 
to ask a teacher of history to conduct his classes without 
books of reference? Or, comparing various kinds of mate- 
rial equipment with each other, one may ask whether it 
is more essential to spend money on well-lighted, well- 
ventilated rooms that are barren of apparatus or to put up 
with old buildings and purchase laboratory equipment. 
Tue MEANING OF FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND 
EpucaTIoNnAL ACCOUNTING 
One reason why it is important that questions like those: 
in the foregoing paragraphs be explicitly formulated is that 
many citizens think of school finance as wholly distinct 
from school organization. Very often members of the board 
of education will disclaim any knowledge of the course of 
study or of the qualifications of teachers and say that it is 
their sole duty to supervise expenditures. Consideration of 
the real problems of school finance soon brings to the sur- 
face the fact that financial expenditures are merely means 
to the end of supplying adequate opportunity for all the 
children who are required by legislation to attend schools. 
School finance is one aspect of school organization. 
In recent years there has been a movement in the di- 
rection of better accounting systems which are designed to 
reveal the needs of the schools and the ways in which these 
needs are being met. The financial records of progressive 
school systems, instead of throwing together expenditures 
in general accounts, are keeping items of supervision distinct 
from items of teaching. Costs of supplies of various kinds 
are kept apart. Thus, janitors’ supplies are kept separate 
from crayon and other educational supplies. The cost of 
coal is used as a means of checking the efficiency of janitors, 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The Bureau of Education of the United States has pre- 
pared bookkeeping forms, and a number of school systems 
are keeping uniform records of expenditures. This will 
greatly facilitate comparisons and scientific studies in the 
future and will help to make school finance more than a 
mere haphazard distribution of public money. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
What would it cost to supply all the members of a college class 
with free textbooks? Would it be equally just to supply a college 
class with notebooks? with writing paper? 
Why is a laboratory fee charged in certain courses? Is a labo- 
ratory fee just in a class in physics? in chemistry? in drawing ? 
In case a boy is going to become a plumber, is the public under 
any obligation to train him so that he will become an expert? 
How about a doctor? What steps does the public take to insure 
efficiency in teachers? in railroad engineers? in mail clerks ? 
What are the state laws with regard to the amount of tax that 
may be levied for schools? Are upper limits really necessary ? 
A certain town is about to build a new schoolhouse. The build- 
ing will cost in the aggregate about $30,000. If the building is 
provided with a sightly lawn in front and with an ornamental 
pattern in the brick, it will cost $400 more than if it is perfectly 
plain and the yard is made of gravel. If the corridor is made six- 
teen feet wide rather than twelve, the cost will be $400 greater.

     CHAPTER V 
DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARRYING 
ON SCHOOLS 
Crass INSTRUCTION GIVEN OVER TO THE TEACHER 
Although the community as a whole recognizes the need 
of education, and is willing to supply the necessary financial 
support, it cannot manage directly the details of school 
operation, The community cannot decide what seven-year- 
old children shall study. The community cannot decide 
what ought to be done with a disorderly pupil. It becomes 
necessary, therefore, for the community to devise some 
method of picking out suitable representatives who can 
carry on the schools, 
The first task to be thus delegated was that of class- 
room instruction, One reads in the records of the early 
town meetings of New England how the whole community 
participated in the discussion of all financial matters and 
of many problems connected with the course of study. For 
example, the site of a schoolhouse, its cost, and its plan 
have always been subjects of community discussion. Again, 
the community has often decided whether it wants geog- 
raphy taught or certain branches of mathematics. But when 
it came to the daily routine of school work, the community 
employed a teacher and turned the children over to him. 
SUPERVISION 
The next stage of representative control was reached 
when the community came to a recognition of the neces- 
sity of some kind of intelligent supervision of teachers, 
63     
-P-A-G-E-76
64 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Visiting committees were appointed, usually including the 
clergyman of the town, to look into the work of the classes 
and report to the town meeting. 
So long as communities were small and fairly homogene- 
ous in their social and intellectual characteristics it remained 
possible to get on with direct town-meeting control of the 
schools in all except the details of teaching classes and the 
supervision of teachers. One reads, to be sure, of disagree- 
ments at times between the town meeting and the teacher. 
The visiting committee and the teacher sometimes had a 
clash, and the supporters of each presented their views with 
vigor before the whole community. Problems of organiza- 
tion and administration were not lacking even in those 
simpler days, but the machinery of school management was 
fairly direct and simple. 
Sxercn or DEVELOPMENT OF A ScHoot SysTEM 
How this direct control of schools became impossible 
with the growth of communities can be illustrated by a 
single example. In the city of Chicago in its early years 
the schools were independent of each other. Indeed, in the 
first years immediately after the incorporation of the town, 
the schools were private schools to which the taxpayers 
paid a stipulated sum out of the proceeds of the sale of 
school lands or out of district levies. The variable character 
of the teaching which was secured under this plan led to 
the adoption in 1835 of a partially centralized system of 
inspection and management. The districts were left inde- 
pendent in all financial matters, but a central board of in- 
spectors was provided which was to unify the schools of 
the town. This central board was continued after the incor- 
poration of the city, in 1837, but the districts were left in- 
dependent in financial matters even after that date. The 
districts voted on the amount to be paid to teachers, on the 
housing of the schools, and on other matters relating to 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY 65 
taxes. There were district committees to care for these 
local financial matters. 
Even though the city government was centralized by the 
incorporation of 1837, the schools remained distinct. The 
central board of inspectors adopted certain textbooks, but 
it appears that the schools paid little attention to this action. 
How meager was the district provision for schools appears 
in the fact that it was not until 1845 that the first public- 
school building was erected. 
It is not difficult to imagine the chaos under which such 
a system suffered. In 1851 the city council took away 
from the districts the power of hiring teachers and gave it 
to the central board of inspectors. It also appointed a 
business manager. The board of inspectors thus gained in 
power and influence, but they found themselves confronted 
by educational problems which they could not solve. In 
1853 they adopted the plan which was relatively new in 
American cities, but was coming into vogue, of appointing 
a superintendent of schools, This officer at once graded 
the children, organized a uniform course of study, and took 
steps to equalize instruction in the schools of the city. 
Tur Community SLow TO DELEGATE SCHOOL CONTROL 
The historical sketch outlined above gives us a clear in- 
sight into the way in which problems of school organization 
arise. The community must delegate the work of carrying 
on schools. There is a natural hesitation in intrusting this 
important work to anyone. Asa result, the community is con- 
stantly taking a hand, even in these latter days, in all kinds 
of school discussions. Sometimes the whole city is drawn into 
a discussion of school matters. Sometimes the individual 
parent, in his capacity as a citizen, attempts to take into 
his hands the authority of the community, especially when 
the way in which the schools are being managed seems to 
him to be unfavorable to the interests of his children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Limits oF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY NOT CLEAR 
The various officials who are created in the process of 
developing a representative system of school control often 
find themselves unable to determine the limits of their 
authority or responsibility. For example, it is almost im- 
possible to determine where the duties of a business man- 
ager end and the functions of the superintendent begin. 
Thus, when it comes to the employment of teachers and 
the determination of salaries, the question arises whether 
these matters should be settled on educational grounds or 
on financial grounds, or on both. 
Especially acute is the problem of determining the proper 
relation of the board of inspectors to the teachers and 
superintendent. The inspectors, or the board of education 
as they have come to be called, are chosen as the imme- 
diate representatives of the community. They are citizens in 
whom the community has general confidence, but they are 
not charged, as was pointed out above, with the daily tasks of 
teaching. The board must accordingly appoint teachers and 
a superintendent. These latter are selected because they 
have training and technical qualifications which the com- 
munity needs in the schools. The technical officers have in 
an important sense an independent place in the educational 
system. It will be remembered that the teacher was the 
first one to whom the community delegated responsibility 
for the schools. Not infrequently the community finds its 
board of representative citizens on one side of a school 
issue and its technical officers on the other side. 
Take a commonplace example. In the development of 
the course of study it has come to pass that many new sub- 
jects have been introduced which cost a great deal. Manual 
training and domestic science, as was shown in the last 
chapter, are expensive. Superintendents and teachers are 
enthusiastic about the educational value of these subjects.
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY 67 
Sometimes the board of education has to curtail the expend- 
itures involved because the community does not seem to be 
prepared to pay the price. If the board is supreme and the 
superintendent is its servant, how can a campaign of ex- 
planation be organized which will show the community 
what is needed? On the other hand, if the superintendent 
is at liberty to go directly to the community without the 
consent or sympathy of the board, complications arise which 
are not difficult to imagine. 
STATEMENT By A PuBLic EpucaTIon ASSOCIATION 
A series of difficulties in the administration of the 
schools of Chicago brought out from the Public Education 
Association of that city a statement of the relation between 
the board of education and the technical officers of the schools 
which illustrates so clearly the matters discussed in the fore- 
going paragraphs that it may properly be quoted at length. 
WHAT IS A REPRESENTATIVE BOARD OF EDUCATION? 
Some people want the school board to be large, so that every- 
one may be represented. They think that it is desirable that there 
should be members on the board from every district in the city, 
every nationality, the various trades, and the various professions. 
A board cannot be made into a representative body in this 
sense, It would never be large enough to include everybody, and 
it would be unwieldy in action. What is needed is a small board 
that will be broad in its interests, that will ask many questions 
covering all sections of the city, and that can act promptly. This 
board should have laid before it carefully drawn plans touching all 
the interests of the community. 
This small board has to decide general policies and select the 
people to carry out these policies. It should not operate the 
schools but should see that they are operated. It should require 
evidence from the people who operate the schools showing that 
they are doing it successfully. It should demand and issue reports 
that are clear and intelligible to the whole community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
THE FUNCTIONS OF A BOARD OF EDUCATION 
The functions of the board of education have never been fully 
understood in American cities because it has been thought of as 
the means employed by the people to conduct the schools. This is 
a wrong notion, The people want trained teachers and trained 
officers to conduct the schools. The people want the board of 
education to organize the schools so that they shall employ the 
most expert people who can be secured. 
HOW A GOOD BOARD GETS THE WORK DONE 
This statement leads to a consideration of the second group of 
people who have to do with the school organization. The schools 
could not get on without trained teachers. There was a time when 
each parent taught his own child. That was in the days when 
there was n’t much to teach. To-day the parent places his child in 
the care of a specialist. The parent has come. to the specialist 
because the parent has confidence that the specialist knows how 
to take care of the children. Teachers are not mere hirelings and 
nurses, inferior to the children; teachers are trained specialists. 
As the system grows more complex there appear several classes 
of specialists — some who know how to deal with the pupils, some 
who know how to provide the children with proper seats and 
proper ventilation, some who know how to make courses of study, 
and some who keep the records of the schools. 
Furthermore, the school system grows complicated on the 
material side, Buildings have to be erected and cared for. Land 
has to be evaluated and cared for. Some people think that all this 
is an open book to everyone who is in business. The fact is 
that knowledge of school equipment is just as highly specialized 
knowledge as knowledge of railroad equipment. A wholesale 
grocer would not think of himself as competent to estimate the 
cost of Pullman cars just because he knows about business. The 
better school systems now have accounting methods in schools 
which bring out such matters as the cost per unit of teaching in 
high schools and elementary schools, the standard cost of instruc- 
tion in different subjects, and the cost of school equipments as 
related to their sanitary and hygienic fitness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
    DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY 69 
Every complete school system has its business interests in the 
hands of competent specialists who know about school costs in 
detail and in particular. 
MAKING THE MACHINE WORK SMOOTHLY 
By the time a school system reaches the point where it has all 
these: specialists, it becomes necessary to give much attention to 
the central planning of a scheme of operation which shall make 
the whole machine work smoothly. There must be a central office 
where management is provided. In setting up this central office 
there has been a great deal of experimenting. Sometimes a teacher 
has been put in charge; sometimes a board member, in such case 
the president of the board has taken charge. Some years ago 
the city of Cleveland tried the experiment of putting a business 
manager in charge. ‘This business manager appointed the super- 
intendent of instruction. If one goes back into the history of 
Chicago, he finds that a business manager to take charge of 
scliool lands was appointed two years before the superintendent 
of instruction was appointed, 
Gradually out of all the experimenting there has arisen a new type of school officer, a superintendent of schools who is a trained 
school manager. This manager does not teach; he does not shovel 
coal into the furnaces in the schools; he does exactly what the 
head of any great corporation does; he organizes the undertaking. 
He must know human nature; he must know how to get reports ; he must know how to tell the people about the needs of their schools; he must know how to straighten out tangles; and he must know how to judge results. This manager must give his whole time to getting the machinery to work and keeping it in order. In a large school system the manager’s office will be subdivided and there will need to be some further organization to keep it from falling apart. There will be one person in such an office who will know more about heating school buildings and one who will know about the quality of teaching. The more the subdivision the more precautions necessary to hold all parts of the system together.!

  70 ‘THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF SUPERINTENDENTS 
Another recent document which throws much light on 
the problem of the relation between school officers is a 
report presented to the Department of Superintendence, 
a division of the National Education Association. This 
report opens with extracts from a number of letters from 
superintendents in all parts of the country. The discussion 
then proceeds as follows : 
OBSOLETE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM 
The impression which a careful study of this material [referring 
to the material upon which the report is based] makes on one’s 
mind is the painful one that most administrative situations are 
undefined and shifting. Schools are administered, sometimes well, 
sometimes badly, but in most cases without clear definition of 
responsibility or authority. Public interests are fortunately pro- 
tected in most instances, but the machinery is the primitive 
machinery of the vigilance committee, with now the super- 
intendent, now the board of education, now the city council, now 
a parents’ association, trying to determine what steps shall be 
taken to promote public welfare. 
STATUS OF SUPERINTENDENCY VARIES 
In such a situation the accidents of personal influence play an 
unjustifiable part. Several of the letters from successful super- 
intendents state explicitly or show between the lines that they are 
entirely in control of the policies of the schools. Some go so far 
as to say that any effort to define the responsibilities and authority 
of the superintendent would curtail their influence and would there- 
fore be undesirable. At the other end of the scale are reports 
which show that the superintendent is shorn of dll influence. In 
many cases he is little more than a clerk, dependent from day to 
day on the accidents of the board’s attitude for the meager author- 
ity which he tries to exercise. In some cases he goes to the board 
meeting only when especially invited. He has teachers sent to 
him by the board, and he knows nothing about the financial
-P-A-G-E-83
    DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY 71 
management of the system. Such a superintendent usually recom- 
mends the adoption of a state law endowing his office with rights. 
The extreme situations referred to above may occur within a 
single state, showing that there is no such thing as a typical and 
clearly defined American school administration. 
DISTRICT CONTROL DISCARDED SYSTEM OF SCHOOL 
ADMINISTRATION 
The origin of the present situation is not far to seek. American 
schools were first controlled by the citizens of the district. They 
met in intimate neighborhood groups and settled the problems 
relating to their children. Communities were fairly homogeneous, 
the course of study was simple, school buildings were all about 
equally unsanitary, and teachers were equally untrained. A ma- 
jority vote was a democratic and accepted method of carrying 
the community through these undesirables. 
AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE TO BE DISCOVERED 
Within a half century all this has changed. We know to-day that 
every center ina state is involved in the behavior of each of its 
communities. Indeed, our generation is witnessing the assumption 
by the federal government of an influence and authority in educa- 
tion which is without precedent in American history. This is not 
the place to comment at length on these changes, but one result 
is absolutely certain — the simple district control of schools is gone. 
It remains for us to decide what we shall have in its place. What 
we have to-day is a series of experiments of every variety that can 
be set up through the exercise of human imagination. Most of 
these experiments are going on behind closed doors. Most of them 
involve sooner or later a conflict of authority. Very few of them are 
understood by the people of the communities in which they exist. 
DANGERS OF THIS PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT 
The result is, first, much clumsy administration, even where 
everybody acts in the spirit of most cordial codperation. Matters 
of vital importance to the school are delayed. Secondly, baneful 
agencies, seeking to profit unjustly, can set up in the school

system influences which would have no weight if there were clear 
and definite responsibility and authority. Thirdly, the people of the 
community, being uncertain about what is going on, often become 
restless and critical and unwilling to give adequate support to the 
schools. Fourthly, the teaching staff sometimes becomes demoral- 
ized and relatively inefficient, at times the disorganization goes so 
far that teachers are actually and openly antagonistic to the board 
or superintendent, or both." 
ORGANIZATION UNDER SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES 
It is by no means simple to prescribe a remedy for the 
difficulties which these quotations have described. When 
a democratic community delegates its unlimited powers to 
a number of different classes of people, there is sure to be a 
succession of problems of adjustment. Ultimately all parties 
will come to recognize ‘the fact that educational problems 
can be solved only when a full study of the situation is sub- 
stituted for personal opinion. Every party will have to be 
ready to acknowledge the supremacy of a thorough scientific 
statement of the conditions and results of school work. 
Fortunately, examples are not far to seek of school admin- 
istration which is based on scientific study. Two conspicuous 
examples will serve the purposes of this exposition. 
ContTRoL oF Scuoot Work THROUGH TESTS 
In the city of Detroit there has been carried on for the 
last three years a systematic series of tests in the funda- 
mental school subjects. The teachers-in-training in the city 
normal school are given courses in tests and in the inter- 
pretation of results so that they carry into the school from 
year to year the type of preparation which makes them 
intelligent and sympathetic from the first.

  DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY 73 
At first some unhappy results followed the wholesale meas- 
urement of results. Many of the teachers thought that the 
method was arbitrary and that their work would be misrep- 
resented. Even the good teachers were afraid. They had 
been accustomed to the purely personal type of supervision 
based on opinion and answerable, when occasion demanded, 
by opinion. The teachers who were not sure of the success 
of their work were violent in their objections. The Board 
of Education, which at the beginning of the testing was 
composed of some of the cheapest politicians in the city, 
led the attack on what they termed a fad and a theory. 
Experience has, however, justified in fullest measure super- 
vision by a measurement of results. It has become increas- 
ingly clear to all teachers that tests show clearly where the 
work is strong and where it is weak. Not only so, but the 
tests help the teacher to determine with precision the exact 
points where the results need to be improved. 
Above and beyond this, however, is the advantage which 
has come to the schools in their relation to the community. 
No longer is it necessary for teachers to speak in uncertain 
terms of their work. If the community will listen, it is 
possible for the Detroit school officials to make clear by 
scientific reports based on tests exactly what is going on 
in every school and in every grade. 
The community showed its appreciation of the type of 
school management which was intelligent enough to base 
itself on exact studies of results by doing away absolutely 
with the corrupt and inefficient board and electing in its 
place a group of thoroughly representative citizens who are 
supporting scientific management and developing the schools 
along lines dictated by such management. 
The example of Detroit is by no means the only one 
which could be cited. An increasing number of cities are 
revising their courses, training their teachers, and educating 
the communities by similar methods.

74. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
A Stupy oF THE Burtpinc NEeEps oF a City 
One other example must suffice for the present, since the 
subsequent chapters of this book are devoted to the treat- 
ment in outline of the various types of scientific inquiry 
which ought to govern school organization. This example 
is borrowed from a report prepared in 1916 by the superin- 
tendent of schools of the city of Minneapolis. 
In a pamphlet entitled “A Million a Year” there is laid 
before the citizens of Minneapolis a clear statement, first, of 
what they had been doing in the way of erecting school 
buildings for the seven years preceding the report. The 
report then shows in detail what buildings cost, through a 
careful analysis of the records for earlier buildings. Then 
come statements of the uses of schools and the conditions 
which determine the kind of building which should be put 
up in each section of the city. Estimates are given in great 
detail of the needs for five years, and the city is asked to 
act on the situation as thus described. 
The spirit of the study can be clearly seen from the 
introduction, which is worth repeating in full. 
Why a five-year school building program? The reasons are: 
that the Board of Education may be able to calculate for some 
time ahead the financial resources available to meet building needs 
as these develop ; that the numerous children of those sections of 
the city whose citizenry may not be over-insistent and persistent in 
their demands for improved and enlarged school accommodations 
may be as well provided as the children of other sections whose 
needs, real or fancied, are vigorously and incessantly pushed; in short, 
that there may be established and carried out a deliberately formu- 
lated, comprehensive and consistent policy of providing adequate 
and equitable building accommodations for all children of the city. 
The program, as herein outlined, is the result of nearly a year’s 
study by the Board of Education, by a special committee of the 
Board, and by the executive officers of the Board. 
In making this study and in formulating this program, the Board 
has invited and has received the suggestions and the codperation
-P-A-G-E-87
    DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY VAS 
of Parents and Teachers’ Associations throughout the city. Two 
public hearings on the subject were given, to which each of the 
sixty-two associations was invited to send representatives. Each 
association was also invited to submit in writing the needs of the 
district represented as it saw them. 
A generous, indeed an almost unanimous, response was received 
to both these invitations. The educational policies involved in the 
program have been discussed by the principals of the schools and 
by the Educational Council. It has been the effort of the Board 
throughout to enlist the thoughtful help of those chiefly and most 
immediately concerned. 
The program is published now in order to give still wider pub- 
licity to the interests it represents. It is still a tentative program, 
subject to such modifications as may result from further study 
by the Board and from suggestions and criticisms that may come 
from any one interested, whether individual citizen or organization. 
Such suggestions and criticisms the Board invites. 
This program, modified as it may be, will be made the basis of 
necessary legislation, which is to be the first step in carrying it out. 
Such legislation, to provide the necessary funds, whether by bond 
issue or special tax levy, will be sought of the next Legislature. 
The people of Minneapolis should understand clearly that the Board 
of Education has no means whatever of carrying into effect this, or 
any other, building program, for the Board has no power to raise one 
cent of money, either by bond issue or through tax levy. The State 
Legislature only has power to authorize bond issues and tax levies ; 
on the authorization of the State Legislature, only the City Council 
may sell bonds. On recommendation of the Board of Tax Levy, the 
Board of Education may levy taxes within the maximum approved. 
The Board of Education, representing the people of the city in 
their educational interests, is formulating this building program. 
If this program meets the approval of the people, the Board of 
Education will be pleased to carry it into effect. Before the Board 
can do this, however, the people, through their representatives in 
the Legislature, in the Board of Tax Levy, and in the City Council, 
must provide the necessary funds.*

THE Errors or DrEMocrACY 
The funds asked for were voted by the people. It would 
not be a complete statement of the facts, however, to omit 
the statement that an unfavorable reaction came in the form 
of a new board of education which at once began to blockade 
the kind of policy represented by this study. 
American cities proceed slowly to a full realization of the 
possibilities of a satisfactory school organization. Democracy 
always masters its problems slowly and after many slips. 
The hopeful fact is that more communities are providing 
agencies for the scientific study of their school problems 
and are following in their organization the results of such 
study. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
In most communities there arise, from time to time, demands 
for new school legislation, or there occur controversies within the 
board of education or with regard to the superintendent of schools 
and his authority. As a practical lesson in democratic government 
the study of the changes that occur at such a time is very informing. 
If there is no such exceptionally clear exhibition of the complex- 
ity of our public-school government, let the student find out what 
are the personal and professional characteristics of some board of 
education. 
Would it be better, in some city known to the student, to elect 
a board or to have it appointed? Is a definition by law of the 
rights and duties of a superintendent advantageous, or should 
the superintendent acquire all the power and influence he can get 
from the board? Should a board of education examine textbooks ? 
Should it determine the scale of salaries to be paid to teachers ? 
If a class does very poorly in a test in arithmetic, what are some 
of the different interpretations that can be put on this fact? Is 
the superintendent responsible, or the teacher, or the home? 
Our American cities change teachers and superintendents fre- 
quently. What are the elements of cost which enter into such 
a change?

  CHAPTER VI 
THE SCHOOL BUILDING 
Tue BuILpING AS AN EvIDENCE oF A CoMMUNITY’S 
EpucaTIONAL VIEWS 
A study of school buildings furnishes in very concrete 
form evidence of the new spirit which has come into school 
organization. The old-fashioned school building was copied 
from the church. In its externals it often showed its ante- 
cedents by the tower and steeple, which sometimes housed 
the bell and sometimes served merely as an ornament. In 
its interior there was little or no evidence of careful adapta- 
tion of the space to its uses. Small windows, high from the 
floor and narrow in the space admitting light, were scattered 
along three sides of the room. Across the fourth side of 
the room was a raised platform for the teacher. The roof 
was high and made the space below difficult to heat. A stove 
was the means of heating; it gave out an excess of heat 
to the immediate neighborhood and proved inadequate for 
making the remote corners habitable. The seats were narrow 
benches, often without backs. In the schools of earlier days 
these benches ran around the room, the pupils facing the 
wall, to which was fastened a board that served as a desk on 
which the pupil might write or lay his book. In later schools 
the benches were arranged in rows, the desk of one row eco- 
- nomically furnishing a back for the bench in front. Add to 
all this a common drinking cup in a pail of water and sani- 
tary arrangements of the most primitive type, and we have a 
picture of almost complete disregard for human comfort and 
hygiene. More than this, we see in such a school building 
78
-P-A-G-E-91
THE SCHOOL BUILDING 79 
the clearest evidence of a conception of education which 
was limited to the barest rudiments. There was no provision 
for varied activities in a school building of the older type. 
Kitchens in which the girls learn to cook, shops for the 
boys, laboratories for courses in science, playrooms and 
libraries, to say nothing of swimming pools and baths, 
were never thought of, be- 
cause the course of study 
was limited strictly to the 
three R’s. 
The modern school 
building is the embodi- 
ment of a wholly new 
conception of education. ee ee

structed with the utmost 
deference to the demands

of windows, the means of 
heating and ventilating, 
the style and arrangement 
of seats, have all been 
considered in every pos- 
sible detail. When the 
demands of hygiene have 
been met, the various 
needs of the school are 
studied, and the rooms 
and equipment are arranged with the fullest possible regard 
for an enriched course of study. The exterior of the build- 
ing reflects the interest of the community in esthetics. It 
is commonly surrounded by an ample p layground and often 
has a garden as well. These changes from the barren build- 
ings of earlier days show that education is thought of as 
related to the common life of children.

 The.evolution is even more impressive when it appears in 
the many-roomed schoolhouses of a city system. The fol- 
lowing paragraphs and figures from the Cleveland survey 
show how complete has been the transformation of a half 
century : 
The type of building erected during the 50’s is well represented by the Alabama School, although this particular building was not completed until 1861. Several buildings of this general type are still in use in the city... . In these early buildings the rooms were large and accommodated enormous numbers of children. Classes ranged from roo to 200 in each room. There was hardly a square foot of waste space in these buildings. Originally they
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
contained no corridors, no wardrobes, no toilets, no storerooms, no 
running water, and no heating plants except stoves.’ [Figs. 9 A 
and 9 B.] 
The Empire School, completed in the fall of 1915, represents 
the most modern type of school architecture. It is entirely fire- 
proof and so constructed that new wings may be added for future 
extensions without injuring either the utility or the symmetry of 
the building. In appearance these newest buildings are great 
improvements over their immediate predecessors and educationally 
they are far superior. The windows are banked in sets of five and 
the masonry is so shaped as to cut off a minimum of light. Audi- 
toriums have slanted floors like theaters, are unobstructed by 
pillars, and have real stages instead of platforms. 
Gymnasiums for boys and for girls, swimming pool, playrooms, 
toilets, shower baths, auditorium, library, shops, and domestic 
science rooms can all be shut off from the rest of the building so 
that they ¢an be conveniently used for social and community 
center purposes. In these schools mouldings are done away with, 
doors have no paneling, corners of floors and ceilings are smooth 
and rounded, stairways have solid balustrades, and every endeavor 
is made to leave dust and dirt no lodging place. Piping for vacuum 
cleaning, and the most modern heating, ventilating, and regulating 
apparatus are installed.* [Figs. 10 A and 10 B.]

A similar lesson may be drawn from the study of high- 
schoot buildings of successive generations. The following 
quotation from the Denver survey shows how limited was 
the earlier conception of the school and its doings. 
The course of study in this school [the East Side High School] 
was from the first a rigorous, disciplinary course, dominated by 
literary and classical interests. The issue between science and the

classics was clearly drawn even in the early years of the East Side 
High School's history, but the victory has always been with the 
literary subjects. . . . 
The kind of a course of study which was thought of as necessary 
in those early days reflected itself in the kind of a building which 
was erected. The East Side High School building was, in its day,

                                                THE SCHOOL BUILDING 85 
a conspicuous model of high-school architecture. The high ceilings and great corridors and large classrooms showed the generous intention of the citizens of Denver. There were, however, no gymnasium, no lunch room, no shop for manual training, and no special equipments for science courses. In short, the East Side High School stands as a conservative example of a school, strong in its early days, but unable in these days to take on the progres- sive features of a first-class high school because of physical limita- tions and because of the hampering traditions which come from a successful past.! 
Tue Hycrenr or Licutine 
Lest the individual teacher should regard these matters of architecture as very remote from his or her personal interests, let us comment on the evil effects of neglect of some of the hygienic problems which the modern school is designed to solve. : ; When light is badly distributed, there is a strain on the eyes which results in unfavorable physiological conditions, These unfavorable conditions sonietimes take the form of a congestion of the blood vessels in and around the eye, with consequent feelings of discomfort and inability to work, These unfavorable results may appear both in pupils and in the teacher. The conditions are not clearly recognizable through any signs of fatigue which the person affected can readily localize, for we have no sense organ giving direct sensations of fatigue. The result is that the person is unable to do his work, but does not know, unless he has made a special study of the problem, what the difficulty is or how to remedy it. Evidently the’ problem of lighting cannot be left to natural judgment, and every physical appliance for proper control and distribution of illumination should be provided,

86 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Tur Hycienz OF VENTILATION AND HEATING 
In regard to ventilation and heating the situation is 
much the same as with lighting. Until recently all public 
buildings were without special provisions for ventilation, it 
being assumed that enough air would come in through doors 
and windows. The private dwelling was the model followed 
in this matter. A dwelling occupied by a few people leaks 
enough fresh air so that even when all the windows are 
closed the air is tolerable. When fifty or a hundred people 
in a public building are crowded into a space that is propor- 
tionately much smaller than the space in a dwelling and 
when, furthermore, through improvements in methods of 
construction the leakage of fresh air is almost entirely 
stopped, the situation calls for artificial means of introduc- 
ing air and distributing it. The situation with regard to 
fresh air is complicated in all colder climates by the ne- 
cessity of producing and conserving artificial heat. Modern 
heating arrangements are capable of maintaining large 
buildings at a summer temperature even in the coldest 
weather, but in order to do this at reasonable cost the 
building must be made as nearly air-tight as possible. The 
temperatures secured through artificial-heating plants have 
also brought another evil. The air raised to a high tempera- 
ture is abnormal in humidity because it is taken from out- 
doors, where it is cold and the humidity is low, and is raised 
by heating to a condition where it can absorb a great quan- 
tity of moisture. Such air is very dry and takes moisture in 
an excessive degree from the moist linings of the human 
respiratory tracts and thus irritates and fatigues the people 
exposed to the dry air, becoming a serious menace to com- 
fort and even to health, To meet these difficulties it has 
been necessary to introduce into all public buildings artificial 
ventilating and humidifying systems. Even in one-room 
rural schools, where the simpler types of architecture must 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
       THE SCHOOL BUILDING 87 
still be adhered to, it is common, as pointed out above, to 
jacket the stove, thus making it possible to circulate fresh 
air and to introduce an evaporation reservoir which will 
render the humidity more nearly normal. Above all it is 
important that teachers understand that these matters can- 
not be left to mere chance. Life indoors is artificial at best, 
and its conditions must be guarded as carefully as possible. 
Hycientc Equipment 
Not merely has the plan of the building been improved, 
but the equipment has also been thoroughly worked over. Drinking fountains or individual drinking cups have taken 
the place of the pail and the common dipper. Toilets have 
been furnished in a way which makes it possible to keep 
them clean and wholesome, 
The matter of seats may be discussed from both points 
of view suggested in earlier paragraphs, that is, from the 
point of view of attention to the health and comfort of 
pupils and from the point of view of the work which pupils have to do in school. The old uncomfortable benches have 
given place to comfortable individual seats which, in the best- equipped schools, have been made adjustable so that they fit the individual pupil. Where this complete adjustment to 
individual size is not provided, at least an approximation is secured by seats of two or three heights in each room, Desks with broad, smooth, sloping tops have been added to make writing and other kinds of school work easy. The ‘most recent improvements have to do with the storage of books and materials. Formerly the pupil’s knees were wedged below the storage drawer, or the working top of the desk was inconveniently or unhygienically high. The storage drawer is now being relegated to a position under the chair or to a locker on the side of the room. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
88 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
RELATION OF EQUIPMENT TO THE COURSE OF STUDY 
The adaptation of the desk to the pupil’s work has been 
carried to the full limit in the shops and drawing rooms 
and domestic-science laboratories where work benches and 
laboratory equipment have been substituted for the conven- 
tional seats. That much remains to be accomplished is vividly 
set forth in the following extract from the writing of one of 
the most suggestive critics of the present-day school. In 
the second chapter of “‘ The School and Society” Professor 
Dewey writes : : 
Some few years ago I was looking about the school supply 
stores in the city, trying to find desks and chairs which seemed 
thoroughly suitable from all points of view — artistic, hygienic, and 
educational — to the needs of the children. We had a good deal of 
difficulty in finding what we needed, and finally one dealer, more 
intelligent than the rest, made this remark : *T am afraid we have 
not what you want. You want something at which the children 
may work; these are all for listening.” That tells the story of the 
traditional education. Just as the biologist can take a bone or two 
and reconstruct the whole animal, so, if we put before the mind’s 
eye the ordinary schoolroom, with its rows of ugly desks placed in 
geometrical order, crowded together so that there shall be as little 
moving room as possible, desks almost all of the same size, with 
just space enough to hold books, pencils and paper, and add a 
table, some chairs, the bare walls, and possibly a few pictures, we 
can reconstruct the only educational activity that can possibly go 
on in such a place. It is all made “for listening ” — for simply 
studying lessons out of a book is only another kind of listening ; it 
marks the dependency of one mind upon another. The attitude of 
listening means, comparatively speaking, passivity, absorption ; 
that the‘e are certain ready-made materials which are there, which 
have been prepared by the school superintendent, the board, the 
teacher, and of which the child is to take in as much as possible in 
the least possible time. 
There is very little place in the traditional schoolroom for the 
child to work. The workshop, the laboratory, the materials, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
  THE SCHOOL BUILDING 89 
tools with which the child may construct, create, and actively in- 
quire, and even the requisite space, have been for the most part 
lacking. ‘The things that have to do with these processes have not 
even a definitely recognized place in education. They are what the 
educational authorities who write editorials in the daily papers 
generally term “fads” and “frills.” A lady told me yesterday 
that she had been visiting different schools trying to find one 
where activity on the part of the children preceded the giving of 
information on the part of the teacher, or where the children had 
some motive for demanding the information. She visited, she said, 
twenty-four different schools before she found her first instance. 
These paragraphs serve to indicate the close relation 
between school equipment and the course of study. Since 
the above criticism was written, general conditions have 
undergone a radical change. Shops have become common, 
and there is an increasing emphasis on activities. Corre- 
spondingly, there is a change in the conception of the 
course of study, as we shall see in later chapters. 
MopeErn ScHooLt ConsTRUCTION AND Costs 
In the meantime the erection of buildings with shops, 
auditoriums, laboratories, kitchens, and gymnasiums has 
given rise to new and urgent problems. First, the cost of 
these new buildings is great, and many school boards are 
driven to ask whether the community can afford to erect 
them. The superintendent of schools of New York City 
recently reported to the Board of Education of that city 
that a building program would have to be adopted which 
would cost the city $40,000,000 in a period of five years. 
In order to provide buildings many cities have been obliged 
to issue bonds which will fall, in the years to come, as a 
financial burden on the generation which is being educated 
in the buildings.

Chicago Press, 1907. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The urgency of these financial problems is aggravated by 
the fact that in many school systems the elaborate buildings 
are not used to the full extent of their capacity. Indeed, it 
comes to be a most interesting economic and educational 
problem to inquire what is the capacity of one of these build- 
ings. For example, what does an auditorium represent in 
the way of actual enlargement of the school plant? Is it 
merely a place in which the school may come together for 
a general exercise once a week, or should it be used every 
day? If it is used for twenty minutes or half an hour 
every morning, should it be closed during the remainder of 
the day? Asa matter of public economy should it be made 
available to adults at hours when it is not needed for school 
purposes, as, for example, in the evening or in the late 
afternoon ? 
Such questions as the foregoing multiply with every new 
addition to the buildings. The old buildings equipped only 
for study and recitations were economical in the extreme ; 
the new buildings are often lavish. 
Tue Gary PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTING PUPILS AND 
ENLARGING THE SCOPE OF ScHooL Work 
To meet the problems of economy and of adaptation of 
buildings to ediicational needs, ingenious ways of rotating 
classes have been devised. The most conspicuous experi- 
ment of this type is that worked out by Superintendent 
Wirt in Gary, Indiana. Indeed, Superintendent Wirt has 
advocated the most elaborate extension of the school build- 
ing and its grounds and a corresponding expansion of the 
school program. For him the school playground becomes 
an additional space of great importance in rotating the 
pupils. Shops and laboratories are to be kept full all day 
and even in the evening ; corridors are to be used as assem- 
bly rooms and recreational spaces. He goes so far as to 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
    THE SCHOOL BUILDING 91 
draw the churches and the public library into his plan. 
With all these available places in which pupils may be 
instructed, a program is adopted which provides that each 
room with its special teacher be continuously engaged in 
some kind of teaching. Pupils are sent from room to room, 
the theory being that each room shall be kept full at all 
hours and that each pupil shall get all the different kinds of 
advantages which the elaborate course of study offers. The 
reorganization of grade work which is necessary to carry 
out this program reaches deeper than the addition of new 
subjects. To make rotation complete, each teacher must be 
a special teacher and the pupils must move from room to 
room. Even the lowest grades must be organized under 
what is known as the departmental plan. Thus, even a 
second-grade child gets his reading with one teacher and 
his arithmetic with another. 
REQUIREMENTS TO BE MET WHEN THE GARY PLAN 
IS ADOPTED 
The Gary plan is a very striking example of the relation 
between the school plant and the school program. In many 
quarters this relation has not been clearly recognized. For 
example, some school boards, hearing that twice as many 
pupils can be accommodated in a Gary building as in an 
ordinary school building, have instructed the superintendents 
in their own towns to adopt the Gary plan. The superin- 
tendent has to answer: We have an old four-square build- 
ing which is full in every available corner, there are no 
shops, and the play space is inadequate. 
He often has to go further and question the advisability 
of departmentalizing the teaching in the lower grades. He 
is sometimes convinced that a daily program which includes 
many kinds of activity is distracting and undesirable. The 
adoption of a new building plan involves the course of study, 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
and the adoption of a new policy with reference to the 
course of study involves the use of the building. The inter- 
esting fact for our immediate purposes is that educational 
questions that have to do with the content of the course of 
study and with the methods of teaching are always related 
to considerations regarding the building. 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS 
Not only does the school building reflect the internal 
needs of the school organization which it houses, but there 
is also a close relation between the school and the distribu- 
tion of the population in the community. A sparsely settled 
community invariably used to have a one-room school, be- 
cause the distances which pupils must travel are such that 
it is difficult to bring together enough pupils to justify a 
larger building. The one-room building is likely, however, 
to offer only the most meager educational opportunities. 
There is only one teacher. There are no adequate provisions 
for the pupils who are supposed to be studying, because 
this one teacher in the one room must be hearing a class 
recite on some subject at practically every period in the day. 
The one-room building does not satisfy the progressive 
community. The device which has been adopted is that of 
consolidating a number of one-room schools and transporting 
the pupils through the necessary distances to make possible 
large schools with separate rooms for pupils of different ages. 
A consolidated school has facilities which are impossible 
in a one-room school. These facilities cannot be described 
without discussing the course of study and also the building 
and equipment. 
The following quotation gives an example of such a 
discussion : 
In Harrison County, Miss., about 8 miles out from the Gulf and 
in a typical south Mississippi rural community, may be found the

Wool Market consolidated school, the subject of this brief study. 
Three medium-sized one-teacher schools — Coalville, King, and 
Oakhead — were brought together two years ago to form this 
school near the Wool Market post office, on the Biloxi River. 
The new house, built by private subscription at a cost of about 
$2,000, was located within 2 miles of all the children in two of 
the old districts, while a transportation wagon was used to bring 
in from 25 to 30 pupils from the Oakhead district, about 3 miles 
from the new schoolhouse. The territory of the new school covers 
27 square miles and now has within its bounds 134 children of 
legal school age. 
Each of the teachers in the abandoned schools, having from 30 
to 4o recitations daily to cover the eight grades of the elementary 
and grammar grades, had no time to do high-school work, and on 
that account had no high-school pupils. As a result of those condi- 
tions the patrons who were able financially to bear the expense 
sent their children out of the community to school as soon as they 
were ready for the high school, at an annual cost of from $150 to 
$200, while the larger number were forced to turn aside to take 
up life’s duties and responsibilities with only the meager training 
obtained in these little schools. Such conditions obtain in three- 
fourths of the schools in the South. The Wool Market consoli- 
dated school, now serving the same territory, has 23 high-school 
pupils — 16 in the ninth grade, 5 in the tenth grade, and 2 in the 
eleventh grade — and 20 pupils in the music and expression classes 
under special teachers. 
The aggregate average attendance for the original schools was 
60 pupils, according to the records, while the average attendance 
now in the consolidated school is 110 pupils, with an enrollment 
of 125. There are only 9 children of school age in the district not 
in school. In the old schools the number was too small to form an 
attractive social center and to justify the employment of special 
teachers, but the new school is fast becoming the center of all 
social activities of this larger community, employs special teachers 
in music and expression, and has in the faculty teachers qualified 
to give instruction in practical agriculture and domestic science. 
In the interhigh-school contests last spring the Wool Market con- 
solidated school, though only two years old, captured a fair share

of the medals in declamation and recitation, while the girls’ basket- 
ball team claims the county championship. 
The school is located on 5 acres of land, which are used for 
playgrounds, school garden, and practical agricultural demonstra- 
tion work. Dr. Welch, the community physician, lectures to the 
school once a week on hygiene and school and home sanitation ; 
and Mr. W. A. Cox, a trustee of the school and a practical farmer 
and horticulturist, gives the school weekly lectures on agricultural, 
horticultural, and allied subjects. 
After trying the consolidated school two years the patrons and 
other citizens of the Wool Market community voluntarily levied a 
tax of $7 per thousand on the property of the district to support 
the school for an eight or nine months’ session.

The Wool Market school, with its four teachers and adequate 
high-school advantages, costs the community only 41 cents per 
pupil, or a total of $45 per month more than the three little one- 
teacher schools. To send the 23 high-school pupils out of the 
community for their high-school education would cost the com- 
munity at least $1,000 more than this entire school cost the com- 
munity and county for eight months. Mr. W. A. Cox, referred to 
above, is authority for the statement that the value of land in the 
community had increased during the two years as a result of the 
good school from $ro per acre to $25 per acre.

THE SCHOOL BUILDING 95 
What has been accomplished in the Wool Market school can be 
done in almost any community in the South. This and similar 
instances that might be mentioned lend strength to the contention 
that adequate school advantages can be provided for the country 
children in the community near the farm home.! 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
A new school building with twelve recitation rooms is to be 
built. Shall the windows of the classrooms open to the north and 
south or to the east and west? Shall the lockers for coats and 
hats be in the general corridors or shall there be a cloakroom off 
each room? How high shall the blackboards be from the floor? 
How many sides of the room shall be supplied with blackboards ? 
How high shall each step be in the stairways? If the building is 
designed to accommodate six hundred pupils, what rooms besides 
the recitation rooms shall be provided? How big should the audi- 
torium be? Should it have a large stage? Shall the toilets be in 
the basement or on each floor? Is it legitimate to spend money 
on a teachers’ rest room? Where should the principal’s office be? 
Is there any difference between the kind of school building to 
be recommended in San Antonio, Texas, and Minneapolis, Minne- 
sota? What color should the walls of a classroom be? How much 
playground space should there be around a school building designed 
for six hundred pupils? 
Should school buildings be frame buildings? Should doors open 
into the building? What is a fire drill, and why is it required?

CHAPTER VII 
GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES 
TRANSITION TO PROBLEMS OF INTERNAL ORGANIZATION 
The preceding chapters have dealt, for the most part, 
with aspects of school organization which are external to 
the classroom and to the operations of instruction. The 
external organization is set up, however, for the sole pur- 
pose of making class work possible. We shall progress, 
therefore, in our statement of educational problems and 
principles by turning to the consideration in detail of the 
organization of the groups. to which instruction is given. 
The connection of this problem with the-one discussed 
in the last chapter is not difficult to trace.“ Where a com- 
munity is small and has few children, a one-room building 
will serve to house the school. Economy dictates the. em- 
ployment of a single teacher. This one teacher must divide 
his or her time as best possible in giving instruction to 
pupils some of whom are very young and others of whom 
are more mature. On the other hand, where the community is 
large or where the school is consolidated, a many-room build- 
ing is required, and the lines of division between groups are 
drawn in a fashion quite impossible in the one-room school. 
Economy A First Motive ror GRouPING 
Some of the simplest motives back of the grouping of 
pupils into classes are financial. Instruction can be adminis- 
tered economically to a number of pupils when it would be 
prohibitively expensive to provide a teacher for each learner. 
Indeed, the demand for large classes in city schools becomes 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES 97 
so urgent that it is often necessary to point out the danger 
of carrying economy so far that it will defeat the purposes 
of instruction. 
SocraL INFLUENCE AN Important Motive 
On the other hand, it can be shown that even where the 
motive of economy is not pressing, there are valid educa- 
tional grounds for grouping pupils into classes. Pupils help 
each other through their natural social relations. The whole- 
some rivalry and mutual suggestiveness provided by the 
class furnish a much better atmosphere for teaching than 
does the isolation of individual instruction. 
Somewhere between the huge class dictated by economy 
and the small class diminishing to a single individual is 
the ideal group in point of size for successful teaching. 
GROUPING IN THE ONnE-Room ScHOOL 
There are other characteristics than size, however, to be 
considered in making up proper groups. In order to dis- 
cover some of these characteristics, it will be well to consider 
certain concrete types of grouping exhibited in schools. 
The type of grouping in the one-room, one-teacher school 
is in many respects the freest which can be found. The 
teacher can organize the school with no conflicts in pro- 
gram, because the whole program consists in distributing 
his own time, The classes can be of any size that the 
teacher’s judgment determines., The reasons for the group- 
ing are purely and simply those which appeal to the teacher. 
Under such circumstances what happens? The teacher 
naturally puts in one group the pupils who are for the first 
time taking up school work. In other groups he puts those 
pupils who have approximately the same attainments in 
each subject. In the classes beyond the first many compli- 
cations arise. There are some pupils who read well but  
-P-A-G-E-110
98 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
seem to be deficient in knowledge of number. Other pupils 
with a taste for arithmetic are very forward in that branch 
and do only indifferently well in reading and spelling. It 
is not uncommon in the one-room school for the teacher 
to regard these differences in ability in particular subjects 
as adequate reasons for distributing the pupils differently in 
different subjects. It comes about in the course of time 
that one and the same pupil will be in the third reading 
class, in the fourth geography class, and in the fifth or sixth 
class in arithmetic, while another pupil who has attained to 
the fifth reader will be lingering behind in the third class 
in arithmetic. 
CoursEs oF INSTRUCTION IN RELATION TO THE PROBLEM 
OF GROUPING 
We find ourselves led by the discussion of groupings to 
a consideration of different levels of difficulty in subjects 
of instruction and to the rate of progress of each individual 
in each subject. The teacher in the one-room school has 
no difficulty in seeing the wisdom of holding together those 
pupils who have a common grade of knowledge in 
geography. In like fashion the class in arithmetic must be 
as homogeneous as possible. There is, however, no recog- 
nized demand that a certain section of geography be coupled 
in the education of any child with any particular section 
of arithmetic. Pupils are grouped in the one-room school 
with reference to each subject considered by itself. 
New Prosrems oF GRoupPING IN LARGE SCHOOLS 
When schools grow to the size where pupils are put into 
different rooms, as in an eight-room building, a problem 
arises which was never faced in the one-room school. It is 
the problem of carrying a group of pupils through all the 
subjects at the same rate. Thus, when the pupils in an 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES 99 
ordinary city school have been grouped together in arith- 
metic, there are obvious advantages from an administrative 
point of view in keeping them together in reading and in 
geography. In ordinary practice the graded school assumes 
that it is possible to find means of keeping the group 
together for long periods in all subjects. 
This assumption leads to the necessity of asking a kind 
of question which did not confront the teacher in the one- 
room school. The kind of question which comes up in the 
graded school can be illustrated as follows: When a pupil 
is old enough and intellectually mature enough to study the 
products and industries of North America in his geography, 
what phase of arithmetic will be appropriate to hold his 
attention and stimulate his thinking? When a pupil is old 
enough to read the history of his own city, what other read- 
ing material will insure real effort on his part? 
The one-room school escapes these questions for the 
most part because it is at liberty to allow the pupil to take 
a different pace in each subject. The one-room school is a 
place where the subjects of instruction taken in their totality, 
or the curriculum, as the whole series of subjects may be 
called, is usually not recognized as important. Each subject 
has a sequence of its own, but the curriculum as a whole is 
not thought out. In the graded school the curriculum is one 
of the matters of major importance. The graded school not 
only grades pupils; it grades subject-matter of instruction. 
The importance of this contrast cannot be overemphasized. 
Many of the problems of the modern school arise at this point. 
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE CURRICULUM 
Let us consider certain cases which will make clear the 
importance of the contrast. The following extract from 
the report of the state superintendent of schools in Maine 
sets forth a definite view on the matters under discussion : 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 THE SCIENTIFIC. STUDY OF EDUCATION 
More Careful System. The number of pupils in ungraded 
schools is shown to be 29,089, a decrease of 1986 from the figures 
*shown for the previous year. It is clear that the work of the 
schools is becoming more carefully systematized. ‘This fact is fur- 
ther attested by the reduction in the number of schools not using 
a course of study. In 1904 there were 2323 schools that were 
reported as following no definite outline of studies. In 1913 this 
number had dropped to 827 and, as indicated by this report, has 
now been further reduced to 670. This change, already increasing 
to no small extent the efficiency of the schools, suggests a promise 
of the greater advantages that would follow the adoption of a 
course that would in essentials be uniform for the state. While 
an absolute uniformity that would prevent individual initiative and 
wise experimentation would retard progress and is not to be desired, 
there is much to be said in favor of an agreement on established 
and essential points for all parts of the state school system.* 
On the other hand, practical efforts are being made 
in many quarters to overcome the rigidity of the graded 
system by devising methods of taking the individual out 
of the group whenever the course of study proves to be 
inapplicable to his particular needs. In Fond du Lac, Wis- 
consin, the elementary schools have their programs for the 
various grades so arranged that language comes for every 
grade at exactly the same hour in the day; in like fashion, 
all arithmetic classes are held at the same time, and so with 
geography and the other subjects. Through this arrange- 
ment it is possible for a child who is backward in a single 
subject to withdraw from the group with which he spends 
most of the day and to go for the period to another class 
where he receives a different type of instruction in the 
subject in which he is behind. 
At Gary the schools are so organized that certain teachers 
in certain rooms teach a particular subject; the general

of Maine, for the School Year Ending June 30, 1914, p. 21.

    freedom of organization secured in this way is utilized to 
shift pupils from room to room, thus breaking up the grading 
system. The possibilities of this arrangement are described 
in the following quotation : 
If a boy is weak in some particular subject, it is possible to 
give him double work in that subject. Let us say a 4A boy is 
weak in arithmetic. It is possible for a time for him to omit some 
of his special activities and take arithmetic with the 4B class also, 
thus permitting double time in arithmetic. If he is weak in all of 
his regular studies it is easy to drop him out of his special activities 
for a time and permit him to do double work in the regular studies. 
The special activities are of such a sort that he can return to his 
classes there without difficulty.t 
THE UncrApED Cass IN GRADED SCHOOLS 
Another type of experiment is seen in the so-called un- 
graded class. In many large schools a room is set apart 
under an especially skillful teacher where pupils who are 
for any reason out of joint with the curriculum may receive 
personal attention. Many of these ungraded rooms are so 
conducted that bright pupils, through a little personal help, 
are prepared to skip a grade and thus advance more rapidly 
than the ordinary pupil. Backward children, especially those 
who are backward in only a single subject, are helped enough 
to restore them to their classés. Where it is found that 
pupils are subnormal and permanently unable to keep in linc 
with others of like age, the ungraded class may become a 
special class. The teacher is then given authority to take 
all liberty with the subject-matter of instruction and fit it to 
the needs of the pupils. Sometimes in such special classes 
reading is practically abandoned and time is devoted to 
various forms of handwork.

  102. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
CASES WHERE FaILurES SHOW THE URGENCY OF THE 
GRADING PROBLEM . 
.The foregoing paragraphs have, it is to be hoped, made 
clear the fact that the grouping of pupils and the organiza- 
tion of the curriculum are closely interrelated problems. The 
same lesson can be taught by a study of the actual opera- 
tions of certain school systems which are organized under 
the graded system. 
Fig. 11 shows certain records of failures in the elemen- 
tary schools of Cleveland for one half of the year 1914. 
A failure on the part of a child in any school can have no 
other meaning than this: the child was, at the time of his 
failure, in the wrong group for his intellectual advantage. 
There is no effort in such a remark to place the blame for 
the child’s failure. Perhaps the child who fails is indolent. 
Perhaps the work is too difficult for him. Whatever the rea- 
son, failure means that the pupil and the system of grading 
are out of joint with each other. Hence, when we find pupils 
failing, we know that the grading system is not working 
perfectly. 
In the figure the diagram at the left shows the percent- 
age of nonpromotions in each grade. About 17 per cent 
failed in the first grade, about 12 per cent in the second, 
and so on. It may be well to comment briefly on the high 
percentage in the first grade. This is due to the fact that 
some pupils enter school when they are immature, Many 
pupils lose a great many days of schooling in the first years 
through contagious diseases, which, as shown by school statis- 
tics, are contracted more commonly during the first years 
than later. The family does not take care of attendance as 
carefully in the first year as later. The first year supplies 
the test which in many cases brings evidence of mental defi- 
ciency. These and other reasons explain the high percentage 
of nonpromotions in the first year. The reduced percentage 
*
-P-A-G-E-115
      GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES 103 
in the second year is explained by the fact that a part of 
the task of adjusting pupils to the graded system and to the curriculum has been accomplished in the first grade, 
The record given in the diagram for the third, fourth, 
and fifth grades is an impressive exhibition of increasing 
  
  
  incoérdination between the pupils and the work of the school. So striking is the difficulty in these later grades that we are led to ask for an explanation. This is supplied

  in part by the diagram in the middle of the figure and by the one at the right. These present the records of failures 
in two of the most important school subjects. 
A record of constantly diminishing failures in reading is exhibited in the middle diagram. This shows that the teachers judge that the pupils improve steadily in reading. There is a satisfactory response to the methods of teaching 
reading and to the demands of the upper grades. Those pupils who have difficulty in reading in the lower grades are held back or are helped to master the art. The evident fact is that improvement in reading is, according to the record, 
continuous and satisfactory, 
    
-P-A-G-E-116
i104 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The diagram at the right shows the record in arithmetic. 
Here is the cause of many of the nonpromotions shown in 
the diagram at the left. Failures mount up in the middle 
grades at a rate which shows with manifest clearness that 
something is radically wrong. 
One may venture several remarks in the presence of such 
records, It does not seem likely that the pupils are stupid, 
since it is shown that they can read. It is to be noted that 
they do not have any option about taking arithmetic, nor 
do they determine what arithmetic they shall study. They 
are evidently not getting a section of arithmetic in each 
of the grades which suitably parallels the reading which is 
administered to them. 
Errorts To Apjust Instruction To PupILs 
The conditions shown in the figure are paralleled in many 
school systems. The result is that school officers, seeing the 
difficulty of doing justice to the pupils, have made radical 
changes in the grading system in order to meet individual 
needs, Two extracts from reports by superintendents will 
show the extent to which school systems will go. 
A study of the performances of the failures in Boise has con- 
vinced the entire force that the repeater is generally a quitter, and 
does about as poor work in his second attempt as in his first trial 
at the work of a given grade. The stamp of disapproval has been 
placed upon him. He starts on his second attempt with a griev- 
ance against the teacher and the entire institution. The parents as 
well as the child feel injured, so that the teacher must combat both 
the antagonism of the home and the hostility of the pupil, who has 
been trained for failure and not for success, and who becomes 
either morbidly sensitive or brazenly indifferent. What the laggard 
would probably do as a repeater is therefore quite definitely known. 
If he were permitted to, advance, he could hardly do worse and he 
might do better. It is less expensive and more human to pro- 
mote him than it is to degrade him, This view of the situation is 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
      GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES 105 
generally accepted in Boise. The standard for promoting the dull 
pupil is entirely individual. He is not compelled to do all the work 
of his present grade before he is permitted to pass to the next. He 
is even allowed to pass on without manifesting enough ability to 
justify the hope that he may be able to do the work of the ad- 
vanced grade. The question is reduced to the one consideration : 
Would he do better if advanced than he would as a repeater ?? 
Ten years ago no pupil could enter the Newton High School, 
no matter what his age or educational need, who had not com- 
pleted satisfactorily all the work of the grammar schools; and 
a considerable’ portion — probably one-third to one-half — of all 
Newton children were then leaving school at fourteen to sixteen 
years of age with only part of an elementary school education. 
To-day any boy or girl who needs secondary school instruction — 
and most boys and girls of high school age, fourteen or fifteen, do 
need such instruction — may enter some department of the New- _ 
ton high schools, whether grammar school work has been com- 
pleted or not; and nearly all — probably from eighty to ninety per 
cent — of our children are now getting secondary training before 
leaving school.” 
e READJUSTMENTS OF THE CURRICULUM 
There are other and more fundamental remedies for some 
of the evils of the graded system. The curriculum can be 
readjusted. Where any considerable number of pupils fail 
in a particular subject, it is highly probable that the material 
of instruction or the method of presentation or both ought 
to be modified. In some cases pupils ought to be taken 
out of the regular grades and treated as special cases. The 
city of Cincinnati was a pioneer in recognizing the need of 
special curricula for special types of pupils. The whole coun- 
try has in recent years come to recognize the importance of 
taking children who are mentally backward or slow out of

the grades. Less commonly there is a recognition of the 
importance of specially arranged courses for the bright 
pupils. 
In the city of St. Louis the curriculum of each grade is 
administered in units of ten weeks for each section. At the 
end of each ten weeks a readjustment is possible so that 
the bright pupils may go forward and the slow pupils may 
proceed more deliberately. There are at the end of each 
period of ten weeks a number of promotions which carry 
individual pupils forward two quarters. The curriculum is 
so arranged that a rapidly promoted pupil does not omit 
any essential part of the subjects, while the slow pupil has 
ample opportunity for drill and review. 
The grading of the material used in instruction in par- 
ticular subjects has also been recognized as a problem of 
the first importance. One of the most thoroughly studied 
subjects is spelling. Ayres! took the thousand words which 
several investigations had shown to be the most commonly 
used in ordinary life and tried them out on the pupils of 
eighty-four cities. As a result of those trials he is ab} 
state that a certain list of words will be spelled with a & en 
percentage of error by pupils of the third grade andy with a 
less percentage of error by pupils of the fourth, fifth, and 
higher grades. Thus the material of instruction’in spelling 
is graded, not by arbitrarily selecting what the teacher thinks 
will be appropriate, but by trying out the actual ability of 
pupils in eighty-four cities. 
PROBLEMS OF GROUPING IN HiGH ScHOOL 
Thus far the problem of grouping has been discussed 
from the point of view of the elementary school. The prob- 
lems’of the high school are different in detail, but no less

impressive. In the first place, the failures in high-school 
subjects show the same lack of systematic ordering of the 
curriculum that was observed in the elementary records cited 
above. For example, from the survey of the Denver high 
schools we may borrow a series of percentages showing the 
failures in various subjects in the five high schools.

  108 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Table VI is worthy of careful study. Let us compare 
English I and II, which are required of all students, with 
Mathematics I and II, which are also required. In almost 
every case the percentage of failures in mathematics is 
greater. This goes to show either that the grading in math- 
ematics is more exacting or that the students are less well 
qualified to carry the courses. The exception to the rule 
that mathematics shows more failures than English, which 
appears in the second year of the Manual High School, 
suggests that possibly the students in that school see the 
importance of mathematics as a professional course. The 
difficulty with this explanation is the enormous mortality in 
that school in the first-year course in mathematics. Per- 
haps the pupils who are likely to fail are dropped during 
the first year. 
While the failures in mathematics are uniformly higher 
than in English, the policy of the different schools is strik- 
ingly different. In the East High School the two subjects 
are about alike, while in the West High School the failures 
in mathematics are relatively very high. 
Such contrasts become more impressive if we draw the 
records in Latin into consideration. In the West High 
School, Latin in the first year is like mathematics, while 
in the South High School it is like English. Elementary 
science also shows wide divergences in practice. 
A number of startling facts appear if the table is made a 
subject of careful study. What these facts mean is not diffi- 
cult to set forth. The subjects now included in the curricu- 
lum of the high school are only imperfectly adjusted to the 
abilities of the students. The community has a right to 
question instruction which results in failure on the part of 
one student out of four. It certainly must be aroused at the 
lack of codrdination between schools within a single system 
which show differences as marked as those exhibited in 
Table VI.
-P-A-G-E-121
  GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES 109 
Other problems in the grading of high-school students 
and the subject-matter in which they are given instruction 
grow out of the laxity which has crept into the administra- 
tion of the elective system. Thus, if we consider certain 
subjects which are open to students of different classes, 
such as the first course in Spanish or French or the course 
in ancient history, we find that senior students are allowed 
to enter the same class as freshmen because the organiza- 
tion of separate divisions would be too expensive. The 
result is either a reduction of the requirement in class work 
to the level of the more immature student or undue effort 
to bring the lower student to a reasonable understanding of 
the subject. 
ILLEGITIMATE REASONS FOR PROMOTING PUPILS 
The problems which have been pointed out will perhaps 
be seen most vividly if some types of promotion are cited 
which are likely to interfere with instruction. 
Sometimes the school allows a pupil to move up a grade 
or class, although it is. known that he has not done the 
work below, because the parents of the child have influence 
and it does not seem safe to antagonize them. 
Sometimes the pressure of numbers in the lower grades or 
classes is so great that the teacher sends a pupil on in order 
to make room for the younger pupils, even when it is evident 
that the pupil will not be able to carry the higher work. 
Sometimes the teacher in a given grade is anxious to 
unload the backward or disorderly and therefore incompetent 
pupil on someone else, and since the open road is into the 
next higher grade, the child is sent on. 
Promotion is sometimes controlled by the calendar. Be- 
cause the date for closing the schools has arrived, and 
the long vacation is at hand, pupils are declared to have 
completed the work whether they have or not. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Sometimes it is more or less explicitly argued that the 
backward pupil is larger than the other children of like 
intellectual attainments and he should therefore be sent to 
the upper-grade room where the seats are larger. 
When such reasons for promotion are deliberately set 
down in black and white, they are evidently not legitimate 
reasons. Many a pupil has, however, been dealt with on 
exactly such grounds. 
EXPERIMENTS AND STUDIES WHICH AIM TO SUPPLY BOTH 
InpivipuaL INSTRUCTION AND CLAss INSTRUCTION 
The indefensible reasons given above for advancing pupils 
ought to make anyone who expects to become a teacher the 
more ready to turn to the careful study of the problem. It is 
undoubtedly a social and financial necessity that pupils be 
grouped in classes. It is equally necessary for purposes of 
administration that the groups have some kind of perma- 
nency and some degree of internal uniformity. It is cer- 
tainly legitimate that the individual’s needs be asserted to 
the extent of freeing him from absolute subordination to 
the interests of the group. 
Such a statement of the case would seem to dictate a 
double type of instruction which will recognize more than 
does the present rigid class system the need of individual 
freedom and the value of class solidarity. 
Many experiments have been tried in the effort to solve 
this problem. The Batavia system, so called, puts two 
teachers into a room, one to supervise individual work and 
one to teach groups. There are various systems of individual 
promotion which advance a pupil whenever he is ready. 
Recently Principal Allen! of the high school of Spring- 
field, Illinois, has developed a‘ system of supervised study 
in which the students put themselves through certain

GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES IIt 
prepared exercises and in this part of their work receive 
individual help and are allowed to progress at their own 
individual rate. Later the class meets for recitation as a 
group. The recitation group is made to depend for its 
composition on the rate at which students complete the 
individual exercises. The class is accordingly readjusted 
frequently, and in order to provide time for individual 
work the length of its meetings is somewhat less than 
the conventional high-school period. 
The instructional plan thus arranged requires certain 
readjustments of the program and certain divisions of labor 
among the teachers which differ from the ordinary. But, 
above all, it calls for the separation of those aspects of 
the subjects of instruction which are suitable for individual 
work from those aspects which are suited to class exercises. 
ARRANGEMENT OF THE MaTerIALs oF INSTRUCTION 
We are constantly brought back by our discussions of 
the organization of classes to a consideration of the cur- 
riculum. The materials of instruction are capable of advan- 
tageous and economical use only when they are adapted to 
pupils. Our next problem, therefore, is to consider some 
of the general principles which underlie the organization of 
the general curriculum and of particular subjects. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
What are some of the limitations in the training of a child who 
gets his education from a private tutor rather than as a member of 
a class? Show that the most satisfactory size for a class depends 
in large measure on the subject of instruction. In certain subjects, 
such as typewriting and bookkeeping, instruction often becomes 
almost purely individual instruction. Observe such a class and 
describe the method of instruction. 
If terminology is employed in a strict way, a “ course” refers 
to a series of lessons in a single subject, a “curriculum” to a

schools to compel students to think of curricula rather than courses? 
What are the advantages and what are the evils of the elective 
system?

tolerated in a class? What conditions affect your answer to the 
foregoing question? Is a “stiff” course the best course? What 
class in high school has the “ stiffest ” requirements ?

in the closing paragraphs of the chapter, describe some thoroughly 
practical method of handling each ‘situation without making the

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE TRADITIONAL CURRICULUM AND ITS 
REORGANIZATION 
IMPORTANCE OF A STUDY OF THE CURRICULUM 
The last chapter failed of its purpose if it did not con- 
centrate the attention of the reader on the school curriculum. 
The organized body of materials of instruction constitutes 
one of the most important factors which enter into the life 
of the school system. Along with the board of education, 
with the grading system, and with the staff of teachers 
and supervisory officers stands.the curriculum as a kind of 
dominating personality always -ercising a leading influence 
in the determination of every educational policy.) It will be 
the business of this chapter to open the discussion of the 
curriculum by commenting on the history of courses of 
study and by pointing out some of the changes which recent 
years have wrought. 
Tue SPECIALIZED CURRICULUM OF HIGHER SCHOOLS 
If one goes back to the beginnings of any school system, 
it will always be found that the original courses of study 
grow directly out of the intellectual ideals of the times. 
For example, if one goes back to the beginnings of medieval 
universities, he finds that these institutions grew up because 
there was an interest in certain well-defined bodies of ideas. 
At Bologna one Irnerius had made himself acquainted with 
the laws of the northern Italian cities, and students came 
from all Europe to hear him expound these laws.. The 
course of study was directly related to a specific demand. 
113 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
A professional theological curriculum was organized at 
the time of the founding of the early American universities. 
Harvard was at first a school for the training of clergymen. 
At that time there was no demand for lawyers trained in 
the New World. The law came from England, and from the 
same source came the lawyers. Medicine had hardly de- 
veloped into a profession. Preaching and listening to ser- 
mons were, on the other hand, among the most absorbing 
occupations of the colonists, and Harvard was established to 
provide those who could preach. The courses of study were 
arranged according to the traditions of the single profession 
towards which the graduates were aiming. 
PROBLEMS OF GENERALIZING A SPECIALIZED CURRICULUM 
We may pursue this example further as typical of the 
complications which ultimately grow up around any course 
of study. The original purpose of Harvard was expanded 
with the passing years. A demand arose for lawyers and 
doctors; in the effort to meet this demand the institution 
was divided into separate schools. Still later students came 
to college seeking a general training not leading to any 
profession. Through all these changes in the demands of 
the student body the original courses of study have persist- 
ently battled their way down to the present. No clearer 
evidence can be found than this, that courses of study once 
created become vital factors in all the later life of the 
school. The college courses of study were in the first place 
the product of a particular professional demand. While sat- 
isfying this particular demand they became strong enough 
so that at a later period they have often dominated educa- 
tional policies. 
It is too flippant a remark to say that the classical educa- 
tion of the clerical period became the fashion and that later 
generations were afraid to be out of fashion, but something
-P-A-G-E-127
        CURRICULUM AND ITS REORGANIZATION 115 
of this sort is what really happened. The traditions of a generation are hard to break. The father who took Greek as a part of his education hesitates to see his son enter upon life without the same equipment. Courses of study thus come to have an intellectual sanction which it is extraordinarily difficult to break down. : 
TRADITIONAL CHARACTER OF Matuematics Courses 1n 
Hieu, ScHoots 
Another example of no less impressive a type can be drawn from the high-school curriculum of the present time. There is hardly a tradition of high schools which is more fixed than that of requiring algebra in the first year and geometry later. This practice persists even though it is a well-known fact that in many schools failures in high-school algebra are more numerous than in any other high-school course. Also, there is a clear recognition of the fact that by being required of all students in the first year algebra is in effect made the prerequisite of admission ‘to the courses in science and literature which are open only to students who have reached the later years of the high school. The ques- tion which the student of education must raise is this: How did algebra secure this position of commanding importance, and how does it hold this position when experience shows that so many students cannot take it with success ? The answer to these questions throws a strong light on the nature of the curriculum. 
Mathematics in general gained a preéminent position in the educational scheme of the Western World as far back as the fifth century before Christ, in the days of Pythagoras. The branches of mathematics which were chiefly cultivated in those days were geometry and arithmetic. Geometry flourished as an experimental science, and arithmetic con- sisted in the most elaborate speculations about prime numbers
-P-A-G-E-128

116 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
and the properties of odd and even numbers. After these 
sciences had reached a certain maturity they were trans- 
ferred to the University of Alexandria, where, in the third 
century before Christ, Euclid formulated the principles of 
geometry into the logical form which has persisted to our 
own time. If one asks why the same service was not 
rendered for arithmetic at the University of Alexandria, the 
answer is to be found in the fact that the Greeks had no 
adequate method of expressing number. They used a system 
of letters even more clumsy than the system employed by 
the Romans after them. If one needs further demonstration 
of the reason why arithmetic did not develop in the classical 
world, let him try to multiply DCCLXXVII by XCIX. 
Arithmetic was very little cultivated, therefore, while geome- 
try was put into perfect logical form. Since arithmetic was 
so little developed in the ancient world, algebra never suc- 
ceeded in getting a real start. 
Geometry, thus launched as a systematized branch of 
learning superior to arithmetic, has held its place through all 
generations. In the medieval institutions the perfect logical 
form of geometry was fully recognized. Geometry was used 
to sharpen the logic of many a mind. Arithmetic devel- 
oped only so far as it was needed for the practical purposes 
of daily life. 
In due time there came into Europe oriental scholars who 
brought with them that marvelous invention — the Arabic 
numerals, They brought also the science of algebra with 
its profound abstractions. The Arabic numerals soon super- 
seded the clumsy Roman numerals, and the common man 
found that he could easily deal with the practical matters of 
life by means of this number system which rendered all 
calculations simple. With arithmetic of the new type came 
algebra. The scientists of Europe found that the algebraic 
methods opened up possibilities of mathematical reasoning 
which were of the first importance to science. Algebra and 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
      CURRICULUM AND ITS REORGANIZATION TE. 
arithmetic flourished. But did these two newcomers in any 
degree disturb the position of geometry ? Not at all. Algebra 
may be as abstract as any subject in the curriculum, but 
its historical relations were from the first with arithmetic, 
while geometry was related to logic and the higher sub- 
jects. Geometry has continued since 300 B.c. to be a higher 
course. The situation in the high schools of to-day is in 
no sense due to a careful study of the degree of abstraction 
involved in geometry and algebra. It is in no sense a 
recognition of the fact that geometry was the first of the 
two subjects to develop. The present situation can be 
understood only by recognizing the strength of tradition 
and the persistence of a practice when once it gets itself 
established. 
The situation is the more impressive because even a 
superficial study of the intellectual needs of pupils shows 
that there ought to be instruction in the lower grades in 
the discrimination of forms and designs. One does not 
master the forms even of common things until his attention 
has been turned to them again and again. The conse- 
quences to the curriculum of the elevation of geometry to 
the upper school are far-reaching in a negative as well as 
in a positive way.’ Space study has been kept out of the 
lower schools because the only orthodox form of space study 
is the geometry of the higher schools. Space study ought 
to have a place in the curriculum of every grade. © 
In the case of algebra, on the other hand, tradition has 
operated to keep the subject in the lower classes of the 
high school. That it would be better to change this situa- 
tion appears in the fact that textbooks in algebra have in 
recent years been made much easier in the effort to fit the 
subject to pupils’ needs, in the fact that some high schools 
have made it elective, and in the fact that some high schools 
have rearranged the whole subject-matter of mathematics, 
breaking up the historical lines of division.     
-P-A-G-E-130
118 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
SuacEstions oF NEw SupjEcts 
Other evidences that the curriculum is in need of radical 
reform appear when one notes that schools are curiously 
blind in the subjects which they omit. A recent writer has 
pointed out in a very interesting way the weakness of the 
ordinary school in its failure to give children any training 
in the use of money. A quotation from his introductory 
chapter will show the force of his criticism. 
Most people if suddenly asked, “t What financial training did you 
have as a child?” would probably say, “ None.” If asked, “ What 
financial training are you giving your own children?” many parents 
would give the same answer. All parents, however, do incidentally 
give lessons in finance and a few give definite instruction with 
regard to money. 
The teacher, if thus questioned, would usually say something 
about arithmetic or perhaps refer to some system of money-saving 
that is being operated by the school. Much has really been done 
that educates children financially, but probably not one person in 
ten has ever seriously studied the problem of the need of financial 
training of children and of how that need at each age may best 
be met. 
A moment's reflection tells one that many adults do not know 
how to spend their money wisely and that still fewer know how to 
keep it safely or invest it successfully. Every day we see people 
spending money in ways that bring little satisfaction. Others are 
tortured by the fear of losing what they have, while still others 
are investing in schemes that promise much and yield little 
or nothing. 
Charity workers are especially impressed with the inability of 
poor people to spend wisely the little money they get. One woman 
whose family was.in a starving condition spent all of the dollar 
that was given her for canned lobster, and another in a similar 
situation had a picture taken. 
Rich sons and daughters often spend the money accumulated 
by their fathers in even more foolish ways. In general it is only 
the common people who have had much experience in saving and 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  CURRICULUM AND ITS REORGANIZATION 119 
spending money, who spend it wisely and many of these have paid 
a high price for their knowledge. If carefully planned financial 
training were given, the number spending wisely would doubtless 
be greatly increased.* 
Present-Day SocraL Demanps 
Other suggestions are being made these days for a change 
in the course of study. Sometimes the suggestions take the 
form of social movements. Such social movements often 
come in the form of violent criticisms of existing practices. 
These criticisms will be understood only when it is recog- 
nized that back of them there is often a social pressure 
which has not been understood and is now finding voice in 
a demand that requires immediate attention. It will be well 
for us to seek some examples of this type in order that we 
may come to understand that the school system is answerable 
at all times not merely to earlier social ideals which were 
incorporated into courses of study but also to the new ideals 
which arise with the later developments of community life. 
An example of the type we are seeking appears in a study 
which was made in 1913 in the city of Minneapolis. The 
following extracts from an article published on March 10 in 
the Morning Tribune of that city state the case fully : 
A year ago a group of men and women interested in the welfare 
of boys and girls, and somewhat acquainted with conditions that 
confront them upon their entrance into industrial life, decided that 
it was time to make a survey of the city. There'had been much 
talk of training for the trades in the public schools, and apparently 
there was reasonable ground for this advocacy. . . . 
Was there a real demand, or was this a new educational fad 
sweeping across the country, to be lost in the great abyss of 
educational nostrums, along with vertical writing and basketry ? 
That was to be determined.

  120 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Educators are usually learned men; but this world generally 
does not ascribe to them an abundance of sound sense. These 
learned men have charge of the greatest plant in the world — our 
schools. A half million employees are at work at an annual ex- 
pense to the nation of $450,000,000. The product of this institu- 
tion should be manhood and womanhood, efficient to take its place 
in the world of workers, and firmly established in habits of right 
thinking and noble action. Yet who is accounted efficient for the 
work of to-day ? 
Certainly not the armorer, no matter how skilled — for what 
need have we of him? Possibly not the bootmaker ; for the best 
and latest in boots come from big factories. And so rapidly do 
industries change that confusion awaits the man still using methods 
of ten years ago. No system of education can be efficient until 
the conditions of life to which pupils go are thoroughly known. 
No manufacturer would think of setting his machines to make 
“ what-nots ” or muzzle-loading guns; they were all right in their 
day but that day is now yesterday. The first thing for the man of 
business is to know what the market demands. And the managers 
of the schools must explore their market to know what is demanded 
of the education factory. That is the reason for this survey. 
The commission was made up of persons well known in the 
city and representative of differing interests. . . . 
Ten months were spent in gathering the information, and a 
month in studying it and getting it into shape for presentation. 
The tables have been arranged in the following order: First, a set 
of three tables, showing the sources of the material studied, by 
school, by age, by grade, and by nationality, and the causes of 
retardation ; second, a table showing upon whom the responsibility 
should be placed for the child’s leaving school; third, four tables 
setting forth the reasons for leaving school, and the economic 
status of the family; fourth, a table indicating the education of 
the children after leaving the public school; and fifth, five tables 
showing the industrial history of each child, his wages, the number 
of jobs, the kind of work, and his advancement. 
In the discussion comparisons are frequently made with similar 
reports from other cities, and following these are the conclusions 
reached by the committee and recommendations for further work.
-P-A-G-E-133
        CURRICULUM AND ITS REORGANIZATION 121 
It will not be possible to give in detail all the results 
thus obtained. It must suffice to repeat here the figures 
which summarize the table of causes for leaving school. 
The percentages of pupils leaving for each cause are given 
with the statement of the cause.

The number of pupils who leave because they do not 
like school or do not believe it worth while is disturbingly 
large. That there should be so pronounced an adverse 
judgment on the part of pupils is perhaps to be explained 
in a measure by their immaturity and restlessness ; but part 
of the school’s problem is to meet this immaturity and 
restlessness and to train the pupils with full regard to all 
that goes to make up their individual tastes and abilities. 
It is especially important that a careful study be made of 
all available recommendations for improving the situation. 
We turn, therefore, to some of the leading recommendations 
of the Minneapolis commission : 
That as rapidly as would be economical, the schools be organ- 
ized on the “six-three-and-three” plan, beginning differentiated 
courses in the B seventh grade. ‘These courses should follow three 
broad lines: (1) Leading toward the academic courses in high 
schools. (2) Toward the commercial courses, or directly to busi- 
ness. (3) Toward manual training in high school, or directly to 
manufacturing and mechanical pursuits. 
That preparation for the trades can be best and most economi- 
cally closely related to working conditions, while the necessary 
skill shall be gained in actual work under the usual commercial 
conditions.

to include all boys who have reached the age of fifteen and have 
not yet reached the seventh grade. And that a similar school be 
organized for girls. 
That a department of vocational guidance be organized. 
That, as an adjunct to the board of education, an advisory 
commission of 15 members, composed of employees, employers 
and educators, be established, whose duty it shall be to report 
changes in the demands of business and industry, and to advise 
modifications of the course of study to meet these new demands. 
That a law should be enacted, making it mandatory that a boy 
shall be either in school or at work up to his eighteenth year, and 
that the department of vocational guidance be charged with the 
duty of enforcing such a provision. | 
This report has been reproduced at length because it 
furnishes a concrete example of the kind of demand which 
is being made on many sides for a complete remaking of 
the curriculum. The comments about school officers are 
also typical of much that is being laid at the door of the 
present-day pedagogue. Better than any theoretical answer 
to these critics is a careful study of the whole problem of 
reorganizing the curriculum. 
TRADITIONAL NEGLECT OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION ON 
THE PART OF THE PUBLIC 
The reasonableness of the demand that the schools pre- 
pare boys and girls for their work in the world raises at 
once the question: Why have the schools ever neglected 
this need? The answer to this question is supplied in 
part by the remoter history of schoolsywhich was touched 
on in an earlier chapter and in the early paragraphs of this 
chapter. European and American schools first dealt with 
professional and theological problems and have accordingly 
always had a strong leaning toward the literary subjects.

  CURRICULUM AND ITS REORGANIZATION 123 
The early history of the American educational system 
throws light on this particular matter in a way which will 
help the reader to understand the present situation with 
regard to industrial education and traditional education. 
At the same time that the New England colonies were 
passing laws establishing schools where children were to 
learn to read the Bible, they provided in such laws as the 
following for training in industrial lines. The Connecticut 
law of 1650 provides that “all parents and masters do breed 
and bring up their children and apprentices in some honest 
lawful labor, or employment, either in husbandry or some 
other trade profitable for themselves and the commonwealth, 
if they will not nor cannot train them up in learning, to fit 
them for higher employments, and if any of the selectmen, 
after admonition by them given to such masters of families, 
shall find them still negligent of their duty, . . . the said 
selectmen, with the help of two magistrates, shall take such 
children or apprentices from them, and place them with some 
masters for years, boys until they come to be twenty-one, 
and girls to eighteen years of age complete.” 
The conception of responsibility which lies back of this 
law is wholly different from that expressed in the legisla- 
tion providing for reading-schools. A public officer was 
put in charge of reading. He was stimulated to carry on 
his work by the rewards which he received in the way 
of compensation for his services. The control of industrial 
education by the public was very slight. We can imagine 
some selectman whose attention was by chance drawn to a 
neglected child, debating with himself the wisdom of setting 
in motion the magistrates and his fellow selectmen in en- 
forcing this somewhat vague law. The fact is that the law 
was not enforced. It became a dead letter, and public atten- 
tion to vocational education has no history in this country 
until recent years, when the pressure of industrial competition 
has forced its recognition.
-P-A-G-E-136
124 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
In the early days of the nation’s life the absence of any 
definite plan for public vocational education of young people 
was not a serious matter. Industrial life was relatively sim- 
ple, and the family lived close to its sources of supplies. 
The family was able to take care of the children’s prepara- 
tion for industrial life without aid or interference from the 
state. But social and industrial conditions have changed. 
With the development of factories, of elaborate systems of 
transportation, and of urban life it is no longer possible for 
the family to train the children, and the demand begins to 
be urgently felt that some agency give adequate preparation 
for the practical later life of the children, and that more 
especially where families are not well-to-do. 
For a long period after this demand was felt the school 
went on with its specialized task, and the public was com- 
placent to see the school neglect vocational training. The 
specialized task of the school, as thought of in those days, 
was to teach reading and the other subjects which naturally 
attached themselves to the literary tendencies that grew up 
in a reading-school. Private institutions, such as business 
colleges, sprang up as agencies for satisfying the demand 
for special vocational training. These were tuition schools 
and secured their students in many cases by criticizing the 
public school as incompetent and wasteful. In some cases 
employers, realizing the necessity of training their workers, 
made it a part of their industrial organization to teach cer- 
tain branches of the trades. In other cases, a boy going 
into an occupation which had no regular training-school, 
either in a private institution or in the industrial plant, 
got his training as best he could by accepting a low wage 
and blundering along until he learned his trade. Even 
to-day the private training of young people for iridnstry 
is conducted on a scale that shows how new is the idea 
that the public school is responsible in any degree for 
such training.

    CURRICULUM AND ITS REORGANIZATION 125 
Tue Demand For REvISION OF THE CURRICULUM 
The historical sketch given above illustrates, as do the 
earlier examples presented in this chapter, the natural con- 
servatism of the school curriculum on the one hand and the 
inevitableness of an expansion of the school on the other. 
Historically, the common school had no duties in the diret- 
tion of vocational training. But we are beginning to realize 
that it is not profitable to try to throw off responsibility. 
To-day the school must cope with an urgent social problem. 
The curriculum was and is literary in its major content. 
The problem of the future is to expand it so that it shall 
combine with its literary content a new and productive body 
of vocational training. ‘ 
SUMMARY 
Our study of the curriculum has established, first, the important 
fact that courses of study are real factors to be dealt with in any 
school situatign ; ‘second, ‘the motives which give rise to particular 
forms’Of instruction are supersedéd in the course of school history 
by new social needs, Nevertheless, the curriculum tends to persist, 
and often because of its conservatism becomes a menace to prog- 
ress. Suggestions for innovations come through the insights of 
individuals or through the formulation of social demands. What- 
ever the source of suggestions for change, the student of education 
will find his problem in the fact that the curriculum is undergoing 
change as is every other phase of modern life. How to under- 
stand the changes that are imminent and how to direct them into 
productive channels is a major problem of the science of education,

the curriculum of the grades, Within the older courses find some 
new topics which have been introduced. New subjects in general 
are not looked on as entirely respectable. Why is this? What 
should be done to make them respectable ?

Do people in general know what changes ought to be made in 
the curriculum? Note that the Minneapolis study found difficul- 
ties. For these it had clear scientific evidence. Did it have equally 
clear grounds for its recommendations? Should it have had? How 
could it secure evidence of this latter type ? 
Relating this discussion to the first paragraphs of Chapter I, let 
us inquire what steps with regard to informing the community are 
necessary to the success of a new program of studies. 
Whose duty is it to plan new courses—that of the board of 
education, the superintendent, or the teacher who is a specialist in 
some subject ?

      CHAPTER IX 
SPECIALIZED EDUCATION VERSUS GENERAL 
EDUCATION 
  
PrESENT-Day WAVERING BETWEEN SPECIALIZED AND 
GENERAL TRAINING 
Because there is an urgent social demand for the reor- ganization of the curriculum and because the principles which should underlie a sound curriculum are as yet not clear, there is much running back and forth in the educa- tional world and much controversy that at times grows very bitter and even personal. Experiments are set up and lauded or assailed. Optimists. are hopeful that out of this experimentation will come much good. Pessimists see in it the failure of a democratic educational system. 
The recent controversies have revived the ancient dispute between a general education which makes the “all-round man” and specialized education which serves some partic- ular purpose. This controversy can be illustrated by two kinds of examples. First, let us listen to those who are interested in higher education for the classes of students who are going to high school and college. Later we shall find that there is another level at which the same kind of controversy is going forward, 
The following statements and counter-statements illustrate 
the extent to which the dispute is carried : 
I suggest, that, in’ the first place, a man educated in the modern sense, has mastered the fundamental tools of knowledge: he can read and write; he can'spell the words he is in the habit of using ; he can express himself clearly orally or in writing; he can figure 
127    
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
correctly and with moderate facility within the limits of practical 
need; he knows something about the globe on which he lives. So 
far there is no difference between a man educated in the modern 
sense and a man educated in any other sense. 
There is, however, a marked divergence at the next step. The 
education which we are criticizing is overwhelmingly formal and 
traditional. If objection is made to this or that study on the ground 
that it is useless or unsuitable, the answer comes that it “ trains 
the mind” or has been valued for centuries. “* Training the mind” 
in the sense in which the claim is thus made for algebra or ancient 
languages is an assumption none too well founded ; traditional 
esteem is an insufficient offset to present and future uselessness. 
A man educated in the modern sense will forego the somewhat 
doubtful mental discipline received from formal studies ; he will be 
contentedly ignorant of things for learning which no better reason 
than tradition can be assigned. Instead, his education will be 
obtained from studies that serve real purposes. Its content, spirit 
and aim will be realistic and genuine, not formal or traditional. 
Thus, the man educated in the modern sense will be trained to 
know, to care about and to understand the world he lives in, both 
the physical world and the social world. A firm grasp of the phys- 
ical world means the capacity to note and to interpret phenomena ; 
a firm grasp of the social world means a comprehension of and 
sympathy with current industry, current science and current politics. 
The extent to which the history and literature of the past are util- 
ized depends, not on what we call the historic value of this or that 
performance or classic, but on its actual pertinency to genuine need, 
interest or capacity. In any case, the object in view would be to 
give children the knowledge they need, and to develop in them the 
power to handle themselves in our own world. Neither historic 
nor what are called purely cultural claims would alone be regarded 
as compelling. 
Even the progressive curricula of the present time are far from 
accepting the principle above formulated. For, though they include 
things that serve purposes, their eliminations are altogether too 
timid. They have occasionally dropped, occasionally curtailed, 
what experience shows to be either unnecessary or hopelessly 
unsuitablé. But they retain the bulk of the traditional course of
-P-A-G-E-141
SPECIALIZED AND GENERAL EDUCATION 129 
study, and present it in traditional fashion, because an overwhelm 
ing case has not — so it is judged — yet been made against it. If, 
however, the standpoint which I have urged were adopted, the 
curriculum would contain only what can be shown to serve a pur- 
pose. The burden of proof would be on the subject, not on those 
who stand ready to eliminate it. If the-subject serves a purpose, 
it is eligible to the curriculum ; otherwise not. I need not stop at 
this juncture to show that “serving a purpose,” “ useful,” “ gen- 
uine,” “ realistic,” and other descriptive terms are not synonymous 
with “ utilitarian, materialistic,” ‘‘ commercial,” etc., for intel- moe 
lectual and spiritual purposes are genuine and valid, precisely as 
are physical, physiological, and industrial purposes.! 
The answer in florid and perfervid terms offered by a 
champion of the classics is as follows : : 
I have left myself only a few words to sum up and define the 
main issue raised by the so-called modernist reform of education. 
It is not the place of physical science in our civilization and in our 
universities: that is secure. It is not the opportunity of industrial 
or vocational training for the masses: we all welcome that. It is 
not the conversion of the American high school into the old Latin- 
verse-writing English public school: nobody ever proposed that. 
It is not the prescription of a universal requirement of Greek or 
the maintenance of a disproportionate predominance of Latin in 
our high schools and colleges: there is not the slightest danger of 
that. It is the survival or the total suppression, in the comparatively 
small class of educated leaders who graduate from high schools 
and colleges, of the very conception of linguistic, literary, and 
critical discipline ; of culture, taste, and standards; of the historic 
sense itself ; of some trained faculty of appreciation and enjoyment 
-of our rich heritage from the civilized past; of some counterbal- 
ancing familiarity with the actual evolution of the human man, to 
soften the rigidities. of physical science, and to check and control 
‘by the touchstones of humor and common sense the a friori de- 
ductions of pseudo-science from conjectural reconstructions of the 
evolution of the physical and animal man.

130 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
It is in vain that they rejoin that they too care for these things, 
and merely repudiate our exclusive definitions of them. That is, in 
the main, only oratorical precaution and the tactics of debate, as, 
if space permitted, I could show by hundreds of citations from their 
books. The things which, for lack of better names, we try to 
suggest by culture, discipline, taste, standards, criticism, and the 
historic sense, they hate. Or, if you prefer, they are completely 
insensitive to them and wish to impose their own insensibility upon 
the coming generation. They are genuinely skeptical of intellectual 
discriminations which they do not perceive, and zsthetic values 
which they do not feel. They are fiercely resentful of what they 
deem the supercilious arrogance of those who possess or strive for 
some far-off touch or faint tincture of the culture and discipline 
which they denounce as shibboleths, taboos, and the arbitrary 
conventions of pedants. 
From their own point of view it is natural that they should 
deprecate with sullen jealousy the inoculation of the adolescent 
mind with standards and tastes that would render it immune to 
what one of them has commended in print as the “science” of 
Elsie Clews Parsons. The purpose, or, at any rate, the tendency 
of their policies is to stamp out and eradicate these things and 
inculcate exclusively their own tastes and ideals by controlling 
American education with the political efficiency of Prussian autoc- 
racy and in the fanatical intolerance of the French anticlericalists. 
Greek and Latin have become mere symbols and pretexts. They 
are as contemptuous of Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Racine, 
Burke, John Stuart Mill, Tennyson, Alexander Hamilton, or 
Lowell, as of Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, or Horace. They will 
wipe the slate clean of everything that antedates Darwin’s Descent 
of Man, Mr. Wells’s Research Magnificent, and the familiar pathos 
of James Whitcomb Riley’s vernacular verse. 
These are the policies that mask as compassion for the child 
bored by literature which, they say, it cannot be expected to appre- 
ciate and understand, or behind the postulate that we should 
develop zesthetic and literary sensibilities only by means of the 
literature that expresses the spirit of modern science, not that 
which preserves in amber the husks of the dead past."

SPECIALIZED AND GENERAL EDUCATION 131 
Tue THEORY OF SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR DIFFERENT 
CLASSES OF PEOPLE 
Both writers above quoted are speaking of those learners 
who are to have large opportunities of higher education. 
What is to happen to the common masses, to whom the 
last writer grants the ‘‘ opportunity of industrial or vocational 
training,” is still in doubt. There are, however, disputants 
who are trying to settle this question also. To illustrate we 
may borrow from a pamphlet issued by a great commercial 
organization in its campaign for legislation which should 
transform the school system of the city of Chicago and the 
state of Illinois. 
STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES 
Definition: Vocational education includes all forms of special- 
ized education, the controlling purposes of which are to fit for useful 
occupations, whether in agriculture, commerce, industry or the 
household arts. 
1, State aid is necessary to stimulate and encourage communi- 
ties to carry on work in vocational education, but local communities 
should be permitted to initiate and should partly maintain such 
courses or schools. 
2. The vocational schools should not compete or interfere with 
the present public school system, but should supplement it by pro- 
viding practical instruction in vocational lines for youth between 
fourteen and eighteen who have left the present schools. To guard 
against-any competition with the public schools as now organized, 
a special tax should be levied for the support of vocational schools, 
which, with the State grant for their support, should not be taken 
from the funds now provided by law for the support of the public 
school system. 
3. The proper expenditure of State moneys for vocational 
schools should be fully safeguarded, while at the same time the 
initiative in adapting measures to local conditions should be left 
with the local authorities. To secure these ends the general man- 
agement and approval of these courses and schools should be left
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
to a State commission, while the local initiative and direct control 
should be exercised by a local board composed of employers, skilled 
employees and local superintendents of schools. 
4. An efficient system of vocational education requires different 
methods of administration, different courses of study, different 
qualifications of teachers, different equipment, different ways of 
meeting the needs of pupils and much greater flexibility in adapt- 
ing means to ends than is possible under the ordinary system of 
public school administration. For these reasons these schools 
should be under a separate board of control, whether carried on 
in a separate building or under the same roof with a general 
school, so that they may be free to realize their dominant purpose 
of fitting for useful employment." 
If the last two quotations are stripped of their decorations, 
they reveal a demand for a distinct class system of education. 
Broad education is for the few. Specialized education is 
another matter, —let it be developed for the masses. 
’ 
Pusuic DEMAND FOR A NEw CURRICULUM 
It is interesting to note that the masses, so far as they 
can express themselves, are asking for a change in the 
traditional curriculum and are likely to get it. The masses 
are expressing their demands through the courses sought 
by their children. 
Our problem will perhaps be clearer if we turn from the 
writings of those who discuss these matters to the changes 
which are actually going on in the schools of the country. 
CommercrAL Courses In Hic ScHoors 
High schools in all parts of the country are giving 
commercial courses in increasing degree. The first type of 
industrial education to be extensively cultivated in the 
United States was commercial education. This consisted in 
1 Vocational Schools for Illinois, pp. 1-2. Published by the Commercial 
Club of Chicago.
-P-A-G-E-145
      
  SPECIALIZED AND GENERAL EDUCATION 133 
training for clerical positions and was carried on for the 
most part in private “business colleges.” The reason for 
the early demand for this particular kind of training is to be sought in the fact that America has for years been a 
country devoted on a vast scale to exporting raw materials. 
Commercial training, which has to do with the shipping of 
goods, was accordingly the first to grow here. The extent 
of the demand for commercial training is vividly set forth 
in a report of the City Club of Chicago published in 1912, 
which contains the following chart : 
ENROLLMENT IN PRIVATE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND 
IN PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS OF CHICAGO1

  Fie. 12 
The high schools of the country entered into competition 
with the private commercial schools, and for some years the competition has been running high. The private schools 
solicit and get a large patronage on the ground that they 
do not teach anything that is useless. They give short, 
compact courses fitted to pupils’ needs. The high schools 
point out that the short courses leave the stenographer with 
a meager vocabulary and the clerk with no outlook on life. 
1 A Report on Vocational Training in Chicago and in Other Cities, p. 38. Published by the City Club of Chicago, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-146
134 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The public schools are gradually pulling ahead of their 
competitors because they are employing a higher grade of 
teachers than formerly and are doing the work in a fashion 
which is technically more complete. In the meantime the 
commercial courses are becoming more “ respectable” and 
are being taken by a better grade of students. The effect 
of the election of commercial courses by a better grade of 
students is such as to modify the whole program of the 
school in the direction of more attention to the needs and 
practices of business life. 
AcriculruraL HicH ScHooLs 
A second type of vocational course appears in the high 
schools of rural communities where much attention is being 
devoted to agriculture. Indeed, the increase in the number 
of high schools in the country in recent years has been very 
largely due to the fact that rural communities have taken 
an interest in carrying the training of pupils beyond the 
rudimentary subjects of the elementary curriculum. 
This movement relates itself to the development of a 
department of agriculture in the Federal government and 
to the generous subsidy through that department for agri- 
cultural experiments in centers of education in all the states. 
Three years ago a large Federal subsidy was set aside for 
the further promotion of agricultural demonstrations and 
schools, and the recently enacted Federal legislation for 
industrial education includes provision for more agriculture. 
PaRT-TIME COURSES 
A third movement which has recently attracted a great 
deal of attention and favorable comment was started in the 
engineering school of the University of Cincinnati and is 
known as the part-time plan. Classes are organized in such 
a way that their members spend one week or one month in 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
   
    SPECIALIZED AND GENERAL EDUCATION 135 
the shop of some manufacturing plant and the next period 
in school. A second group alternates in the reverse order, 
so that the shop and the school are at all times engaged 
in regular work. Where this plan is well organized, there 
is a special school officer, called a correlator, who sees to it 
that there is some direct connection between the shop work 
and the courses taken up in the schools. 
The part-time plan aims to supply that mixture of prac- 
tical opportunity and training in science, mathematics, and 
the academic subjects which will lead to both vocational 
efficiency and a general education. 
Various Types oF TRADE SCHOOLS 
(Fourth, there are all kinds of schools for young people 
in the trades.) Some of these hold their sessions at night, 
when the working day is over, and others are organized to 
take the young worker out of the shop or store for a limited 
number of hours during the working day. In the matter of 
instruction some give only special training intended to make 
the worker more skillful; others give general courses in 
civics, or history, or even in literary subjects. 
Some of these schools for workers are organized by the 
corporations which employ the workers. Thus, telephone 
companies and dry-goods stores find that it is economical to 
train their employees. Some of the schools are conducted 
by the school system and are provided with pupils either 
through the voluntary demand on the part of learners or 
through the operation of state laws or municipal ordinances 
compelling children to attend such schools until they are 
of a certain age. 
Fifth, trade training is provided not merely for those in the 
trades but also for those who are preparing to enter them. 
Trade schools are sometimes supported out of the public 
purse, sometimes by private endowments. The method of 
 
-P-A-G-E-148

136 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
instruction is that of requiring the learner to go through a 
definite series of exercises which will give him skill in the 
trade. The strictly technical training is usually supplemented 
by some “ general” training. 
The following quotation gives a brief summary by one 
specialist in vocational education of the writings of another 
specialist in the same field : 
THE MANHATTAN TRADE SCHOOL, NEW YORK CITY 
This trade school for girls is now a part of the public-school 
system of New York City. Its early history as a privately sup- 
ported institution is of absorbing interest, and has been tersely 
written by Mrs. Mary Schenck Woolman, in her book entitled 
“The Making of a Trade School.” In this volume she gives an 
interesting account of the first experiment in the United States to 
deal in an adequate way with the problem of furnishing vocational 
training and guidance to children destined to enter industrial life, 
otherwise wholly unprepared, at the earliest possible age. 
The aim of the school is frankly stated to be the giving of help 
to the youngest wage earners, but its ideals are of considerable 
breadth. They are to demonstrate to the community what educa- 
tion is needed for “ the lowest rank of women workers ” in order 
that a girl may become self-supporting and adaptable, “ under- 
stand her relation to her employer, to her fellow workers, and to 
her product,” and value health and moral and_ intellectual 
development. 
The necessity for this effort was found in the unfortunate 
social and economic conditions, and especially in the lack of 
opportunity for progressive work. “After several years spent in 
the market” the girl was found to be little better off than on 
her entrance into industrial life. 
After investigation, trades were selected in which are used the 
sewing machine (foot and electric power), the paint brush, paste 
brush, and needle. In organizing instruction all unnecessary waste 
was eliminated; short, intensive courses were planned to give 
knowledge and skill in the technical aspects of the selected trade, 
and to develop mental alertness on the part of the worker. It has 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
      SPECIALIZED AND GENERAL EDUCATION 137 
been observed that “the academic dullness which is shown at 
entrance comes frequently from lack of motive in former studies.” 
The fundamental importance of health and the value of trade art 
as a help to progress are given special emphasis. 
' The supreme value of the school’s trade-order business, as an 
educational asset, is shown in the following quotation : 
It provides the student with adequate experience on classes of ma- 
terial used in the best workrooms; these girls could not purchase such 
materials and the school could not afford to buy them for practice. ‘The 
ordinary conditions in both the wholesale and the custom trade are 
thus made a fundamental part of instruction. Reality of this kind helps 
the supervisor to judge the product from its trade value, and the teach- 
ing from the kind of workers turned out. Through the business relation 
the student quickly feels the necessity of good finish, rapid work, and 
responsibility to deliver on time.’ The businesslike appearance of the 
shop at work on the orders, and the experience trade has had with 
the product, have increased the confidence of employers of labor 
in the ability of the school to train practical workers for the trades. . . . 
The business organization and management required in the adequate 
conduct of a large order department can itself be utilized for educa- 
tional purposes. 
A chapter devoted to representative problems makes an illu- 
minating analysis of the difficulties which must be met and 
solved by those organizing schools for workers in the lower 
grades of industry. While the instruction must be direct and 
specific, some preliminary general training is needed, and work in- 
tended to awaken vocational interests should also be provided. 
Mrs. Woolman believes that all this might and should be given 
in the public elementary school. Other difficulties are the keeping 
of the school organization flexible and sensitive to ever-changing 
trade conditions, and in “close contact with industrial and social 
organizations of workers in settlements, clubs, societies, and 
unions, that all phases of the wage earner’s life — pleasures, aims, 
and needs—may be appreciated.” There is the difficulty of 
securing suitable teachers, and of working in harmony with the

  138 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
PrAcTICAL APPLICATIONS AS Parts oF ACADEMIC 
CouRSES 
The effect of these experiments in vocational education is 
clearly discernible in the traditional courses. Reading books 
are beginning to include extracts which deal with practical 
matters. Mathematics textbooks are presenting more than 
ever before practical problems drawn from commercial, 
trade, and agricultural life. Science, both in elementary and 
advanced forms, is turning to practical applications. In 
short, there is going on a kind of intellectual compromise 
which will eventually make training in skill an accepted 
part of a general training. 
General training has until recently been so proud of itself 
that it has not willingly accepted association with courses 
designed to cultivate skill. The result is that the common 
man has gained the impression that there is a wide gulf 
fixed between general education and practical life. One 
hopeful symptom of the present situation is that discussions 
of general education are becoming very much more demo- 
cratic. To be sure, there are examples of the proud 
exclusiveness of former days still to be found in the writ- 
ings of those who do not understand the reach of modern 
reforms in the curriculum, but these cases are likely to 
become fewer as the years pass. In the meantime the 
practical world is making long strides in the direction of 
an appreciation of the value of a general education. The 
shop mechanic should read. He should be independent in 
his cultivation of contact with the most recent movements 
in his trade. The teacher who teaches reading is coming 
to recognize this as clearly as does the employer, and very 
shortly the idea that reading is an artificial somewhat, culti- 
vated exclusively for purely intellectual reasons, will give 
way to the broader view that even the artisan gains in 
efficiency by reading.
-P-A-G-E-151
    SPECIALIZED AND GENERAL EDUCATION 139 
When that time comes there will be no room for the 
theory that there should be a different school for the trades- 
man and the professional class. There will be differentiation 
within the courses. There will be an elective opportunity 
for each pupil which will adapt the curriculum to his special 
needs, but there will be no industrial school on the other 
side of the street, with a separate course, a different kind 
of teacher, and a different governing board. Such a cleav- 
age of social interests would be disastrous to the academic 
subjects quite as much as to the practical subjects. Academic 
life cannot bury itself in the past; it must make its contri- 
bution to the activities of the present. 
Stupies oF SociaL ACTIVITIES 
Nowhere is the future more clearly forecast than in the 
new lessons which are being introduced into both the ele- 
mentary schools and the high schools for the purpose of 
teaching social organization. Under the title ‘“ community 
civics” or ‘‘lessons in community and national life” the 
social sciences are beginning to offer to the lower schools 
an exposition of the life of the people who make up society. 
These courses, like all new applicants for admission to the 
crowded curriculum, are finding some difficulty in making 
their way into the school. In spite of these handicaps the 
movement toward the introduction of social studies into the 
general school is now sufficiently under way to be described 
as one of the most hopeful innovations in the curriculum. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
What would be the effect on a community of putting different 
social classes of children into different schools? Is this done in 
any degree? Is the principle involved in such a suggestion different 
in its essentials from the elective system ?

than in a school which gives general academic courses also ? 
Should agriculture be taught in city high schools? It is some- 
times argued that the country school should have a course of study

      CHAPTER X 
EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
A GENERAL SociaL Movement 
It would be a mistake to treat the innovations in the 
course of study which were discussed in the last chapter as 
concessions to a narrow demand for mere gain through the 
better training of workmen. To be sure, there are some 
who would be willing to curtail the educational opportunity 
of the common people in order to insure that type of con- 
tentment which is supposed to dwell in the mind untrained 
in higher ideas. But these are fortunately not likely to 
succeed in their plans. The movement for a better indus- 
trial training is part of a larger movement for a broader 
social and economic life for all. The important fact about 
the whole movement is that changes within the school 
parallel a general effort to deal with all the problems of 
modern life as problems of popular education. 
No exhaustive study of educational extension can be 
undertaken in the short compass of a single chapter. In- 
deed, there is hardly more than space to enumerate the types 
of activity which enter into this movement. Confining our- 
selves, then, to this very modest effort, the following out- 
line will serve as a rough classification of the major phases 
of the school-extension movement. 
First, there are activities of pupils which lie outside the 
school but are systematized and promoted through the 
supervision of the school. Second, there are organized 
efforts to supplement and enlarge school work by adding to 
the opportunities offered to pupils out of school hours or 
141

| 
during vacations. Third, there are continuation courses 
offered in the schools for adults who have been limited in 
their educational opportunities. Fourth, there are various 
forms of educational propaganda through which communi- 
ties are to be brought to a more satisfactory economic or 
social status. Fifth, there are legitimate and refined forms 
of entertainment, some intellectual and some purely social, 
which are provided at public expense either in the school 
building or in other meeting places. Some of these social 
activities are directed toward the cultivation of a direct in- 
terest in the schools; some have no special relation to 
schools. Sixth, there is at present a great movement for the 
spread of education through correspondence schools. 
Following this outline, concrete examples of each type of 
activity may be briefly described. 
CREDIT FOR Home ACcTIVITIES 
First, the extension of school supervision is illustrated by 
the fact that in a township high school the girls who are 
taking cooking are required to do each day a certain amount 
of laboratory work in the kitchen at home. This is reported 
by the parents, and the cooking teacher visits the homes 
from time to time to inspect the work. Again, in many 
agricultural schools home gardening is required as a part of 
the course. Sometimes a school officer is employed to keep 
up the supervision of this home work during the vacation 
period. Another series of examples under this heading is 
to be found in those systems where miscellaneous home 
activities are credited by the school on the report of parents. 
The following quotation taken from Superintendent Alder- 
man’s book on home credits shows how far the matter has 
been carried in some quarters :

Below is the Spokane County plan. 
BULLETIN FOR TEACHERS: HOME CREDITS 
The following are the rules and reward offered for home work. 
This work is to be done during the school week. No one is com- pelled to enter this contest, and the pupil may drop out at any time. 
All work must be voluntary on the part of the pupil. Parents 
are requested not to sign papers for pupils if the work is not 
voluntarily and cheerfully done. 
The rewards for this work are : 
One half-holiday each month to the child who has earned one hundred or more home credits, and has not been absent or tardy 
for the month; also 5 per cent will be added to his final examina- 
tion. The pupil who earns one hundred or more credits each 
month but fails in perfect attendance will have the 5 per cent added to his final examination. 
In addition, the board of directors may offer a prize to the pupil in each grade who shall have the greatest amount of home 
credits, and shall be neither absent nor tardy during the term, or 
from the adoption of these rules.

144 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The following statement is made by Superintendent McFarland 
as to the effect home credits had on attendance in 1913-1914: 
We attribute the increase in our attendance this year in the schools 
of Spokane County, outside the city of Spokane, largely to the Home 
Credit System and our certificates for perfect attendance. While the 
enrollment was 108 less than last year, yet our attendance was 16,712 
days more. At the present rate of 16 cents per day, the pupils earned 
for the county, from the State appropriation, nearly $2700 more than 
last year. With the same enrollment as last year the increase of appor- 
tionment would have reached approximately $6000. 
The credit slip for the school week provides for a daily record 
of “chores or work done” from Monday to Friday inclusive. It 
does not contain a stated list of duties; the blanks are to be filled 
in by the child. The list of home credits is furnished each district, 
but the teacher uses her judgment in allowing credit for any chore 
peculiar to her locality.’ 
In Greeley, Colorado, the high school gives credits for 
courses taken in the Sunday schools. The teachers, under 
this plan, must be approved by the school authorities and 
the work must be graded. In many schools credit is given 
for music taken at home. Sometimes the results of this 
instruction are examined, sometimes not. In the latter 
cases teachers are sometimes approved by the school and 
their work then accepted without further question. 
RELATION or Home Work To TRADITIONAL ScHOoL WoRK 
All these examples make it clear that the school organ- 
ization is being used to systematize activities which without 
school credits are carried on very irregularly. The supervi- 
sion of the school is undoubtedly of advantage to the activi- . 
ties. Is the draft made on the supervisory energy of the 
school legitimate ?. The answer to this question is, in some 
cases, undoubtedly no. Thus, if the school is not supplied

EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 145 
by the public with supervisory energy beyond that commonly 
devoted to the routine of ordinary school work, it is difficult to 
manage without distraction some of these new kinds of credits. 
Again, if outside activities are allowed to take the place 
of regular school courses, the dangers become even more 
apparent. The advocates of the home credit system assert 
that the drawbacks are slight and offer examples to show that 
there is no conflict, but rather help for the school work. 
A boy in one of the Portland, Oregon, schools had trouble with 
his spelling, getting a mark of only 4$ on a scale of 10. Soon 
after home credits were put into use by his teacher he came to her 
and anxiously inquired if he could help out his spelling grade with 
a good home record. The teacher graciously assured him that he 
could. The boy brought in each week one of the very best home 
record slips, and in some mysterious manner his spelling improved 
as his hours of work increased. He does not need his home record 
to help out his spelling grade now, for last month he received more 
than a passing mark, 74, in his weak subject. The knowledge that 
there was help at hand relieved his nervousness, and gave him 
confidence.* 
Artrr-Scuoot CLAsses AND VacaTIon CLASSES 
The second type of extension to be noted is that which 
adds to the regular school work by giving supervised .oppor- 
tunity outside the ordinary curriculum, 
One example is that of a high school which tried the 
experiment of requiring manual training. The students 
grumbled a good deal about the course because it was so 
different from their other work. The course was abandoned. 
- In its place was opened a voluntary class after school hours 
to which only students who secured a high grade in their 
regular work were admitted. There was a larger demand 
for the course than the shop could satisfy.

146 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Vacation schools are often supported by groups of citizens 
interested in providing for pupils who have to remain in 
the city during vacation and have no suitable employment 
or recreation to keep them off the streets. So valuable is 
this addition to school work that it is very often taken over 
by the school system. 
A great deal of school gardening is being encouraged by 
finding vacant lots or providing land in unsettled districts. 
School supervision sometimes cannot be extended to cover 
this work. This movement has been evolved during the 
recent campaign for food cultivation and conservation into 
a general social movement. 
‘Athletics are sometimes organized under school supervi- 
sion; sometimes only advisory help is furnished by the 
schools. The playground is opened to pupils after school 
hours or a special playground is provided. The matter of 
supervised play is important enough to justify a full discus- 
sion in a later chapter. 
Some schools are providing moving-picture exhibitions 
out of hours for the pupils. The experiment has been suc- 
cessfully carried out by charging enough for such entertain- 
ments to pay their cost, the school thus furnishing only the 
place and the organization. 
All these examples show that there is an unused margin 
of time and energy which pupils will use somewhere. Espe- 
cially in cities it becomes a serious problem to insure whole- 
some conditions for the use of this surplus. If the pupils 
need further opportunities and the schools can provide them, 
it is certainly legitimate to carry out such plans. To be really 
educational all these activities need supervision. Supervi- 
sion, of course, means either more expenditure of money to 
secure additional supervisors or an increased demand on 
the energies of present school officers. The present provi- 
sion for instruction and supervision is seldom excessive. 
Expansion, therefore, ought to be faced as a new demand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 147 
ConTINUATION CLASSES FoR ADULTS 
Continuation courses for adults are intended to carry on the schooling of people who for some reason or other have 
found it necessary to stop ordinary school work. In many 
cases continuation classes are conducted at night in what is 
commonly known as night school. Here there are two types of courses, one designed to give training in the conventional 
academic subjects, the other to give greater efficiency in the practical occupational life of the student. As an example of general courses not connected with industries we may cite the special courses for immigrants which have of late been 
matters of an especially urgent campaign by the Bureau of Education, as indicated in the following paragraphs from a paper by Mr, Wheaton, the specialist’ on immigration in the bureau : 
Education, however, is the most potent force toward inculcating 
American ideals and impulses. The English language and a knowl- edge of the civic forces of the country are indispensable to the alien in adjusting himself to America. Through our common speech comes understanding. Without it the pages of our newspapers are meaningless and ordinary matters of business with Americans must be transacted through the medium of an interpreter. Only by over- coming inability,to speak English, by eliminating illiteracy among aliens, and by instilling the ideals, attitudes, and habits of thought 
of America, can we hope to make real American citizens of the strangers within our gates... . 
The education of children of immigrants in the day schools has always been considered a primary and essential function of the school system. But the training of adults in English and civics has not been generally so considered. Evening schools, through which only can adults be reached effectively, have usually been regarded merely as adjuncts to the day-school system, and hence are main- tained when funds can be spared or eked out. Adequate facilities for the adult are rarely organized and maintained as an organic 
part of the educational system with a specific appropriation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
148 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
unified supervision. In fact, education of immigrants has been left 
too largely to the well-intentioned but sporadic interest and effort 
of private organizations and individuals. The provision of public 
facilities may, therefore, be treated at present and for some time to 
come as a legitimate extension activity for educational systems. 
Tt is with this latter conception in mind that the United States 
Bureau of Education has for a considerable period been actively 
engaged in promoting the extension of facilities for the education 
of immigrants over the compulsory attendance age. Authority to 
undertake this extensive program is derived from the organic act 
creating the bureau in 1867 and from various acts of Congress 
making appropriations for the purpose of promoting industrial and 
vocational training, the elimination of illiteracy, and the cause of 
education generally.* 
The industrial phase of continuation education was noted 
in the discussions of the last chapter. It remains only to 
add that the industrial courses for adults have done much 
to make available for mature workers the kind of training 
which the school is now beginning to give to children. 
Continuation classes are often provided by organizations 
outside of the schools, such as the Christian associations 
for young men and women, and labor unions, and through 
private endowment. 
DEMONSTRATIONS AS MEANS OF ECONOMIC AND 
SoclaL IMPROVEMENT 
The fourth type of educational activity may be described 
as educational propaganda. The Federal government, espe- 
cially through its Department of Agriculture, has promoted 
scientific farming where there was no initial impulse on the 
part of farmers to go to school. This work was supported, 
especially in the Southern States, by the General Education

Board. It sometimes took the form of an appeal to the 
boys and girls as well as to adults. A typical case is set 
forth in the first report of the General Education Board. 
A club consists essentially of a group of boys varying in number from twenty-five to one hundred, and ranging in age from ten to eighteen. Corn and cotton are both cultivated, but corn is pre- ferred: first, because the South needs more corn; secondly, be- cause corn lends itself better to study and selection. As a Tule, each member works a plot of one acre. The county superintendent 
of education is usually in charge. . . . 
Driving through Macon County, Alabama, not long ago, two strangers observed, in a large field of ordinary corn, a patch stand- 
ing out like a miniature skyscraper. They dismounted to interview 
the owner. A Negro boy approached. 
“Is this your corn?” 
“Ves, sir.” 
“How did you come to grow it?” 
“One of Dr. Knapp’s men showed me, sir.” 
“Why did you plant it so far apart in the rows?” 
“ Because, sir, most all that grows comes from the sunshine and 
the air.” 
“When did you plow?” 
“Last fall, sir.”

“To make plant food during the winter.” 
“Where did you get your fertilizer ?” 
“From the bottom, sir.” 
“How many times did you cultivate?” 
“ Six times, sir.” “Why 2?” 
“ Because there’s water down next to the clay, and when I don’t plow the sun draws it all away.” 
“When did you put in the cowpeas ?”” 
“ After the last plowing, sir.” 
“What did you do that for?” 
“ Because the cowpeas get out of the air nitrogen, and put back in the ground about as much as the corn takes out.”

150 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
How many valuable lessons had this remote Negro lad learned 
from doing one job right! But this is not the end of the story. 
His double crop was worth $52. From his pocket he pulled a dirty 
little pass-book, the entries in which showed what the crop had 
cost. Reckoning his own time at ten cents an hour and his father’s 
mule at a dollar a day, he netted a profit of $30 to the acre. His 
younger sister, it appeared, had had an equally profitable quarter 
of an acre in cotton. Three years later both were students at 
Tuskegee, paying for their education with the money earned as 
club workers." 
Equally impressive examples could be supplied of trans- 
formations in homes brought about by demonstrations in 
cooking, house decoration, and costume design given by 
teachers of domestic science and household art. 
ENTERTAINMENT AS PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL 
PROGRAM 
The problem of providing proper entertainment for people 
in the city and proper places for the coming together of 
social groups in country and city communities is one of the 
serious problems of modern life. The church serves less 
than it used to the purposes of a meeting place for the 
community. The schools have been called on to help solve 
this problem. The extent to which the demand exists is 
illustrated by the following quotation from the Cleveland 
survey”: 
According to the custodians’ reports the total after-class lettings 
of school accommodations during 1914-15 numbered 3,469. Of 
these, 462 were for mothers’ club meetings, class dances, pupil

society meetings, pay. entertainments, bazaars, or some other kind of purely school function and 3,007 were lettings to outside organ- izations. A large part of the latter consisted of clubs or Sunday- school classes connected with some 27 different churches which, along with two dozen or more specifically named athletic societies, 
sought the use of school gymnasiums and showers for basketball and similar indoor games. The varied character of the bodies which hired the auditoriums, club and class-rooms can best be discovered 
from a perusal of the following partial but representative list.

These names show concretely what a wide range of Cleveland’s social elements are nowadays seeking the kind of facilities which a modern school edifice possesses. In the majority of cases these groups were obliged to pay custodians’ fees ranging from 30 cents to $5.00 an evening depending on the size of the quarters used. That fact attests the genuineness of this demand and its vigor is further evidenced by the rapid growth in volume which, as shown in the following table, has practically doubled during the past two years.

ASSOCIATIONS AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE IMPROVEMENT OF 
ScHOOLS 
A social organization which is of special importance to the 
schools is the parent-teachers’ association, which is coming to 
be a common adjunct of every school. Such an association 
often helps the school te secure equipment which it needs, 
and furnishes a useful avenue for the dissemination of ideas 
with regard to school policies. Sometimes the school officer 
finds that the proper relation of the association to school 
administration needs definition. He then falls back with 
satisfaction on the words of a recent writer in the Adlantic : 
Running a school or a class is a technical or expert job. It 
cannot as a rule be done by an untrained person; and untrained 
people, seeking to break in, are likely to do more harm than good. 
The School situation, indeed, resembles the situation in medicine 
fifty years ago. The practice of medicine at that time was atro- 
cious ; but it had to be improved, and it was improved by doctors, 
not by laymen. I shall not spare the schools; but schools must 
be improved by schoolmen — and they will be. 
We have then reached this point. Intelligent parents wish to 
have a say in the education of their children. But schools must 
be conducted by trained persons. The training of these persons 
is, however, largely antiquated. Are we not deadlocked ? 
I think not. Parents cannot tell teachers what to do or how to 
do it. But what they can do is to ask questions. They can, like 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 153 
the man from Missouri, require “to be shown.” At first blush, this 
may not look like very much, But if my readers will bear with 
me for a moment, perhaps they will see that the right and the 
duty of asking “to be shown,” of asking persistently and continu- 
ously “Why?” “Why?” gives parents all the leverage they need 
or can use in making over the education of their children. 
Our schools could not be perfect. I won’t even stop to argue 
that they can all at a bound make themselves much better than 
they are. Parents cannot possibly make many practicable sug- 
gestions by way of improving them. But just because we all 
know so little, just because schoolmasters are so hampered by 
tradition and organization, just because parents are so helpless in 
making practicable suggestions, for these very reasons thé com- 
placent following of traditions is the most inexcusable of attitudes. 
The schools which are now too conventional, too complacent, too 
free from deep-seated and unhappy doubts, should be tentative, 
inquiring, investigating, skeptical in their point of view. They will 
be assisted in becoming tentative, inquiring, skeptical, and experi- 
mental if parents will, year after year, make them tell why, make 
them show zw/y. For when people are called on to show why, they 
begin to look into what they are doing, and out of this critical 
scrutiny will come doubt, invention, and finally something living 
in place of something long since dead.1 
CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS 
This discussion has not included, as. perhaps it should, 
university extension, libraries, rural-community organization, 
and other agencies. It must, however, make reference to 
one popular movement which has grown in recent years 
to proportions that are literally vast. The correspondence 
schools of this country do an enormous amount of more or 
less valuable teaching, The qualifying phrase ‘‘ more or less 
valuable” is justified by the fact that many of the corre: 
sporidence schools are purely commercial enterprises and

provide a very low grade of courses. The number of such 
schools, ieee shows the demand for education, the evi- 
dence in this case being the stronger when we recognize 
that in many cases the quality of instruction is not such as 
to encourage the student.

The list of activities which carry education far beyond 
the limits of the traditional curriculum could be extended. 
A complete list would include newspapers and magazines 
with their lessons on health, on food and economic problems. 
It would include the churches and many social organizations. 
The purposes of the present exposition have, however, been 
adequately served if the reader has been impressed by the 
popular demand for a broad educational program. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
Complications sometimes arise in the matter of credits, not 
from the fact that they are given within a certain institution but 
rather from the fact that a second institution to which students 
go cannot deal with the credits. Suppose that a certain high 
school gives credit for gardening. Should the college accept the 
credit toward admission? Is it legitimate to substitute Sunday- 
school courses for senior English ? 
What would you want to know about a music teacher before 
crediting her pupils with a high-school credit in music? How 
would you find out how much work the music pupil had done? If 
you think an examinationsa good method, would you give credit 
for typewriting to a boy who learned to write outside of school 
and could pass an examination ? 
The distinction between an education and school credits is 
sometimes painfully evident. Describe cases in which the effort to 
get credits interferes with school work. 
When a community is very enthusiastic about social centers, it 
often asks the board of education to open the schools at night.

EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 155 
Should the board charge a fee or give the use of the building 
without charge? In case the board does not have money enough 
to furnish the children with playground apparatus, should it give 
the use of buildings free?

CHAPTER XI 
PRINCIPLES INFLUENCING THE ORGANIZATION 
OF THE CURRICULUM 
Necessity oF PRAcTICAL DECISIONS IN SPITE 
or CONFUSION 
With the expansions in education that have been reviewed 
in foregoing chapters, there has come a certain confusion 
and uncertainty of practice which sometimes tends to lower 
the standards of work in the school. 
Consider a concrete case. A small city can afford to offer 
only a limited number of courses in its high school. Shall 
the choice fall on Latin or typewriting ? Among the sciences 
shall botany or chemistry be provided? Botany would re- 
late itself well to agriculture, and chemistry would be a 
basis for domestic science. Sometimes in the effort to meet 
both demands, weak courses are tolerated, and teachers are 
either overloaded because they are called on to carry heavy 
programs or are inadequately compensated in the effort to 
provide a sufficient number to do all the work demanded, 
Nor is it the school alone which is confronted with the 
necessity of choosing; the individual student must elect. 
There is a high school in a small city in Illinois, as shown 
by the last report of the North Central Association of Col- 
leges and Secondary Schools, which enrolled in 1915 four 
hundred and sixty-one students. This school offered twenty- 
three units in academic subjects and twelve units in voca- 
tional subjects. If each pupil took five units a year, which 
would be a very heavy program, he would be able to com- 
plete in four years only twenty units, or fifteen less than the 
156 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
   PRINCIPLES OF THE CURRICULUM 157 
school offers. Another high school in the same state with 
an enrollment of five hundred and thirty-two students offers 
an aggregate of forty-four units. 
Finally, there are choices to be made within these choices, 
because after the decision has been reached that botany is 
to be taught, the teacher must select from the abundant 
material within this science that which seems most produc- 
tive. The student, also, gives more attention to one sub- 
ject than to the others which he is pursuing, thus exhibiting 
another kind of selection. 
Choices have to be made, and every choice has back of 
it some prejudice or some clearly thought-out principle or 
some experience collected by the teacher or pupil through 
contact with earlier educational problems. Our business in 
this course is, first, to become aware of the chief reasons 
for the choices actually made in schools, and, second, to 
take up some of the evidences which justify one or the 
other of these reasons. The present chapter will be devoted 
to a brief statement of the principles most commonly urged 
as the basis of choice. 
Tue Doctrine or DiscrPLinE 
The historical reason for training children which has come 
down to us from the religious traditions of the Middle Ages, 
and more directly from the austere beliefs and practices of 
the Puritans, is the supposed demand for a curbing of the 
naturally perverse tendencies of children, for a disciplining 
of nature into a higher form of morality. This reason has 
in more recent times been phrased in new terms. The 
mind, it is said, must be made strong through struggle with 
difficulties as the athlete becomes skillful and muscular 
through training. If the training seems for the time being 
monotonous and overvigorous, well and good; the end 
justifies the effort. This is the doctrine of discipline.    
-P-A-G-E-170
158 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
THE eee or NaturaL EpucaTION IN THE ForM 
F THE DOCTRINE OF FREEDOM 
Against the notion of discipline there has been matched, 
especially in the last century, the opposing notion that all 
good qualities are natural and will express themselves freely 
if the artificial restraints of life are removed. Rousseau, in 
his famous attack on social conventions, pointed out the 
truth that the child is naturally an eager learner. Biology 
reinforced Rousseau’s teachings with the doctrines of natural 
selection and the survival of the fittest, meaning by the fittest 
those able to take on complete adaptation to the present 
environment. The belief that nature is a safe guide has led 
to the doctrine of freedom for the child in all matters of 
intellectual development. 
CoNCENTRATION AND INTEREST 
The antithesis between discipline and freedom, between 
training which aims to transform the child’s nature and 
training which gives the child’s nature opportunity to express 
itself without restraint, can be illustrated as follows. On the 
one side it is said that children have no power of concen- 
tration of attention. They are flighty and erratic. They 
must be made to think steadily in order to train their minds 
for hard mental work. On the other side it is asserted that 
when a child’s interest is aroused through an appeal to his 
natural tastes he will exert his mind to the limit of its powers, 
and this is all that can advantageously be required. 
PopuLaR ATTITUDE TOWARD DISCIPLINE 
When the antithesis between discipline and natural inter- 
ests is presented to the present-day world, it must be said 
that there is a widespread disposition to set aside discipline 
as arbitrary and puritanical. Our generation is in favor of 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  PRINCIPLES OF THE CURRICULUM 159 
natural development. Perhaps it would be truer to use the 
past tense in the last statement because the social attitude 
toward discipline has been profoundly affected by the war. 
Never in the history of this country has the lesson been 
clearer than it is at the present that social codperation 
means the training of the individual to make some sacrifices. 
The American school has carried the elective system and 
its concessions to individuals to an extreme which is likely to 
be limited somewhat in the future by a recognition of social 
obligations. 
Examples oF DISCIPLINE AND FREEDOM 
It may be well to illustrate this abstract discussion of dis- 
cipline and freedom with concrete examples. One of the 
most emphatic pronouncements in favor of the doctrine of 
freedom is that of Madam Montessori, an Italian physician 
whose system of education has been much heralded in this 
country as a substitute for the kindergarten. According to 
this writer’s views the pupil should have perfect freedom. 
The contrast with the kindergarten is described as follows 
by one of the observers of the two institutions : 
A contrast between the Montessori school and the kindergarten 
of the more formal and traditional type may serve to give a clearer 
picture of the Montessori procedure, and consequently of the 
Montessori conception of liberty as it appears in practice. The 
most evident difference is seen in the function of the teacher. 
The kindergartner is clearly the center and arbiter of the activity 
in the room. The Montessori directress seems, on the contrary, 
to be at one side. The kindergartner contemplates at each moment 
the whole of her group; the directress is talking usually to one 
alone — possibly to two or three. The kindergarten children are 
engaged in some sort of directed group activity; each Montessori 
child is an isolated worker, though one or more comrades may 
look on and suggest. The arrangement of the room shows the 
same contrast. The kindergarten has a circle about which all may 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
160 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
gather, and tables for group activity. The Montessori room is 
fitted, preferably, with individual tables, arranged as the children 
will. (In the writer’s observation, there has been little deviation, 
however, from arrangement in formal rows.) Montessori provides 
long periods, say of two or more hours, while the kindergarten 
period rarely goes beyond a half-hour. During the period assigned 
for that purpose practically all of the Montessori apparatus is avail- 
able for any child (except for the very youngest or the newest 
comers), and the child makes his choice freely. The kindergartner, 
on the other hand, decides very nicely what specific apparatus 
shall be used during any one period. The Montessori child abides 
by his choice as long as he wishes, and changes as often as he 
likes; he may even do nothing if he prefers. The child in the 
traditional kindergarten uses the same apparatus throughout the 
period, and is frequently led or directed by the teacher as to what 
he shall do. At other times he may be at liberty to build or repre- 
sent at will whatever may be suggested by the “ gift” set for the 
period. The Montessori child, each at his own chosen task, works, 
as stated, in relative isolation, his nearest neighbors possibly 
looking on." 
At the other end of the educational system we find the 
example of “stiff” courses in college designed to “ weed 
out” the slothful and incompetent. The “stiff” course is 
required mathematics, or a foreign language, or a course in 
English composition. Opposition to stiff courses expresses 
itself in the demand for an undiluted elective system in 
which the student may take whatever serves his purposes. 
Naturat EpucaTioN AND RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES 
The advocacy of a natural education takes a different 
turn when it drops the word “freedom” and emphasizes 
the fact that individuals differ radically in their native 
capacities. Some pupils have an aptitude for one kind of 
1 William Heard Kilpatrick, The Montessori System Examined, pp. 14-15. 
Riverside Educational Monograph. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1914. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
    PRINCIPLES OF THE CURRICULUM 161 
work, others for other types. The school is to-day com- 
mitted to a recognition of these differences and to a study 
of their meaning. There is a movement known as the 
vocational-guidance movement which is ‘making progress 
in the direction of the discovery of methods for finding 
out what studies can properly be undertaken by students in 
view of their varying natural endowments. The individual’s 
natural bent being discovered, his educational training can 
be directed to the highest possible cultivation of his powers. 
Nature is thus recognized but is not made the dominant 
fact. The vocational end is the controlling factor in the 
situation, The attainment of this end may require the 
most rigid disciplining of one’s powers. The direction of 
this disciplining is dictated by nature, but not the particular 
steps of education. As a result of such a discussion it 
begins to appear that there is no fundamental reason for 
the abandonment of the idea of discipline even if there is a 
complete recognition of natural individual differences. 
In concrete cases the opposition to the doctrine of disci- 
pline may, however, be acute. The pupil may say that he 
has absolutely no natural capacity for algebra or spelling. 
The teacher may answer that these are universal require- 
ments and that there is no escape from these necessary 
studies because of individual differences. In such a dispute, 
tradition, on the one hand, and the wider opportunities of 
the modern curriculum, on the other hand, are likely to be 
arrayed against each other. Algebra as the conservative sub- 
ject is likely to defend the view that discipline is necessary, 
whereas manual training and domestic science are likely to 
emphasize the natural attractiveness of the practical training 
which they offer. Thus it has come to pass that certain sub- 
jects, especially the older subjects in the curriculum, have 
come to be regarded as the defenders of the doctrine of 
discipline, while the newer subjects have often been regarded 
as opposed by their very. character to the doctrine.
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
NATURAL EDUCATION AS TRAINING FOR LIFE 
Still another turn is given to the discussion by an 
emphasis on the social demands of later life. As society is 
constituted, individual differences are sure to play a large 
part in determining success or failure. Furthermore, society 
as constituted in its commercial organizations accepts without 
hesitation the principle of division of labor. Why should 
not the school be like society? Why should not the school ' 
be a miniature world with all the different types of life that 
will later become real to the pupils? Practical needs thus 
come into the foreground. 
TRAINING IN THE METHODS OF KNOWLEDGE AND 
GENERAL TRAINING 
Two views are sometimes offered in opposition to the 
doctrine of a strictly practical training. First, it is said 
that the pupil in order to prepare for later life must pass 
through certain forms of training which are preliminary, 
intended to set up his mental machinery before it begins to 
produce anything. Otherwise expressed, it is said that the 
pupil must get the tools of knowledge before he tries to 
take part in real life. 
Second, it is said that there is no possibility in the 
complex society of the modern world of foreseeing just 
what will be the practical needs of pupils when they grow 
to adult life. It will therefore be better, it is argued, to 
aim at a broad flexible training which can in due time be 
turned into any channel that circumstances may dictate. 
EXAMPLES OF VIEWS ON ForMAL TRAINING 
The dispute which is introduced by these opposing: 
statements is one of the bitterest in modern educational 
writings. Let us borrow two quotations which will present
-P-A-G-E-175
        PRINCIPLES OF THE CURRICULUM 163 
the case in detail. Frank M. McMurry has given in his report 
on the schools of New York City a striking example of the 
advocacy of direct and constant attention to social needs. 
In giving the quotation from this author it is possible to 
include incidentally his description of an earlier view of the 
curriculum which emphasizes general training or methods 
of thought rather than special content. 
PROMINENCE OF CURRICULUM IN DETERMINING 
QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION 
Thirty years ago the belief was often expressed that it made 
little difference what one studied, but all the difference in the 
world with whom one studied. That belief made almost any 
curriculum acceptable, and directed attention to the personality 
of the teacher and to method as the principal factors determining 
the effectiveness of instruction. 
That belief, however, has been greatly modified. While no one 
will deny the importance of the teacher’s personality, most per- 
sons will admit that the proper expression of personality and skill 
in method are both greatly dependent upon the subject matter of 
the curriculum. Carefully selected subject matter is prerequisite to 
skill in method of presentation. Without a good curriculum there 
is bound to be great waste. 
BASES FOR JUDGING CURRICULUM AND SYLLABI 
1, By RELATION OF SUBJECT MATTER TO CHILDREN’s PURPOSES 
In harmony with the previous discussion of standards for judg- 
ing the quality of instruction, as a whole, the quality of the cur- 
riculum in particular is to be determined partly by its tendency to 
influence the tastes, purposes, and hopes of children. Any cur- 
riculum for the elementary school should have its content selected 
from among those experiences of mankind that have seemed most 
valuable. That is to be presupposed. But this selection can be 
indifferent to the tendencies, interests, and capacities of children in 
general, and of certain ages in particular, and aim only at present 
Storage of facts and ideas that may count in a dim future, ie,
-P-A-G-E-176
164 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
in adult life. Or it may be made with constant reference to the 
abilities, tastes, and needs of children at the present time. In 
the former case, motive on the part of children is overlooked ; in 
the latter case, the extent of provision for it is accepted as one 
of the standards by which the curriculum is to be judged. We 
represent the latter point of view.’ 
The group of thinkers to whom McMurry refers with 
disfavor as absorbed in methods rather than content has 
never been more ably represented than by President 
Hadley, extracts from whose statement are as follows : 
Greek is an intellectual game where the umpires know the rules 
better than they know the rules in the game of French, for in- 
stance, or history, or botany. A man’s rating in an examination on 
any one of these last three subjects is largely the result of accident 
unless the examiner is quite unusually skillful. A man’s rating in 
Greek, on the other hand, means something. There never were 
intellectual competitions keener than the classical competitions at 
Oxford in the days when the best men in England wanted their 
sons to learn that particular game. 
Unfortunately, a large number of the strongest men, both in 
England and in the United States, have decided that this game 
takes more time than it is worth. Personally, I believe that this 
change of mind is in many respects a misfortune; that in trying 
to get more practical results in the way of knowledge or culture a 
great many American college boys have lost the training which the 
Greek would have given them and gained nothing of equal value 
in its place... . 
It was a mistake for the advocates of the old curriculum to 
think that all the students required the same treatment. It is, I 
believe, an equal mistake for the advocates of the elective system 
to think that each student requires a different treatment. For while 
there is a very large number of subjects of interest to study, and 
an almost infinite variety of occupations which the students are 
going to follow afterwards, there is a comparatively small number

School System of the City of New York, 1911-1912, Part II, p. 265. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
      PRINCIPLES OF THE CURRICULUM 165 
  of types of mind with which we have to deal. If we can have 
four or five honor courses, something like those of the English 
universities, where the studies are grouped and the examinations 
arranged to meet the needs of these different types, we can, I 
think, realize the chief advantages of the elective system or the 
group system without subjecting ourselves to their evils. I am 
confident that we can secure a degree of collective intellectual 
interest which is now absent from most of our colleges, and can 
establish competitions which will be recognized not only in college 
but in the world as places where the best men can show what is 
in them. ; 
It may be objected that any such arrangement would render it 
difficult for a boy to study the particular things that he was going 
to use in after life. I regard this as its cardinal advantage. The 
ideal college education seems to me to be one where a student 
learns things that he is not going to use in after life, by methods 
that he is going to use. The former element gives the breadth, the 
latter element gives the training. 
Format Discipuine AND TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
The controversy here illustrated has led to the devélop- 
ment of a number of technical phrases. The doctrine that 
emphasizes form or method as opposed to content is known 
as the doctrine of formal discipline. The advocates of this 
doctrine defend the vicw that tfaining gained in one field 
will transfer to other fields of activity. Stated in these terms 
the doctrine is referred to as that of the transfer of training. 
The doctrine of transfer of training is capable of experi- 
mental and statistical verification or refutation. A vast body 
of evidence has been collected in recent years. The conclu- 
sions to be drawn from this evidence are clear. There are 
certain general habits, such as concentration of attention 
and power of arranging and expressing ideas, which carry 
over from one field of experience to another. The transfer

the University, New Haven, 1909.   
-P-A-G-E-178
166 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
of training is facilitated if the original training is given 
in such a form that it lends itself readily to application in 
new spheres of thought. So important is the development 
of general habits that it is entirely legitimate to proceed at 
every stage of education slowly enough to give to each sub- 
ject its relations through a variety of possible applications. 
It is recognized as impossible to give in the schools direct 
special training for all possible lines of activity upon which 
the pupil is to enter. Some effort must be expended in cul- 
tivating what may properly be called the applying attitude of 
mind. Once the applying attitude is aroused in any indi- 
vidual, the transfer of training will be likely to go on through 
individual recognition of the advantages of application. 
RELATION OF SuByecTs TO Maturity or Pupits 
The quotation from McMurry given some pages back sug- 
gests another aspect of this whole matter which has been 
a subject of much dispute. When should certain kinds of 
training be introduced into the curriculum ? A quotation will 
help to make the problem clear. 
So far as high-school instruction is concerned, the most impor- 
tant practical question raised in the present discussion is whether 
the ability to learn a foreign vocabulary varies with age. It is 
almost universally claimed that a student must begin a language 
when young in order to learn it effectively and economically. In 
opposition to this theory, we shall maintain, as in the case ‘of 
motor skill, that a foreign vocabulary can be learned just as 
economically at the later end of the period from six to eighteen 
years of age as at any other part of it. As the basis for this con- 
tention we have some very closely related evidence from experi- 
mental psychology, in the work done upon facility in memorizing 
at different ages.’

PRINCIPLES OF THE CURRICULUM 167 
If the statement here quoted is accepted, it still remains 
an open question whether the pronunciation of a foreign 
language is worth acquiring and whether pronunciation is 
to be sought as an important element of the study, for if it 
is, there is little doubt that young children acquire it more 
easily and more accurately than do older persons. 
The example is introduced not for the purpose of 
attempting a settlement of the question but for the purpose 
of showing that the organization of the curriculum raises 
questions which are now answered for the most part on 
the basis of mere prejudice, but should be answered in the 
light of a body of broad, scientific evidence. Certainly the 
problem of the distribution of a pupil’s studies through 
the various periods of his mental development is one of 
the most important of these problems. 
SUMMARY 
The doctrine of discipline holds that it is desirable by training 
to transform in some measure the natural tendencies of the 
child’s mind. : 
The general doctrine of natural education emphasizes the im- 
portance of following the lines of natural development in education. 
Often this doctrine is so formulated as to be opposed to the 
doctrine of discipline. 
When dealing with the intellectual side of the pupil’s nature the 
doctrine of discipline takes the form of a demand for cultivation 
of concentration, Natural education asserts the right of the child 
to his personal interests and is liberal in making concessions to 
these interests. 
The form of the doctrine of natural education most directly 
opposed to the doctrine of discipline is the doctrine of freedom. 
According to this view the pupil should be left to follow his 
natural impulses. 
Another form of the doctrine of natural education recognizes 
the differences between individuals as important considerations 
in governing their training.

lee : 
‘Training for practical life is a very common basis for the 
organization of the curriculum and has been amply illustrated 
in earlier chapters. 
Training in the methods or tools of knowledge is in some 
measure opposed to the demand for practical training. 
Training of general intelligence is advocated because it gives 
the student greater freedom in adjusting his career to the circum- 
stances of later life. 
Training in the forms of knowledge, or formal training, some- 
times called formal discipline, is practically synonymous with 
training of general intelligence. 
The doctrine of transfer of training is one formulation of the 
doctrine of formal discipline. Evidence is abundant that transfer 
takes place. Its degree and the methods of securing it are sub- 
jectsof vigorous investigation. 
The adaptation of training to the maturity of pupils is one of 
the most important requirements in arranging a curriculum. Ina 
later chapter this will be discussed under the title “ Periodicity in 
the Pupil’s Development.” 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
The arguments for and against disciplinary subjects should be 
followed in detail. Thus, why so much arithmetic in the lower 
school? Is it necessary to have as much as we do in the upper 
grades, even admitting its value in the lower grades? Are 
students of higher mathematics practical men? 
A child brought up in an indulgent home is sometimes pointed 
out as a horrible example of a child brought up with unlimited 
freedom. Is the example just? What are the different meanings 
which may attach to the term “freedom ”? 
What does maturity on the part of a pupil mean? What are 
the marks of increasing maturity? Can maturity be produced by 
deliberately adopted school methods ? 
What elements of one’s own education can be traced to the 
demand on the part of some teacher or parent for discipline ? 
Was the demand when put into actual operation in the school 
successful in producing general improvement in one’s ability ?

appealing to men of ordinary experience in their efforts to secure 
an education? Booker Washington used to say that he found 
many people desiring an education in order that they might escape 
from hard work. Is this a common desire? Is it legitimate? Is 
it harder to earn one’s living by composing music or by keeping 
books? Why do men want an education ?

CHAPTER XII 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
ADAPTATION OF CURRICULUM TO INDIVIDUAL PUPILS 
A number of times in the last few chapters the discussion 
has been brought to the point of recognizing the importance 
of individual differences. The teacher cannot determine 
merely from a knowledge of history what history is suitable 
for a given type of pupils. In the elective system of the 
high school and of the college there is a liberal recognition 
of the principle that instruction must be adapted to individ- 
uals, both in content and method. The present chapter will 
be given over to a treatment of some of the individual dif- 
ferences among pupils which are of dominant significance 
in formulating the curriculum. 
Low Grapes OF INTELLIGENCE 
The most striking example of individual deviation from 
the average grade of intelligence is to be found in’the cases 
of those unfortunates who continue throughout life to be 
deficient because they have underdeveloped nervous systems. 
As a result of heredity or pathological conditions in early 
childhood a certain number of persons, conservatively esti- 
mated as two in every thousand, are permanently subnormal. 
These cases vary in degree. The lowest grade defectives, 
known as idiots, are defined in the Report of the British 
Royal Commission on the Feeble-minded as persons “so 
deeply defective in mind from birth or from early age that 
they are unable to guard themselves against common physi- 
cal dangers.” The less defective are classed as imbeciles, 
+170 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 17s 
feeble-minded, and morons, each class representing a further 
approach toward normality. 
The lower grades of defectives are so dependent on the 
care of others that they ‘do not reach the school at all, but . 
the higher grades either escape detection until they try to 
learn reading and arithmetic or through the persistence of 
parents are brought to school in the hope that their defec- 
tiveness may be temporary. Some of the highest grades 
succeed in learning enough so that they pass out of the 
first grade. They do not master reading, but they learn to 
repeat the words sufficiently to deceive the teacher with the 
appearance of having recognized the printed symbols.) 
DIFFERENTIATED COURSES 
v As soon as a defective child is discovered, it is advan- 
tageous for him and for the other pupils in the school that 
he be given some form of special training. In most cases 
it is more than useless to try to give him the ordinary 
school courses. He cannot learn to read well enough to 
enable him to get information from books. He can, on the 
other hand, acquire some of the simple arts of self-support. 
It would be better for all concerned to give up the effort to 
teach such a child reading. ~ 
The major objection to.a program of this type is that it 
is sometimes extremely difficult and, in the early years, often 
quite impossible to decide whether the child is really defec- ° 
tive or is merely slow in development. (Some children come 
to their normal powers slowly, but ultimately reach a level 
of intellectual and physical efficiency so high that they are - 
not to be classed with the defectives. One hesitates, there- 
fore, to give up the teaching of reading in the case of a 
particular child until all possibility of his development is 
past. It is better to err on the side of too great training 
than to despair at too early a date. ;

172 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION , 
Tests oF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 
In the effort to discover defectives various systems of 
tests have been devised. The general assumption back of 
all these systems is that a defective child is one whose 
mental development has prematurely ceased. For example, 
a twelve-year-old child may be behind in his development to 
such an extent that he has a mind like a four-year-old. If, 
now, it can be determined what mental powers are possessed 
by an ordinary four-year-old and if the defective can be 
shown to possess the same powers, and no more, it is pos- 
sible to adapt instruction to his real intellectual needs. 
Technical students of the problem have accordingly drawn 
the distinction between physiological age and mental age. 
In the example cited above the- physiological age is twelve ; 
the mental age, four. 
A system of tests of this kind has another use. (tf a 
child is put through the tests at intervals of a year, it can be 
ascertained whether he is improving or standing ‘still. In 
this way some of the uncertainties as to the permanence or 
temporary character of his deficiencies can be removed. 
Tests of the type under discussion are called tests of 
general intelligence. An example taken from one of the 
most widely used systems, namely, the Binet-Simon series, 
will serve to show what the tests are and how they are 
used, The special form of the test here quoted is that 
worked out by Professor Terman. His exposition of one 
of the fifth-year tests is as follows: : 
Materials. It is necessary to have two weights, identical in 
.shape, size, and appearance, weighing respectively 3 and 15 grams. 
Hf manufactured weights are not at hand, it is easy to make sat- 
isfactory substitutes by taking stiff cardboard pill-boxes, about 
1} inches in diameter, and filling them with cotton and shot to the 
desired weight. The shot must be embedded in the center of the 
cotton so as to prevent rattling. After the box has been loaded to 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 173 
the exact weight, the lid should be glued on firmly. If one does 
not have access to laboratory scales, it is always possible to secure 
the help of a druggist in the rather delicate task of weighing the 
boxes accurately. A set of pill-box weights will last through hun- 
dreds of tests, if handled carefully, but they will not stand rough 
usage. The manufactured blocks are more durable, and so more 
satisfactory in the long run. If the weights are not at hand, the 
alternative test may be substituted. : 
Procedure. Place the 3- and 15-gram weights on the table before 
the child some two or three inches apart. Say: “You see these 
blocks. They look just alike, but one of them is heavy and one is 
light. Try them and tell me which one is heavier.” Tf the child 
does not respond, repeat the instructions, saying this time, “ 7@// 
me which one is the heaviest.” (Many American children have 
heard only the superlative form of the adjective used in the 
comparison of two objects.) 
Sometimes the child merely points to one of the boxes or picks 
up one at random and hands it to the examiner, thinking he is 
asked to guess which is heaviest. We then say: “ Vo, that is not 
the way. You must take the boxes in your hands and try them, like 
this” (illustrating by lifting with one hand, first one box and then 
the other, a few inches from the table). Most children of 5 years 
are then able to make the comparison correctly. Very young 
subjects, however, or older ones who are retarded, sometimes 
adopt the rather questionable method of lifting both weights in 
the same hand at once. This is always an unfavorable sign, 
especially if one of the blocks is placed in the hand on top of the 
other block. 
After the first trial the weights are shuffled and again presented 
for comparison as before, ¢hzs time with the positions reversed. The 
third trial follows with the blocks in the same position as in the 
first trial. Some children have a tendency to stereotyped behavior, 
which in this test shows itself by choosing always the block on a 
certain side. Hence the necessity of alternating the positions. 
Reserve commendation until all three trials have been given. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the three comparisons are 
correct. If there is reason to suspect that the succgssful responses 
were due to lucky guesses, the test should be entirely repeated. 
’
-P-A-G-E-186
174. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Remarks. This test is decidedly more difficult than that of 
comparing lines. It is doubtful, however, if we can regard the 
difference as one due primarily to the relative difficulty of visual 
discrimination and muscular discrimination. In fact, the test with 
weights hardly taxes sensory discrimination at all when used with 
children of 5-year intelligence. Success depends, in the first place, 
on the ability to understand the instructions; and in the second 
place, on the power to hold the instructions in mind long enough 
to guide the process of making the comparison. The test presup- 
poses, in elementary form, a power which is operative in all the 
higher independent processes of thought, the power to neglect the 
manifold distractions of irrelevant sensations and ideas and to drive 
direct toward a goal. Here the goal is furnished by the instruction, 
“Try them and see which is heavier.” This must be held firmly 
enough in mind to control the steps necessary for making the 
comparison. Ideas of piling the blocks on top of one another, 
throwing them, etc., must be inhibited. Sometimes the low-grade 
imbecile starts off in a very promising way, then apparently forgets 
the instructions (loses sight of the goal), and begins to play with 
the boxes in a random way. His mental processes are not con- 
secutive, stable, or controlled. He is blown about at the mercy of 
every gust of momentary interest.

from a proper system of training supernormal children than 
from special provisions for the subnormal. Since defense 
is of the most vital importance, we may say that society 
had at the outset to defend itself against the harm that 
might be done by subnormals. But defense having been © 
provided in adequate degree, attention should turn to the 
possibilities of great benefit which may be expected from 
special training of the unusually bright. 
Various devices have been suggested for the treatment 
of the supernormal. In general, the principles underlying 
these suggestions are the same as the principles for the 
treatment of subnormals. (Separate the unusually bright 
and give them a type of training which will best develop 
their personal powers. 
In a school system which has only a few special cases of 
the one type or the other it is extremely difficult to follow 
the suggestion of special training for special levels of ability. 
The matter must be left in such cases to the ingenuity of 
the teacher. (fhe bright pupil should be given extra work 
‘and, so far as possible, special attention. (The dull child 
should be allowed to do some useful handwork.) Where the 
system is larger, special rapid classes — express classes, as 
they have sometimes been called —should be organized for 
the bright pupils, while slowly moving classes are provided 
for the backward pupils, 
Sex DIFFERENCES 
Leaving the degrees of intelligence, we turn to a distinction 
which is of an entirely different type — the difference between 
boys and girls. 
It is difficult to disentangle this problem from a mass of 
social considerations which attach to it. Women and girls 
have grown up under a social system that has assumed on 
their part fundamentally different tastes and interests from 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
those of men and boys. The social system has sometimes 
expressed itself in terms which imply inferiority of women 
as compared with men. It is natural, therefore, that at a 
period when women and girls are taking a new place in 
the social scheme, there should be at first a good deal of 
attention given to the demonstration that women are not 
inferior to men. The simplest demonstration can, of ‘course, 
be given by putting girls into the same classes with boys and 
requiring of them the same intellectual tasks. For some 
years past the experiment has been under way. Girls have 
shown themselves not only quite as competent intellectually 
as boys but in some respects superior. 
During the period of experimentation, however, there 
has persisted a difference in tastes and interests; and the 
demand for a special training for girls was never louder 
than to-day when the proof that girls are quite as competent 
as boys seems to be incontrovertible. 
The reasons for this demand are connected in part with 
the later practical uses to which girls expect to put their 
training and in part with the fact that girls give attention to 
certain groups of facts which boys neglect, while boys, on 
the other hand, have their special spheres of interest. 
For example, boys are always brought up to interest 
themselves in mechanical appliances. When a boy comes 
to study natural science, therefore, it is easily possible to 
introduce the subject by examples of a mechanical type. 
Parents do not give girls mechanical toys, society assumes 
that girls will not engage in occupations which. call for a 
knowledge of machinery, consequently they do not readily 
take up courses in physics which begin with mechanics. 
The present situation, then, is something like this: girls 
are proved to be equal to boys in school ability, but continue 
with the full sanction of society to have tastes and interests 
different from those of boys.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 177 
DIFFERENCES IN INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SEXES 
AND CORRESPONDING DEMANDS FOR TRAINING 
The contrast in industrial demands which the school must 
meet in dealing with boys and girls who are preparing for 
clerical positions is shown in the following summary of 
conclusions reached by the Cleveland survey : 
Training for boys and girls should be different in content and 
in emphasis. 
The usual course of study in commercial schools is suitable for 
girls and unsuitable for boys. 
A girl needs, chiefly, specific training in some one line of work. 
She has a choice among stenography, bookkeeping and machine 
operating. 
A boy needs, chiefly, general education, putting emphasis on 
writing, figuring, and spelling; general information; and the 
development of certain qualities and standards. 
Boys’ training looks forward to both clerical work and business 
administration ; but as clerical work is a preparation for business 
and is likely to occupy the first few years of wage-earning, training 
should aim especially to meet the needs of clerical positions. 
Clerical positions for boys cover a variety of work which cannot 
be definitely anticipated and cannot therefore be specifically trained 
for. But certain fundamental needs are common to all. 
Most of the specialized training for boys should be given in 
night continuation classes. 
Girl stenographers need a full high school course for its educa- 
tional value and for maturity. Girls going into other clerical 
positions can qualify with a year or two less of education; but 
immaturity in any case puts them at a disadvantage. 
Boys’ training, for those who cannot remain in school, should 
be compressed into fewer than four years. Immaturity in the case 
of boys is not a great disadvantage.'

178 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
To many readers not prepared by a full consideration of 
the facts the above conclusions may seem untenable. A brief 
section of the argument will therefore be important in carry- 
ing conviction. This argument is presented in the following 
quotation : 
If we wish to generalize broadly about the work of boys and 
girls we can say with truth that the majority of boys begin as 
messengers or office boys and subsequently become clerks or do 
bookkeeping work. As men they remain in these latter positions 
or, in at least an equal number of cases, pass on into the pro- 
ductive or administrative end of business. The majority of girls, 
first and last, are stenographers or to a less extent, assistants in 
bookkeeping or clerical work. There are of course boy stenogra- 
phers and girl clerks, and there are women in general administrative 
work; but that these are a minority this report has several ways 
of showing. 
Boys’ work may be expected to take on the characteristics of 
the business that employs them; girls’ work remains in essentials 
unchanged even in totally changed surroundings. For example, a 
boy who is clerk in a wholesale house will have work very unlike 
that of the boy who is clerk in a bank ; but girl stenographers in 
both businesses will have an experience that is practically the same. 
Boys’ work, within limits, is progressive ; girls’ work in its gen- 
eral type — with individual exceptions — is static. Boys as a rule 
cannot stay at the same kind of work and advance; girls as a 
rule stay at the same kind of work whether or not they advance. 
Boys in any position are expected to be qualifying themselves for 
the “job ahead,” but for girls that is not the case. Boys may ex- 
pect to make a readjustment with every step in advancement. 
Each new position brings them to a new situation and into a new 
relation to the business. Girls receive salary advancement for in- 
creasingly responsible work, but any change in work is likely to be 
so gradual as to be almost imperceptible if they remain in the 
same place of employment. If they change to another place those 
’ who are stenographers have a slight readjustment to make in 
getting accustomed to new terms and to the peculiarities of the 
new persons who dictate to them. Bookkeeping assistants may 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 179 
encounter different systems, but their part of the work will be so 
directed and planned that it cannot be said to necessitate difficult 
adaptation on their part. The work of clerical assistants is so sim- 
ple and so nearly mechanical that the question of adjustment does 
not enter. These girl workers do not find that change of position 
or firm brings them necessarily into a new relation to the business. 
Even moderate success is denied to a boy if he has not adapta- 
bility and the capacity to grasp business ideas and methods ; but a 
comparatively high degree of success could be attained by a girl 
who possessed neither of these qualifications. A boy, however, 
who has no specific training which he can apply directly and defi- 
nitely in work would be far more likely to obtain a good opening 
and promotion than a girl without it would be. 
The range of a boy’s possible future in commercial occupations 
is as wide as the field of business. He cannot at first be trained 
specifically as a girl can be because he does not know what busi- 
ness will do with him or what he wants to do with business. The 
girl’s choice is limited by custom, She can prepare herself defi- 
nitely for stenography, bookkeeping, or machirle operating and be 
sure that she is preparing for just the opportunity — and the whole 
opportunity — that business offers to her. Her very limitation of 
opportunity makes preliminary choice and training definitely pos- 
sible things. 
HovusEHoLp Arts As Extras 
There is another respect in. which the present-day training ° 
of girls differs from that of boys. Girls are being trained 
in the science of home-making. Where a girl intends to 
take up some vocation in the business world, her desire for 
courses in the household arts complicates the situation very 
seriously. The boy who is going into business wants a gen- 
eral education plus some business training. The girl wants 
all that the boy has plus household arts.

  180 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Demanp For NEw CoursEs FOR GIRLS 
The demand for the complete education of girls gives 
rise to many unsolved problems. For example, shall physics 
as at present taught be required as an introduction to cook- 
ing, or shall the cooking course be made to carry all the 
physics that the girl needs? The course in physics, be it 
remembered, contains many an example that is drawn from 
the boy’s sphere of interests in mechanics and does not 
appeal at all to the girl’s interests. 
- Or one may ask a similar question about economics. 
Shall the girl be given a special course in marketing in 
which examples are drawn from the daily activities of home 
life, or shall she wait until she can take the conventional 
course in political economy where the problems are often 
those of international trade and banking? 
It would be impossible to secure anything like unanimity 
for any answer to these questions. The uncertainty in regard 
to the correct answer calls attention to the opportunity which 
is offered to the intelligent women of the teaching profes- 
sion to solve a problem which is new and complicated, but 
all the more important because there are no guideposts to 
mark the way. 
InpivipuaAL DIFFERENCES WHICH APPEAR DURING 
TRAINING 
The individual differences discussed up to this point may 
be described as native differences. In addition, there are 
differences which appear in the'course of training. These, 
  in turn, divide into two classes. There are differences which 
seem to result from. varying degrees of mastery of the sub- 
jects taken in school, and there are differences in taste and 
outlook which arise as the pupils mature to the point where 
they begin to exhibit personal ambitions.
-P-A-G-E-193
  
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 181 
Recent studies of attainments of pupils in school subjects 
show how striking are the differences among individuals. 
For example, it is shown in the Cleveland survey that in 
the fifth grade of one and the same school there are pupils 
who read orally only 7, 8, or 9 lines in a minute, while

  182 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The type of individual difference which develops when 
pupils begin to look forward to their places in the practical 
world is of great significance in organizing school work. 
School experience in this matter is clearly reflected in the 
following resolution adopted in 1915 by the Department of 
Superintendence of the National Education Association : 
Resolved, That we note with approval the increasing tendency 
to establish, beginning with the seventh grade, differentiated 
courses of study aimed more effectively to prepare the child for 
his probable future activities. We believe that as a result of these 
modifications a more satisfactory type of instruction will be 
developed and that a genuine economy of time will result.? 
The differentiation of the curriculum here demanded is 
required in order to keep in school those pupils who have 
reached the point where any simple uniform curriculum 
would fail to furnish the variety which they require to meet 
their developing tastes and their demands for special training. 
Democratic REcoGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
The differentiation of the courses for individual pupils 
was at one time thought to be contrary to the democratic 
principle that all pupils must be treated alike. We are 
coming to see that a democracy has need of many kinds of 
people and that the truest expression of the principle of 
equal treatment is through liberal provision for individual 
differences. f 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
Evidently low grades of intelligence are most likely to be found 
in the lower grades. Is the elimination of low-grade children from 
the regular ‘classes advantageous to them? It is sometimes argued 
that they gain from association with the bright children.

t With regard to the bright children, it is pointed out that the 
may be pushed along too rapidly. How can this danger 
avoided ? 
Are the elections of courses made by students in high school

What types of school work are adjusted, even in the present

individual tutoring? How far should it be insisted that all the 
members of a class be kept together for a year in their attain- 
ments in arithmetic? in Latin? in English literature? in type- 
writing? in laboratory physics ?

of courses be organized with profit to the pupils ? Could a medical

CHAPTER XIII 
‘PERIODICITY IN THE PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 
RECOGNITION OF PERIODICITY IN PRESENT ORGANIZATION 
Both the school curriculum and the general organization 
of the school program in such matters as the length of 
class periods and the forms of order required, reflect the 
fact that the pupil passes through distinct periods or 
epochs in his physical and intellectual development. Each 
of these epochs requires that a certain type of subject-matter 
be used for instruction and that a certain type of school 
discipline be administered.- There is a progressive maturing 
of the pupil and a corresponding broadening and deepening 
of the education which can be given him. The general 
outline of this maturing process will be reviewed in this 
chapter. 
Tue MEANING OF INFANCY 
Before examining the changes which take place during 
school life, it will be instructive to review the general mat- 
ter which has been discussed by John Fiske under the title 
“The Meaning of Infancy.” ! Writing from the point of 
view of the student of evolution, Fiske calls attention to 
the fact that the period of infancy has gradually lengthened 
with the increase in complexity of animal forms. The low- 
est animals have practically no period of infancy. They 
begin their independent lives with all of the capacities 
of the adult. For example, when a unicellular animal is 
1 John Fiske, The Meaning of Infancy. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1909. 
184 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  PERIODICITY IN PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 185 
produced, it results from a division of the parent cell into 
two equal parts. Each part immediately takes up an inde- 
pendent life, and it may be said that adulthood begins at 
birth. Further up the scale the parent organism provides 
protection and food, and the infant requires a longer period 
of time to arrive at adulthood. 
This lengthening of infancy is paralleled by an increase 
in complexity of the animal form itself. The highest stages 
of complexity are reached in man, and here we find also 
the longest period of infancy. - The human infant is help- 
less for years, and the care which parents must give to it _ 
includes not only the provision of food and protection but 
also the gradual training of the child to assume the 
responsibilities of an independent life. 
When viewed by the evolutionist, infancy and even child- 
hood thus appear to be the clearest evidences of the need 
of educational care. Indeed, childhood may be described as 
a period of preparation or of gradual maturing of the powers 
until the individual can carry on his independent personal 
activities, 
Tue Prriop BEFORE ENTERING SCHOOL 
Just as the period of childhood taken as a whole has a 
clearly definable character and purpose in the economy of 
life, so each epoch viithin this period can be set off from 
the others as serving a distinct purpose in the child’s 
development. This is especially clear with regard to the 
years that precede school. In all civilized countries there is 
practical agreement that regular schooling shall begin with 
the normal child in the sixth year. To be sure, {there are 
special institutions like the kindergarten, which receive chil- 
dren at an earlier age, but these institutions aim to serve 
in a somewhat more systematic way the’same purposes that 
under other circumstances are served by home training.  
-P-A-G-E-198
186 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
What is the character of the education given in the home 
or the kindergarten preliminary to the work of the primary 
school? The answer to this question can be given nega- 
tively by saying it is not of a type which belongs to a pub- 
lic institution. When the pupil comes to primary school 
he must be reasonably prepared to live with people who are 
comparative strangers. This implies that he must have a 
sufficient command of language to make his wants known 
and to understand what others want him to do. He must 
be somewhat independent of maternal care, and must be 
ready to be initiated into a social world where his individu- 
ality will be recognized as somewhat detached from that of 
everyone else. Put in positive terms, the pre-school training 
may be described as training in language and in personal 
independence of a very elementary type. 
This statement can be applied to the kindergarten, where 
the purposes of the pre-school training have been brought 
to fairly clear consciousness. The kindergarten gives the 
child much opportunity to play with things that are given 
to him. He must learn to distinguish objects for himself ; 
he must learn to handle them with enough skill so that he 
becomes an independent individual. Second, he must play 
with other children, learning through games that social life 
consists of a give and take which marks him off from 
others and yet makes him responsible to the group. The 
social training of the kindergarten is a preparation for life 
in an institution where the pupil will have to recognize the 
reciprocal duties of life in a large group. Third, the chief 
instrument of social life, and the most important means of 
effective contact with the group, is speech. The kinder- 
garten child, through songs and stories, learns words and sen- 
tences and cultivates the power to which home-training also 
contributes —the power of independent oral communication. 
The kindergarten does in an energetic and systematic 
way what the home does incidentally, for in any home, 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
\ 
PERIODICITY IN PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 187 
however meager its resources, the child learns in five years 
something of his mother tongue and something of the 
demands of group living. The pre-school period is an im- 
portant epoch in education as well as in physical growth. 
We recognize the physical fact that the child must cultivate 
strength enough to run around independently and to use his 
hands in holding what he needs. So it is also in the sphere 
of his mental life ; he must be able to take care of himself. 
THe Primary Pertop OnE or SocraL ImiraTion 
At five or six years of age the pupil comes to the pri- 
mary school, His experience is very limited; his senses are 
open to the impressions of color and sound and touch, and 
he eagerly or timidly mixes in the social group which is 
often to him bewilderingly large and strange. The key to 
the understanding of this period is to be found in the sim- 
ple psychological principle that out of all the bewildering 
mass of childish experience it is persons who attract the 
child’s most vivid attention. The experiences of childhood 
are to be thought of not as meager but as confusing in their 
‘abundance. The world is so full of a number of things 
that one hardly knows where to turn. In the mass of this 
experience one turns to some person and follows in a docile 
way the lead of that person. The first grade is a place 
where children do what others do. First-graders are a flock 
of sheep. The teacher can lead them into almost anything 
because they are eager to do whatever they see others do. 
Sometimes this period is described as a period when 
children are absorbed in sense impressions. This statement 
is true if it means that colors and sounds constitute the 
content of experience. It is false if it is meant to teach 
that little children are absorbed in the study of objects. 
The sounds and colors which hold the attention of primary 
children are those which attach to people. A little child 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
188 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
will give up a plaything which he has in hand for a less 
attractive plaything in the hands of someone else. Primary 
children are social creatures first, last, and all the time. 
This description of the primary child’s mental attitudes 
gives us the formula for the organization of the primary 
course of study. There is an eager desire on the part of 
the first-grader to write his name. He does not need any 
artificial stimulation to undertake writing. Other people 
write; that is enough for him. He is eager to be initiated. 
Other people look into books; he must do the same. The 
period is not a period for nature study in any analytical 
scientific sense. It is a period for social companionships. 
The primary child likes animals as playthings; he is not 
interested in studying their structure. Show an animal to 
a little child and let him ask the questions that are in his 
mind, and social questions are the only ones which will 
come. ‘‘ Where can I get one?” “ Will it bite me?” 
The judgment of the race has been right; this is the 
period for the teaching of reading and writing. The oral 
language which the pupil acquires in the pre-school period 
is the basis on which the primary work must be erected; 
The first reading lessons are lessons in the association of 
known oral symbols with those complicated social devices, 
the printed symbols. The ability to live in society which the 
pupil brings to the first grade must be extended through 
the mastery of language in its written and printed forms. 
The utter absorption of the child of this age in society _ 
rather than in material things is attested by his credulity . 
for fairy tales which are full of people but are grotesquely 
impossible in their description of material facts. In his 
eager desire to illustrate every story he hears, the child pro- 
duces drawings which have very little’ merit as representa- 
tions of things but are often expressive of action in the 
highest degree. A child of this age is keen in his observa- | 
tion of people but neglectful of things. 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  PERIODICITY IN PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 189 
THE Period oF INDIVIDUALISM 
The primary attitude of mind lasts about three years. In 
the normal child nine years of age is a turning point. 
By this time he has learned to read fairly independently: 
He can write and can solve simple problems in arithmetic. 
He has control of some of the simpler objects about 
him. He has imitated his elders until he has habits of his 
own. Now comes a change. Sometimes the change is 
sudden and violent. The pupil who has been laboriously 
writing from copy throws. the example of his copy book to 
the winds and composes a note to one of his friends in a 
rapid, scrawling hand. The child has become an independ- 
ent master of writing for his own private purposes. So it is 
with his other activities. Even in social matters he asserts his 
independence by refusing to follow the dictates of the teacher. 
School discipline suddenly comes to be a serious problem. 
The change here described reflects itself in a fact of 
administration which is of frequent recurrence. Pupils fail 
of promotion in the fourth or fifth grade much more com- 
monly than in the second, third, or sixth. In other words, 
there is here, just after the primary grades, a period of 
- violent readjustment. . 
The readjustment which comes at this point can be 
described by saying that the pupil is entering on a period of 
self-recognition. The primary child is an imitator absorbed 
in social examples. The intermediate child is an individ- 
ualist. He is aware of his own powers and ambitions. The 
boys of this period have been described as young barbarians. 
They are disregardful of the rights of others. They step 
on the little children; they refuse to be friends with the 
girls. They are ambitious to leave school and do something 
to assert their independence. 
The school has dealt with this period with much less 
intelligence than it has exhibited in the primary years, In 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
general, the intermediate grades have followed in subject- 
matter and in methods too closely the ,xample of the 
successful primary . ades. The result appears in the fact 
that the migration out of elementary schools is very com- 
fmon in the fifth and sixth grades. The intermediate grades 
have been described as periods of drill. If there is one 
kind of work that is not appropriate here, it is routine drill. 
There ought to be a new and thoroughgoing study of the 
needs of this period and the introduction of a type of 
instruction which will meet the needs of children who are 
vividly aware of themselves and of their personal relations 
to the world. 
That a change is coming about in the methods of dealing 
with pupils in these years is shown by the fact that the 
elementary school is setting apart the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth grades as the years in which the strictly elementary 
work is to be completed. Much that was postponed to the 
seventh and eighth grades under the older form of organ- 
ization will doubtless be brought down into the intermediate 
grades. The children will no longer be drilled in the forms 
of the social arts while waiting for the enlarged opportunities 
of the upper grades, but will be introduced at once to expe- 
riences with the objects of the physical world. They will be 
encouraged to see things and handle them for themselves. 
Earty ADOLESCENCE AS A PERIOD OF SOCIAL 
CONSCIOUSNESS 
The close of this period of individualism is marked by 
physical and mental changes of a very definite and signifi- 
cant type. From twelve years on the child begins to realize 
anew the social world about him.) Physical changes are 
going on within him that stimulate this type of thought. 
The literature of education has emphasized the fact that at 
this period there is a maturing of the sex organs and an
-P-A-G-E-203
       PERIODICITY IN PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 191 
accompanying development of feelings and interests in the 
opposite sex. There has been doubtless an overemphasis 
on the sexual characteristics of thi: period. The fact is 
that a profound general physical and mental change is 
going forward. 
On the physical side the organism which has been 
accumulating powers through its mastery of the fundamental 
processes of life is now ready for its last large development. 
We shall understand the meaning of this statement only 
when we realize that the organism has to cultivate a whole 
series of internal habits in order that it may be internally 
harmonious. The little child is easily disturbed, for example, 
in his digestion. This means that the habits of digestion 
are not established. The immature nervous organism of the 
pupil needs training to bring it to the point where digestion 
will go forward without interruption or distraction. The 
same is true of circulation and respiration. The organism 
has to learn to live. The school period is a period of mas- 
tery of these internal processes quite as much as a period 
of intellectual training. 
At about twelve years of age the inner coérdination is 
reaching its consummation. If one were to select for dis- 
cussion the most significant physical fact that marks this 
period, one would lay stress on the development of the heart. 
This organ grows rapidly in size and strength. Its more 
vigorous action raises the blood pressure throughout the 
body. Organs which have been slow in their development 
now grow rapidly. The whole life of the individual is in- 
tensified. It is not alone the sex organs which mature; the 
nervous system acts with greater energy, and the muscular 
system develops. In short, a period of the most active 
life sets in. 
The physical vigor of the twelve-year-old and the thirteen- 
year-old child is only part of the explanation of the charac- 
teristic intellectual temper of this period. Just prior to this 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
192 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
period the child, as we have seen, passes through an era 
of marked individualism. The unsocial tendencies of that 
period bring disappointments and new lessons, and finally 
the child is ready for a renewal of his contacts with the 
social group. He cannot now be purely imitative as was 
the primary child, for he has gained. self-consciousness. 
He cannot be content with pure individualism, because his 
experience has broadened so that he sces his. dependence 
on others. A new social era opens. With self-consciousness 
and with a desire to get back into society by accepting its 
ways and complying with its demands, the adolescent seeks, 
albeit somewhat clumsily, a new contact with his fellows. 
The awkwardness of this period, its lack of self-assurance, 
its eagerness for social recognition, are all perfectly clear to 
the student of human nature who has analyzed the case 
of a twelve-year-old pupil. 
Tue New ScuooL ADAPTED TO ADOLESCENCE 
Has the school met the legitimate demand for a suitable 
education of the adolescent? The answer is that the school 
has been slow in meeting this situation. The archaic form 
of school organization which attached the seventh and 
eighth grades to the elementary school has hindered greatly 
a proper recognition of the special needs of adolescence. 
The child of twelve or thirteen does not need a review of 
the elementary work so much as a preparation for the active 
life of adulthood. ‘The adolescent needs ‘to be given an 
insight into the otganization of society. He needs to be 
brought into contact with the ways and languages of other 
peoples. : Fortunately, the keener educational insights of 
the present day are bringing us to a recognition of these 
needs. The school for the adolescent is beginning to emerge 
out of the current reorganizations of the seventh and 
eighth grades. 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
     PERIODICITY IN PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 193 
In many schools these two grades have been gradually 
separating from the rest of the elementary grades. The 
teaching has been organized on the departmental plan; 
that is, a number of special teachers, each dealing with a 
single subject, replace the single teacher who has charge 
of the whole curriculum in the lower grades. Furthermore, 
the curriculum has been enlarged. Manual arts and house- 
hold science have been introduced and, in some cases, other 
subjects which were formerly offered only in the high 
school. A new. type of school, including the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth grades and known as the junior high school or 
the intermediate school, is appearing. 
Where these and like changes have not been made in 
the seventh and eighth grades, criticism has made itself 
increasingly heard because the pupils do not get ahead in 
these grades. The reviews which are sometimes carried on 
at great length in preparation for promotion into the high 
school are a waste of time and energy and leave the pupils 
without enthusiasm for school work and without habits of 
concentration, 
In an earlier chapter it was shown that the seventh and 
eighth grades came from Europe during the decade 1840-— 
1850. Every line of evidence which is taken up points 
to the desirability of a complete reorganization of the work 
of these grades. 
The spread of the junior-high-school idea has been re- 
markably rapid. This is due _to the growing conviction that 
pupils in the seventh and eighth grades require a higher 
type of instruction and discipline than that which is supplied 
in the lower grades. The curriculum is being enriched by 
the addition of. science, foreign language, mathematics other 
than arithmetic, and several of the practical arts. Instruction 
is being intrusted to teachers of broader training, and the 
individual needs of pupils are being more adequately met 
by the introduction of some elective courses.     
-P-A-G-E-206
194 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Later ADOLESCENCE A PERIOD OF SPECIALIZATION 
The early part of the adolescent period which has been 
under consideration in the foregoing paragraphs is followed 
by a period which can be described as the beginning of 
specialization. The fact that individual differences here 
assert themselves and that individual outlooks determine 
the training demanded is clearly recognized in the adoption 
of the elective system by the high school. Special education 
has an adequate foundation in the work of the earlier years, 
and now the student must build his individual career on 
this foundation. He comes to a new period of individualism. 
He is not individualistic in the sense in which the fourth- 
grade boy is when he breaks away from imitating social ex- 
amples. The boy of fifteen to eighteen has passed through 
the first period of individualism and through the socializing 
training of early adolescence ; he now comes to a new type 
of individualistic effort which will fit him for his place in 
the social system. 
The upper limit of this period, as set down in the fore- 
going discussions, coincides with the age at which a normal 
student is now supposed to finish high school. There can 
be very little doubt that with the readjustments going on in 
the seventh and eighth grades there will be far-reaching 
changes in the upper high school also. It is not too much 
to expect that with improved methods of teaching and with 
a better curriculum it will be possible for the normal stu- 
dent to complete at eighteen years of age the first two years 
of the college curriculum. The complete reorganization of 
the higher institutions is thus likely to follow the changes 
which are now under way in the high school. 
The freshman and sophomore years of American colleges 
are at present filled with subjects which are essentially 
secondary in character. The reorganization suggested is 
therefore altogether legitimate.

PERIODICITY IN PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT 195 
Tue ReEorGanizeD Scuoot System 
¥ The scheme of school organization which is in keeping 
with the foregoing study of mental development is as fol- 
lows: Three primary years are to be devoted to the rudi- 
ments of the social arts. Three intermediate years following 
the primary are to be devoted to gaining an outlook on the 
world. Three years covering the period now covered by 
grades seven, eight, and nine are to be devoted to social 
studies and a systematization of knowledge of the world. 
The three years from fifteen to eighteen are to be devoted 
to a completion of general training and to the beginning of 
specialization. After this will come complete specialization. 
Not all students can go through the. full training thus 
outlined. More and more, however, communities will pro- 
vide for, and require the completion of, the whole cycle. If 
a student’s training must be curtailed, there will doubtless be 
an increasing tendency to bring the higher stages down rather 
than to terminate education before ‘preparation for life has 
been carried far enough to give specialized individual training.

  CHAPTER XIV 
SYSTEMATIC STUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM 
Tue CURRICULUM BASED ON AUTHORITY VERSUS 
THE Livinc CURRICULUM 
The six preceding chapters, which have dealt with the 
curriculum, make no pretense of presenting formulated 
courses which can be given to classes. Some reader may 
have been impatient because he did not find there an out- 
line of arithmetic or geography or Latin or English. It 
has been the purpose of these chapters to deal only with 
general principles and general problems. The fact is that 
it would be absolutely futile to lay down a curriculum and 
say of it that it is the true curriculum. The curriculum of 
a school is a living thing. It is constantly undergoing read- 
justments. Its content is drawn from the social life to 
which it introduces pupils, and its arrangement depends on 
the ability of pupils of different ages and different capacities 
to grasp this constantly readjusted content. 
There are some teachers who prefer to have the course 
of study handed down to them by some superior authority. 
There are many fifth-grade teachers, for example, who pre- 
fer to have the superintendent tell them just how many 
pages of geography to cover each week and how many 
minutes to devote to this subject. There are many Latin 
teachers who are satisfied to take from some college catalogue 
a statement of the number of pages to be read in Cesar, 
to divide this number by the number of days during which 
the class meets, and then to plod through the assignments. 
The day of such teachers, unfortunately, is not yet past, but 
1907 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  198 ‘THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
it is passing. The course in geography or Latin is not a quan- 
titative matter; it is not a static affair; it is an organized 
body of material which grows and changes with the develop- 
ment of society. To the intelligent teacher a course of study 
is a subject of constant scrutiny and revision. Every detail 
must be weighed as to its importance and as to its relations 
to the whole series of topics and to the needs of pupils. 
OxpER Supjects Propucts or Lone SELECTION 
Efficient teachers have always assumed toward the subject- 
matter of their courses an attitude of the type described. 
As a result there has been in every generation of schools 
some progress in organizing courses. Little by little experi- 
ence has refined the practices of schools. Take, for exam- 
ple, Latin or any of the older subjects. Countless teachers 
have contributed to the organization of this subject. There 
is very little probability that pupils will encounter in first- 
year Latin anything that they ought not to be asked to learn, 
because the details have been tried out on successive gener- 
ations of learners, and only that has been retained in first- 
year Latin which can be taught in that year. In the newer 
subjects, on the contrary, there is the greatest uncertainty. 
In his enthusiasm for the new ideas which come to his own 
mind, the teacher of biology rushes forward to generaliza- 
tions which are too mature for his first-year classes. The 
subject-matter will have to be tried out and sifted before it 
is as well selected as is the course in Latin. The teachers 
of the new subjects will inevitably pass through a series of the 
same kind of sifting processes through which the teachers 
of Latin have passed. Even when some of the problems thus 
arising are settled, the new subjects will still be difficult of 
organization. Thus biology is changing by virtue of the 
evolution of the science at a rate which complicates the case 
very much more than it can ever be complicated in Latin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
in sTUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM 199 
SociAL NEEDS AND THE CURRICULUM 
Further evidence that the curriculum is a living, changing 
institution is seen in the way in which courses are related 
to social demands. There was a time in the history of the 
secondary school and college when the course in Hebrew was 
regarded as universally desirable for every student of the 
social group which attended these institutions. That was 
in the period when the group was of a definitely vocational 
composition. For example, in the early days of Harvard 
College 70 per cent of its graduates entered the ministry, 
and Hebrew was a requirement. The later history of the 
student body explains why the requirement of Hebrew 
became obsolete. Two paragraphs from a recent bulletin of 
the Bureau of Education give some of the facts as follows : 
From this it is apparent that those who founded the institution 
primarily had in mind a theological seminary. The professions of 
the graduates for the early period bear witness to the fact that this 
was practically what the institution was. The ministry was the one 
profession most necessary, most demanded by the society of that 
time, and this profession more than any other required an ad- 
vanced education. It is not surprising, therefore, to find this 
profession dominant during the early years of Harvard’s history. 
This dominance continues for over a century, and not until the 
period immediately following the Revolutionary War does any 
other profession claim so many of the graduates as the ministry. 
The curve representing this profession has three distinct tend- 
encies. The first part, extending from 1642, the date of the first 
graduating class, to 1720, is slightly downward, with rather wide 
variation. This stretch of 80 years shows a decline from 70 per 
cent for the first three years, a percentage never again reached, to 
60 per cent for the last five-year period. The second tendency is 
seen in the period of theological unrest, marked off roughly by the 
years 1720-1775. Here the downward tendency is clearly defined. 
It shows a decline from 60 per cent to less than 20 per cent. The 
variations during this period are not so marked. The third tendency 
extends from the Revolutionary War to the present. This shows 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
a slow, persistent relative decline reaching well below 5 per cent 
by the end of the nineteenth century. The variations during this 
period, particularly during the last half, are inconspicuous.’ 
Systematic STupDIES AS DEVICES FOR FACILITATING 
EvoLutIon OF THE CURRICULUM 
The effect of this and like radical social changes is some- 
times slow in actually modifying the curriculum because of 
the conservative tendencies discussed in earlier chapters. 
But the final effect is inevitable. The changing social order 
carries with it the school and its subjects of instruction. 
The characteristic fact about the present generation of 
progressive educators is that they are undertaking certain 
studies which are designed to hasten the processes of selec- 
tion. The curriculum is to be modified and improved, with 
every new accession of knowledge and with every new 
evolution in social life. How the improvement can be 
brought about most expeditiously and most productively is 
a problem which is engaging much of the attention and 
energy of school officers. 
It will be noted that there is no opposition between the 
natural tendencies of growth and revision and the special 
investigations which are intended to hasten the process of 
adjustment. The purpose of scientific studies here, as in 
every other sphere, is to facilitate natural evolution and to 
give it rational guidance. 
A Srupy or REPRESENTATIVE ADULTS 
One of the first methods of studying the curriculum is that 
of investigating the relation between school work and the 
demands of later life. The following description of a study 
made as part of a school survey teaches some very impressive 
lessons on the need of revision in the elementary curriculum : 
1 Bailey B. Burritt, “* Professional Distribution of College and University 
Graduates,” p.15. Zzdletin No. 19, United States Bureau of Education, 1912. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  STUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM 201 
The most serious defect of the present course of study, includ- 
ing some of the suggested revisions now under consideration, is 
that it makes thousands of children waste tens of thousands of 
precious hours in the laborious acquisition of facts for which they 
will never have any practical use. While the survey was under 
way the staff attempted to test the practical value of some of the 
subject matter taught to children in the elementary grades. 
For this purpose short examinations were prepared from the 
material prescribed by the course of study and actually being 
taught in the upper grades in spelling, arithmetic, history, and 
geography. Through the codperation of a woman prominent in 
social and intellectual circles of the city, rr of the leading suc- 
cessful citizens were brought together one evening and asked to 
take these examinations. The object was to find out whether or 
not the material that the children of the upper grades were being 
taught was of the sort actually used by able men of affairs in the 
conduct of their daily business. For carrying out the test the most 
prominent and successful citizens were purposely chosen and in 
making up the examinations the most difficult material was pur- 
posely selected. ‘The result of these examinations in spelling, geog- 
raphy, arithmetic, and history of the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades 
was that no one of the men examined made a passing mark in any 
subject. The reason is that the material on which they were exam- 
ined, and which the children in the schools are daily learning, 
is of a sort that is seldom or never met with in the business of 
even the most successful men engaged in commercial and profes- 
sional pursuits. The gentlemen who submitted to the examination 
were the following : 
A state senator 
A former lieutenant governor 
The president of a manufacturing concern 
‘The former superintendent of parks 
A banker 
A physician 
A merchant 
A lawyer 
A newspaper editor 
An efficiency engineer and a clergyman 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The test in spelling consisted of ten words taken from the spell- 
ing lists of the seventh grade. These words were as follows: 
1, abutilon 6, reconnoissance 
2. bergamot 7. erysipelas 
3. deutzia 8. mnemonics 
4. daguerreotype g. trichinze 
5. paradigm Io. weigelia 
Among the 11 men taking the examination, one spelled six of 
these words correctly. Three succeeded in spelling four words, 
two got three words right, one got two, three spelled one word 
correctly, and one failed on every word. It is not surprising that 
they failed so completely for no citizen in any ordinary walk of 
life needs to know how to spell these words. When the rare occa- 
sion arises that he needs to write one of them, he looks it up in 
the dictionary. These words and scores of words like them are 
studied in the classrooms as well as found in the spelling book. 
The test described above was suggested by the experience of 
the director of the survey who went into a sixth grade room where 
an examination in spelling was being given. He took the test with 
the children. It consisted of 20 words, and he failed on six of 
them. These six words are included in the ten-word list used in 
the examination of the business and professional men. Some of 
the children in the schools can spell these words correctly but 
while they are laboriously learning to do it, many of them are still 
unable to spell short and common words as “which,” “separate,” 
and “receive.” * 
A Srupy oF CURRENT REFERENCES 
Another method of comparing school courses with com- 
mon social needs is set forth in the following quotation : 
At a meeting of the Committee on Economy of Time held in 
the fall of 1912 it was suggested that current literature could be 
profitably employed as a standard for determining the kind of

geographical information that the school should provide. The pro- 
posal was to read current newspapers and magazines, record the 
geographical references, and determine from the frequency of these 
references the relative value of the various types of geographical 
information. Results of the application of the method presented at 
' the meeting seemed to indicate that the content of geography as 
now taught in the elementary school would be greatly modified if 
materials were chosen upon this basis. . . . 
Miss Biester collected and classified the geographical and histori- 
cal references and allusions in eighteen issues of the Outlook and 
the Literary Digest, representing a period of seven years ending 
with 1913. She found in these eighteen journals a total of 2,237 
geographical references. The distribution was as follows: 
PER CENT 
References to facts of location, size, direction, etc., which 
may be assumed to require for their understanding a 
knowledge of “ place and location” geography . - 53.5 
References to political divisions and facts of government

A grouping of this sort is obviously subject to the errors or 
peculiarities of individual judgment, but it may be said that the 
classification just presented is quite consistent with those furnished 
by other readers. Except for the absence of explicit reference to 
physiographical principles, this grouping represents fairly accurately 
the distribution of emphasis in the textbooks ordinarily used in the 
seventh and eighth grades. The physiographical principles, how- 
ever, are precisely the “ general” principles to which we referred

above; that is, their function is broadly interpretive and adaptive ; 
they “cover” a host of particulars too numerous in the aggregate, 
and too insignificant separately, to warrant specific attention. 
Another suggestive grouping is based upon the frequency of 
references to the various continents. If one is to read intelligently 
the journals which formed the basis of this test, one will find occa- 
sion to apply one’s knowledge of the continents in approximately 
the following proportions (the maximum frequency of reference 
being represented arbitrarily by 100):

It is not merely the remoter needs of adult life which 
should be taken into account in determining the content 
of courses of study. Pupils in schools have certain urgent 
needs which should be met. A study was carried on in the 
schools of Kansas City, Missouri, which dealt with the needs 
of pupils in grammar. Teachers observed and noted the 
mistakes of pupils, and collected a body of written material 
which was carefully analyzed. The urgent needs of pupils 
were readily discovered and were found to be comparatively 
few. The following quotations give the gist of the matter :

STUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM 205 
Table M, which is based upon the oral and written errors of 
the children of the community, displays the items to be included in 
a course of study for the elementary grades. It assumes that all 
types of error were found and reported. That this assumption is 
absolutely correct is not probable. ‘That it is approximately correct 
seems reasonably certain. To verify its accuracy further other 
studies would need to be made in Kansas City. 
As the present course of study in grammar in the sixth and in 
the seventh grades of the Kansas City schools was materially sim- 
plified in the r913~—1914 session, it is now one of the simplest in 
the United States. Notwithstanding this fact, many items would 
be omitted from it upon the basis of Table K. These are included 
in Table L. The Bees refer to “ Grammar and Composition with 
Practical English,” by Robins, Row, and Scott (Row, Peterson & 
Company, Chicago), the text now in use in the sixth and seventh 
grades.

tory sentence and after interjections to express an intensity of 
feeling greater than that expressed by the period, and it is doubt- 
ful if children have the nicety of experience to understand the 
difference. If the point is absent, its omission cannot be counted 
as an error because the reader has no way of knowing how intense 
is the feeling that accompanied the sentence. Strangely enough, 
the children used the appositive hardly at all. Instead of saying, 
* Bill, the bandit, killed a deer,” they seem to prefer to say, “ Bill 
was a bandit, and he killed a deer.” 
To the omissions, tabulated in Table M, should be added such 
sentences for analysis and parsing as are given to children solely 
because they involve subtle points in grammar. This is true 
because the errors made by children seem to occur in the com- 
moner and more easily classified constructions, as may be seen 
by an examination of Table I. 
POSTSCRIPT 
The content of the course of study in elementary grammar in 
the Kansas City schools is not dealt with here. The problem is 
simply and solely to find out what the course of study would be 7 
it were based upon the errors of the children. The problem of the 
content of the course of study requires such serious consideration 
that it can be determined only by practical experience and opinion 
aided by other scientifically conditioned studies.*

    STUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM 207 
PREREQUISITES FOR HiGHER CoursEs 
The problem of finding what is the best progression of 
studies within the curriculum is an important problem on 
which we have at the present time relatively little informa- 
tion. President Lowell of Harvard University collected some 
statistics on this matter which can be briefly summarized 
in three quotations from his article : 
Harvard University is singularly rich in material for determining 
the relation of college studies to the work of the professional 
schools, because nowhere in the world have so large a body of 
undergraduates been so free, for so long a period, as in Harvard 
College to study whatever they chose, and to make any combina- 
tion of courses they pleased. With the exception of one required 
course in English, and sometimes one in another modern language, 
the election of courses has been almost wholly free for a quarter 
of a century, and in fact the variety of combinations made has 
been almost limitless. Moreover, the Law and Medical Schools 
have contained a large number of graduates of Harvard College, 
and this is essential for a fair comparison of the results. . . . 
The statistics here presented cover, therefore, only bachelors of 
arts of Harvard College who graduated afterwards from the Har- 
vard Law and Medical Schools, and they comprise only men who 
took twelve courses, or nearly three years’ work, in the collesens 275 
If, therefore, one can draw any inference from figures so small, 
the case of mathematics is singular. Unless some other element 
enters into the problem, such as an unusually high standard in 
the department, or an unusually vigorous intellectual appetite on 
the part of students who elect the subject, the result may be sup- 
posed to indicate, so far as it goes, that mathematics, altho rarely 
selected for the purpose, is a particularly good preparation for the 
study of law; perhaps because the methods of thought in the two 
subjects are more nearly akin than is commonly supposed. 
Leaving aside this possibly exceptional case, the conclusions to 
be derived from the facts presented in this paper would seem to 
be that, as a preparation for the study of law or medicine, it makes 
comparatively little difference what subject is mainly pursued in

college, but that it makes a great difference with what intensity the 
subject is pursued — or, to put the same proposition in a more 
technical form, familiarity with the subject-matter, which can be 
transferred little, if at all, is of small importance in a college edu- 
cation, as compared with mental processes that are capable of being 
transferred widely, or with the moral qualities of diligence, per- 
severance, and intensity of application which can be transferred 
indefinitely. The practical deduction is that in the administration 
of our colleges, and, indeed, in all our general education, as distin- 
guished from direct vocational or professional training, we have 
laid too much stress on the subject, too little on the excellence of 
the work and on the rank attained.* 
ADMINISTRATIVE STUDIES 
Other studies of the curriculum have been made which 
may be called administrative studies. The most elaborate 
investigation of this type which has been carried out is re- 
ported in a volume entitled ““ The Supervision of Arithmetic. 2 
Two of the leading students of the science of education 
have here reported an exhaustive study of the practices of 
various school systems in administering the arithmetic 
course. At the same time they have made an analysis of 
the textbooks which are commonly used in administering 
this course. Finally, they have supplemented this body of 
fact with numerous opinions from competent school people 
regarding changes which ought to be made. 
It is not possible to take up in detail the various findings 
reported in this volume. One especially interesting set of 
facts, however, may be referred to as furnishing convincing 
evidence that the school curriculum is constantly in process 
of revision. The particular part of the book which shows 
this deals with the number of hours a week devoted to

arithmetic in the course of study of various cities. If we 
compare the relative amount of time given to arithmetic in 
earlier years and at present, we shall have some indication 
of the movement which has been going on within the school 
curriculum. In 1888 New York City devoted 26 per cent 
of the total school time in the grades to arithmetic. In 
1904 this had been reduced to 12 per cent, showing that 
the attention to arithmetic is in point of time less than 
half what it was at an earlier period. Boston, on the other 
hand, devoted to arithmetic almost exactly the same relative 
amount of time in 1904 that it did in 1888. In both cases 
about 16 per cent of the time of the course of study was 
given to this subject. Chicago shows a distinct increase in the 
amount of time given to arithmetic. In 1888 it was giving 
9 per cent of its time to that subject. The time devoted to 
arithmetic in 1904 was 18 per cent, or just twice as much. 
These statements confirm the remark repeatedly made 
in this volume that the course of study is constantly under- 
going revision. The only intelligent way for the school sys- 
tem to deal with the problems of the course of study which 
are sure to come up is to make a careful examination of 
the movement which is under way, for this movement is 
usually guided by the personal judgment of some enthusi- 
astic school officer or by the chance readjustments which 
arise out of the effort to bring new subjects into the cur- 
riculum. The result is a blind fluctuation, the magnitude 
and importance of which are wholly unrecognized until 
exact comparisons are set up. 
Such general discussions as that summarized in the fore- 
going paragraphs are supplemented in the volume referred 
to, by detailed studies of such questions as the following: 
When should the teaching of fractions begin? How far 
should the elementary course deal with square root and cube 
root? What are the characteristics of a given textbook which 
make it available for a particular school system ? 
    
-P-A-G-E-222
210 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The kind of study which is here reported for arithmetic 
should, of course, be made for other subjects as well. The 
time allotment for the course in geography and the distri- 
bution of topics within that course are quite as important 
as the time allotment in arithmetic. 
Neep or Broap, CoOPERATIVE STUDIES 
It would be a serious mistake to advocate any one of the 
investigations referred to in this chapter, as the sole basis for 
reform in the curriculum. There must be a broad consider- 
ation of social and educational conditions if the school is to 
arrange its materials of instruction in the most advantageous 
form. Furthermore, the individual teacher cannot make all 
the studies involved. The problem is one which involves 
codperation and the organization of scientific methods which 
will give to each school officer the benefit of the experience 
of many schools. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
The best type of exercise which can be suggested in connection 
with this chapter is the analysis of a series of textbooks by members — 
of the class, The following suggestions will aid in the attack on 
three classes of texts: 
First, let the student get several sets of readers, beginning with 
primers and running up to the books designed for the upper grades. 
Note among other characteristics such matters as the following : 
‘Are the selections in the primers equally interesting? Are the 
vocabularies the same? What devices in the primer are adopted 
as aids in explaining the words? Are the sentences of equal length? 
In the readers for the upper grades is the emphasis on poetry the 
same? Is the reading matter equally appropriate for boys and 
girls? Does it fit all localities equally well? Is there any sugges- 
tion that would carry the pupil out of the book itself to other books? 
Second, let the student take several geographies. Are the maps 
equally good? Are the pictures equally helpful? What is the order 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
STUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM ant 
—<5 of topics? Is the treatment equally detailed in the various books ae Is the attention given to the United States satisfactory both in point of gross volume and in point of details taken up? What is the degree of emphasis on physical geography and on man’s place in the world, that is, on commerce and civilization ? 
Third, take books in first-year Latin. What emphasis is given to vocabulary, to reading, and to grammar? How do books of this type differ from books on French and German? Is the choice 
of reading matter in the various books based on the same prin- 
ciple of selection? How far could the books be used by a pupil 
without a teacher? What is the contribution expected of the teacher; that is, what must the teacher know about Latin more 
than is given in the book? How are the pages of material related to assignments; that is, are assignments suggested by the text itself?

CHAPTER XV 
STANDARDIZATION 
s 
Tests AND MEASUREMENTS OF PRODUCTS 
There is a group of recent studies which affect the 
curriculum and all other phases of school organization so 
profoundly that a separate chapter must be devoted to an 
exposition of their character and aims. These are studies 
which aim to standardize school work through tests, measure- 
ments, and exact quantitative descriptions of the products of 
teaching. 
For example, one of the efforts of the elementary school 
is to teach pupils to write. It is entirely possible after the 
school has done its work to find out by an examination 
of the results how well pupils can write. It is never ex- 
pected that pupils in the second grade will write as well 
as pupils in the upper grades. In this sense, then, it may 
be said that the results expected in the second grade are of 
a lower standard than those expected higher in the school. 
Furthermore, there is a sharp contrast between rapid writ- 
ing and slow writing. The pupil who writes one hundred 
and fifty letters in a minute with a quality or form of letters 
which is fair exhibits one kind of result, while the pupil who 
writes only seventy-five letters a minute but shows great 
regularity in his letters exhibits another kind of result. It 
is not easy in two cases such as have just been described 
to determine at once which result is better. It may be that 
speed should be encouraged in order to secure free, fluent 
movements even if quality has to be sacrificed for the time 
being. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
STANDARDIZATION - 
Ear.ier STANDARDS BASED ON OPINION 
One difficulty in dealing with the results of school work 
has been that schools have had no clear definition of what 
ought to be demanded. Opinion has been matched against 
opinion. Thus the parent often feels that he has a right 
to pass unqualified judgment on the progress of his child 
‘and on the teacher’s methods of dealing with him. The 
employer demands of the boy whom he employs a certain 
proficiency in spelling and adding. The superintendent, in 
pursuance of his duties, tells the teachers that their work is 
satisfactory or otherwise and that the children do or do not read as well as they should. The teacher has a certain 
expectation, and the pupil feels sure that he is doing his 
work well. Each, according to his personal standard, is 
estimating the work done in the school. 
Very often these standards differ when applied to one and 
the same performance; sometimes they differ so radically 
that social troubles follow. The parent says that his child 
is doing satisfactory work, while the teacher estimates the work as inferior. In such a case it happens, often after a controversy, that one standard ultimately prevails. It is a 
matter of record in some communities that the parent’s 
standard has at times been asserted with enough energy to 
result in the removal of the dissenting teacher from office. 
On the other hand, it is more commonly true that the 
. teacher’s standard dominates, and the pupil either changes 
his ways or fails of promotion. In either case, it would 
have been better for all concerned if some exact standard could have been set up which would have been recognized 
as superior in its sanction to individual opinion. 
Even teachers of experience disagree in grading the same 
examination paper. One demands correctness in every detail, 
while the other concentrates attention on originality and 
force of expression,

214 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
OsjEcTIVE AND Exact STANDARDS 
The effort to lay down by investigation satisfactory 
standards of school work is one of the most productive 
lines of educational inquiry which has ever been instituted. 
Like all great movements, this movement of standardization 
has been misunderstood and opposed, but it is steadily 
gaining ground and promises to be the largest contribution 
of this generation to education. 
In essence it consists of a careful, systematic measure- 
ment of what pupils accomplish. If there are at hand 
measurements of the actual achievements of pupils in 
various subjects in all the grades, it is safe to compare any 
single performance with the general average. It should be 
noted that this does not imply a demand that every pupil’s 
work be like the average. There are pupils who do their 
work under unfavorable conditions, as, for example, pupils 
who have difficulty in reading because they hear no English 
at home. Their results should not be expected to reach the 
average, at least in the early grades. How far the results 
are from the average should, however, be definitely known. 
Explanation can then be given. Where conditions are not 
unfavorable the demand can be the more vigorously made 
that the average expectation be reached. 
BEGINNINGS OF THE MOVEMENT 
The way in which tNis movement began and the rapidity 
with which it has progressed are vividly described by one 
of its chief exponents as follows : 
Eighteen years ago the school superintendents of America, as- 
sembled in convention in Indianapolis, discussed the problems 
then foremost in educational thought and action. At that meeting 
a distinguished educator’— the pioneer and pathfinder among

STANDARDIZATION 215 
the scientific students of education in America — brought up for discussion the results of his investigations of spelling among the children in the school systems of nineteen cities. These results showed that, taken all in all, the children who spent forty minutes a day for eight years in studying spelling did not spell any better than the children in the schools of other cities where they devoted only ten minutes per day to the study. 
The presentation of these data threw that assemblage into con- sternation, dismay, and indignant protest. But the resulting storm of vigorously voiced opposition was directed not against the methods and results of the investigation, but against the investi- gator who had pretended to measure the results of teaching spelling by testing the ability of children to spell. 
In terms of scathing denunciation the educators there present and the pedagogical experts, who reported the deliberations of the meeting in the educational press, characterized as silly, dangerous, and from every viewpoint reprehensible, the attempt to test the efficiency of the teacher by finding out what the pupils could do. With striking unanimity they voiced the conviction that any attempt to evaluate the teaching of spelling in terms of the ability of the pupils to spell was essentially impossible and based on a profound misconception of the function of education, 
Last month in the city of Cincinnati that same association of school superintendents, again assembled in convention, devoted fifty-seven addresses and discussions to tests and measurements of educational efficiency. The basal Proposition underlying this entire mass of discussion was that the effectiveness of the school, the methods, and the teachers must be measured in terms of the results secured,? 
¥ HanpwritInc SCALES 
One of the earliest types of school work to be standard- ized was handwriting. Standard ‘ scales,” as they are called, have been prepared by several investigators, and their use has become very common.

-P-A-G-E-228
21Ov DELe ee STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The first scale was prepared by Professor Thorndike.t 
He secured a number of specimens of children’s writing, , 
and asked experienced judges to arrange these specimens 
in a series of descending degrees of excellence. By combin- 
ing the judgments returned by the experts it was possible 
to secure an average judgment. Certain typical specimens 
were then set aside, representing equal steps in the descend- 
ing scale. In practical use, a given sample of handwriting 
which is to be judged is compared with the successive steps 
in the scale until an approximate equality in degree of excel- 
lence is found. The sample to be judged is then marked 
with the grade agreed on for the standard specimen. 
A second scale was prepared by Ayres? on a more ob- 
jective basis. The specimens were arranged in a series, not 
in accordance with the judgment of experts, but according 
to the time which was required to read them. 
A third scale, more elaborate than either of the others, was 
prepared by Freeman? He first made an analysis of the dif- 
ferent characteristics which enter into excellent writing, such 
as uniformity of slant, uniformity in the height and spacing 
of letters, and other like essential characteristics, and then 
selected specimens exhibiting decreasing grades of excellence 
in each of these characteristics. Since each characteristic of 
writing is capable of definite measurement, the specimens 
could be graded on the basis of direct measurements. Thus 
the slant of a number of specimens was measured letter by 
letter, and objective grades were established. 
Finally, the preparation of scales of handwriting has gone 
so far that special scales or series of graded specimens for 
particular school systems have been prepared.

     STANDARDIZATION 
SPEED AS A CORRELATE OF QUALITY 
In the meantime the matter of speed in handwriting has 
also been a subject of careful measurement, and tables of 
average speeds for different grades have been prepared in 
a number of school systems. 
A device for presenting in a single diagram both speed 
and quality and at the same time comparing several grades 
in the same school with each other was worked out in the 
Cleveland survey. The figure and a description of its mean- 
ing are given on pages 218, 219. 
The relative emphasis on speed and quality actually found in a 
number of different schools is set forth in the following diagram. 
The separate parts of this diagram are made up as follows: The 
average speed of a grade is represented by distances in the hori- 
zontal, and average quality by distances in the vertical, scale. Thus, 
taking the first section of the diagram, that of the North Doan 
School, the fifth grade has an average speed of 71 letters per 
minute, and an average quality of 41. The sixth grade shows 
progress in both speed and quality, though speed increases more 
than quality. The seventh and eighth grades show further prog- 
ress in both speed and quality, the two changing at about the 
same rate. The diagram for the Kentucky School shows progress 
of a slightly different type. In this school the sixth grade, as com- 
pared with the fifth, shows progress in quality} but very little in 
speed, Progress from the sixth grade on is about equal in quality 
and speed. Memorial School emphasizes speed almost exclusively 
up to the eighth grade, while Mt. Pleasant emphasizes quality. 
The various schools which have been reported in the four upper 
- sections of the diagram are all regular in the sense that each school 
shows steady progress from grade to grade in both speed and 
quality. Without attempting to comment in detail on the special 
cases, attention is called to the series of results presented in the 
lower part of the diagram,”

  STANDARDIZATION 219 
Before giving examples of standardization in fields other 
than penmanship, it will be well to indicate the full mean- 
ing of the foregoing paragraphs. 
STANDARDS, PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL 
First, it will be seen that measurements are here substi- 
tuted for purely personal judgments. It was the universal 
practice before this movement began, and it is the common 
practice to-day, for a supervisor to go from school to school, 
passing on the excellence and speed of handwriting. The 
supervisor has arrived at a personal standard through his 
experience. He expects a certain result in the fifth grade. 
He has in his mind a more or less clearly defined require- 
ment and regards it as his duty to impose this on pupils 
and teachers. In the same way the teacher has a personal 
standard which is imposed on the pupils. It would be a 
mistake to describe these personal standards as arbitrary or 
unintelligent. The experienced teacher is usually approxi- 
mately right in his expectations, and the supervisor usually 
does a great deal to raise and unify the level of work with 
which he comes in contact. But it is not possible in a 
complex social situation to rely on personal standards. Per- 
sonal life and professional activity are too transient. How 
many schools have changed standards, to the great disadvan- 
tage of the penmanship, with each change of supervisors ? 
Furthermore, personal standards are vague when one tries 
to transmit them to others. This is a serious matter when 
it is remembered that a very large proportion of teachers in 
each school are changing each year. If a supervisor is to 
systematize the work of his schools, he must constantly be 
* Quality on vertical scale, speed on horizontal scale. The four schools referred to 
in the text are represented in the four diagrams in the upper part of the figure. North Doan is reported in the diagram in the upper left-hand corner, Kentucky is

220 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
bringing into agreement with his standards the standards 
of a large number of new teachers. For the sake of coéper- 
ation it is advantageous,to turn a personal standard into one 
which can be described and defined. Finally, a personal 
standard grows up out of all the accidents of a personal 
career. The person of narrow experience may not have 
incorporated into his standards valuable elements which he 
would have accepted had he come in contact with them. 
The person of strong personal likes and dislikes may often 
be prejudiced. The person of broad experience may be 
inexact when it comes to details. To demand of all who 
teach handwriting that they rise above purely personal stand- 
ards is not unlike the demand that the central government 
rather than the states mint our coins. 
SoctaL STANDARDS VERSUS IMPOSED STANDARDS 
Second, the standards set up are derived from the work 
actually going on in schools. There is no dictation from 
purely theoretical and arbitrary sources. It is quite impos- 
sible to close one’s eyes to the fact that in the past there 
has been a tendency to assume. that the only standard of 
action is the perfect standard. Many a child has been 
taught penmanship from perfect copy and has been urged 
to imitate this copy at whatever cost of time and pains. 
The slow, painful effort to draw letters like those in the 
copy book is not an unfamiliar exhibition in the penman- 
ship class. A standard derived from the school work itself 
is a social standard; it is based on what pupils really do. 
One need not be satisfied with present performances, but 
one starts from solid ground. Furthermore, out of actual 
measurements will come a clear idea of the range of vari- 
ation. One of the most astonishing facts which have come 
out in the course of the study of standards is the fact that 
there are very wide variations in the same grade, There is, 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  STANDARDIZATION 221 
therefore, an easy possibility of finding for each grade high 
standards. These high standards have the further advantage 
of being standards actually realized by pupils. We are justi- 
fied in describing the standards thus set up as natural stand- 
ards. They do not limit the progress of any grade or aim 
at mechanical uniformity as do the arbitrary standards based 
on personal judgments. 
CoMPARISON THROUGH Exacr MEASUREMENT 
Third, standards measured and expressed in definite 
terms can be compared and can be made the basis of studies 
which are quite impossible so long as standards are not 
expressed in common terms. For example, when the speed 
of handwriting in a ‘certain school is deliberately changed, 
what is the effect produced on quality? Heretofore it has 
been almost impossible to answer such a question. Every 
school reform has been enthusiastically hailed by its friends 
as accomplishing much. In the second generation most of 
these reforms are checked, if not actually dropped, because 
‘it is found that the good accomplished in one line is entirely 
lost in some other. To-day reforms are in a position to 
measure their effects in all directions. A change in the 
speed of handwriting may or may not be advantageous ; it 
is the duty of measurement to so state results that some 
light will be thrown on this matter. 
A concrete example will serve to show how studies of 
this kind may be carried out. Fig. 15 shows the relative 
speeds and qualities of handwriting found in various grades 
in a miscellaneous group ‘of cities and the corresponding 
facts for St. Louis and Grand Rapids. It is seen that both 
of these school systems are ahead at all points in speed and 
behind at first in quality. Both cities have made a conscious 
effort to get away from the slow drawing of letters in the 
lower grades. In doing this quality has been sacrificed.
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
It is not the purpose of this discussion to decide what 
methods of teaching handwriting are best ; the value of this 
example is that it shows quality and speed reduced to terms 
where the two can be studied together and with a high 
degree of exactness. 
Recorps AS A Basis OF STANDARDIZATION 
Fourth and finally, measured standards show the direction 
in which pupils are moving, because they permit a per- 
manent record of each step of the child’s development. 
Schools have been slow to learn the value of records. On 
the one hand, school records have been piled up by the 
tome and no use has been made of them; on the other 
hand, they are usually so loosely thrown together that 
they are of very little value in guiding educational pol- 
icy. Here is a form of record which can be duplicated 
and compared from year to year. Medicine has long since 
learned that exact records are the only safe means of 
guiding treatment. Modern agriculture has become scien- 
tific through the use of records and through decisions, 
regarding experiments which these records make possible. 
Modern business has learned to make its accounting intel- 
ligent enough to guide policies. Finally, schools are begin- 
ning to see that records of a type permitting continuous 
comparisons are invaluable in determining at what point 
school work shall take this or that form. 
SrupIES OF ORAL READING 
What has been done with penmanship has been paralleled 
in some other subjects of elementary instruction. The fol- 
lowing quotations have to do with oral reading :

  224 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION ‘' 
(Northeastern Section), which met at Elgin, Illinois, November 
3 and 4. The purpose of this study was to secure a body of facts 
in regard to the achievement of boys and girls in reading in a 
number of schools represented in the Association. . 
The materials used in this study of reading were the standard- 
ized oral-reading paragraphs and the silent-reading tests which 
have been uSed in connection with the surveys in Cleveland, 
Grand Rapids, and St. Louis, as well as in a large number of 
investigations carried on in other cities. . . . 
The standardized oral-reading paragraphs consist of a series of 
twelve paragraphs arranged in the order of increasing difficulty. 
The tests were given to the pupils individually by a principal or 
by a teacher who had been previously trained for the work. As 
the pupil read the teacher recorded the time required to read each 
paragraph together with the number of errors which were made of 
the following types: 
(a) Gross mispronunciations, which include such errors in 
pronunciation as indicate clearly that the word is too difficult for 
the pupil to pronounce. 
(6) Minor mispronunciations, which include the pronunciation 
of a portion of a word, wrong accent, wrong syllabification, 
omission of syllables, etc. 
(©) Omission of words. 
(d) Insertion of words. 
(2) Repetition of words or groups of words. 
(/) Substitution of one word or group of words for another. 
A pupil continued to read until he had made seven or more 
errors in each of two paragraphs. By means of a system of 
scoring based on the time required to read and on the number 
of errors which were made it was possible to represent the 
achievement of a pupil or a class in numerical térms. . . . 
The upper section of the table [given below] gives the aver- 
age number of seconds required to read paragraph 1 and the 
average number of errors made by three oor second-grade classes 
and by three good second-grade classes. Of the poor schools, 
School M made more errors and read more slowly than the aver- 
age. School N read with fewer errors than the average, but read 
so slowly that the oral-reading score for the class was below the
-P-A-G-E-237
STANDARDIZATION 225 
average. School O, on the other hand, gave sufficient emphasis to 
rate, but neglected accuracy to such an extent that the oral-reading 
score was low. An examination of the records made by the good 
schools shows clearly that consistent progress in both rate and accu- 
racy is a prerequisite to a high level of achievement. The schools of 
northern Illinois vary widely in the amount of emphasis given to 
these phases of reading achievement. There is need, on the part of 
many teachers, for a continuous critical study of the specific char- 
acter of the results which they are securing.

Additional light is thrown on this problem when we follow 
certain schools through the second, third, and fourth grades. The 
average rate and number of errors for Grades II, III, and IV are 
given in the left-hand column of the lower section of the table. 
The records for School A show that second-grade pupils do better 
both in rate and in accuracy than the average. The same thing may 
be said of the third and fourth grades. Continuous, consistent
-P-A-G-E-238
226 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
progress of this type is very commendable. In School B, on the 
other hand, the pupils do less well in each grade in both speed and 
accuracy than the average. A question arises here concerning the 
general effectiveness of the classroom instruction. School C ranks 
low in accuracy in the second grade. Apparently this difficulty was 
realized in the third grade, and considerable progress both in speed 
and in accuracy resulted. In the fourth grade average results are 
attained which are above the average. This school represents con- 
sistent, continuous growth from grade to grade of a highly desirable 
type. School D, on the other hand, makes improvement in speed 
and accuracy in the third grade, but fails to increase its rate in the 
fourth grade, and makes a record in accuracy which is distinctly 
below the record made by the third grade. It is evident, if the 
records for the present second, third, and fourth grades are typical 
of the results secured from year to year, that there is need for 
more intelligent instruction and supervision in School D. 
In this connection it should be said that objective standards of 
attainment for each grade should be defined. By means of tests 
given throughout a school or a city the present level of achieve- 
ment can be determined. By means of comparisons with results 
secured elsewhere new goals of attainment can be defined. Each 
teacher should become familiar with the methods of giving tests. 
She should utilize them frequently in examining her work to find 
sources of strength and weakness. Through the co-operation of 
teachers and supervisors progressive revisions in standards 
of attainment and methods of procedure should be made. This 
type of co-operation is necessary because it is only when all the 
units of a school system work consistently together toward clearly 
defined ends that the most effective results can be secured.* 
STUDIES DEALING WITH OTHER SUBJECTS 
A great number of similar studies are being reported 
each year on arithmetic, spelling, and other aspects of the 
elementary curriculum. The high-school subjects are more

  STANDARDIZATION 227 
complicated than those in the elementary school, but even these are beginning to be tested. There are satisfactory 
tests in algebra and the beginnings of measurements in Latin and English. 
MecuanicaL Aspects THE First TO BE STANDARDIZED 
In all cases standardization begins with the mechanical 
aspects of school work. These are more susceptible to exact quantitative description and are the first to be taken up. Some writers have professed to find in this a reason for rejecting the whole movement toward standardization. 
There are, they assert, products of teaching which are subtle and intangible. These are the products which are most highly to be prized. Thoroughly to standardize pen- manship and oral reading and algebra is to set aside these more important matters. 
Two answers are to be made to this objection to the movement toward standardization, In the first place, the higher values of education are not secured by teachers who are negligent of the fundamental mechanical requirements. 
The teacher who successfully trains his pupil to study history will make of him a good reader also. In the second place, if it should prove to be desirable to give less time than is given at present to training in the mechanical aspects of school 
subjects, it will certainly be absolutely essential that the limits and restrictions be set up with discrimination, We shall never be able to deal intelligently with the mechanical 
aspects of education until we have studied them, 
A third statement which can be ventured with assurance 
in the light of the recent history of this movement is that its limits cannot be set. Each year new aspects of school 
work are measured with exactness. It is certain that the ultimate conquests of measurement will push the opponents 
back into their own territory.

STANDARDIZATION AND THE ScrencE oF EpucaTION 
In short, standardization is nothing but a systematic effort 
to deal with educational problems explicitly and in the light 
of exact information, Whatever may be the limits of exact 
knowledge in educational matters, it is certain that we ought 
to secure as much knowledge of this type as possible. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
"The exercise which will best serve to supplement this chapter 
is a series of tests performed on members of the class and worked

CHAPTER XVI 
METHODS 
MEANING OF THE TERM “ METHOD” 
The problems of instruction are by no means solved when 
a subject has been selected and’ placed in its proper relation 
to the other subjects in the curriculum, There is still the 
problem of presenting the subject to the class in such a 
way as to appeal to the attention and interest of its mem- 
bers. The special term which is applied in educational 
writings to the organization of material for class instruction 
is the term “method” or ‘method of teaching.” 
In contrasting American schools with European schools 
it was pointed out in an earlier chapter that the American 
method is the textbook and recitation method, while the 
method of the European schools is predominantly the oral 
or lecture method.~ The subject-matter of instruction can 
be treated by either of these methods. 
MEANING oF THE TERM “ Device” 
Another term which has been used in educational dis- 
cussions to distinguish between the more general modes of 
procedure and certain details of classroom work is the term 
“device.” A classroom device is some special piece of 
equipment or some particular way of dealing with a class 
that can be described as appropriate to a single classroom 
situation or to some topic of a given subject. For example, 
if a teacher of Latin has verb forms printed on cards for 
the purpose of drilling his classes in the recognition of such 
229 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
230 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
forms, his cards are spoken of as devices. Again, if one 
calls the roll by assigning a number to each member of the 
class and then requiring each number to be given in its 
order, it is said that one has a time-saving device. 
PERSONAL METHODS AND DEVICES 
Every teacher has methods and ‘devices of presenting 
material to his or her classes. The experienced teacher 
behaves skillfully in the presence of a class because all 
the details of procedure have been tried, and those which 
proved successful have been retained. The inexperienced 
teacher is: clumsy in his methods, just as is any novice in 
dealing with an unmastered social situation. 
SupposEp CONFLICT BETWEEN METHODS AND 
Supyect-MATTER 
It is sometimes pointed out that in the training of teachers 
there is danger that competition will arise between the de- 
mand for skill in methods and the demand for knowledge 
of subject-matter. @he, specialist in science scoffs at a 
course in methods of teaching, saying that all the prospec- 
tive teacher needs is to know the subject thoroughly, and 
method will take care of itself. ‘Furthermore, such a critic 
of methods often points out that the time required for a 
course in methods must be taken from time which the 
student ought to devote to subject-matter. 
The school principal who is looking for a science teacher 
is likely to reply that he has had teachers thoroughly ac- 
quainted with the science but utterly unsympathetic with 
pupils. Such teachers do not know how to get the facts to 
the students. They are abstract, or speak too fast, or do not 
assign the lessons in such a way as to help the students see 
the important points. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
    
METHODS 231 
There is no necessity of being one-sided in this matter. 
The successful teacher will ultimately have both knowledge 
of the subject-matter and methods and devices of presenting 
the subject-matter. If he is lacking in either, he will be in 
just that degree inefficient. There can be no doubt that a 
properly balanced appreciation of both is the sane and wise 
attitude to assume. 
Two ExampLes oF Mopern Meruops 
It will, of course, be quite impossible to do more than 
illustrate the problems of method in this general introduc- 
tion. The remainder of this chapter will be devoted to 
comments on two significant innovations in method which 
are characteristic of present-day teaching as contrasted with 
the teaching of two generations ago. The older of these 
innovations was the adoption of the laboratory method ; the 
later general innovation is the movement in the direction 
of supervised study in all subjects. 
Oxject TEACHING 
An appreciation of the laboratory method can be gained 
by reviewing briefly the history of this method in American 
schools. As far back as 1809 a follower of Pestalozzi, one 
Joseph Neef, conducted a school in Philadelphia, where he 
exhibited Pestalozzi’s object method. Pupils learned by 
direct contact with things. Such teaching was in sharp 
contrast with the ordinary methods then in vogue, for at 
that time instruction consisted exclusively of statements, 
either oral or written, which the pupils were supposed to 
learn by heart. 
The object-teaching movement made little progress until 
it was taken up in 1860 by Dr. Sheldon, the head of the 
normal school at Oswego, New York. From Oswego the 
movement spread, especially to the new Western schools,
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
and had so wide an influence that the study of nature in 
the lower schools was vigorously advocated and extensively 
undertaken. The inductive method of direct contact with 
the facts was advocated in fields other than nature study. 
Dr. Sheldon’s daughter took a vigorous part in the develop- 
ment of instruction in history based on direct contact with 
source material. The laboratory method in history, as it was 
sometimes called, spread and inspired enthusiasm for methods 
in all the literary subjects analogous to the laboratory work 
of the sciences. 
Laxsoratory MEtTHop IN Puysics 
In the high schools a parallel movement took place in 
the last third of the nineteenth century, leading to the 
adoption of laboratory work as a definite mode of instruc- 
tion. On this subject one writer on the history of physics 
has given the following statements : 
Experimental work had not been entirely unknown in secondary 
schools even in the early part of the century, but no attempt had 
been made to bring the pupil into personal contact with its results. 
The Boston Grammar Schools were all furnished with a $275 set 
of physical apparatus as early as 1837, and most of the academies 
installed sets about that time, but the apparatus was for the use of 
the instructor only, the pupils not being allowed to handle it. And 
this condition existed to within about thirty years of the end of the 
century, when the agitation for individual laboratory work began. 
This period of agitation was marked by the beginning of some 
laboratory work and the discussion of the value of individual work 
and the inductive method by educators, But there was no general 
adoption of the plan till a later period. It was about this time that 
David Starr Jordan accepted the chair of Natural History in an 
Illinois college and attempted to establish a chemical laboratory. 
His attempt was promptly vetoed by the board of trustees. . . . 
In the report from the Albany, N.Y., City School, for 1882, 
the Superintendent recommended that a whole year be given to 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
       METHODS 233 
the study of physics with opportunity for daily experiments, the 
class participating in the experiments as far as practicable. The 
report of 1882-1883 from the Washington, D. C., High School, 
states that laboratories have been fitted up. Indianapolis reported 
in 1883 that the experimental method had been introduced and 
was meeting with approval from both teacher and pupil. Cincin- 
nati reported in 1882 that physics was taught from a syllabus four 
hours a week during the third year. St. Louis reported physics 
taught through the second year of the high school. The reports 
show only qualitative experiments. . . . : 
The general trend of accumulated opinion in 1884 shows in- 
creased favor of the idea that mental discipline is the chief aim in 
physics teaching. There was a general notion that the study of 
physics ought to train the pupil to think, but as to what method 
should be used to bring about this result there was no settled opin- 
ion. Laboratory work meant anything from a few simple demon- 
strations by the teacher to a complete individual laboratory course, 
such as is given at the present day. 
For the next fifteen years, physics teaching, in fact, science 
teaching in general, was in an experimental stage. In the effort to 
make science a disciplinary study, the laboratory method was com- 
ing into general use rapidly, but the old idea of making science 
include everything in reach —a remnant of the Watural Philosophy 
stage —had prevented its becoming a really disciplinary study. 
We find David Starr Jordan in 1889 lamenting the superficial way 
in which science was taught.? 
SPREAD OF THE Laporatory IDEA 
The historical statements given above show how recent 
is the acceptance of the laboratory method even in science 
teaching. The enthusiasm for the method is as impressive 
as its youth. It would be, impossible to turn the present 
generation of science teachers away from the laboratory 
method of teaching. In spite of its cumbersomeness of

234 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
administration, its demand for expensive equipment, and 
the deliberation which it compels in teaching the results 
of science, the laboratory method is everywhere accepted as 
the true method. Indeed, as stated above, the literary sub- 
jects such as history and English, the latter especially in 
the teaching of composition, not infrequently adopt the term 
“laboratory method” in order to show their recognition of 
the effectiveness of the method worked out by the sciences. 
REACTION AGAINST THE QUESTION AND ANSWER MerTHop 
The second innovation in method of teaching, namely, 
supervised study, came as a reaction against the purely 
examination method of conducting class exercises which 
was formerly almost universal except in laboratory classes. 
The examination method is the familiar one of calling a 
pupil to his feet and then asking him one question after 
another to find out whether he has learned his lesson. If 
he answers well, he is marked with a high grade. If he 
answers badly, he is marked with a low grade, reprimanded, 
and told to do his work over. 
The futility of some of this procedure is at once evident 
if one thinks of the student who has made an honest effort 
to learn his lesson, but has failed because he adopted an 
inefficient and often a wrong method of getting the lesson. 
In such a case the pupil fails because he does not know how 
to get his lesson, It therefore occurred to some progres- 
sive teachers that it was their duty to inquire not merely into 
the results of the student’s study but also into his methods 
of study. The moment this new idea is grasped, the function 
of a recitation will be seen to be something more than the 
examination of pupils. The recitation is now coming to be 
the place where pupils learn how to do intellectual work, 
how to attack intellectual problems, and how to guide their 
efforts into more economical and effective channels. 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
     METHODS 
Inerricient MetHops oF Stupy 
Observation of high-school pupils who are asked to study 
will always show the need of attention to methods of 
study. The following description of such observation is 
illuminating : 
To ascertain to what extent the other members of the class 
might have this difficulty, the following experiment was tried. In 
assigning the next lesson, suggestions were given with unusual 
care. The pupils were then told that the next fifteen minutes 
would be given to studying the lesson, and that they should begin 
the assigned home work immediately. The experiment showed at 
once that the pupils did not appreciate the value of limited time, 
for all were slow in beginning work. It took some of them the 
whole fifteen minutes to go through the technique of getting started. 
Several evidently were not in the habit of working alone, for they 
looked about helplessly and simply imitated the others. However, 
these same pupils had come to the classroom daily with the lesson 
well prepared. Very little was accomplished in the fifteen minutes 
indicating that the pupils very probably wasted much time in 
studying their assignments of home work. Although the class had 
been in the high school only a short time, the teacher had been 
presupposing a habit of study which did not exist. Much of the 
difficulty is due to lack of knowledge as to how to study and how 
to use time to advantage. The remedy in this case is, of course, 
definite instruction as to methods of study. 
ORGANIZING A SCHOOL FOR SUPERVISED STUDY 
The organization of a school to provide opportunity for 
supervised study is thus described by the principal of one 
of the first schools to undertake this type of work on a 
large scale:

236 ‘THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
We took five minutes from each of the six recitation periods, 
which we have in our school day, and put these together to make 
a thirty-minute study period coming once a day. In order that 
each class might receive the benefit of this period, we arranged 
that the first period class use the time on Tuesday; the second 
period class on Wednesday ; and the third period class on Friday ; 
the following week that the fourth, fifth, and sixth period classes 
use the period for supervised study. On Monday and Thursday 
the teacher uses this study period by having come to her room for 
individual attention, such students as she thinks may need individual 
help. So much for the plan. 
In regard to the results, we have found that the plan is of 
greatest advantage with the younger students, and in the first part 
of a subject. That is, the younger students need direction in 
method of study, and all the students find it helpful when learning 
the method of attack upon a new subject. 
We find it necessary, of course, to keep some definite check 
upon the work of the students. This is done by setting for them 
certain concrete problems in their study. For instance, to work 
out a certain number of examples; to be ready to prove a given 
theorem ; to pick out the topic sentences in a given paragraph ; to 
determine the most important points of a certain, topic in physics ; 
to pick out the leading events in a given historical topic, etc. We 
find the method works very well in mathematics, science, and 
history. (Some difficulty has been experienced in the study of an 
English classic, such as Aacbeth, in making the work of the study 
period definite. We are working at this problem. 
Besides teaching methods of study, we have found one de- 
cided advantage of this study period is that by reason of it, the 
teacher gets a considerable insight into the methods of study of 
the various students and can discover those who waste time, who 
have faulty methods of attack, etc. 
Another point which we have found as a result of this work 
is that the teachers themselves are not at all clear as to definite 
methods of study."

METHODS 237 
ORGANIZING SuBJECT-MATTER FOR SUPERVISED STUDY 
One of the recent elaborate plans for supervised study is 
thus described by its author : 
It has been erroneously assumed by many writers that super- 
vised study was synonymous with effective study. It has been 
taken for granted that schools administering supervised-study 
schedules taught pupils how to study. There is a wide difference 
between more study and effective study. Supervised-study schedules | 
may secure the former and miss the latter. Effective study depends 
upon many elements, among them proper time and place, concen- 
tration, reading ability, organization habits, questioning habits, and, 
memory. Supervised-study schedules mechanically provide for the 
first two and more nearly secure the third than do other devices. 
The remaining element9 involved in the technique of study are not 
necessarily concomitants of so-called supervised study. . . . 
The origin of the plan I am about to describe grew out of study 
of the classroom exercise in typewriting. In the typewriting class 
pupils remain in the same group, but are individually apart. A 
pupil taking typewriting may stay out of school for two weeks and 
return to the same group in his mathematics, Latin, and typewrit- 
ing. In the last subject he starts in exactly where he left off with 
a distinct realization that his muscular-mental co-ordination has 
been impaired, while too often in the first two subjects he takes 
up the advanced work with his classmates apparently without any 
particular sense of loss. Why should he, if he makes his grade? 
Does he not figure out a distinct gain? 
Two things differentiate the mechanics of the typewriting exer- 
cise from the mathematics and Latin recitations: (@) consecutive, 
daily assignments which the pupil may follow without the guidance 
of a teacher; (4) individual responsibility and progress or an ac- 
counting for individual differences. Apply these same principles 
to academic subjects and it becomes necessary to provide printed 
daily lesson assignments and to check upon individual preparation 
of these daily assignments. One added factor, however, appears 
with the academic subject which uniquely distinguishes it from the 
manual, namely, the expression of the lesson ideas.
-P-A-G-E-250
  
238 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
In typewriting the pupil during the exercise concretely and 
muscularly shows the teacher how well he understands the lesson. 
In academic subjects the understanding must first be tested by 
language expression. There is no machine yet invented for elim- 
inating this language-expression exercise. Consequently for all 
academics there must always remain the recitation period. Zhrow- 
ing one’s ideas into a language mold is not the same as expressing 
one’s ideas by mechanical means. For this reason the recitation 
period must always be stressed. . . . 
v__ The laboratory-recitation plan is based on the fundamental idea 
that recitation groups should be organized on the basis of prepara- 
tion. Pupils need not recite on the day’s preparation, but the 
recitation for the day is upon work previously prepared and tested. 
The recitation teacher knows that when his group assembles each 
and every pupil has previously prepared and has been checked in 
the work to be recited upon, otherwise the pupil would not 
be in the group. This is accomplished by the following modus 
operand : 
Co-operating laboratory-recitation teachers, Forty or fifty pupils 
are assigned to a certain laboratory-recitation period operated by 
two teachers — one the laboratory, the other the recitation, teacher 
— in adjoining rooms. While the laboratory teacher is supervising 
the preparation of lessons during the ninety-minute period, the 
co-operating recitation teacher is conducting recitations with groups 
of pupils taken from the laboratory on the basis of their preparation. 
For illustration, each Friday the laboratory algebra teacher in the 
second period will give the co-operating recitation teacher of that 
class and period the advancement of the slowest pupil in each of 
two or three recitation groups previously determined on the basis 
of laboratory preparation. The recitation teacher prepares his 
work for the following week on the basis of this information. If 
there are three groups, the recitation teacher devotes thirty minutes 
to each group ; if two groups, forty-five minutes. The pupil spends 
either one-half or two-thirds of each period in the laboratory, the time 
depending upon the number of groups into which the recitation 
has been divided, and the remaining time in recitation."

METHODS 
ExPERIMENTS IN METHOD 
The meaning of experiments such as have been described 
is not far to seek. The ingenious supervisor or teacher who 
has watched the ordinary recitation made up of a series of 
questions and answers recognizes the fact that such a reci- 
tation is very formal. His efforts to improve teaching will 
carry him into new types of class exercises. The laboratory 
type of exercise will serve better in certain cases ; in others, 
the supervised-study type. Sometimes it is desirable to try 
other experiments. Without attempting to deal with these 
other experiments in detail, it may be well to enumerate 
some of the types of class exercise which have not been 
discussed in full. 
The lecture method is common in higher institutions. 
In the primary grades this method has taken the form of 
story-telling and has been developed of late with elaborate 
technique. 
The study lesson is a name which has been used to 
describe an exercise in which the pupils study new material 
on which they have not prepared in advance. The special 
forms of this kind of exercise may vary from a critical 
reading together of an advanced section of the textbook 
to a series of readings by members of the class of various 
scattered sources in collateral books. 
A report lesson is a modification of the lecture method. 
The members of the class, rather than the teacher, furnish 
the lecture material; each student having prepared a part 
of the whole in advance has an opportunity to present his 
findings to the class, with the result that the subject is 
studied in full through the coéperative efforts of all. 
The laboratory method may take on the form of field 
excursions in the geographical sciences and the form of 
gardening in agriculture. Whatever its form it is one of the 
most radical departures from the traditional class exercise. 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
240 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Shopwork has become common in many lines. With the 
girls the class exercises in domestic science and domestic 
art are crosses between construction exercises and investi- 
gation exercises. 
Drill exercises in mathematics and language consist in 
the performance under the teacher’s supervision of a series 
of tasks which are designed to cultivate fixed habits in the 
fields to which they belong. Very often such exercises are 
conducted in such a way that each pupil works individually. 
Written examinations ought to be included here. When- 
ever a class is given a series of review questions for the 
purpose of requiring a general review of a whole subject, 
the result of the exercise is to fix in the student’s mind 
certain larger elements of the study and to establish certain 
broad habits of selection. Written examinations may be, 
from this point of view, devices, of training, not merely 
tests of results. The examination method as a training 
method has, accordingly, an important place. 
The codperative recitation is one in which the mail ask 
the questions. The teacher withdraws as far as possible, 
and allows the members of the class to initiate the dis- 
cussions. When this kind of exercise is first introduced, 
the pupils are likely to follow as closely as they can the 
manner of questioning which they have seen exhibited by 
their teachers. If the experiment is carried out persistently, 
the pupils will ultimately become quite independent and 
spontaneous in their questioning. 
Metruop As A SuBjEcT oF ScrentiFic TESTS 
Class exercises are thus seen to differ in form and in 
results. When the student of standards begins to make his 
tests and measurements, he finds an inviting field for study 
in the different effects which follow, the various types of 
exercises enumerated above. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
METHODS 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
Methods can be discussed from various points of view. Let 
the student consider methods in relation to the different subjects 
of instruction. How will the method of teaching manual training 
compare with the method of teaching Latin or arithmetic or music? 
Again, let the relation of method to the maturity of pupils be 
discussed. What can be done in a high-school class in English 
that is not possible with an elementary class? In this connection 
what are the methods of teaching adults? Does a preacher exhibit 
method in his preaching? What is the method of a writer in a 
newspaper as distinguished from the method of a writer of novels? 
Methods can be considered from the point of view of the teacher's 
personality and equipment. Are there any natural differences 
between the methods of men and women in teaching? Classify 
teachers with respect to the aggressiveness of their methods of 
attack. Some are very quiet and require the pupils to do most of 
the talking ; others are not. A

  CHAPTER XVII 
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT 
INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS AND SociaL CONDITIONS 
The last chapter dealt with the intellectual side of class 
exercises. The recitation has for its final purpose the con- 
veying and fixing of certain ideas and methods of thinking. 
But this end can be reached only when the social condi- 
tions within the class are properly under control. The 
teacher is concerned, therefore, not alone with intellectual 
instruction; he is concerned also with what is sometimes 
called school government or school discipline. If the class 
is in a riot, it is impossible to make any headway with his- 
tory or arithmetic. Young and inexperienced teachers are 
often ineffective because they do not know the art of social 
management. They know the subject-matter which is to be 
impressed on the minds of the pupils, but they do not 
understand the serious social distractions which are sure 
to arise at times in a group of immature human beings. 
SocraL TRAINING GENERAL 
The social conditions necessary for successful classroom 
work are often dependent on the general discipline of the 
whole school rather than on the momentary situation. If 
the general social tone of a school building is low, the best 
teacher is likely to find himself handicapped. If, on the 
other hand, the social management outside the classroom is 
efficient, a given teacher who is not skillful in organizing 
his class may get on without serious disturbance. 
242 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-255
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT 243 
There is another sense, also, in which the problem of 
management is a general one. The effect of class manage- 
ment on the pupil’s life is profound. The school coéperates 
with the home and often outweighs the home in determin- 
ing the pupil’s ideals of social life. These ideals are not 
so much matters of intellectual training as of social habit. 
The influence of a teacher over his pupils is often due quite 
as much to the way in which he manages the class as to the 
subject-matter which he teaches. 
Types oF SocIAL ORGANIZATION 
A social situation can often be anticipated and condi- 
tions can be prearranged so as to direct all the participants 
into lines of activity which are desirable. In considering 
classroom organization it is important that we recognize, first, 
the possibilities of prearrangement. The more experienced 
a teacher becomes, the more he can anticipate situations. 
Second, there are forms of class organization which facili- 
tate social coéperation, such as arranging pupils in line. 
This is recognized outside the school, and it is a common 
practice to arrange people in line, when, for example, they 
are securing tickets. The management of groups of people 
can best be carried on by the adoption of such forms. 
There need be nothing artificial about the forms if they are 
not overdone. The skillful teacher often uses formal routine 
to keep the class moving as a unit. 
Third, there is no social group which does not at times 
profit by a critical review of situations after they are over, 
Punishment is meted out by society to those who have 
failed to conform to social demands. On the other hand, 
rewards are given to those who have promoted in conspic- 
uous ways the interests of the group. Both punishments 
and rewards are to be recognized as educative devices, and 
should be used in the school only when they are such. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  244 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
future welfare of society is what should be in mind in every 
expression of judgment on past performances. 
Briefly put, social management deals first with conditions 
before the group comes together; second, with the forms 
necessary while the group is together; and third, with the 
rewards or punishments which should follow an act in the 
interests of future behavior. 
SocraL ConrroL THROUGH ANTICIPATION 
Examples of anticipatory arrangements are not difficult to 
find, All the material equipments of the school contribute 
to class management. The division of the building into 
small classrooms provides for the division of the school into 
manageable groups. The arrangement of seats and the pre- 
cautions against the noise and distraction which result from 
the shuffling about of furniture are further examples of 
preparation in advance for the management of classes. 
In like fashion, the program for the day is worked out 
in advance by the wise administrator. This program pro- 
vides for a distribution of work and recreation such that 
there will be no undue tax on the child. The third-grade 
pupil, for example, cannot sit still for thirty-five minutes at 
atime, so the teacher changes the character of the exercise 
at the end of every twenty or thirty minutes. 
Anticipatory measures of the type here pointed out are 
usually not thought of by the inexperienced teacher as 
devices of class management. Class discipline is usually 
assumed to be a matter of the moment. If one will learn 
to look ahead, it is surprising how far most situations can 
be anticipated. The first day a teacher meets a class it is 
possible to foresee that it will be safer to require certain 
members of the group to sit apart. It is better to arrange 
their seats at once rather than to wait until an overt act 
precipitates a separation as a punishment. 
   
-P-A-G-E-257
    
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT 245 
The fact is that unfavorable social situations usually grow 
out of conditions that are remote and cannot be dealt with 
adequately at the moment. The disorderly boy is often one whose physical condition is unfit. The school is beginning 
to recognize the importance of proper feeding and proper 
hours of sleep, and is taking steps to see that pupils receive 
at home and at the luncheon hour the kind of hygienic 
attention which will prepare them for the work of the class, The social situation in the classroom is thus anticipated by a whole series of preparatory moves which at first sight 
seem remote from the teacher’s direct task of meeting a class. The attitude which is encouraged by a study of antici- patory measures is the same as that which is coming into 
the practice of medicine. There was a time when the phy- sician regarded it as his chief duty to deal with disease 
after it had actually appeared. To-day the far-sighted prac- titioner is an advocate of what he calls preventive medicine. 
He aims to get the community interested in preparing in 
advance wholesome conditions which will conduce to health. The teacher's task ought not to be that of constantly penal- 
izing pupils who have done wrong; it should be rather that 
of preparing conditions which will reduce disorder to a minimum and promote to its highest degree orderly pro- 
cedure in the class. 
ORGANIZATION OF ROUTINE 
The anticipation of social needs passes insensibly into 
the organization of regular forms of routine to be followed 
in the class exercise itself. The class exercise is not dif- 
ferent in its essentials from any social gathering. It has 
been found necessary in meetings of any type to require 
one who would speak to secure the floor. It would lead to 
social chaos if everyone in an assembly spoke his mind 
according to his own personal impulse.

246 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The difficulty in applying this analogy to the classroom 
and the difficulty in general about all fixed routine is that 
free discussion is often defeated by formality. The teacher 
is anxious, if he understands his task, to draw out the 
enthusiastic response of every member of his class. How to 
do this and at the same time avoid confusion which will 
disturb the whole group is a nice problem of adjustment. 
Formal methods should be required and adhered to far 
enough to insure the smooth operation of the social life of 
the class, but spontaneity should be prized and conserved, 
Another and perhaps more fortunate example of routine 
to avoid confusion is to be found in an effective beginning 
of a class exercise. When a recitation is about to begin, it 
is a matter of major importance that the teacher be ready 
with something which will attract the attention of the whole 
class. Some instructors accomplish this with the first ques- 
tion; some resort to such a device as the announcement of 
the next assignment; some begin with a summary of the 
last lesson; some have the members of the class write for 
a few minutes. In sharp contrast with these methods which 
indicate that the instructor is ready and knows what he 
wants done are the aimless wanderings of some instructors 
who look over their desks for a book which seems to be lost 
in the débris, or the time-consuming roll call indulged in 
by others. 
A third type of illustration of orderly procedure is the 
systematization of methods of passing in material. If pupils 
arrange their written work or their books or other material 
in a regular fashion, there will be no disorder in handling 
them. The social group will move as a unit, and this com- 
mon movement will itself make for social solidarity. 
There is much sanction in social psychology for this 
emphasis on routine. The customs of primitive peoples 
take on the character of sacred rites, so essential are they 
to the common life of the social group. Even in civilized
-P-A-G-E-259
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT 247 
society the demands of the group are paramount. There is 
in the family a fixed time for eating meals, not because 
hunger coincides in its reappearances with the movements 
of the clock but because the joint activities of a social 
group proceed better when they are systematized. 
The routinizing of school work can go too far. The re- 
quirement has been imposed within the memory of this 
adult generation that pupils sit in their seats through long 
recitation periods with their hands behind their backs. 
Marching in lockstep from class to class has sometimes 
been required. The list could be lengthened indefinitely. 
The trouble in most of these cases is that the teacher loses 
sight of the educational motive of all discipline and begins 
to think of so-called order as an end in itself. 
PUNISHMENTS AND REWARDS 
Even after a situation has been as carefully organized as 
is humanly possible, there are sure to come social emer- 
gencies. These furnish occasions for a type of discipline 
which is valuable not so much for the effect which it pro- 
duces on the present situation as for its effect on the 
future. Furthermore, there is often very little expectation 
that the future will bring an. exact repetition of the par- 
ticular situation which has just passed. The discipline is 
therefore general in its type rather than specifically appli- 
cable to the present. 
Viewed as a general preparation for the future, the social 
condemnation or approval of an act is often very important. 
For éxample, a boy breaks something through sheer careless- 
ness. Shall the teacher pass the act without comment, or 
shall the act be made an occasion for punishment? Some 
people are disposed to determine what kind of treatment 
shall be given in terms of the value of the object broken. 
This is evidently to make of the specific act a specific issue. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
248 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
It is better, if it can be done, to detach attention from the 
specific act and note the general consequences of careless- 
ness. Educationally, the accident furnishes an opportunity 
to warn, not against breaking that particular object again, 
but against being careless. If the lesson is well taught, it 
will tend to keep the boy from rushing about in the future 
without regard for his surroundings, whatever those sur- 
roundings may be. 
Commendation, like blame, is useless except as it sets 
up in the pupil’s mind true canons of judgment. To praise 
a child for a particular act, merely concentrating attention 
on that act, is to neglect the opportunity of cultivating a 
general virtue. 
So complicated are the issues touched on in the last few 
paragraphs that many teachers feel that the safest course is 
to avoid praise and blame as far as possible and allow 
natural consequences to open the eyes of children to the 
virtue or error of their ways. Social approbation and _ social 
condemnation are thought of as something highly artificial 
and to be avoided. Experience does not justify this view. 
Social life has its rewards and its punishments, and the 
child will miss a large part of his education if he does not 
come to understand the importance to him of social values. 
Let us consider a concrete case. A group of small boys 
in the fourth grade hid the rubbers and umbrella of a little 
girl in their grade one rainy noon, so that the girl was much 
delayed in starting home for luncheon and was much dis- 
tressed. What could be done? The range of ordinary 
school punishments seems very limited. In earlier days 
there was a form of punishment capable of the nicest gra- 
dations and of universal application for every offense. But 
corporal punishment has gone, and if, from among the 
remaining possibilities, properly adjusted punishment is to 
be administered, it must be devised with ingenuity and reg- 
ulated in quantity. The teacher in the case referred to hit 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT 249 
on the plan of making the three little boys serve the girl for 
a week. They brought her coat and hat to her after school. 
She sent them on errands to the library. They learned 
more under the careful observation of the class about how 
boys should treat others, especially girls, than they could 
possibly have thought out in long months of freedom from 
the bonds of service. 
Legitimate praise is perhaps harder to administer with 
equity than punishment. The teacher holds up a child’s 
drawing and calls attention to its excellences. The danger 
is that the child will become self-conscious and conceited. 
A boy is polite and the teacher remarks on the fact. The 
other boys in the class who have not of late merited such 
praise make a virtue of their freedom from the taint of the 
teacher’s praise. 
The difficulty of laying down any principles regulating 
punishment and praise is that cases cannot be discussed 
intelligently without reference to the general social situations 
in which they find their setting. It may be said, indeed, 
that when an act is performed, it is too late to deal with it 
adequately in any case. The only effective form of class- 
room management is that which anticipates the act and 
develops a social atmosphere in which condemnation or ap- 
probation is naturally and spontaneously contributed by the 
whole group. 
It is sometimes said that good school discipline is to be 
found only where there is no discipline. This remark is 
true only when discipline is thought of as synonymous with 
punishment administered; it assumes that the administra- 
tion of such punishment is the chief or only form of dis- 
cipline. In a larger view of the situation one should 
recognize that the best school discipline is that which 
guides the social group at all times and controls its atti- 
tudes toward all acts. The spirit of a class is no accident 
of the moment. That teacher has the best discipline who
-P-A-G-E-262
  250 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
has planned and prepared the social situation so carefully 
that a departure from the established order brings an in- 
stant and wholesome response from the whole group. 
LarGER SocIAL ORGANIZATION 
With this larger view of discipline in mind, one may legit- 
imately introduce into this discussion a reference to those 
forms of elaborate organization of the school group which 
are sometimes attempted in the school-city or the school- 
state. Under these plans the pupils of a school are organized 
into an imitation city or state patterned after the adult cor- 
poration. The purpose of such an experiment is twofold. 
First, the conduct of a miniature organization prepares the 
pupils for participation in later life in the duties of citizen- 
ship, and second, there grows up a feeling of responsibility 
for the conditions in the immediate social group. The 
officers of the school-city are more active than they would 
otherwise be in restraining their fellows from possible dis- 
order and in promoting acts which redound to the advantage 
of all. 
These elaborate organizations are educational devices 
which often stimulate great interest and serve their twofold 
purpose admirably. In general, it must be remembered 
that a sense of responsibility cannot be cultivated in a day 
and is not the natural possession of an immature mind. 
Unless there is constant supervision the school-city is likely 
to go on the rocks even as a real municipality suffers from 
the tendency of human nature to backslide. The teacher 
must bring to the school-city those experiences and those 
social stimulations which will train and keep alive the 
community spirit. 
It is a mistake to assume that social organization exists 
only where it finds expression in some such elaborate form as 
is discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. Social attitudes 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT 251 
of some kind are always present. The teacher who leaves the 
matter to mere chance runs risks. The teacher who over- 
does organization suffers from the reaction which commonly 
follows restraint. The teacher who deals with the situation 
with plan and foresight may mold the social group into a 
helpful agency contributing greatly to the work of the school. 
ATTEMPTS TO CLASSIFY UNRULY MEMBERS OF THE 
SocraL Group 
However carefully the social whole has been organized, 
there comes a time when an unruly member appears. The 
teacher’s task is then to defend the group and bring the 
eccentric member if possible under the influence of the social 
order. 
In a very interesting chapter in his volume on ‘ School 
Discipline” Professor Bagley has supplied the evidence that 
no classroom can be regarded as free from the appearance 
of unruly types of students. Even good teachers of long 
experience who in general are free from difficulties with the 
discipline of their classes find it necessary to give special 
attention to the troublesome types. These types are described 
by Professor Bagley as including the following: the stub- 
born pupil who makes difficulty because he is constantly 
refusing to fit into the social order; the haughty pupil who 
is not merely conceited but in his ordinary performances 
disturbs the regular social routine by his overbearing atti- 
tude both toward his fellows and his teacher; the self-com- 
placent pupil who cannot be aroused to activity by any of 
the ordinary inducements that are presented by the school. 
Other types include the irresponsible pupil, the morose 
pupil, the hypersensitive pupil, the deceitful pupil, and the 
vicious pupil. 
This collection of unmanageables fortunately does not turn 
up in any single class at one time, but, as Professor Bagley 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
252 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
remarks, it would be unwise for us to leave young teachers 
with the idea that the appearance of any one of these types 
is due to the teacher’s inefficiency. Many an efficient young 
teacher is baffled at the outset by the difficulties of dealing » 
with one or another of these types of students. Professor 
Bagley made inquiry of some of the best teachers whom he 
could locate, and found that it is inevitable that pupils of 
these types are to be found sooner or later in every school. 
The wise teacher does well to plan in advance for the recep- 
tion of the particular specimen that is sure to fall to his 
lot with every ten or twelve pupils. 
IMPERSONAL DISCIPLINE 
The final comment which may be made in this connec- 
tion is that the teacher must recognize that school discipline 
is a professional and educational problem, not a matter of 
purely personal relations between pupil and teacher. The 
teacher is dealing with a problem of group organization ; 
he cannot allow the fractious pupil to pull him down to the 
level of a personal controversy. It is difficult at times to 
keep from the strong emotional reactions which blind the 
teacher to this objective view of school order, but the effi- 
cient teacher will see to it that the group idea and the

Society as a whole has taken an entirely new attitude in modern 
times toward the matter of punishment. The prison policy of 
modern nations is different from the older policy. What can be 
said with regard to prison education? What is the relation of 
crime to physical conditions ? 
With regard to the matter of rewards and prizes, what can be 
said for and against exemption from examinations as a reward for 
good work? Should medals be given for high scholarship? What 
is the attitude of society at large outside of the school in regard to 
rewards? For example, what does society do for the painter, the 
author, the successful plumber and carpenter? Is the example of 
society at large capable of direct translation into school practice ?

SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 
PROGRAMS AND Marks 
The regular and orderly movement of a social group 
depends on the adoption of a program. The daily program 
of a school is an indispensable formal device for maintain- 
ing that type of solidarity which was discussed in the last 
chapter. A second formal device of school control is the 
marking system, under which the pupil’s status is deter- 
mined and in accordance with which all his relations of 
an official type are regulated. The marking system may 
be treated as a conventional plan for distributing social re- 
wards and punishments. Together, the daily program and 
the marking system are so much more significant than any 
other devices of social organization that they may properly 
be selected for special treatment. 
Tue Totat Scnoot Day 
The arrangement of the daily program involves, first of 
all, the determination of the total amount of time available 
in the school day. Reliable information on this matter is at 
hand for a large number of the smaller cities of the United 
States, as indicated in the following quotation : 
The following statistics show present conditions regarding the 
length of the school day. Of 1,270 cities reporting, 338 have a 
school day of from four and a half to five hours; 521, from five to 
five and a half hours; 411, from five and a half to six hours. Of 
1,310 cities reporting, 1,242 have two daily sessions, and 68 but 
254
-P-A-G-E-267
SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 255 
one daily session. The tendency is toward a longer school day, 
especially in the grammar grades and in the high school. The 
opinion of most school men is that a high school of two sessions 
is superior to a high school of one session. With the one-session 
plan, but little time is available for study periods. It is evident 
that four recitations, the number generally required, demand more 
than one or two 45 or 50 minute periods for study. The theory 
is that with the’ one-session plan pupils will prepare their lessons 
at home in the afternoon. The experience of the superintendents 
who have tried the one-session plan has generally been similar to that of the superintendent of schools at Detroit, Minn., who says: 
The one-session plan which I found in vogue in this high school was 
retained for the present year so that its workings might be studied. It 
is fine in theory, but a failure in practice. Asking the pupiis to be ready 
for work at 8:30 caused much tardiness. It was impossible for those who came by the bus or train to be on time. Then the fact that the high school had one time schedule and the grades another, while occupying the same building, caused endless confusion. During the afternoon, 
when students came back only for shop and laboratory work or to con- sult teachers, there was further annoyance from students passing to and fro through the halls. There was too much idling about the buildings for the good of the grades in session or of the high-school students themselves. Of course, the fine theory was that students would spend the afternoon studying in the quiet and freedom of their homes, but they didn’t. Too many of them roamed the streets and came to class unpre- pared the next day. The plan also kept the industrial teachers waiting until afternoon before they could begin their work. They were compelled to do it when pupils were tired and nervous. This work ought to be interspersed through the day to relieve the tension of the other work. One argument advanced in favor of the one-session plan is that many students work their way through school by using the afternoon. The facts are otherwise. This year only three boys have worked afternoons, and possibly the same number of girls, 
Next year we shall return to the “long day” and lengthen the time “devoted to each subject, so as to give teachers a better chance to teach it thoroughly. Each student will also have a longer time at school to study under the supervision of the principal.1

256 ‘THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
At Gary the eight-hour school day with variations in the 
program to secure play, shopwork, class work, and entertain- 
ment is the ideal toward which the system is working. In 
some other quarters the reduction of formal school work 
has been advocated on the assumption that outdoor work 
and play can be supplied by the home or some other agency 
enough to fill up the pupil’s waking hours. » Whatever the 
form taken by the discussion, one leading tendency appears 
everywhere: the child’s work should be organized through- 
out the day. In most communities this means that the 
school will be called on to extend its control to most of 
the hours. 
Tur Crass PERIOD 
When the length of the school day has been determined, 
the problem of subdividing the day presents itself. The 
subdivision must first of all recognize the claims of various 
subjects. The type of problem which arises at this point 
was discussed at length in the chapters on the curriculum, 
and we need not here discuss further the claims of subjects. 
We turn now to the general problem of class organization 
which can be formulated in the question, How long can a 
student profitably try to concentrate his attention on a 
single form of activity? 
PHYSIOLOGICAL FATIGUE 
The pupil's ability to work is determined by certain 
physiological conditions which should be understood by 
every teacher. These conditions can be described in a 
brief study of the physiology of fatigue. 
Any animal tissue, as, for example, a muscle, is a store- 
house of energy. Through nutrition the muscle tissue is 
kept in condition to contract. Whenever the muscle con- 
tracts, it uses up its own substance; it burns up its tissues 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
       SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 257 
to a limited degree. In the process of thus consuming 
its material the muscle gradually becomes clogged with 
waste products. It is the business of the circulatory system 
in a living organism to carry away this waste material and 
thus free the muscle from the effects of its contraction. 
The circulatory system also brings new materials in the 
form of nutrition to restore the depleted tissues. The res- 
toration of the tissue through nutrition is not the demand 
which is most urgent in the case of a muscle which is called 
on to contract for a long period of time. Sooner or later 
the muscle must, indeed, be brought back to its normal 
state of nutrition, but during actual contraction the most im- mediate physiological problem is to keep it clear of its own 
waste products. If these waste products are not removed, 
they tend to interrupt further contraction by preventing 
the nerve fiber which enters the muscle from discharging 
motor impulses into the muscle. If stronger nérvous im- 
pulses are sent through the nerve fiber, the muscle, even 
though it is somewhat clogged, will be found in a condition 
to contract with its original vigor; but if the nervous im- 
pulses are not increased, the contractions gradually diminish 
in intensity. This is a condition of muscular fatigue, and 
is to be distinguished from exhaustion, which does not set 
in until the substance of the muscle has been used up toa point which endangers the tissue. 
Fatigue is nature’s effort to protect tissues against any 
possibility of excessive use. Fatigue sets in at a period 
long before danger to the tissue is at hand. The overcoming 
of fatigue is dependent in all cases on the power to dispose 
of waste products. The athlete, for example, becomes a 
better runner chiefly through a training of his organism to 
carry away waste products. The untrained individual grows 
stiff and sore from exercise, not because his muscles are 
used up, but because his muscles are clogged with waste 
substances,   
-P-A-G-E-270
258 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
This description of muscular fatigue lays the foundation 
for an understanding of the problem of nervous fatigue. 
The nerve cells, like the muscles, get clogged by the prod- 
ucts of their own action. They then fail to carry nervous 
impulses freely, and the individual can do his mental or 
physical work only with excessive effort. Fatigue of nerve 
cells means that nature has limits of work in these cells. 
Fortunately, the limit is reached long before exhaustion or 
other real dangers set in. 
CoNDITIONS LIKE FATIGUE 
Matters are complicated by the fact that physical condi- 
tions other than ordinary use produce fatigue-like effects in 
nerve cells. Excitement of any kind rapidly changes the 
condition of nerve cells, and sometimes foreign chemical 
substances get into the blood, as in fever or infection, and 
produce a condition that is in effect the same as fatigue. 
Still further, as a fact of large importance in determining 
capacity for work, the nerve cells pass each day through a 
kind of internal cycle of conditions. At certain hours their 
condition is such that they transmit nervous impulses freely, 
and work is easy; at other hours work drags because the 
nerve cells are not prepared to be active; their internal 
chemical condition is such as to obstruct transmission of 
impulses. Thus, one is usually very energetic in the middle 
of the forenoon, but is logy at noon and sleepy at a late 
hour in the afternoon, Marked individual differences appear, 
making this statement merely a general statement. Further- 
more, personal habits can be changed to some extent through 
the adoption of new habits of life. 
Finally, there are all sorts of pathological conditions which 
profoundly affect the life and action of nerve cells. Anzemia 
and malnutrition may render nerve cells utterly incapable 
of continued action. 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 259 
PRACTICAL PRECEPTS BASED ON Stupy oF FaTIGUE 
Enough has been said to make it clear that no simple 
formula can be applied to a group of pupils when one tries 
to determine for purposes of the daily program how long 
their nerve cells can be kept at work on a single task. The 
wisest course for the teacher to follow is to be alert, and 
when a class reaches its limit of profitable work to intro- 
duce a change. On the other hand, the teacher should be 
very discriminating and should understand that fatigue is 
not a dangerous symptom. For example, suppose that the 
athlete always stopped his exercise just as soon as he began 
to feel the necessity of sending stronger nervous impulses 
down to his muscles. He would lose the best results of 
training, for these results consist in the acquisition of the 
power to overcome fatigue. So also with the pupil. The 
acquisition of the power to overcome fatigue is a most 
important part of the pupil’s training. 
Keeping the principles suggested in the foregoing dis- 
cussion in mind, it is relatively easy to arrive at certain 
practical rules of program administration. 
First, maturity ought to mean greater power of endurance. 
The older classes should—and usually do — have longer 
periods of work. 
Second, the period should be long enough to stretch 
the pupil’s powers. Regulation of work within this period 
should be left to the teacher, and teachers should train 
themselves to recognize the symptoms of fatigue and to 
judge when training has gone as far as it can in over- 
coming fatigue. 
Third, there should be variety in the program. The 
nervous system is made up of many different centers. 
The variation of occupations brings different centers suc- 
cessively into play and gives to each the opportunity of 
relaxation which is most wholesome. A long school day with
-P-A-G-E-272
  260 ‘THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
much variety is eminently more rational than a short session 
of work of a single type concentrated into a few hours. 
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS CONTROLLING LENGTH 
oF THE CLAss PERIOD © 
When recommending variations in the program we collide 
with what may seem at first to be an insuperable difficulty. 
It is impossible from an administrative point of view to have 
class exercises of irregular lengths. Imagine what would hap- 
pen if the mathematics teacher should dismiss his class after 
a recitation of twenty-seven minutes, and the Latin teacher 
should hold his for fifty-three minutes. For administrative 
reasons class periods must be measured by the clock. 
This leads to certain absurdities in school organization. 
For example, in order to regularize credits in high schools 
a unit of credit has been defined as a certain number of 
hours of class work. A moment’s consideration makes it 
perfectly clear that an English class consisting of thirty 
freshmen will do less intensive work in a forty-minute 
period than will an advanced senior class of four students ° 
in trigonometry. The administrative fiction of uniformity 
when like credit is given for these two classes is grotesque. 
The assignment of a double period to laboratory classes 
is likewise a concession to administrative convenience rather 
than a carefully weighed arrangement. It is easier to make 
up periods in multiples of the standard recitation time. But 
it is by no means clear that the sciences can profitably use 
double periods. The internal adjustment of laboratory work 
needs more careful study than it has received in the past. 
The laboratory method, as shown in an earlier chapter, is 
one which has excited great enthusiasm. Many a laboratory 
assignment which does not fill the time allotted to it is 
tolerated because of the vague general enthusiasm for the 
method and the formal arrangement of double periods.  
-P-A-G-E-273
SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 261 
ADJUSTMENT OF WorRK WITHIN THE PERIOD 
Such examples as these show from a new angle the im- 
portance of the movement for supervised study which was 
described in an earlier chapter. The teacher in charge of 
the class must ultimately have at hand various devices, some 
intended to give play to individual differences, some in- 
tended to promote social codperation. Then, while admin- 
istrative necessity dictates a uniform period for the class 
exercise, the educational needs of the students can be met 
by variations in the content and method of instruction. 
ADJUSTMENT OF CREDITS 
Such a formula as this dictates also the recognition in 
an administrative way of the differences between the work 
performed by different students. There has been of late 
an increasing recognition of the justice of giving pupils 
different degrees of credit for work which they do in one and the same course. The student who carries a course in 
algebra with a high grade undoubtedly learns more than 
the student who does low-grade work in the same class. 
Tue PROBLEM OF GRADING 
The proper distribution of credits opens up the complex problem of grading systems. The grading system is the basis of academic rewards and penalties. Yet it is recog- nized by pupils and teachers alike to be full of pitfalls. The _ ordinary system uses letters such as E for excellent, P for poor; or percentage designations such as 100 for perfect, 60 or 75 for just passing ; or some other similar symbolism, 
The ambiguities in the system arise in part out of the fact that individual teachers have the most divergent notions as to the meaning of each of the symbols. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
262 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Let us assume the case of a new teacher who has just 
come to a given school trying to find out what the other 
teachers mean by their marks. This teacher will be told 
that 100 per cent means perfection. But what is perfection 
in a subject ? Is the student perfect when he tells what is in 
the textbook, or is there a demand for original thinking? 
Still more doubtful is the meaning of 90 per cent. Does 
this signify nine tenths of what a student might know, or 
is it a kind of vague statement meaning that the student is 
in the upper part of the class? 
The new teacher will be very likely at this point, if he 
is intelligent about marking systems, to ask how many stu- 
dents in a class usually get 100 or 90. This question is 
based on a conception of the meaning of marks entirely 
different from that which was referred to in the last para- 
graph. Marks may refer, and often do refer, not to the 
degree of perfection in knowledge but to the relative posi- 
tion of the student in his class. Some teachers mark the 
best pupil 100 and then try to grade the rest from this 
standard. 
EXPERIMENTS WITH GRADING SYSTEMS 
Examples could be multiplied indefinitely, showing that 
there is great vagueness in regard to the meaning of marks. 
We are, however, more interested in the efforts which are 
being made to overcome these unsatisfactory conditions. 
First, teachers are being informed by comparative dia- 
grams what the relation of their own marking system is to 
the general average of their colleagues. A few years ago. 
the president of Harvard sent to each member of the faculty 
a chart showing the curve of distribution, reproduced in 
Fig. 16, and, superimposed on this, the curve of the indi- 
vidual instructor’s marks. The standard curve was derived 
by averaging the marks from eight large courses.

SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 263 
Second, the University of Missouri! has frankly given up 
trying to determine whether students are 100 per cent per- 
fect in a subject or only 80 per cent. All students in all 
classes are arranged in the order of their excellence in their 
classes. The marks, in other words, are relative. When all the 
marks of the institution are compiled, there are a few stu- 
dents who are relatively very high, many who are mediocre, 
and a few who are low. The low ones are dropped, the high

The full-drawn line shows the average percentage of grades in eight large elementary courses. The dotted line and the broken line represent two departures from the 
average practice by instructors in two different departments 
ones get honors, and the mediocres get the reward due the

the University gives to a student who stands in the upper- 
most 5 per cent of his class 1.2 credits toward graduation. 
The student in the next lower 20 per cent gets 1.1 credits. 
The 50 per cent who are mediocre get the normal credit of 
1.0, while the lower ranks are penalized from o.1 to all credit.

  264 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
A third effort to improve the situation is being tried in the 
high school of Kansas City, Kansas.1_ In each classroom is 
posted a conspicuous chart telling students what they must 
do to get high grades. One may pass with a C if one does 
the required work taken up in a sixty-minute combination 
recitation and study period. If one is to receive #, it is 
required among other virtues that one be sufficiently well 
prepared to recite without prompting from the teacher. 
Furthermore, one must do outside work and report on it. 
The C pupil does his work in the class, but that is not 
enough for a B. The A pupil must fulfill even higher re- 
quirements. Each department is allowed to post, in addition 
to the general statements made for the whole school, special 
regulations which obtain for the work of that particular 
department. 
This system is a kind of public definition of the marks, 
and has the great advantage of clearing up in the minds of 
the students what often seems to them to be an unjust and 
mysterious scheme. 
Tue Stupy or Marks As AN INTRODUCTION TO A STUDY 
oF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
The study of grading systems has attracted much atten- 
tion’ of late among the students of the science of education. 
It is an excellent subject with which to illustrate scientific 
methods, because the records being in quantitative form lend 
themselves to easy and exact statistical comparison. 
There is no better body of material for a principal to 
employ in arousing his teachers to a recognition of the fact 
that they are factors in a system. Marks are a kind of 
technical language used in the school system. Their suc- 
cessful use calls for some comprehension of the meaning 
and problems of the system as a whole.

EXERCISES AND READINGS 
Let members of the class make up a school program. Let 
there be in a certain high school eight teachers, one well qualified 
in each of the following subjects: English, mathematics, Latin, 
physics, biology, modern languages, domestic science, and manual 
arts, There are seven classrooms and a study room. ‘There are 400 
students, distributed as follows: 140 freshmen, 110 sophomores, 
go juniors, and 60 seniors. ‘The school is in session-from 8.45 A.M. 
to '12 noon and. from 1.30 to 3.30 P.M. Make up a program of 
classes. Record all the questions that are not answered in the 
above statement of conditions. Supply answers yourself, recording 
explicitly the answer which you give in each case. Let the mem- 
bers of the class then compare programs. 
What is the difference between such a problem as above defined 
and the problem of making out a program for an elementary school? 
A very good exercise under this chapter is to give a written 
exercise to the class and then ask the writers to mark each his 
own paper after the question and its possible answers have been 
discussed by the class. In like manner let each member of the 
class mark a certain English composition or a recitation made by 
some member of the class. Let the members of the class rate the 
various members of the class in regard to their work. After each 
of these markings make a general table showing the distribution 
of grades and note the differences between the different markers. 
There is very little written on detailed administrative problems. 
A very good reading exercise at this point can be made up by 
referring to Monroe’s “A Cyclopedia of Education” (Macmillan) 
and requiring the student to find ten strictly administrative topics 
and ten which have to do with methods. For most of the articles 
in the “Cyclopedia” reading references are given.

  CHAPTER XIX 
PLAY 
Motives FoR CULTIVATION OF PHysIcAL POWERS 
Recent educational practice has laid great emphasis on 
the cultivation of children’s physical natures as well as their 
mental powers. This new emphasis on physical training is 
due in part to a recognition of the wisdom of extending 
education so as to include all sides of the individual. It is 
due in part also to the conviction that the only way to deal 
successfully with the ordinary work of the classroom is to 
provide the kind of change and relief which comes from 
physical exercise. Regular opportunities for play are accord- 
ingly provided in the schools of to-day, and an elaborate 
system of physical supervision is being developed in all the 
leading school systems. Some review of these movements 
will be appropriate by way of supplement to the general 
survey in earlier chapters of the activities of the school 
system, 
EARLIER ATTITUDE TOWARD PLAy 
The school of a generation ago retained a good deal of 
the Puritan attitude toward play. One has only to recall 
the pandemonium which used to break loose at recess and 
at the time of dismissal to realize that there was a sharp 
distinction between school and play. In school one sat up 
straight and still; when one was free from school one let 
out all the pent-up inner impulses. The kind of play that. 
was exhibited under these conditions was riotous, irregular, 
266 . 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
      PLAY 267 
and aimless. Furthermore, the kind of play which was cul- 
tivated under these conditions did not carry over into later 
life. There was no system, no progression, in that play, and 
no cultivation of the inventiveness so necessary if the rec- reations of later life are to be intelligent. 
Pray as Naturat BEHAvior 
The change in attitude from that of the old-fashioned 
school to that of the modern school is traceable in part to practical experience and in part to a general and funda- 
mental change in the philosophy of life. To-day there is the profoundest respect for all that is natural. The theo- 
logical attitude of medievalism and of the Puritans that the body is the baser part of self has disappeared with the development of the biological sciences. The social sciences, 
too, have contributed the lesson that all human behavior is 
in accordance with certain natural laws. The philosophy of 
naturalism thus accepted has profoundly modified the views 
of parents and teachers with regard to the play impulse in children, 
PERIODS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLAY 
Not only is play natural, but numerous scientific studies reveal the fact that in the animal world and in man’s life play contributes in no unimportant degree to the individ- 
ual’s development. These scientific studies have shown 
that play follows definite lines of development. There is first the play of early infancy, which consists in the thyth- 
mical movement of the limbs and in the grasping after ob- jects which ‘satisfy the senses. This is the period of the rattle. There is at this stage no regard for others, no social 
interest. Then comes a second stage, where play is made 
up of imitative acts, This is the period of the girl’s doll 
and of the boy’s kit of tools, The child’s attention is now  
-P-A-G-E-280
268 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
centered on others and their doings, and this outward atten- 
tion furnishes the individual with his models of action. 
Then come the plays of contest and competition, when the 
child, now of school age, matches himself against his com- 
panions in speed or strength. This is the period of running 
games. Imitation has ripened into the kind of rivalry which 
helps the individual to realize his personal powers. Follow- 
ing competition comes the period of team play, in which 
social union with some of one’s companions is combined 
with contest against others. The adolescent child is now 
becoming aware of the uses of social sympathy and co- 
operation. At each of these stages some of the earlier 
forms of play survive, and all ripen into the form of play 
characteristic of adult life, where the competitions are against 
intellectual obstacles more than against physical. Adult play 
demands skill and intellectual mastery of complex problems. 
When one has learned that there is a natural and orderly 
evolution of the play impulse, one realizes that it is rational 
to follow this natural order in promoting individual develop- 
ment. Play takes on a dignity that it never had in the days 
when it was looked on as an uncurbed attribute of infancy 
to be tolerated only because there seemed no possible way 
of eradicating it. 
Pray as NaturaL EpucaTIon 
Indeed, the scientific discussions have gone much further 
than merely to trace the course of the development of play. 
They show why play is to be recognized as a necessary 
phase of life. At first the immature instincts of the child 
tend to express themselves in activities that are irregular 
and ill-codrdinated; but aimed unmistakably in the direc- 
tion of the later serious activities of adult life. The kitten 
chases the ball in preparation for the later activities of the 
hunt,: The explanation of this form of early play is that in 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
PLAY 269 
the young animal’s nervous system there are inherited paths 
which are ripening into action. The impulses of life tend 
to flow down these inherited paths; it is nature’s method 
of helping the nervous system to mature to the point of 
full action. 
When nature’s processes have matured the nervous sys- 
tem, the lines of behavior of which the individual is capable 
are diverse. Each serious activity of life engages some of 
the individual’s energy and brings to the point of fatigue a 
certain group of his possible activities. When one part of 
the nervous system has been fatigued, there will always be 
other parts which have not been used. For example, a man 
who reads for four hours does not use his arms and legs, At 
the end of the four hours his reading powers will be fatigued, 
but his arms and legs will be overready for action. There 
must be some change in activity and’ some relaxation from 
serious work. Play is nature’s answer to this demand. 
Socrat Necessity oF RECREATION 
In addition to the scientific studies of the nature and 
function of play appears the sociological fact that the growth 
of leisure has created a new demand for well-regulated play. 
Furthermore, the conditions of urban life are unfavorable 
for some of the simple plays which in an earlier stage of 
civilization furnished an outlet for the natural impulses. If 
the environment is artificial, there must be a deliberate and 
intelligent effort to supply what nature demands but civiliza- 
tion has made inaccessible. 
The danger in a congested city where natural play is 
not possible is a moral danger. There are vicious agencies 
which are not slow to take advantage of the strong natural 
demand for recreation. The result is that for the sake of 
gain appeals are made to the baser impulses of human 
nature, The success of these unsavory forms of amusement 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
270 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
attests the presence of a strong natural demand. The way 
to meet the danger is to provide forms of recreation which 
are wholesome and elevating. 
Pray as PuysicAL EpucaTION 
Finally, all the arguments in favor of play are reénforced 
by the general demand that the physical condition of chil- 
dren in school be made a matter of especial concern. Play 
is the form of exercise which serves better than any other 
to keep the physical system in good tone. Hence the 
conclusion that play is as indispensable as it is natural. 
Tur ScHOoL AND PLay 
In the light of these scientific and sociological studies 
it is evident that the school has a task before it. Briefly 
stated, this task is as follows: Nature intended that the 
child should play; play is a phase of the child’s natural 
education. The conditions of life in cities have deprived 
children of the opportunity for the free development of play. 
The educational system must take the children in hand and 
train them back into nature’s ways. 
Surveys oF CHILDREN’S PLay IN CITIES 
Evidence that the situation needs attention is furnished 
by studies which have recently been made. The following 
quotation supplies one such body of evidence : 
In the hour and a half following the close of school November 
10 and 18 careful observations were made in all parts of the town 
at the same time, by four adults selected for the purpose. They 
were instructed to look carefully through the streets, vacant lots, 
yards, parks, and playgrounds and make a notation of every child 
or young person up to the age of 21, observed. The information 
sought was what each one was actually doing, at play or otherwise, 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
     PLAY 271 
and where he was doing it. They were also asked to estimate the ages of the children observed. On November 6 a preliminary sounding was made by the investigator. Each observer was assigned definite territory so as to avoid duplication and all worked at exactly the same time. The results of these * soundings ” have been carefully tabulated and summarized. 
Altogether 696 children, 447 boys and 249 girls, were ob- served, Of the total number, 262 or almost 40 per cent of the children and young people were doing nothing. Especially signifi- cant is the fact that 168 of the 262 idling boys and girls were idling in groups. Here is where mischief usually starts. A major- ity of those walking (203) were in reality idling. Fifty-six or eight per cent of the children were playing football and baseball and 22 or a fraction over three per cent were occupied with other games. A play life the two chief features of which are idling and walking indicates that the community is not discharging its plain duty with respect to the boys and girls," 
A like result is reported in the Cleveland survey. 
A play census, taken June 23, 1913, under the direction of the Chief Medical Inspector and Assistant Superintendent in charge of Physical Education in Cleveland, seemed to show this same lack of relationship between the school and the out-of-school activities of children. The results of this study are shown in the following table.- [Page 272] 
CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THIS CENSUS 
1. That just at the age (under 15) when play and activity are the fundamental requirements for proper growth and development 41 per cent of the children seen were doing nothing. The boy without play is father to the man without a job. 
2. Fifty-one per cent of all the children seen were in the Streets, in the midst of all the traffic, dirt, and heat, and in an environment conducive to just the wrong kind of play.

fooling ” — not playing anything in particular. 
6. We need more and better playgrounds and a better trained leadership.* 
SYSTEMATIZING INSTRUCTION IN PLAY 
What is to be done in dealing with this situation? Three 
answers have been given. First, plays must be arranged in 
a sequence which will follow the natural order of chil- 
dren’s development, and when this play course is properly 
organized, children must be given training in play. The 
training should be of the same kind as that given in any 
line, namely, such as to stimulate self-activity and full utilization of the teacher’s suggestions. Specialists in the 
field have found it advantageous to revive folk games and to call attention to the interest which children exhibit in 
festivals and dramatic representations. In other words, the discovery of plays suitable for children is nothing but the extension into the field of recreation of the type of educational resourcefulness which has enlarged the , cur- 
ticulum in every division of the school. The enriched 
course of training in play should be used for the improve- 
ment of adults as well as children, thus making education 
for play a part of the movement of educational extension. 
SURVEY OF RECREATIONAL FACILITIES 
Second, the available resources of the community for play must be canvassed and must be intelligently utilized. In the quotation from the Cleveland survey given above it was

-P-A-G-E-286
  274 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
pointed out that there are vacant lots which are not used. 
A study of the play facilities of the community will also 
show the necessity of curbing those forms of recreation 
which are undesirable. A survey of this kind should deal 
not only with the community’s equipment for play among 
children but also with the play of adults. Such a survey 
has been made for the city of Madison, Wisconsin, and 
there is now going on in the city of Cleveland an exten- 
sive examination of all forms of recreation and amuse- 
ment together with an investigation of their effects on 
the people. 
‘A few extracts from the Madison survey will show the 
kind of findings which are turned up by such an inquiry : 
A study of the various sections of this survey shows that play 
or recreation occupies a great place in the life of the city. The 
time, effort and money put into it is enormous. Practically every 
social organization, as well as the individual and home, is involved 
in it, A very large percentage of the business section of the city 
and many outlying business places are directly or indirectly, wholly 
or partially, devoted to it, as is a large area of the whole city 
territory. Its influence is far reaching. . . - 
The study of children’s activities in connection with the map 
survey shows that there is an enormous amount of play forced into 
the streets, even in well-to-do, sections of the city, and in other cases 
into the worst of environmental conditions. There is no leadership 
or supervision of this play and there are no public playgrounds 
except Burr Jones Field and two park playgrounds and inadequate, 
unsupervised school playgrounds, where there is no attractive 
organization or play to draw the children from the streets to more 
wholesome activities and influences on the playgrounds. This is 
physically dangerous and a menace to morals. 
The study of commercial recreation shows that the large number 
of children are involved in passive amusements indoors during the 
few hours free for outdoor, health-giving activities or when they 
should be in bed. This is bad from the standpoint of health, the 
educational efforts of the school, and general social habits or ideals.
-P-A-G-E-287
PLAY 275 
The study of environmental influences and a neglect of play 
show that some of this street and unsupervised play results dis- 
astrously, even in delinquency, and supports the claim of many 
observers that most of the bad habits of children develop in play 
under bad influences. 
If the play of children is to be wholesome and generally devel- 
opmental rather than inactive or detrimental, they must have wholesome places to play in, equipment, companionship, and at least a part of the time organized play and leadership. In so far as the home cannot supply these demands most of the time —and 
the larger number of homes cannot — public interest in the welfare of the rising generation demands that the play be centered in a community playground under proper supervision. ‘The supreme need of children of Madison is playgrounds under trained directors. 
The recreational needs of the young men and women of the city requiring public attention are of three classes, all of which require places, organization and leadership. (1) They need,athletic 
and aquatic activities, athletic organization and leadership. These activities are wholesome and increase efficiency rather than decrease it. (2) The young men and women need facilities and organization 
for more wholesome social activities, such as dances. They need to be under the auspices of the best influences rather than the questionable, and it is just as easy to have the best as the ques- tionable. (3) Young men and women need opportunities for, and direction in, the more constructive use of their leisure time. They 
need places for their club meetings that have a distinct educational value as well as organization and general leadership. Individual 
use of museums and libraries also needs organization. The facilities for these activities are meager and an effective organization and leadership are totally lacking. 
The needs of adults in’ the way of activities and facilities are so complicated that it is almost impossible to summarize them, From the standpoint of public effort, the main points are provisions for the essentials in the way of facilities, organization, promotion and direction that cannot be supplied by individuals or small-group 
initiative or enterprise. This requires a public body that can study and deal with these needs. There is still a great body of adult individuals, largely of the untrained, laboring classes, without 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
276 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
recreational resources and unprovided for by any recreational 
agency except, perhaps, the saloon. These men are recreational 
outcasts; they seriously need a place where they can find clean 
opportunities for their toilet and bath and wisely organized recre- 
ation. The provision of organization is the way to a simple, con- 
structive use of leisure time by at least some of the younger of 
these men; here is a demand for a new type of men’s club, or a 
new type of organization of men who have no recreational resources. 
It is a need practically untouched by social agencies, yet one that 
must be faced frankly if these men are to gain or maintain any 
semblance of self-respect and not be a menace to democratic 
institutions." 
Pray as PART OF THE REGULAR SCHOOL PROGRAM 
Third, the work of the schools should be so adjusted that 
play will take its place with other subjects as a regular and 
essential part of the curriculum. This implies not only that 
play will be given time in the program but also that the 
same kind of expert guidance will be provided for play as 
is provided for the other activities of the day. The great 
value of a varied program is evident to all who have watched 
the process which has been going on very rapidly in recent 
years of opening up the school hours so as to include many 
different types of activity. Play needs not only to be organized 
as play and to be equipped with proper facilities, but it needs 
also to be incorporated into the regular systematic program 
of the school. This statement may be reénforced by extracts 
from the conclusions reached by the Cleveland survey. 
Some reorganization of the educational corps should take place 
with a view to efficient administration of play and recreation from 
a broad educational and social standpoint. This would lead to a 
far greater influence of the school upon the out-of-school life of 
the community. Through lack of greater influence of the school

Committee of the Madison Board of Commerce; 1915.

PLAY 297 
during out-of-school hours, there is a great social leakage for which 
the city must pay. 
The school is the natural and logical agency for the safeguarding 
of the great fundamental interests of children and youth. Each 
year discloses more and more clearly that the school is the one 
institution we have yet conceived that is best fitted adequately to conserve these interests and utilize them for educational and social 
progress. Opportunities that came as a matter of course to children 
a generation ago do not come to many children now unless they 
are specifically planned for by some agency other than the home. 
Met wisely by the community, this seeming handicap may, in the end, result in a great and new-found social strength. 
Play is more than recreation. If its educational significance is real in the kindergarten period, it is real in every subsequent stage 
of growth and development. Rightly conceived, play is a most 
efficient method of education for life, for work, for social service. 
The fact that we do not yet know how to make full use of play in education need not and should not prevent the utilization of play, to the full extent to which we are prepared, for the tremendous 
social service it can render. 
Stow Spreap or Mopern Artirupe rowarp PLay 
The suggestions just given, if acted on, would completely 
reverse the attitude of the Puritans, with whom our school 
program originated. To them play was a distraction, an 
evil to be avoided during the few serious hours which are 
to be devoted to self-improvement. This Puritan attitude 
is contrary to experience, unsupported by science, and dis- 
advantageous for the school and society. To reverse it has 
required long centuries and will require a more general 
recognition than now exists in the minds of most people 
of the possibility and importance of incorporating play as 
an integral and systematic part of the educational scheme.

278 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
Let the class undertake a survey of the recreation facilities of 
the town or a survey of the play activities in which its members 
actually engage in the course of twenty-four hours. 
‘A whole series of questions arise with regard to athletics. Is 
professional baseball a form of recreation, or is it work? Is attend- 
ance on the theater a form of play? The early students of the 
theory of play spoke of literature as play. What can be said in 
support of this view? How late in life do animals play? How 
does play relate itself to business ? 
Play when considered in connection with school work is un- 
doubtedly in some cases a distraction. Is it for this reason to 
be criticized? Under what conditions are play and study at odds 
with each other? Are there methods of adjusting the relation 
without giving up play? 
On the administrative side such questions as these arise : Should 
all the teachers take part in the teaching and supervision of games, 
or should a special teacher be employed to have full charge of 
this part of the school program? Should there be any effort on 
the part of the school to supervise play after school hours?

  CHAPTER XX 
HEALTH SUPERVISION 
Tue ReLation or HeattaH to Scuoot Work 
Ordinary school work is so dependent on health that one 
wonders how teachers of an earlier generation could have 
failed to see the absolute necessity of systematic super- 
vision of health. When we think, for example, of the con- 
sequences of absence from class exercises because of illness; 
when we think of a child’s sense organs unable to carry 
to his mind the full message brought by the sounds and 
sights of the schoolroom; when we think of the nervous 
system dull and unresponsive because of malnutrition or 
hunger,— we begin to realize that the school is concerned 
in a very vital way with the problem of supervising health. 
TREATMENT OF PATHOLOGICAL CASES 
In order to exhibit something of the scope of the pres- 
ent movement toward complete supervision of health, we 
may begin with the extreme cases. In progressive school 
systems the children who are tubercular or anzmic or 
otherwise seriously affected are taken out of the regular 
classes and put where the whole educational program can 
be subordinated to the one consideration of bringing them 
back to physical vigor. Often these classes are conducted 
in open-air rooms, and often the equipment of the rooms 
includes cots on which the pupils may rest as a part of the 
regular school exercise.

ScuooL LuncHEONS 
A second line of treatment deals with nutrition. The 
importance of one aspect of this matter is brought out in 
the following paragraphs : 
Long ago Horace Greeley, in an address before a convention of 
teachers, called attention to one of the most perplexing social and 
economic problems of the age—a problem which still confronts 
school authorities of to-day. 
“In vain,” he said, “shall we provide capable teachers, and 
comfortable school rooms, apparatus, libraries, etc., for those chil- 
dren who sit distorted by the gnawings of hunger, . . . or suffering 
from the effects of innutritious or unwholesome food.” 
Medical inspection is forcing upon public attention ¢#és appalling 
fact — that a large percentage of children in school are in no phys- 
ical condition, because of malnutrition, to profit by the present 
generous outlay of public money for school purposes. Practical 
educators, everywhere, are agreed that even the most pdtient, 
thoughtful effort to train under-nourished children is attended with 
but partial success. Out of their experience comes this plea— 
give the under-nourished child body food first, before offering him 
the wisdom of ages."   
In view of the condition in which many pupils come to 
school, it has been found important for school authorities 
or philanthropic organizations to provide luncheons. These 
have been most successful where a small price is charged 
for the food.   Controt oF HomE FEEDING 
The influence of this experiment in feeding is important 
not merely because of the positive nourishment given to the 
pupils but also because of the example which it sets in 
proper standards of eating at home. Many families do not 
1 Sarah Webb Maury and Lena L. Tachau, A Penny Lunch, p. 8. 1915.
-P-A-G-E-293
  HEALTH SUPERVISION 281 
know how to feed children. The son of a truck driver who 
breakfasts with his father on coffee, sausage, and griddle- 
cakes will spend the morning trying to digest the food 
which is appropriate to his father’s occupation but not to 
the sedentary life of the scholar. 
PusLic ATTENTION TO NUTRITION OF CHILDREN 
The importance of the whole problem of nutrition can be 
made clear by quoting from the work of a specialist. The 
paragraphs selected are the more impressive because they 
show that other nations as well as ourselves are confronted 
by these problems. 
Recently there has been an increasing tendency to make the 
report on nutrition of different children the basis of the entire 
medical-inspection report. “This is because it has been demon- 
strated again and again that the occurrence of disease and physical 
defects is largely conditioned by nutritional disturbances. 
In Paris medical inspectors have charge of the school canteens 
and are required to report on the nutrition of each child. They 
are further expected to follow up any child with impaired nutrition 
and to administer tonics and special care. 
In England, since 1907, compulsory medical inspection has 
included inspection of nutrition. Beginning with 1909, the chief 
medical officer of the National Board of Education has reported 
yearly on the nutrition of the children throughout the country and 
on the work of the school feeding centers. In Scotland the medi- 
cal inspectors are required to see that children suffering from mal- 
nutrition are fed properly either by the school or by the parents. 
As a result of this systematic work British school doctors are 
developing methods of technique and standards for judging mal- 
nutrition, which, on account of its complex and interwoven causes, 
is very difficult to estimate accurately. . . . 
In American cities no record of the nutrition of the entire school 
population has been made. In 1907 in New York the Committee 
on: Physical Welfare of School-Children reported 13 per cent of 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  282 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
990 children, selected as typical of the whole city, to be suffering 
from malnutrition. A similar investigation of 10,090 children in 
Chicago in 1908 revealed 12 per cent badly nourished in all grades, 
the proportion decreasing from 15 per cent in the kindergarten to 
6 per cent in the fifth grade and above. Wherever an attempt has 
been made to include all classes of children in the examinations, 
the percentages found suffering from acute malnutrition run from 
ro to 15. Where only schools in the poorer districts are included, 
the percentages are far higher, and vary between 20 and 40. How- 
ever, it must be remembered that children from the poorer districts 
far outnumber those in other schools, so that in point of figures 
the actual proportion of children suffering from malnutrition is 
probably nearer the second estimate. Doctor Thomas F. Wood, of 
Columbia, gives 25 per cent as the estimate for the school popula- 
tion of the whole country. 
“The longer a medical officer remains at school inspection,” 
remarks Doctor Hope, of Liverpool, in a report for 1912, “ the 
more severe becomes his standard of nutrition, and the less read- 
ily does he pass a child as being well nourished.” ? 
One reason that health conditions in rural schools have been so 
long neglected is because of the common idea that country children 
are naturally vigorous and healthy. “This ought to be so but un- 
fortunately is not,” says Doctor Ernest Hoag, in a recent govern- 
ment report. He finds that, “in general, food is not as well 
prepared in the country as it is in the city; the available variety is 
smaller.” Bad methods of ventilation and heating at home and at 
school, exposure to wet in the long walks to school, and overdress- 
ing in the house —all are inroads on the already badly nourished 
bodies. Investigations show that malnutrition and its accompany- 
ing diseases are quite as frequent among country as among city 
children.”

HEALTH SUPERVISION 283 
ContTROL oF CONTAGION 
Turning from nutrition to another aspect of the physical 
condition in schools, it is easy to show that the school must 
control contagion. The bringing together of hundreds of 
children increases so greatly the probability of spread of 
disease that the health authorities always welcome the arrival 
of the summer vacation as a relief from the most strenuous 
of their duties. 
Tue ScHoot HreattH DEPARTMENT 
The kinds of demands described have led to the develop- 
ment of health departments in many school systems. The 
various functions served by a school health department have 
been described by Dr. E. A. Peterson, a health officer in one 
of the largest cities of the country, in a report from which 
the following paragraphs are extracted : 
The problem of checking contagion is an acute problem in the 
schools. The facts show that in the early years of a child’s school 
life he has more of the diseases of childhood than at any other 
period, especially more than he had when he was at home during 
the period immediately preceding school. Furthermore, as soon as 
school breaks up for the long vacation, contagion subsides. The 
bringing together of large groups of children in schools is one 
of the most prolific methods of spreading contagion... . 
But the school health service soon developed far beyond this 
first stage of merely policing the schools. Indeed, one sees the 
real justification of a separate school health department if he fol- 
lows this health department into what may be called its second, 
third, and final stage of evolution. . . . 
Examinations by physicians within the last decade indicate that 
as many as five per cent of school children suffer from defective 
vision to such an extent that they cannot see lessons on the board 
unless they have the services of expert oculists, that one in every 
hundred cannot hear what the teacher is saying, that ten in every 
 
-P-A-G-E-296

284. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
hundred are so “stopped up” by adenoids that attention to school 
work is nearly impossible until the science of medicine gives them 
relief. 
This drew the attention of the educational world to the necessity 
of ridding children of these defects in order that they may take 
advantage of the educational opportunity offered in the schools. . . . 
One characteristic development shown at this second stage of 
school health organization is the employment of the school nurse. 
The school nurse marks the growth of the health era away from 
its first or merely policing stage. The school nurse is at once a 
medical officer and a teacher. She teaches the parents in the home 
and she teaches the children. She becomes a most important link 
between the home and the school. Her methods are those of 
persuasion, not those of the emergency police officer... . 
Once the idea of making health a matter of intelligent interest 
took root, it was sure to grow. Correction of physical defects is 
itself a tardy method of dealing with the situation. Why not pre- 
vent the defects? This kind of thinking turned attention to the 
environment of the child and the necessity of making it as conducive 
to health as possible. . . . 
Finally, it is by no means satisfactory that we should stop with 
the negative work of preventing disease and unfavorable condi- 
tions. We must be positive in our treatment of health. We want 
more health, more vigor, more efficiency. The fourth stage of 
medical inspection may properly be called the health development 
stage and has to do not only with the teaching of hygiene but 
with the development of higher ideals of wellness, with the rais- 
ing of the standard of normality, with taking a person who is well 
and making him “ wellest.” . . . 
The department must constantly assume new functions without 
dropping any of the old. If it is to be an efficient department, it 
must carry on all of the activities suggested in the summary which 
can be made up from the foregoing study.

DIFFICULTIES OF INTRODUCING HEALTH INSTRUCTION 
Health work in the schools, as it has risen to the level 
of a subject of instruction, has encountered the kind of 
obstacles met by every new school subject. Teachers are 
ignorant on medical matters, and the doctors who come into 
the schools are ignorant of methods of teaching. The result 
is that the instruction given by teachers is sometimes formal 
and unscientific, while the work of the doctors does not 
prove as effective as it might because it does not reach 
the pupils. A partial corrective for this difficulty can be 
supplied through a better system of training teachers. 
The following extracts from a paper by Dr. Allison show 
how one state is attempting to cope with this problem: 
In this tremendous but not superhuman task of teaching health, 
there seems to me no more effective method than to commit it to 
those who are and are to be the teachers. Progress in these mat- 
ters cannot be made without an intelligent understanding on the

part of the teacher. It is therefore important to teach the teacher. 
It is said that the normal school is historically the only institution 
in the country which has aimed to deal with the teaching problem. 
The Board of Regents of the normal schools of Wisconsin felt 
the need of making the normal schools of the state instruments 
of public health and in 1912 appointed a physician for this work. 
The work as organized consists of: (1) exclusion of the physi- 
cally unfit among the normal-school students; (2) detection of

1. The term “physically unfit” is very elastic, but we should 
have some physical standard. The public has not been in a posi- 
tion to protect itself against those physically unfit in the profession, 
but it is beginning to make certain demands. For example, what 
community will now tolerate a teacher who is known to be tuber- 
culous? It is well to enlighten these physically unfit, and stop the 
source of the physically undesirable, as we would the intellectually 
undesirable. 
My experience with several thousand young men and women 
during the last three years has shown me that the health habits of 
teachers need improving. .. . 
2. In the normal schools of Wisconsin a health-record «card for 
each student is on file in the department of physical training. The 
side filled out by the physical-training teacher consists of a record 
of height, weight, and lung capacity, the neck, chest, and hip 
measurements, and a detailed record of posture. The physician’s 
report includes a record of the past medical history, personal 
history, sex history, family history, and the present condition of 
nutrition, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, teeth, glands, lungs, heart, 
and elimination. Each student is advised in accordance with the 
conditions which are found. . . .

CHAPTER XXI 
SCIENTIFIC SUPERVISION 
EvoLuTIoN OF THE DEMAND FOR SUPERVISION 
In the days when the school system was simple in its 
equipment and in its course of study no distinction was 
drawn between the problems of teaching and the problems 
of organizing the school. The teacher did everything that 
was done in the school. The teacher made the program, 
promoted the pupils, consulted with the town officials and 
parents, conducted the classes, and in not a few cases 
swept the floor and built the fire. There was, to use a 
phrase of the business world, no overhead management. 
The course of study has grown complex. The work of 
the classroom is absorbing, and yet its success depends on 
equipment and organization that need to be studied and 
intelligently arranged. The work of one school must be 
correlated with the work of the schools in neighboring com- 
munities. The public must have authoritative information 
about the fiscal needs of the school and about the outcome 
of the public investments in education, The demand has 
arisen for a new type of school officer—the supervisor. 
This officer is not a teacher but a manager. His duty is 
one of organization and central adjustment. 
THE PRINCIPAL 
The new demand here referred to can be described by 
means of an example which exhibits one of the greatest 
weaknesses of our present school system, Schools of all 
289 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
    290 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
grades which have grown large enough to employ three 
or more teachers commonly have an officer who is known 
as the principal. 
In the small school the principal spends most of his or 
her time in teaching. In larger schools the principal does 
no -classroom work. In both cases the principal is univer- 
sally selected for a special position in the school because 
of his or her success in teaching. The work of the princi- 
pal is thought of as that of a head teacher. The fact is, 
however, entirely at variance with this idea; the work of 
the principal is not that of teaching. Principals ought to be 
managers and central organizers. They ought to know the 
system as a whole and ought to devote time and thought 
to problems of a managerial type. The weakness of our 
present school system is that most principals are in no 
sense equipped for this central managing task. They do 
not know how to use profitably the release from class- 
room work which attaches to their office and title. The 
result is that they drift, often with the full cognizance of 
the board of education, into the habit of spending time on 
trifling clerical tasks which are wholly unworthy of the special position which they are supposed to occupy in the 
system. It is a deficiency of our educational system that 
while there are institutions for the training of teachers there 
are only a few general courses for administrative officers. 
There certainly can be no objection to experience as a teacher in the classroom as preliminary training for the 
person who is to occupy a school principalship. But the 
moment the experienced teacher leaves the ranks and takes 
up the office of principal, a wholly new set of central prob- 
lems should come within his view. He should recognize 
the fact that from this time on his task is one of a broader 
type, and the successful execution of that task will require 
a kind of study which is demanded at most in very minor 
degree of the teacher.     
-P-A-G-E-303
SCIENTIFIC SUPERVISION 291 
OrHER. SUPERVISORY OFFICERS 
What has been said of the principal is true also of 
assistant superintendents and of the superintendent of the 
school system. It is true also of departmental supervisors 
who have general oversight of certain subdivisions of the 
work. All these officers ought to become expert in a type 
of study and a type of management which are not expected 
of the individual teacher. 
Lack or Pusiic APPRECIATION OF CENTRAL PROBLEMS 
In general, it is evident from a study of American school 
systems that emphasis has not been laid on central organ- 
ization. Cities have employed a superintendent when they 
had a population of five thousand inhabitants and have ex- 
pected a single officer to continue to perform all the duties 
of that office when the population has increased to one hun- 
dred thousand. A principal is put in charge of a high school 
of two hundred students and continues to have full respon- 
sibility for the school when it increases to eight hundred 
students. Boards of education have refused to give super- 
visory officers clerical assistance, and have thus required a 
principal or superintendent receiving the highest salary of 
any person in the system to do work which a clerk could do 
more economically and quite as efficiently, thus interfering 
with the performance of important central duties for which 
no time is left. 
MANAGERIAL TRAINING IN RELATION TO DEMOCRACY 
The training of a large number of persons who will be 
competent to take up managerial functions is especially 
important in the school system of a democracy because the 
problems of each community are in some measure local 
problems to be solved at the point where they arise. In a 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
school system which treats every child and every commu- 
nity exactly alike administration is simplified through uni- 
formity. In a school system which is as complex as ours 
there must be an intelligent adaptation of organization to 
particular ends, and every device which will promote such 
adaptation is economical. 
Tue PurPosE OF THE PRESENT Discussion 
The general discussion of supervision will be clearer if 
we take up for brief description some of the problems which 
should be dealt with by central officers and some of the 
methods of solving these problems. It will not be the pur- 
pose of this discussion to attempt anything like a complete 
enumeration of such problems or methods, but merely to 
suggest their type. 
STUDIES OF THE COMMUNITY 
First, there must be a study of the community. To some 
extent the individual teacher must take a share in this study. 
The character of each pupil and the facts about his home 
surroundings are important to the teacher in carrying on 
class work, But there must be some agency which can 
devote time and attention to a systematic collection of facts. 
The teacher has a right to expect that the school system 
as a system will make information readily available which it 
would be difficult for an individual to collect. The central 
officers should make such a study. 
The making of a school census is a duty of the central 
officers who have in hand the enforcement of the com- 
pulsory-attendance laws. When these officers recognize 
_ their task as a large educational task, they will make the 
census not merely a formal basis for compelling attend- 
ance but a means of collecting a body of facts on which 
educational adaptations can be based.
-P-A-G-E-305
SCIENTIFIC SUPERVISION 203 
It has been pointed out in earlier chapters that the com- 
munity should be studied with a view to discovering the 
needs of pupils. Up to this time such studies have been 
made as special undertakings in a few isolated communi- 
ties. For example, the industries of Richmond, Virginia, of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and of the state of Indiana have 
been studied by special commissions and reported at three 
annual meetings of the National Society for the Promotion 
of Industrial Education. What is needed is a constant study 
of these problems in every community. Again, teachers 
cannot meet the demand. This problem is a central prob- 
lem, and the central management must be equipped to get 
information which the teachers need but cannot collect. 
SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF TEACHERS 
A second group of central problems have to do with the 
selection of teachers and their continued training while in 
service. It used to be very generally assumed, and in some 
quarters it seems to be assumed to-day, that in the teaching 
profession there is no need of training beyond the initial 
normal course or the initial college course that brought the 
candidate through the first requirements. A kind of per- 
sistence in professional efficiency on the part of teachers is 
assumed. 
The day of such easy-going neglect of professional re- 
quirements is over. Score cards of teachers’ qualifications 
are being worked out. The relative importance of such 
personal qualifications as a pleasant voice and manner as 
compared with such products of training as knowledge of 
the correct forms of English expression and knowledge of 
geography or Latin must be determined with direct refer- 
ence to the particular duties which are required of the 
teacher. The development of methods of correcting defi- 
ciencies in the equipment of a teaching corps, the proper - 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
    294 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
distribution of the time and energy of a group of teachers, 
and the proper method of keeping the records of the work 
of teachers are all central problems. As the teacher stands 
in a central relation to his or her class, so the supervisor 
stands in a central relation to a corps of teachers. 
Of all the problems touching teachers, that of their 
training in service is perhaps the most important. There 
is a great deal of very blind and ineffective effort expended 
each year in futile attempts to meet this problem. A great 
deal of required reading is done by teachers, and a great 
many meetings are attended which could be turned to better 
account if there were well-organized systems of training in 
service and of parallel promotional requirements. 
STANDARDIZATION BY MEASUREMENT OF RESULTS 
A third group of problems are those which have been 
referred to in the chapter on standardization. The results 
of classroom work must be evaluated and comparisons 
must be made on a large scale to guide the future work 
of the pupils. In some measure this is a problem for 
teachers. But so far as the individual class teacher is 
concerned, there will have to be dependence on central 
agencies for the collection of material which can be used 
in comparisons, 
At the present time a large share of the standardizing 
material is being collected by private agencies. Men and 
women who are interested in the promotion of educational 
science are making individual studies and are bringing 
together bodies of comparative material. This is entirely 
legitimate so long as the movement of standardization and 
quantitative treatment of results is in what may be described 
as an experimental stage. As soon as the utility of meas- 
urements has been proved, it becomes a public obligation to 
’ provide agencies for this work.  
-P-A-G-E-307
SCIENTIFIC SUPERVISION 2905 
The growth of the movement toward the addition in all 
large school systems of one or more officers whose duty it 
shall be to measure results has been commented on in 
earlier connections. There is a national organization of 
school-efficiency officers with a membership including rep- 
resentatives of some twenty of the leading systems of the 
country. This shows in a concrete way that the demand for 
central officers of standardization is beginning to be met. 
An Example oF PusLic RECOGNITION OF THE NEED 
oF EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENTS 
A single example of a personal type may serve further to 
impress on the reader the character of this movement. 
Mr. S. A. Courtis, who is widely known as the author of a 
system of arithmetic tests, began his work in testing as a 
teacher in a private school for girls, the Liggett School of 
Detroit. He devised tests to find out how well his pupils 
were doing their work. He found at once that he needed 
comparative material because he saw that the success of his 
classes was in a measure a comparative matter. He pub- 
lished his first findings, and secured the codperation of 
other interested teachers and school officers. ‘Soon he 
became a center for arithmetic tests. He was compelled to 
give up more and more of his time and energy to.a task 
which was broader in its scope than the task of teaching 
his classes. The school was intelligent enough to recognize 
this general service to all schools and gave him time and 
assistance in organizing his tests. The individual work of 
a scientific student thus began to develop. He was called 
to all parts of the country to discuss his methods and results, 
and centers of interest were established where his tests 
were used, 
Ultimately Mr. Courtis was called to assist in the survey 
of New York City and in the surveys of other systems, 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
notably Gary, Indiana. He was also asked to organize for the 
city of Detroit a department of investigation as a permanent 
division of the administration of the city schools. 
Screntiric STUDIES AND CENTRAL SUPERVISION 
Example after example could be given of the organization 
of public supervision on the basis of private scientific inves- 
tigation. These examples are important not only as exhibi- 
tions of the demand for more central supervision but also 
as demonstrations of the demand that all the larger prob- 
lems of the school system be approached in the scientific 
spirit. The school system of this country, like all public in- 
stitutions, has passed through the period of first organization. 
This was a period of urgent practical demands. Work had 
to be done by any means that came to hand. The situation 
was like all pioneer situations. In many cases teachers who 
were meagerly trained had to administer unorganized courses 
of study, and the public had to be satisfied with results 
which were, to say the least, uncertain. The pioneering period 
is not altogether passed yet, but there is wealth enough in 
most communities to support a more deliberate type of organi- 
zation. There is a perfection of the instruments of education, 
an organization of the agencies of education, and a standardi- 
zation of results which were impossible in earlier days. 
The business of the central officers in a school system 
can be defined in terms of this discussion as the collection 
and distribution of scientific information and the administra- 
tion of the system in keeping with the scientific information 
thus collected. Such a formula can be carried over to prob- 
lems other than those enumerated thus far in this chapter. 
The problems of promotion and of the course of study, 
even the problems of class management and instruction, 
have large supervisory aspects with which the central school 
officers must deal.
-P-A-G-E-309
       SCIENTIFIC SUPERVISION 
ScIENTIFIC SUPERVISION 
Such a statement gives a view of the principalship or 
superintendency of schools which is wholly different from 
that which is expressed by applying to these offices the 
title “head teacher.” In England the chief officer in a 
school building is the head teacher or the head master. 
These names imply merely an extension of the teaching 
function and fail to recognize the necessity of a scientific 
study and administration of the schools. 
The view advocated in this chapter is also at variance 
with the conception expressed in the titles of the chief 
school officers of German schools. There the head of 
a school is a rector or director, His personal authority 
is large. He continues in many cases to teach; his ad- 
ministrative influence as implied in his title arises from the 
fact that he represents the state. His task is that of dictating 
school policies, not that of organizing the school on the 
basis of a complete scientific study of the educational 
situation in the community in which he works. 
It cannot be asserted that the American principals of 
schools are everywhere devoted and competent students of the 
science of education. There is, however, a freer opportunity 
in our schools than in those of any other nation for a com- 
plete realization of the scientific ideal. There is comparative 
freedom of organization, and there is comparative adequacy 
of equipment. There is at hand a body of broadly collected 
information. With this background there is every prospect 
of a more intelligent use of all the opportunities which are 
gradually being evolved for intelligent scientific supervision. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
The study of community needs has been carried on most vig- 
orously in trying to answer the question, What industrial training 
do pupils in cities need? The National Society for the Promotion 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  298 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
of Industrial Education has organized three extensive surveys, 
one in Richmond, Virginia, one in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and 
one in the state of Indiana. One of the best exercises which can 
be suggested is for the class to study the needs of a community 
after the model of one of these surveys. 
A second exercise that may be suggested is that of examining 
the operations of a school building in detail. How does a building 
get its supplies? How many janitors are there? Who supervises 
the janitors? How much time does a principal spend in visiting 
rooms? What reports does a principal have to render? What 
reports do the teachers render to the principal ? 
The volumes of the Cleveland survey, including those which 
deal with industrial education, are models of exposition of com- 
munity needs. (Copies may be secured from the Russell Sage 
Foundation, New York City.) 
There is a body of sociological material with which students of 
this chapter ought to become acquainted. See the Survey (New 
York City), a journal devoted to the discussion of sociological 
problems.

  CHAPTER XXII 
THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 
Screntiric METHops oF STUDYING SCHOOLS 
Each of the preceding chapters has aimed to set forth 
certain practical school problems and to suggest the sources 
of information on the basis of which these problems are 
to be solved. Some of the information to which reference 
has been made is confessedly incomplete ; some of it is in a 
form which renders very difficult exact and final inferences 
as to its meaning. Taken in the aggregate, however, the 
body of information at hand regarding schools is so great 
that we are justified in speaking of a science of education. 
Furthermore, the use of the term “science” would be jus- 
tified even if we were in possession of fewer solutions of 
school problems than we now have, for the essence of sci- 
ence is its method of investigation, not its ability to lay 
down a body of final rules of action. 
A complete transformation of the method of approaching 
school problems has come about in recent years. The time 
was when opinion, especially if it was backed’ by even a 
little practical experience, was urged as sufficient reason for 
all kinds of school practices. To-day it is only the rashly 
ignorant who talk about education or aim to influence actual 
school operations without informing themselves through a 
study of known and recorded facts. A host of practical 
school officers and special students of school problems 
have carried out laborious investigations and have created 
a technical literature which promises to reach every phase 
of school work, 
299
-P-A-G-E-312
  300 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
DEFINITION THROUGH ENUMERATION oF METHODS 
It is not too early, therefore, to define the scope and 
methods of the science of education. Such a definition 
need in no wise limit the further development of the sci- 
ence, while it may serve to stimulate more exact formulation 
of its problems and methods. Our effort to frame such a 
definition naturally leads us to review the courses which 
have commonly been given to teachers-in-training. 
Tue History. or EpucaTioNnAL THEORY AND PRACTICE 
The historical method of studying education was the 
first which was cultivated in institutions which undertook 
the training of teachers. The history of education divides 
readily into two branches: one deals with the history of 
educational theories, the other with the history of actual 
school practices. The history of theories is the easier of 
the two branches to cultivate because it consists chiefly 
in a review of the writings left behind by writers who 
discuss educational problems. Thus the earlier histories of 
education laid great emphasis on the writings of Plato and 
Quintilian, of Comenius and Locke, of Rousseau and 
Pestalozzi. Reviews of earlier writers were, however, of 
little real influence in molding modern practice, and the 
history of theories had only a very indirect influence on 
teachers. 
More significant by far is the recent movement which 
studies practices in schools, especially the schools of one’s 
own country. The development of arithmetic or grammar 
in American schools is illuminating as showing both the 
direction in which we are moving and the kinds of forces 
which operate in reformulating’ the course of study. Earlier 
chapters have aimed to suggest the value of such studies, 
especially Chapters II and III.

    THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 301 
CourRsES IN PsycHOLoGy 
Along with the study of the history of education there has 
commonly been prescribed in training schools for teachers 
a course in psychology. Herbart pointed out more than a 
hundred years ago the importance of the study of mental 
processes as a basis for the proper direction of educational 
practices. The science of psychology has also by its own 
developments encouraged the practical educator to expect 
help in the solution of school problems. There was a period 
when so-called child psychology flourished in this country and 
aimed to contribute to the development of school methods 
as well as to the solution of problems of the curriculum and 
school management. 
EpucaTIoNAL PsyCHOLOGY 
A friendly alliance will always exist between the science 
of psychology and the science of education. Psychology has 
given to education certain methods and such special results 
as it has worked out with regard to memory and learning 
and the nature of behavior; education has taken the psy- 
chological material and developed a special branch of science 
under the name “educational psychology.” 
There are two fruitful psychological methods which have 
been borrowed in this way and put to work for education. 
These are the statistical method and the experimental method. 
STATISTICAL STUDIES 
An impressive example of the statistical method is given 
in the studies of individual differences. For example, Thorn- 
dike has made a careful study of the degrees of likeness 
between twins, and between brothers and sisters who are not 
twins, for the purpose of defining more fully the meaning 
ue of the term “individual differences.”
-P-A-G-E-314
  302 THE SCIENTIRIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
THe EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
The experimental method has been employed in many 
ways. Thus, Freeman has recorded with the aid of suitable 
apparatus the rate at which one writes long and short letters. 
This study he has made with individuals of various ages 
and degrees of training and under different conditions. One 
result which he derived from these records is the fact that 
a given writer’s rhythm of movement is the same in letters 
of different sizes and becomes more regular and more fixed 
with increase in skill. 
ExTENsION OF USE oF PsycHoLocicaL METHODS 
In taking over the methods of psychology and applying 
them to the solution of educational problems, a secondary 
advantage of the greatest importance has come to the science 
of education. These methods are capable of adaptation to 
a much broader range of problems than psychology would 
have attempted to solve. Both the statistical method and 
the experimental method have accordingly been carried 
over in the science of education to the widest possible range 
of applications. 
StupIES oF RETARDATION 
One of the first and most fruitful statistical studies made 
in education dealt with the retardation of pupils. Those 
who fell behind their grade were counted, and the problem 
which they presented was stated emphatically enough to 
bring about the organization of all kinds of special devices 
for the training of retarded individuals and groups. 
ScHooL ExpERIMENTS AND LaporaTory STUDIES 
The experimental method was carried over and applied 
to whole classes. For example, two parallel classes were 
measured with reference to the effects of supervised study.
-P-A-G-E-315
  
  THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 303 
The experimental method has also been productively 
applied in detailed, analytical studies of particular subjects. 
Thus, to recall an example presented in an earlier chapter, 
reading has been investigated in the cases of slow and 
fast readers when they were reading orally and silently, 
when they were trained by the ordinary methods of the 
school, and when they were trained by special methods 
adapted to their individual cases. Like studies have been 
made of the movements performed in writing and of the 
stages passed through in various learning processes. 
EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT EARLIER CHAPTERS 
Further examples will, however, be unnecessary for the 
reader who has had the patience to go through the earlier 
chapters of this volume. There are numerous illustrations 
in those chapters of statistical and experimental investiga- 
tions of educational problems. These investigations show 
the extent to which the new science has borrowed from 
the old and the extent to which a new structure has been 
erected which has a right to claim an independent name 
and rank among the social sciences. 
Srupirs oF ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS 
The recognition of the science of education as a separate 
discipline can be urged on the ground that the scientific 
methods which were first applied to the problems of mental 
development have opened up every aspect of school organi- 
zation to scientific study. Thus, in the field of administra- 
tion more than in any other field the value of - scientific 
studies has been recognized. The promotion of pupils, the 
grading system, the construction of buildings, and the or- 
ganization of financial systems are all spheres in which 
exact scientific methods have in recent years worked most 
important transformations in practice.
-P-A-G-E-316
  304 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Metuop or CoMPARISON 
In many investigations the method of comparison has 
been brought to a degree of perfection which justifies ref- 
erence to it as a special method of scientific research. All 
the previous discussions of standardization show how a 
single school system profits by the effort to evaluate its 
own practices in the light of the experiences and results of 
other school systems. 
Recorps Necessary To Screntiric Srupy 
The scientific methods which have been referred to imply 
as their necessary basis a series of detailed and accurate 
records, Some of these records, as, for example, those 
which show school attendance and those which deal with 
expenditures, are kept in ordinary routine. Some have to 
be made especially for the purposes of scientific studies. 
Here belong all those records which are made through tests. 
Tests are merely devices for showing clearly and explicitly 
how far educational practices have succeeded in special cases. 
SUBDIVISIONS OF THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 
The subdivisions into which the science of education nat- 
urally breaks up are dictated in part by the needs of differ- 
ent individuals within the school system and in part by the 
methods which are employed. Thus the supervisor needs 
a different type of training from that which is required by 
the classroom teacher. Again, the functions of the differ- 
ent supervisors are so different that some require full infor- 
mation on problems of school finance, while others are in 
more direct contact with the problems of promotion and of 
the curriculum. A second line of cleavage is that which 
is described most fully in this chapter and results from the 
use of different methods of investigation. Thus, laboratory 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 305 
studies of reading and writing naturally separate themselves 
from statistical studies of administrative problems. 
Another line of division is that dictated by school organi- 
zation. High-school problems are likely to be considered 
in special courses, elementary-school problems in others. 
There is no need in a general introduction of the type 
here offered of attempting to consider these subdivisions. 
Our purposes are adequately served if we can show what 
the science as a whole is by referring to typical examples 
of scientific work undertaken in several of the subdivisions. 
Rapip ExPANSION OF THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 
Furthermore, it is to be understood explicitly that the 
science of education is in process of rapid expansion. Any 
effort to describe its methods and content in full would of 
necessity fail. The rapid enlargement of the science and 
its methods in recent years is the most impressive fact 
which can be recorded in a chapter describing the scope 
and purpose of such a study. A simple definition within 
which there is wide room for expansion is therefore the 
only definition which is appropriate at the end of this 
introduction. 
DEFINITION OF THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 
The science of education aims to collect by all available 
methods full information with regard to the origin, devel- 
opment, and present form of school practices and also full 
information with regard to social needs. It aims to subject 
present practices to rigid tests and comparisons and to 
analyze all procedure in the schools by experimental methods 
and by observation. It aims to secure complete and definite 
records of all that the school attempts and accomplishes. 
The results of school work are to be evaluated by rigid 
methods of comparison and analysis. To direct studies of 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
      306 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
the school the science of education must add full studies of 
the social life of which the school is a part and of the indi- 
vidual nature which is to be trained and molded through 
the educational processes. In the light of such studies the 
science of education is to suggest such enlargements and 
modifications of school practices as seem likely to promote 
the evolution of the educational system. 
This program is so comprehensive in its scope that it 
becomes evident at once that the science of education is 
a composite science requiring the codperation of many in- 
vestigators. In its formulations it may deal in a broad way 
with general problems, or it may break up into numerous 
subdivisions appealing to the specialist. 
It would therefore be more accurate to describe it as a 
group of specialized studies rather than as a single discipline. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
This chapter furnishes an opportunity to study the contributions 
of other sciences to the study of educational problems. What does 
biology contribute? In this connection Spencer’s first essay is 
perhaps one of the clearest examples of application of biology to 
education. Stanley Hall has carried to an extreme the use of bio- 
logical hypotheses (‘‘ Adolescence,” D. Appleton and Company): 
Fiske in his essay on the ‘t Meaning of Infancy” (Houghton Mifflin 
Company) furnishes another example. The student should raise 
pointedly the question whether biological principles apply without 
modification to human education. 
The discussions of biology pass directly into the consideration 
of psychology. James’s “Talks to Teachers on Psychology” 
(Henry Holt and Company) is a very good beginning of read- 
ings in this line. One of the most recent and productive books 
is Freeman’s “The Psychology of the Common Branches” (Hough- 
ton Mifflin Company). There are many general psychologies. 
The student will be led by a study of some of these books to the 
problem of distinguishing between general psychology and educa- 
tional psychology.     
-P-A-G-E-319
  THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION 307 
Another type of related science is to be found in the mathe- 
matical sciences which contribute to educational studies. Thorndike’s 
* An Introduction to the Theory of Mental and Social Measure- 
ments ” (Science Press) was the first systematic effort to put statis- 
tical methods into form for educators. A much more satisfactory 
treatment of statistical methods is to be found in H. O. Rugg’s 
“ Statistical Methods applied to Education” (Houghton Mifflin 
Company). Numerous examples have been cited in earlier chapters 
of applications of statistics to education. To that list might be 
added Ayres’s “ Laggards in our Schools” (Russell Sage Founda- 
tion, New York City) and the statistical volumes of the reports of 
the Commissioner of Education, which both in the facts presented 
and in the summaries represent the most elaborate collection of 
educational statistics in any report on schools anywhere in the 
world. 
By way of an independent exercise under this chapter let the 
student describe a particular scientific study which it would be 
appropriate to require each of the following school officers to 
carry out: a superintendent, a supervisor of drawing, a principal 
of a high school, a principal of an elementary school, a high-school 
teacher of Latin, a teacher in charge of a third grade.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS 
IncrEASING DEMAND FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING 
It has been the aim of the preceding chapters of this 
volume to make it clear that the teacher of the future must 
be able to cope in a large and intelligent way with problems 
which are not discussed in courses dealing with the subject- 
matter ordinarily taught in schools. The compensations 
offered to the trained teacher are fortunately more adequate 
than formerly, and increasingly justify the demand that the 
teacher bring to his or her task a more complete professional 
training. 
AMERICAN NorMAL SCHOOLS 
The proper content of a professional training is a matter 
on which there is no general agreement in the United States. 
For a little more than seventy-five years there have existed 
in this country normal schools for the training of elementary- 
school teachers. These institutions have in some cases 
required graduation from high school as a prerequisite for 
admission, but more commonly not. Their courses of study 
have in some schools consisted chiefly of reviews of 
elementary-school subjects supplemented by a modicum 
of methodology or discussion of how to teach the subjects. 
In other cases the courses of the normal school have been 
general, of the type commonly offered in colleges or high 
schools. Sometimes the normal school has given its students 
large opportunity to teach children in so-called practice 
308
-P-A-G-E-321
    PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS 309 
schools or model schools. Sometimes, on the other hand, 
the students in normal schools have had no direct contact 
with classroom management, but have gone out into the 
schools equipped only with the theory of teaching. 
The situation with regard to these institutions is set forth 
in the following paragraphs from a bulletin of the United 
States Bureau of Education : : 
Normal schools differ from each other very widely in organiza- 
tion, in admission requirements, in courses of study, and in modes 
of instruction. The explanation of this lack of uniformity is to be 
found in the fact that normal schools have never been a part of 
the system of higher education evolved in this country. Normal 
schools have grown up in isolation. While the colleges have been 
in the closest touch with each other through the organization of 
entrance examination boards and accrediting institutions, while 
high schools have been brought together by standard definitions of 
units, normal schools have stood apart. The typical normal school 
derives its financial support from legislative appropriations, re- 
ceives its students without competition from a territory over which 
it exercises exclusive control, and has no difficulty in placing its 
graduates in positions which they regard as satisfactory. Further- 
more, so urgent has been the demand in the country for teachers 
that school boards and superintendents have not been able to 
make rigid selections, with the result that standards of training 
have not been forced upon the normal schools from without. 
In a situation where relative isolation has not compelled normal 
schools to define themselves to others there has been the largest 
opportunity for the play of personal influences. A strong president 
has often dominated the policies of a normal school to a degree 
that is almost unbelievable. The faculty sometimes has little or no 
voice in determining the courses or the modes of admission. 
There is no State authority in most of the States which is strong 
enough to determine what shall be done in normal schools. ‘The 
result is that within a single State there are the widest variations. 
One president with the ambition to develop his institution into a 
degree-granting university goes on his way, while his neighbor 
uses the funds granted by the same legislature to develop a
-P-A-G-E-322
  310 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
normal school which loudly announces its objection to granting 
degrees and limits its activities rigidly to the training of ele- 
mentary teachers. 
In recent years a number of causes have begun to break down 
the isolation of the normal school. First and foremost is the desire 
of normal graduates to enjoy the advantages of higher education 
in universities and colleges. The growth of summer schools at 
universities and the frequent transfer of normal-school graduates 
to college and graduate courses show with clearness the desire of 
teachers to enjoy the advantages of all kinds of higher education. 
Normal schools, drawn into the current of higher education, have 
been calied upon to announce more definitely their requirements 
for admission and to describe the content of their courses. What 
is a course in methods of teaching arithmetic? Is it a review of 
the course given in an elementary school or is it a discussion 
of the pedagogical principles on. which such courses are arranged ? 
What is a course in practice teaching? Does such a Course require 
of the student any study of material, and does it afford him any 
adequate critical discussion of his work? There has been a sharp 
and at times unfriendly clash between normal schools and colleges 
in the effort to secure answers to such questions. The normal 
school often takes the position that it administers only high-grade 
courses, while the colleges express a frank doubt as to the value 
of these courses for mature students. 
Perhaps the disagreement between normal schools and colleges 
can best be illustrated by the widespread dispute regarding foreign 
languages. The normal school has been historically related to the 
vernacular school, and its officers have had little patience with clas- 
sical or even literary courses. The traditions of the college are of 
a totally different type. So long as no students passed from normal 
schools to colleges the normal schools were at liberty to hold to 
the vernacular, but as soon as normal-school graduates sought 
admission to higher institutions the controversy was on. 
A second reason why normal schools have been called upon to 
define themselves arises because colleges and universities have in 
recent years entered the field of teacher training through the organ- 
ization of departments of education and colleges of education, In 
the State universities the demand for preparation of high-school  
-P-A-G-E-323
  
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS 311 
teachers has been heard, and generous provisions have in many 
cases been made for the work of preparing such teachers. The 
normal schools have looked upon this organization of teacher- 
training courses as undesired competition. Conversely, the uni- 
versity authorities have been critical of the courses in the normal 
schools, and the issue has been sharply drawn. Incidentally it may 
be remarked that college departments of education have usually 
been subjected to the closest scrutiny and sometimes to violent 
criticism by other college departments because of their supposed 
inferiority. It may even be admitted that entrance requirements 
in the departments of education have sometimes been lower than 
those for other college departments in the hope of meeting the com- 
petition of normal schools, and courses of inferior standard in the 
college have been tolerated for like reason. All of these disputes 
and efforts at adjustment have aroused a general inquiry about 
teacher-training courses which a generation ago would have been 
without interest except to a small group of specialists. Now the 
problem is known to all who are interested in education, and the 
discussion must go on until some satisfactory conclusion is reached." 
AMERICAN DEMANDS ON SECONDARY-SCHOOL TEACHERS 
If the situation with regard to the training of elementary- 
school teachers is chaotic, the situation with regard to 
secondary-school teachers is more so. Until very recently 
there was little or no effort in the state laws defining re- 
quirements for teachers’ certificates to distinguish between 
elementary teachers and teachers in high schools. The 
candidate for a position in Latin found himself taking the 
same examination that would have been required if he had 
been about to teach a third grade. Of course in practice 
the school officers who employed the Latin teacher took 
steps to assure themselves that he had studied that subject, 
but practice in this respect has never been standardized.

312 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
GerMAN TRAINING OF SECONDARY-SCHOOL ‘TEACHERS 
By way of setting up a contrast we may review the sys- 
tem which prevailed in Germany before 1914. The German 
system was the most highly developed system of training 
secondary-school teachers in the world. 
Candidates for positions in the secondary schools must first of 
all have completed the course of one of the secondary schools. In 
the second place, the candidate must have attended a German 
university for at least six semesters. Here an exception is made 
in the case of those candidates who expect to teach in the sciences. 
They may take half of the university courses in one of the technical 
institutions rather than in university lectures. 
After this preliminary training is completed, the candidate pre- 
sents himself for an examination. Usually the period of training 
is much longer than the minimum above described. Indeed, in 
most cases candidates take the university doctor’s degree before 
they come up for the examination. The examination consists of 
two parts. First, there is a general ‘examination covering those 
subjects which are supposed to be essential as training for all 
departments ; and, second, there is a special examination given in 
the particular subject in which the candidate is preparing to teach. 
Both examinations include written and oral divisions. . . . 
The examinations are formidable ordeals. They are conducted 
by special commissioners. On these commissions are university 
professors, officers of the education department, and representatives 
of the secondary schools. ‘The candidate is first required to present 
two elaborate theses, one on some phase of the general subjects 
and one in the subject in which he has elected to take a complete 
examination. At the discretion of the commission the candidate’s 
doctor’s dissertation may. be substituted for one of these theses. 
A period of 16 weeks is allowed for their preparation, and they are 
intended to show the ability of the candidate to carry on independ- 
ent research in his selected field, and his ability to formulate mate- 
rial in a clear and systematic fashion, After the presentation of 
these theses there follows a written examination, followed in turn 
by an oral examination.
-P-A-G-E-325
  PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS 313 
After the examination the successful candidate now has before 
him two years of contact with the schoolroom before he can become 
a teacher with a regular position. The first of these trial years is 
known as the Seminar year and the second as the Trial year. 
During both of these periods the candidate is connected with one 
of the secondary schools and is under the general direction of the 
principal or director of this school. . . . 
After a candidate has been assigned to a particular school, it 
becomes his duty, first of all, to participate in the activities of that 
school in any way that he can. He is usually assigned to some 
teacher, whose reports he helps to prepare and whose classes he 
has to visit with regularity. In addition, he is expected to visit all of 
the classes in the institution, so as to observe different methods of 
instruction and class management. It is required that the candi- 
date meet with the director two hours a week for special training. At 
this point in particular the greatest diversity of practice appears. ae 
Sometimes the meeting is conducted as a demonstration lesson ; 
sometimes it is a discussion; sometimes it is a series of reports 
by candidates ; sometimes a lecture by the director or one of the 
teachers of the school. 
After the candidates nave gone through a part of the first year’s 
training and have become somewhat familiar with the methods of 
instruction in the classes which they visit and through the advice 
which they receive in the weekly meetings, they are allowed to 
give instruction. At first this instruction is limited to single class 
exercises under the immediate supervision of the regular teacher. 
The candidate is expected to prepare fully for such an exercise, so 
that he may carry on the work of the students in accordance with 
the general plan adopted by the regular teacher. The regular 
teacher remains in the class during the instruction given by the 
candidate, and after the class has been dismissed the teacher gives 
the candidate the benefit of such criticism as he has to make. 
Opportunity for these criticisms is presented by the school program, 
which is uniformly so arranged that 45 minutes of class work are 
followed by 15 minutes of recess, The criticisms are in some cases 
very helpful, especially where the teacher is interested in developing 
better methods of instruction upon the part of the candidate. On 
the other hand, the criticisms are often very severe and sometimes 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  \ 
314. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
even caustic. In any case, the candidate learns through the com- 
ments given him by the teacher how far he has failed to conform 
to the expectation of the school. . . . 
Several weeks before the close of the seminar year each candi- 
date is called upon to prepare a thesis on some concrete pedagogical 
or didactic problem set for him by the director. This thesis consti- 
tutes part of his preparation for the teaching profession and may 
be the outcome of his readings or the outcome of his observation. 
Not uncommonly the candidate makes an elaborate study of 
some of the pedagogical literature related to his subject. It is to 
be remembered that many of these candidates have already com- 
pleted the work for the degree of doctor of philosophy in, the uni- 
versity and are for that reason trained in the methods of research 
and in the preparation of theses, while all have prepared elaborate 
theses in connection with the examinations which admitted them 
to the seminar year. 7 
At the end of the seminar year the director, with the codpera- 
tion of the other teachers who have observed the work of the 
candidate, makes a report to the school authorities, and if the work 
of the candidate has been satisfactory he is now advanced to a 
higher grade and enters upon the trial year. 
During the trial year he is required to teach six to eight hours 
a week without compensation. .If he is especially fortunate, he 
may receive some compensation for substitute teaching which is 
needed by the school. In the main, however, he is called upon to 
carry a heavy burden of work without any compensation from the 
school. The director may also use his services for other purposes, 
such as the preparation of reports, the checking of lists, and other 
duties which need to be attended to for the purpose of administer- 
ing the school. During this trial year the regular teacher is not 
required to attend the classes conducted by candidates. The can- 
didate, therefore, gradually acquires independence in his conduct 
of the classes. 
At the end of this trial year another report is made of the activi- 
ties of the candidate and the judgment of the teachers in the 
school with respect to his success. If this report is favorable the 
candidate is now put on the eligible list and may be appointed to 
a permanent position, The length of time which it is necessary for  
-P-A-G-E-327
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS 315 
him to wait for this permanent appointment is determined wholly 
by the needs of the schools. If there are no vacancies, the candi- 
date may wait a relatively long period of time, in some cases as 
long as four or five years. On the other hand, for some years past 
it has been possible in most cities for candidates to receive appoint- 
ment almost immediately on completion of the trial year.* 
New Courses IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
FOR SECONDARY-SCHOOL TEACHERS 
The example of Germany is instructive as showing some- 
thing of the amount of professional training which may be 
deemed necessary properly to qualify a teacher of secondary 
schools. It is not at all likely that the particular method 
adopted will be followed in the United States. Indeed, 
there is a rapidly developing movement in American col- 
leges and universities to provide training for such teachers. 
The state universities especially have. developed in recent 
years series of courses, both in subject-matter and in pro- 
fessional lines, designed to train secondary-school teachers. 
These, like the normal-school courses described above, are 
very little standardized, but are promising as a nucleus for 
the final organizations which will solve the problem. 
The following paragraph indicates the existing conditions: 
The significant fact is that 21 of 24 universities report teachers’ 
courses. This means that in some way the academic departments 
are professionally coéperating with schools or departments of edu- 
cation in furnishing to intending teachers the special methods and 
peculiar fechnique, as well as more fundamental educational prin- 
ciples and distinctive values of the actual subjects the students will 
teach when they take positions in the schools. “The proper codrdi- 
nation of the university forces contributing to teaching efficiency

  316 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
is the curriculum problem for the immediate future in university 
administration. At present the solutions are about as numerous 
as the institutions concerned.* 
Tue REQUIREMENTS OF A STANDARDIZING ASSOCIATION 
The standardization of the requirements will require legis- 
lation or the action of central standardizing associations. 
This movement is now under way. The North Central 
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools sets as its 
standards for approval of high schools the following : 
All teachers teaching one or more academic subjects must sat- 
isfy the following standards : 
A. The minimum attainment of teachers of academic subjects 
shall be equivalent to graduation from a college belonging to the 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools 
requiring the completion of a fdur-year course of study or 120 
semester hours in advance of a standard four-year high school 
course. Such requirement shall not be construed as retroactive. 
&, The minimum professional training of teachers of academic 
subjects shall be at least eleven semester hours in education. This 
should include special study of the subject matter and pedagogy of 
the subject to be taught. Such requirements shall not be construed 
as retroactive. (For the succeeding year the Board will interpret 
courses in education as the same courses are interpreted by the 
colleges or universities offering them.) 
C. If a teacher, new to a given high school, does not fully meet 
the requirement of the aboye standards but, in the opinion of the 
inspector, possesses the equivalent of the training prescribed, the 
inspector shall submit, to the Board of Inspectors, a statement 
concerning the training, experience, and teaching efficiency of the 
said teacher, together with his recommendation. The Board shall, 
on each case presented, make a decision.”

THE CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS THE Most ADVANCED 
* in THE UNITED STATES 
The qualifications required by the State Board of Edu- 
cation in California are the highest required in any state. 
They are as follows: 
REQUIREMENTS 
High school certificates may be issued by county and city and 
county boards of education under the provisions of section 1519, 
subdivision 5 (a); section 1775, subdivision 1 (a), and section 1792 
of the Political Code of California, to candidates who meet all of 
the following requirements, to wit : 
(1) Requirement of Bachelor's degree. Fach candidate shall have 
received a Bachelor’s degree from a standard college requiring not 
less than eight years of high school and college training. 
(2) Requirement of one year of graduate study. Each candi- 
date shall submit evidence that in addition to the academic and 
professional courses required for the Bachelor’s degree, he has 
completed at least one year of graduate study, doing full regular 
work, though not necessarily a candidate for a degree, in an 
approved graduate school as hereinafter defined. Such graduate 
study shall include at least one full year course of advanced or 
graduate work in at least one of the subjects in which candidate 
expects to be recommended for certification. 
(3) Requirement of fifteen units of work in education, Fach 
candidate shall also submit evidence that he has completed in 
undergraduate or graduate standing, or the two combined, not less 
than fifteen units (semester hours) of work, in courses listed in the 
department of education in the institution in which the graduate 
work is completed, or courses in other departments of that or 
other institutions accepted as preparation for teaching by the 
department of education. These fifteen units of work shall include 
the several courses in education hereinafter prescribed. 
Required work in education. The required fifteen units of work 
in the department of education shall include the following courses :
-P-A-G-E-330
318 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
(a) A course in school and class-room management, or equiva- 
lent work —a minimum of one unit. . 
(2) Work in actual practice of teaching, with conferences — 
a minimum of four units. 
(€) A teacher’s course in at least one subject in which the can- 
didate expects to be recommended for certification, if such course 
be given in the institution and be accepted by or listed under the 
work in education — a maximum of three units for all such courses. 
(d@) A course in secondary education, presenting particularly the 
purpose and attainable goals of high school work —a minimum of 
two units. - 
(e) Such other courses relating to the theory, function and 
administration of public education, as are needed to complete the 
required fifteen units. 
Practice teaching. The work in practice teaching shall be done 
under the general supervision of the department of education of 
the institution in which the year of graduate work is taken, and 
may be done in schools of elementary, intermediate or secondary 
grade, though preferably in secondary school work of the kind 
the candidate is preparing to teach, and under the direction of 
competent instructors in such work. The work in practice teach- 
ing may also be done in connection with the training school of 
any California state normal school. 
Teachers’ courses. Fach teacher’s course shall be a bona fide 
teacher’s course and shall be made as concrete and practicable 
as possible, and shall have for its purpose the preparation of 
teachers to give intelligent instruction in the subject in the high 
schools of this State." 
ConTINUATION TRAINING OF SCHOOL OFFICERS 
The requirements which have been discussed up to this 
point have to do with admission to the teaching profession. 
Beyond that point there is nothing that can be described as 
sufficiently common to be regarded as typical. There are

tin No. 5, California State Board of Education, 1915. 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
    ' PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS 319 
voluntary and compulsory gatherings of every kind and 
variety intended to keep teachers intellectually alert and 
to inform them of progress in educational matters. There 
are institutes, so called, where teachers hear lectures. There 
are extension lectures, provided sometimes by boards of 
education, sometimes by teachers’ associations. There are 
meetings of teachers called by the superintendent or by the 
supervisor of a special subject or of a special grade. 
The miscellaneous activities which are indicated by such 
a list as the above all recognize the necessity of continued 
study on the part of teachers in service, and many boards 
of education are requiring study in addition to success in 
teaching as an essential prerequisite to promotion or to 
increases in salary. 
The most significant movement which has ever been wit- 
nessed in the training of teachers in service is the summer- 
school movement. All the leading institutions of learning 
in the country are filled during the long summer vacation 
with teachers who are pursuing courses in education or in 
the various subjects which they teach. ¥ 
SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATION 
Two phases of continuation study on the part of teachers 
deserve special discussion. First, the form of promotion 
which carries a teacher into school administration, that is, 
into a principalship or superintendency, is being hedged 
about with very definite demands for advanced study on the 
part of candidates. This advanced study must take the form 
of readings or courses on administrative problems. Such 
problems have been exemplified in earlier chapters which 
have dealt with costs, promotions, and the like. It can be 
safely asserted that the time is not far distant when a special 
preparation will be required for entrance on administrative 
positions, 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
  320 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SCIENCE OF EpucATION 
Second, the study of school problems by teachers in 
service has contributed powerfully to the creation of bodies 
of organized knowledge bearing directly on school matters. 
When education courses were designed chiefly for candi- 
dates for teaching positions, these courses survived even if 
they had no close relation to school work. To-day the situa- 
ation is entirely different in character. Teachers in service 
come to the study of education with urgent problems to be 
solved, The abstract statements of the older courses will 
not satisfy such students. The impulses toward the devel- 
opment of scientific information about schools which arise 
out of a demand for efficiency and economy are powerfully 
reénforced by the demand within the teaching profession 
itself for definite and constructive studies of school problems. 
EXERCISES AND READINGS 
The training of teachers is so closely related to state legislation 
that this chapter suggests the possibility of introducing the student 
to the methods of looking up state laws. How does one go about 
finding school laws? Why is education a matter of state legislation 
rather than a matter of national legislation? What are some of the 
striking differences between the educational laws of different states? 
Second, since the economic conditions which control teachers’ 
salaries are of importance in determining how much training 
teachers shall be required to secure, the question of salaries is 
an important one. This matter may be looked up in the two 
bulletins referred to below.

  APPENDIX 
CLASSROOM OBSERVATION 
In connection with the stuay of the foregoing chapters and col- 
lateral readings it is desirable that students visit classrooms and 
make systematic observations of the work there under way. In 
order that such observations may be productive it is necessary that 
the student have definite ends in view, otherwise observation will 
be scattered over many phases of that which is seen. The ques- 
tions below are intended to furnish guidance. 
It is recommended that each student in the course be required 
to spend at least three hundred minutes in observation and that 
he or-she prepare a written report. 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS 
Before going to the classes for observation determine which of the 
topics outlined below you are going to make the subject of special 
study. It will be advantageous for you to learn the questions. 
Go prepared to take notes. Confine your attention after the 
first general observations outlined below to the particular topic on 
which you are to report. Take down facts and definite individual 
observations. You are at liberty to talk with teachers if you can 
do so without imposing on them, but your report is not to be based 
on what they say but on what you see. Do not quote from books 
on the subject of your study. 
Prepare a report of not less than two thousand words.   
GENERAL QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED IN EACH REPORT 
1. In what school or schools did you make your observations ? 
2. How many visits did you make, and how long was each? 
(Give dates and minutes.) 
3. What was the grade of the class, and what was the subject of 
instruction ? 
321
-P-A-G-E-334
  322 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
4. Report on the physical conditions of each room. What was 
the condition of the temperature, of the lighting, of the ventilation? 
What kind of furniture was used? Did you see signs of fatigue 
on the part of teacher or pupils? 
After noting these general external conditions, turn your sei 
tion to one of the problems outlined below and prepare your report 
with reference to that single topic. 
I. GRADING 
Attend a class several times until you come to know something 
of each individual member ; then form a judgment as to the desira- 
bility of holding the group together... Suggest changes such as the 
putting forward or putting back of certain individuals. 
1. Are the students alike in their physical development, or are 
some oversized ? 
2. Are the mental differences parallel with the physical ? 
3. Do you observe symptoms showing that some children 
frequently do not understand the class work and therefore are 
to be regarded as below the grade? 
4. Do you see evidences that children are not fully occupied 
because the work is too easy for them? 
5. Children differ in their willingness and ability to take part in 
class work. How far should this be considered in grouping children? 
6. How far does the grouping of students in a class help or 
hinder the development of an individual? Give definite cases. 
7. Should the class be changed in size to provide for the best 
teaching ? 
8. In certain schools the effort is now being made to organize 
more individual instruction. What do your observations lead you 
to conclude about the desirability of such a plan? 
II. METHODS OF DISCIPLINE 
For observations under this section visit a number of different 
classes and note the general restlessness or quiet of the groups. 
Note in detail how the “order” is maintained, and try to determine 
(x) what is the teacher’s notion of order in each case, and (2) what 
devices he employs in securing what he wants.
-P-A-G-E-335
  APPENDIX 323 
1. Are there formal rules? For example, must the pupils sit in 
a certain way? Must they ask questions in a certain way? 
2. Does the teacher talk about order ? 
3- Does he have other devices that are evident, such as pausing 
and looking at some member of the class? 
4. Does he inflict penalties? 
5. Does he have devices that are less obvious, such as varying 
the character of the work or calling on a member of the class who 
is disorderly ? 5 
6. What is the relation of order to the subject of instruction ? 
7. Does the teacher neglect disorder which you would correct ? 
8. Of all the cases which you observed, which do you regard as 
the best kind of order? 
III. PREPARATION ON THE PART OF THE TEACHER 
Visit several different teachers and contrast their methods. It 
may be advantageous after a first visit to go back to observe again 
teachers who are radically different. 
1. Distinguish between a teacher’s general preparation or broad 
knowledge of a subject and his special preparation for a particular 
class exercise. What’ evidence is there that the teacher prepared 
for this particular exercise ? 
2. Does the teacher seem to have in mind a fixed order in which 
the lesson is to proceed ? 
3- What is the relation of economy of the time and energy of 
the class to the teacher’s preparation? 
4. Has the teacher anything to contribute outside of the text- 
book material ? 
5. Does the teacher know how to fit the work to the class period 
so as to make a complete exercise ? 
6. Is there evidence that the teacher has made specific prepara- 
tion for the next exercise ? 
IV. PREPARATION ON THE PART OF PUPILS 
One of the best ways to get material for this section is to go 
first to the high-school study room or to the general library and 
take note of the way in which people study. The kind of question
-P-A-G-E-336
  324 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
which should be raised in these observations of study periods is 
illustrated in V (2) below. After making these preliminary obser- 
vations go to some recitations and see if there are evidences in 
the individual recitations of the way in which the work of preparing 
the lesson has been done. The purpose of this particular section is 
to discuss the methods of judging preparation from the recitation. 
1. What proportion of the class has thought about the lesson 
as well as learned what is in the book ? 
2. When a student fails try to determine whether his failure is 
due to lack of study or to bad methods of study. For example, 
if a student has learned his lesson by heart, and forgets, he is very 
different from the student who has not tried either to understand 
or to learn by heart. 
3- How far is the recitation an examination, and how far does 
it teach students to think? What is the effect of the teacher’s 
method on the future study of the pupil? 
4. How far do students show initiative in carrying forward 
the work? 
5. How many questions do they ask? 
6. Girls generally get better marks than boys for their class work. 
Why is this? Do boys contribute anything that girls do not? 
7. Is there any difference in intellectual maturity exhibited by 
different members of the class? 
V (A). ATTENTION DURING RECITATION 
This section will be of special interest to those who wish to 
observe in the lower grades. Productive observations can be made, 
however, in every grade. The chief business of the school is to 
train in concentration. Observe individual pupils closely. 
1. How long does a child keep his attention fixed on one thing? 
2. What distractions does a schoolroom present ? 
3. What concession does the teacher make when pupils do not 
keep up concentration? For example, does he repeat questions? 
4. What positive devices are adopted to keep up attention ? 
5. What are the physical symptoms of attention and its absence? 
6. What individual differences are to be noted ? 
7. Do you note differences in attention at different times in the 
day or at different periods of the recitation ?
-P-A-G-E-337
  
Is) 5 APPENDIX, < 3 
V (2). ATTENTION DURING PERIODS OF STUDY 
For this section go to the study room or to some class that is 
engaged in individual work, as, for example, the laboratory. 
1. Note the way in which a student goes about his work. Is 
he ready to begin at once, or does he have to get matters together 
deliberately after he sits down? 
2. Note whether he reads continuously from the book which he 
is studying. : 
3. Pay attention to the sort of thing that the student does when 
he looks away from the book. Does he turn his attention to other ob- 
jects, or is he trying to think about the book itself? In general, what 
are the distractions that seem to take his attention from the work? 
When he comes back to his book, where does he take up the work? 
4. Is his rate of work evidently slow or rapid? This can be 
judged by watching him long enough to see how much time he 
spends in reading a given page. 
5. Note, if you can, the different ways in which students study 
different subjects. For example, is their work in history different 
from their work in mathematics? If so, which one seems to you 
to secure the highest degree of attention? Is the writing of notes 
apparently of value in keeping them at work ? 
VI. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
A comparison of different teachers and of different subjects of 
instruction will bring out most clearly the distinctions here aimed at. 
1. What part of the recitation is consumed in asking questions? 
2. Are the questions such as to require answers of more than 
a single sentence ? 
3. Are the questions based directly on the text? 
4. What is the mode of assigning the question to members of 
the class for answer ? 
5. Give examples of good questions with reasons for your 
selection. ; 
6. Contrast different subjects of instruction with reference to 
the questions which they permit. 
7. Give examples of questions which seem to you too general 
or otherwise vague.
-P-A-G-E-338
  326 THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
VII. MOTOR PROCESSES 
The gymnasium, the sewing class, the cooking class, and the 
manual-training shop furnish the best opportunities for observa- 
tions on this topic. Penmanship classes and almost any lower- 
grade exercise will, however, serve. 
x. What are the characteristics of a clumsy movement ? 
2. Point out certain instinctive elements of behavior; that is, 
forms of movement which do not have to be learned, but are 
natural. Are these always helpful in the learning process? 
3. Note the prevalence of rhythm in many forms of behavior. 
Is the rhythm more striking where the behavior is natural and 
instinctive or where it is being acquired as a special habit of skill? 
4. Comment on the educational value of repeating acts which 
seem to have reached a high degree of perfection, such as taking 
stitches or swinging Indian clubs. 
5. Are individual differences in rate and grace of movement 
capable of elimination through class training? 
6. How far is skill dependent on knowledge ? 
VIII. RELATION BETWEEN SUBJECTS TAUGHT 
For purposes of this section follow a class for a whole forenoon. 
if the class observed is one of the lower grades, the organization 
which places this class largely in the hands of one teacher favors 
a close interrelation of subjects. In the upper grades and high 
school, on the other hand, organization makes interrelating difficult. 
1. What cases did you observe in which the teacher consciously 
tried to illuminate one subject by reference to another ? 
2. Did the pupils ask any questions or make remarks which 
showed that they were thinking about other school topics? 
3. Within a given subject there is sometimes opportunity to 
relate topics which are remote from each other in the textbook. 
Did the classes visited show any examples of such relating of topics? 
4. What opportunities for interrelating subjects did you observe 
in addition to those taken advantage of by the class ? é 
5. Sometimes the contrast produced by change from one topic 
to another or from one classroom to another is important in arous- 
ing or depressing a class. What oe did you observe ?

SCHOOL EFFICIENCY 
By Henry Eastman BENNETT, Professor of Education, College of William and Mary.

The author has discussed topics which claim the attention of the teacher on every day of the school year, —school grounds, buildings, lighting, heat and ventilation, health inspection, marking systems and reports, discipline, and many others, -—and in discussing them has kept ever uppermost in his mind the average school of average opportunities and the teacher of average ability, which is one of the important reasons why this volume is a real contribution to the teacher’s library. 374 pages, illustrated

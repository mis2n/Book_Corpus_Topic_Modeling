  The articles in the following volume were 
mostly contributed, during the last twenty 
years, to the College Magazine, The Caian. 
Others were delivered as addresses or speeches 
in the College Chapel and Hall. As was natural 
and suitable under the circumstances, the in- 
dividual details and the personalities described 
or referred to, were mostly those of members 
of our own foundation. From this point of 
view I hope that these studies will serve to 
encourage others to enquire into the past 
history of whatever corporation they may 
belong to; and, in particular, to trace in the 
course of the events so displayed the main 
currents of the stream of national history. 
But though many of the illustrations here 
offered may be drawn from a somewhat narrow 
field, the picture of early college life which I 
have endeavoured to portray is, I hope, a fairly 
general and truthful one. It should be clearly 
understood that the social distinctions and 
pretensions which to some extent prevail at 
present, as between one College and another, 
+ had very little significance in early days. There 
was no college, as I believe there was hardly 
any school, which was supposed to be pre- 
dominantly frequented by “gentlemen’s sons.”

PREFACE 
Such distinctions as existed were mainly, at 
bottom, topographical; that is, were dependent 
on the part of the country from which the 
students were drawn. There was also a real, 
though temporary, influence sometimes to be 
traced in the personality of a dominant Master 
or Tutor. A good example of this is to be found 
in the Romanist reaction described in the 
“Elizabethan Episode.” On the whole the 
several Colleges may be considered to have 
been doing similar work, and doing it with 
similar efficiency, throughout the period in 
question.

A COLLEGE BIOGRAPHER’S 
NIGHTMARE 
(As described after dinner ). 
... 16 was a strange encounter altogether, 
as such experiences are apt to be; but I think 
there was a certain moral in it. What I had 
been doing or reading, to prompt such fancies, 
T will not undertake to say; but the scene took 
the form of a sort of Vision of Judgment. The 
locality in which I found myself was rather 
puzzling to me. It was not this Hall, nor was 
it our Chapel, though there were features in it 
which resembled them both; but enlarged be- 
yond all recognition. It was filled from end to 
end with a vast crowd, which seemed to stretch 
out interminably in rank beyond rank. 
The occupants evidently came from many, 
and some from remote districts of the country ; 
and by their dress and deportment seemed to 
extend from very early times down to our own 
day. There were medieval prelates amongst 
them: some of these of saintly aspect: men—as 
I felt sure—, of State, and learning and piety. 
Others of them, however, were clad in warlike 
garb:—I noticed one stalwart Trish archbishop, 
beneath whose priestly garments, as those 
about made hasty way for him, I caught the 
glint of a coat of mail. And there was much

blood on the sword of a certain lordly bishop of a neighbouring diocese. There were many 
monks, too, in the throng; mostly Benedictines, 
in their black garb, from the once famous 
Houses of Norwich and Bury; mingled with 
Cluniacs from Lewes, and a group of Augus- 
tinian canons in their sober garments. Nota 
few of the monks had held office as abbots or 
priors, and I thought that one or two had 
mitres on their shaven heads. Others, I felt 
sure, must have stood high in the courts of 
Rome and Avignon. Here and there was a friar, grey or black. And there were not a few seminary priests, from Douay, Rheims and 
Valladolid, lurking in the throng; some of 
these, I noticed, had halters round their necks. 
Mixed with all these was many a gay and 
gallant gentleman, some with the velvet cloak, 
ruff and rapier which marked them as of Elizabethan date; others in the bag wig and 
coloured coat, of later times. Some of their faces did not seem quite strange to me: could I have seen them anywhere on these walls? But the 
bulk of the crowd before me was composed of 
Anglican clergy, mostly in cassock, wig and bands :—as to whether they would consent to wear the surplice also, there was evidently a bitter dispute. They seemed to fill the room, in crowds past all counting. 
There was evidently some matter of common 
interest pervading that strange assembly, but what this was did not seem at first apparent. There was a universal hum of deep dissatis- 
faction from far and near, which gradually
-P-A-G-E-11
  A COLLEGE BIOGRAPHER’S NIGHTMARE 3 
assumed a tone of bitter complaint and remon- 
strance. It was directed against some one 
whose name I tried in vain to catch, who, they 
declared, had scandalously misdescribed their 
careers in life. Some of them urged complaints 
which were perhaps not altogether without 
ground. But, little as one is apt to be surprised 
on such an occasion, it did seem to me that 
some of the objectors were a little touchy and 
unreasonable. One complained that he had 
held a rectory, and “that fellow had put him 
down as a vicar”; another had preached a 
sermon, “and a visitation sermon, too,” and 
no notice taken of it. There were perpetual 
curates who had been described as if they were 
merely transitory. And so on. Nor did the 
laymen seem better pleased. There were 
squires who had been called yeomen, yeomen 
who had been called farmers, and so on, 
upwards and downwards. More than one portly 
country gentleman remarked that he should 
have thought that the dignity of the King’s 
Commission of the Peace might at least be 
mentioned if the security of the country was to 
be upheld. Somewhere, in the midst of the 
throng I saw the gold-headed end of a cane 
violently shaken, and from beneath came a 
voice complaining that the holder had been 
F.R.C.P.; and that instead of an ‘F’ he was 
insulted with a scurvy ‘M.’ One pointed to a 
portrait on the wall, with a name attached ; 
“They dare to call that me!” Some remarked 
that, though there was a monument to attest 
the fact, no notice of death was recorded.  
-P-A-G-E-12
    4 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Another, in a threatening tone, asserted that 
years before his death he had been foully killed 
by his biographer. Many of them had been 
studying some authority which they called 
‘D.N.B.’; but their complaints were not so 
much directed at the blunders which they said 
they found there, as against a certain delin- 
quent who ‘ought to have prevented such 
mistakes.’ 
Their attitude grew ever more and more 
menacing, and became so persistently directed 
against myself, as one after another pressed 
forwards, that I began to get alarmed. Then, 
with that strange intuition which one is apt to 
display at such moments, I suddenly reckoned 
up their number. I forget the exact figure, but 
it amounted to nearly 9000. Hardly had I done 
so when there came, from far and near, & 
simultaneous yell: “That’s the man, there he 
is!” Then the truth flashed on my mind. 
They were the men whose lives I had written, 
and I awoke with a scream.

Il. 
‘THE MEMORY OF OUR BENEFACTORS.’ 
(Address delivered on the occasion of the 550th 
anniversary of the fowndation of the 
College, June 22, 1898.) 
I have been deputed to propose a Toast, or 
rather a Memory, of the kind usually drunk in 
silence; for, of the many included within its 
scope, few indeed are within our present reach : 
—to be encouraged by our praise, or warmed by 
our thanks. It is the Memory of our Bene- 
factors: of that great cloud of witnesses,— 
witnesses to the nearness of the present and 
the past,—which compass us about in every 
ancient English Institution, whether religious, 
civic, or academic. They are a very numerous 
body, and include almost every rank and 
station in life. Our Commemoration Service, 
long as it may seem, literally does not contain & 
tithe of those who “in their day bestowed 
charitably for our comfort of the temporal 
things given to them.” The small and the 
great are there. 
Take a few representative cases to illustrate 
the variety of age, condition, and motives, 
under which these gifts have been made. Here 
is a broken-hearted mother, in despair at the 
sudden and violent death of her only son. Dean 
Nowell, of St. Paul’s, gives the account, and I 
should spoil it by repeating it in any words but
-P-A-G-E-14
    6 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
his own. He says: “The mother fell into sorrows uncomfortable; whereof I, being of her acquaintance, having intelligence did with all speed ride unto her house near to Hoddesdon, to comfort her the best I could. And I found her crying or rather howling continually, Oh my son! my son! And when I could by no comfort- able words stay her from that cry and tearing of her hair, God, I think, put me in mind at the last to say: ‘Comfort yourself, good Mrs. Frankland, and I will tell you how you shall have twenty good sons to comfort you in these your sorrows which you take for this one son.’ To the which words only she gave ear, and look- ing up, asked, ‘How can that be?’ And I said unto her, ‘You are a widow, rich and now childless, and there be in both Universities so many poor toward youths that lack exhibition; for whom, if you would found certain fellow- ships and scholarships, to be bestowed upon studious young men, who should be called Mrs. Frankland’s scholars, they would be in love toward you as dear children, and will most heartily pray to God for you during your life; and they and their successors after them, being still Mrs. Frankland’s scholars, will honour your memory for ever and ever.” This being said, “I will,” quoth she, “think thereupon 
earnestly.” That was the origin of one of our endowments; and there is little doubt that, if 
  
1 It does not seem to have occurred to the good Dean that some future Commission would simplify matters by retaining the endowments of the various Scholarships, and suppressing the names of the donors.
-P-A-G-E-15
  “THE MEMORY OF OUR BENEFACTORS’ % 
we knew as much of the facts in other cases, we 
should find that such a story of a broken heart, 
or of the hope deferred that makes the heart 
sick, lay behind the dry legal phrases of not a 
few of the dusty deeds in our College treasuries. 
Here again is some solid citizen of Norwich or 
of London, ‘who has accumulated an honest 
fortune; and is making up his mind, in a 
comfortable state of well-being and well-doing, 
how to dispose of some of it. He is advised that 
the exhibition of a young scholar,—one of the 
“poor toward youths” of Dean Nowell,—would 
be a wise and useful way of employing some of 
his surplus wealth. In early times a consider- 
able part of the endowments came from men of 
the trading class who had no apparent con- 
nexion with any college. Here it is a wealthy 
bishop or archbishop who is aiming at an 
increase in the number of the learned clergy. 
Here a statesman, who wants to encourage the 
canonists and civilians. Here a poor priest, in 
same far off parsonage, whose thoughts fondly 
revert to the library of his youth ; and who, in 
giving us a book or two, gives perhaps all he 
has to leave. Not a few of the ancient MSS. 
still on our shelves belong to this class. Here 
it is a knight or a country squire, who conveys 
Jand or an advowson, or founds a chantry under 
the patronage of the college. Bishop Shaxton, 
of Salisbury, coming back here to die in his old 
age, leaves the rent of a house “to solace the 
company at home yearly at Christmas.” A 
young student, cut off in his commencing 
career, leaves a cup, that his memory may not
-P-A-G-E-16
    8 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
die out amongst his comrades. One gives with the cheerful recollection of well-spent hours: he thinks it “his duty to cast in his mite into that fund which he has so abundantly enjoyed.” Another, in a spirit of remorseful retrospect, recalls “the twenty unprofitable years I spent there by my negligence and folly.” 
Isuppose that any one who listens to such a long Roll-call, stretching over century after century, as that which constitutes a list of College Benefactors, inevitably falls into an attitude of criticism. He begins to judge the wisdom of the ends designed: the foresight of the means provided. Has it ever occurred to you, Gentlemen, to conceive this attitude of judgment reversed? If that varied host of charitable donors could be raised to life again, —purged, we may assume, of prejudice and narrowness, but retaining each the special interest which he once had at heart,—and constituted a commission to enquire into the way in which we had used their benefactions, how should we fare at their hands? I appre- hend that such an assembly is one which few of us here present could face without a certain anxiety. Not a man in this room but has bene- fitted in some way, at school or at college, by the fruits of endowment; and some amongst us have fed freely on them. But those of us who are in the position of trustees might well feel some trepidation. Personally, I think that something might turn on the question as to who should preside over such a commission. If it were Bateman, bishop of Norwich, we might
-P-A-G-E-17
‘THE MEMORY OF OUR BENEFACTORS’, 9 
entertain some hope; for he was a thorough 
man of the world, versed in the ways of royal 
and of papal courts: he would know well how 
to make allowance for weakness, and for changes 
of thought and feeling. But with Dr. Caius in 
the chair it would be another matter. He was a 
severe man: rigid in his own conception of 
duty ; stern in his exaction of duty from others. 
He had too a deep love and veneration for the 
past. 
On one point indeed, and that an important 
point, we should not have much to fear. The 
stewardship has on the whole always been 
sound and conscientious. Hach succeeding age 
has rightly regarded itself as a trustee: bound 
to guard carefully what it had received from 
those before, and to hand it on undiminished to 
those who came after. No estate, I believe, 
even in the worst of times, has been lost by 
fraud or negligence. There has been little or 
none of that greed which sacrifices the future to 
the present, and which was sometimes such a 
scandal in the monasteries and in many civic 
corporations. 
But in matters of sentiment and association 
rather than of property, it would be far other- 
wise, and the story of neglect and loss is a sad 
one. As I walk by our chapel door I seem to 
see William Rougham, second master of the 
college, who beckons me in with an air of 
authority, and introduces me to a small but 
dignified assemblage. Rougham himself is a 
man of mark; wealthy and liberal. By his side 
is Henry de Spencer, the famous bishop of
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  10 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Norwich, the great warrior prelate of his age, 
fresh from his rout and slaughter of the Norfolk 
rebels. There too is John of Ufford, son of the 
Earl of Suffolk, the first known fellow-com- 
moner of the college. They are examining, 
with a certain curiosity, our present display of 
glass ;—but they want to know what has become 
of the windows which each of them presented 
500 years ago. Rougham has some cause to feel 
aggrieved, for the window which he placed there 
expressly recorded that he was the builder of 
the chapel; and as to the bishop, it is perhaps 
as well for us that he is not now stalking about 
here in his coat of mail. 
I slink away, and seek refuge in the library. 
There, again, is a distinguished company. 
William Lindwood, bishop of St. Davids, who 
died in 1446; with his contemporaries, the arch- 
deacon of Norfolk and the chancellor of 
Salisbury; also Thomas Boleyn, master of the 
college, and grand uncle of the unfortunate 
queen. There also are two or three of our 
earliest fellows; rectors of important parishes in 
London and elsewhere. They frankly admit 
that the ancient library they knew so well, and 
amongst whose chained volumes they used to 
work, had to go. But could no place be found 
for the windows which each of them placed in 
the ancient room? The bishop hints that he 
should have thought that the author of the 
Provincial Constitutions was one of whose 
connection with them any college might have 
been glad to retain such evidence. I evade the 
subject by begging the bishop to inspect our
-P-A-G-E-19
    “THE MEMORY OF OUR BENEFACTORS’ il 
valuable collection of MSS., assuring him that 
he will still find on our shelves nearly every 
book he remembers to have read here; and, 
offering to fetch the librarian, I escape by the 
ancient staircase. As I descend I am stopped 
by the awful presence of Dr. Caius himself, who 
sternly reminds me that,—as he has recorded in 
the Annals,—on that staircase used to be a 
window of historic interest. It contained the 
likenesses of two of the De La Poles, formerly 
fellow-commoners here, members of that great 
ducal house of Suffolk which was exterminated 
under Henry VIII. I try this Hall; and it is 
the same tale. There is John Crouch, dean of 
Chichester; one of the earliest donors to the 
University Library; in fact one of its founders. 
With him are others of our earliest fellows. 
Again, it is a question of the windows. The 
dean remarks, with stately courtesy, that they 
are doubtless the very best we can now produce : 
but where, they would like to know, are the 
windows which they placed in the ancient 
building ? 
It is a sad story. We have records of some 
18 or 20 windows: each with some personal 
memory clinging to it: each recording the 
student life here of some departed scholar, or of 
some ancient worthy of Church or State; and, 
so far as we know, not one square inch of any 
one of them is now in existence.’ 
  
1 There is reason to believe that three small glass coats 
of arms, long hidden away in a bedroom in the master’s lodge, 
but now placed in a better position in a window on the ground 
floor, are the remains of those given by Dr. Dorington.  
-P-A-G-E-20
    12 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
I slip into the chapel again, after making 
sure that the stalwart bishop is gone. There I find Anthony Disberow, former fellow, enquir- 
ing about the brass eagle which he gave as a lectern. ‘You might think it a poor thing,’ he 
says, ‘compared with what you now turn out at 
Birmingham: but it was mine own; and there 
was a bit of sentiment about it, which is 
perhaps the reason why you would not let it remain. It bore an inscription testifying to the 
“eternal love” which I felt towards my old 
college. Near him is another former fellow, 
Francis Dorington, of Dr. Caius’ time: an unruly member of the house in his day. ‘I know,’ he says sadly, ‘ that I got and gave many a hard blow in my time, before you could get rid 
of me; and the record of my doings survives in the archives of the State Paper Office: but could you not also have preserved the record of my reconciliation? In after years I put a glass window in this chapel, to replace an earlier one already destroyed. It bore the arms of Gonville, 
of Bateman, and of Caius, as well as my own 
arms; and the simple inscription “amice fecit”; to intimate that old animosities had died out, and that I hoped henceforth to be remembered 
only as a faithful son of the ancient house.’ 
It is a sad story; but I do not think that it 
is one for which the present generation has cause to feel shame. That callous indifference 
to any sentimental or historical association may fairly be considered a thing of the past. Of late years nothing has been let pass away which could by possibility be retained; and I
-P-A-G-E-21
  ‘THE MEMORY OF OUR BENEFACTORS’ 13 
know the keen interest felt in what survives. 
and the jealous care with which it is preserved, 
It is mainly the past which is guilty of 
destroying its own past. It is not only, 
or indeed mainly, those convenient scape- 
goats of the disappointed antiquary, — the 
Reformation and the Commonwealth,—which 
are to blame. The chief destructive agencies 
are of another and a humbler kind. To 
characterize their constant and insidious action 
we must fall back upon the old Scriptural 
metaphor of the canker worm and the cater- 
pillar. I do not know what are the original 
Hebrew terms which have been thus translated, 
but we may take it for granted that the actual 
agencies the prophet had in view were the same 
as those which we now call ‘architect’ and 
‘bursar.’ 
But such a Commission as I have supposed 
might raise a more serious question than the 
destruction or preservation of property. When 
anyone has followed, as I have been lately doing, 
the continuous but varying development, for 
century after century, of an ancient institution 
like ours: enquiring whence the students come 
who one after another are gathered within our 
walls, and whither they go as they disperse 
about the world upon their various careers, he 
almost inevitably has the reflection forced upon 
him, at what period have the real ends of all 
these endowments been best secured? The 
stewardship has been good: but when have the 
funds, thus carefully preserved, been admin- 
istered as an enlightened founder might be
-P-A-G-E-22
    14 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
supposed to think best? In other words, when, 
in the long life of a college or a university, has 
it most nearly fulfilled the ideal of faithfully 
reflecting the best culture and learning of the 
country, and been most influential in refining 
that culture and extending that learning? And 
when has it been most successful in attracting 
to itself all the material in the country, in what- 
ever station or place it could be found, that 
would best respond to its influences? I am no 
optimist, and I dare not suggest that in such a 
comparison the colleges or universities of this 
day would head the list. On the contrary, I 
think there are two, or perhaps three, periods in 
the past in which we should find ourselves 
excelled. I think we stand well, but we dare not 
claim the highest place. I can only hope that 
when the final judgment of History,—if any 
final judgment there be,—is passed upon us, it 
may be said that however erroneous our theories 
we endeavoured honestly to act upon them: 
that however limited and shallow our knowledge, 
we strove to broaden and deepen it: that in 
respect of the past we tried humbly to learn 
what it had to teach: and that in respect of the 
future we did what we could not to hamper it 
by our prejudice, confusion and error. Fifty 
years hence there will be occasion for a rehearsal 
of that judgment; and some of you younger 
men,—unless you go out of your way to defy the 
Theory of Statistics,—will have the chance to be 
present at it. I hope you will be lenient to us. 
One guess or fancy, and I have done. What, 
of all the personal possessions and destructible
-P-A-G-E-23
‘THE MEMORY OF OUR BENEFACTORS’ 15 
things which the college owns now, will be in 
existence 500 years hence? It is doubtless an 
idle guess, but excusable on such an evening as 
this, when our unit of time is the half-century. 
Past experience tells us nothing here. What 
have we now that belonged to us 500 years ago? 
There is the brick-work of the chapel and of one 
side of the Gonville court, covered over by the 
modern facing of stone and out of sight ; there 
are several MSS.; perhaps one or two pieces of 
plate; and a curious old astrolabe, not impro- 
bably handled by Gonville himself. That, as 
far as we know, is all. I like to indulge my 
fancy as to one or two of the things in our 
present possession. Five hundred years is a 
very long time indeed in the life-history of a 
college building: it is an eternity in that of 
most of the business which occupies us here: 
but it is not, or need not be, such a very long 
time in the existence of some material things— 
shall we say of a bell? I like to think that our 
successors of that far-off date may perhaps be 
summoned together by the same sound as we 
have heard; and that this, our latest gift, may 
still be flinging forth its solemn notes of an 
evening :—it may be through the smoke of 
square miles of crowded city : it may be through 
the gathering mists of a region which has 
reverted to its ancient condition, and has again 
become a waste of swamp and fen. 
And there is another fancy which I like to 
indulge. There is a familiar adage about the 
laws and the songs of a country, and their 
respective importance. May we give a rough  
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
rendering of this into Academic phraseology by 
saying that any man, even a young man, may 
draft a college statute, and that any man, even 
an old man, may live to see that statute 
repealed? But he who puts together the 
winged words of some song which catches 
on, and he who strengthens the pinions of 
its flight by fitting it to some subtle combin- 
ation of sweet sounds, are workmen of 
another stamp. I like to fancy that our far off 
successors will listen to the familiar chorus of 
our Carmen,—set perhaps to some new and 
strange accessories of musical accompaniment, 
—that they will toast the memory of the com- 
posers, and that perhaps the college annalist 
and historian of that day will be called on to 
tell the company who the men were who gave 
them that lasting benefaction. Gentlemen: I 
give you the Memory of our past Benefactors.

III. 
MOTIVES AND IDEALS OF THE EARLY 
FOUNDER. 
(Address delivered in the College Chapel, after 
the Commemoration Service, Dec. 21, 1894.) 
I have now and then indulged the fancy, 
whether,—if some Supreme Power were to 
grant us for once the privilege of taking our 
holiday ramble, not to the place but to the time 
of our choice,—of spending a few weeks in this 
or that century according to our choice,—we 
should elect to go forwards or backwards. If 
we may indulge in such a freak of fancy, the 
preference would perhaps largely turn upon the 
question of temperament, and therefore to some 
extent upon that of age. Many a buoyant and 
youthful spirit would gladly rush to the front, 
with the conviction that it not merely contains 
the key to all truth, but that it represents the 
outcome of all past experience. Perhaps if one 
were addressing such an assembly as commonly 
fills this chapel, sympathy would prompt one to 
side with such a sentiment. But to most of us 
elder men, I apprehend, the centre of interest 
has shifted, or is shifting, from the van to the 
rear. 
This is an idle fancy, but it may serve as an 
introduction to the only treatment of academic 
endowments appropriate here and now. Shall 
°c
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
we then, for the few minutes available, en- 
deavour not to lay down what such endowments 
should be, or perhaps eventually will be, but 
simply to ascertain something as to the motives, 
intentions and lives of those who actually estab- 
lished them? We will try to lift a corner of the 
veil which seems to shroud the far past, and to 
strain our eyes through the mists of four cen- 
turies, in order to make out,—as to such men as 
those whose names have just been sounding in 
our ears,—what lives they lived within our 
walls, and what motives prompted them to 
their benevolence. Something can be done in 
this way; though those words, which seem to 
me to breathe a fresh pathos every time I hear 
them, are still true of many :—“ There be, which 
have no memorial; who are perished as though 
they had never been.” 
Shall we, for one thing, try to picture to 
ourselves what the life here was, 400 years ago? 
Further back than that we cannot go with 
much confidence. In the existent state of our 
records, and of most other sources of personal 
information, the outlines then begin to crumble 
away. In place of the words and deeds of living 
men, we are left in possession of nothing 
beyond a few names and dates. But so far 
back, our footing is to some extent sure. We 
may picture to ourselves a small assemblage of 
probably 20 or 25 persons, constantly meeting 
within these very walls, not only for religious, 
but for all corporate purposes. We know not 
merely their names, but something of their 
surroundings, whence they came and from what
-P-A-G-E-27
  
IDEALS OF THE EARLY FOUNDER 19 
position in society, and still more, what career 
they followed, and what part they played in life. 
The corporate feeling was of course very strong: 
far stronger than with us, who have so many 
links of connection with the outside world. We 
must not forget that they too had a past behind 
them, to which they strove to bind themselves 
with many an obit mass and prayer. And their 
dead lay closer to them than is the case with us. 
Some were laid to their rest here: others in the 
aisle of St. Michael’s hard by. Those of their 
comrades who died in college, whom they com- 
memorated, and on whose souls they prayed 
that God might have mercy, were lying close at 
hand. 
In such a commemoration service as we 
publicly hold here we cannot record any but 
the prominent names, “the famous men.” But 
the aggregate made up by the host of the 
unrecorded is very great, and it is of them that 
I would rather speak now. Gifts of small actual 
value were almost universal. It is noticeable 
how rare it is to find an ancient Will of one of 
the members of our older societies here, in 
which the thoughts of the testator do not 
revert, at the last, with fond and grateful 
remembrance to the house or hall in which the 
seed-time of his early days had been spent. 
The parish priest, as so many of these men 
were, had but little to give. But after he has 
made mention of the altar or rood-light of the 
church where he had been baptized, and the 
tower or the chancel of that wherein he had 
ministered, or celebrated his first mass, his
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
thoughts generally wandered back to his 
student’s days, and he pondered how he could 
help those who were struggling along the same 
path of poverty and trial which he had once 
trodden himself. That is the history of not a 
few of our MSS. Shall we be far wrong if we 
picture to ourselves some poor priest, passing 
away in a distant parsonage, his mind perhaps 
already disturbed by the commencing shocks 
of the great religious earthquake and prema- 
turely aged by the scenes of war and famine 
and pestilence through which he had passed ? 
He recalls the hours he had spent as a youth in 
the chilly garret which served for a library, as 
he made the most of the brief daylight, and he 
remembers how he had longed in vain for a 
sight of this or that volume which the frugality 
of many later years has since enabled him to 
procure. So he adds it to the store on our 
shelves, and shows his sense of the real value of 
his gift by the precautions he asks for its safe 
custody. Many of our books are suggestive of 
details in the life and death of the far past. 
Now and then there is some record of the gift 
in the Annals of the College, or in the lists 
recorded in our library ; but more often we can 
only infer the fact from the name on a blank 
page or from the last will of the donor. This is 
not mere guesswork. Take an instance or two 
from the records in the Probate Courts. Thus 
Geoffrey Champney, once a Fellow,—who died 
in 1472,—after making bequests to the Church 
of Cromer, where he had been vicar, and to 
that of St. Stephen, Norwich, which he served 
   
-P-A-G-E-29
  IDEALS OF THE EARLY FOUNDER at 
till then, and leaving small legacies to the 
prior and to each monk of the Charter House 
and of Sion, his dying thoughts revert to this 
chapel where he had so often worshipped and 
to the library which he knew so well. He 
leaves 40s. for the repair of the former, and 
his copy of Philip Rippington’s Homilies to 
the latter, with directions that it should be 
chained up in its place. That book is there 
now, on our shelves. Perhaps it was his 
memory of such a gift that prompted Robert 
Carlton, himself a Fellow of the College, who 
died in Norwich 80 years afterwards, to direct 
that he should be buried by the side of 
Champney. Those who turn over our old MSS. 
will find in them from time to time these 
trifling intimations, these touches which help 
the annalist and biographer to transform mere 
names into human beings. Thus Henry 
Osburne, Fellow of the College in 1392, gave 
us a copy of Polychronicon of Ralph Higden. 
He was probably giving us of his best. On 
the fly-leaf is an entry, dated 1400—presumably 
by the proctor of the time—that this volume 
was the cautio or pledge of Henry Osburne. 
These pledges were very common then and 
long afterwards, sometimes to raise money for 
fees or other necessary purposes, more often as 
security for performing the exercises requisite 
for the higher degrees. Now and then the 
pledge consists of money or plate, but often 
the poor scholar’s only available treasure is 
one of his valued books. Osburne must have 
left us that book; and though he himself is
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
numbered amongst those who are as if “they had never been” as regards any public recognition, yet as one handles his book after just five centuries, 
one seems to be brought closer to him. Volumes 
have come to us in this way from many parts of 
the country. Some were given by the Vicar of Leeds, Henry Thomson, in 1480; others by the 
Rector of St. Andrew’s, Holborn, in 1502; and 
so on. Amongst these ought in justice to be mentioned John Crucher, Fellow in 1407. 
The glass windows which he helped to give— presumably for this chapel—have long since been shattered and have given place to others, 
which in their turn have disappeared. But there is still a MS. of his gift in the University 
Library which Mr. Bradshaw pronounced to be the gem of the English collection. 
As one thus looks backward across the chasm of four centuries one cannot help wondering 
sometimes whether, with these men, the wings 
of fancy made a similar flight forwards; and if they dared to frame any conscious hope that 
after such a lapse of time their own lineal 
successors should be meeting within the same 
walls, and striving somehow to get at their personal history. Probably not; for those were no times of optimism. I suspect that to most men of that day, of the convictions and tempera- 
ment of the pious donor, however unshaken 
their own personal faith might be, despair 
rather than hope would seem the fitting attitude 
towards the future of the world. But one 
would fain believe that it might have been so, 
and that their minds could have been cheered
-P-A-G-E-31
  
IDEALS OF THE EARLY FOUNDER 23 
by the conviction, somehow granted to them, 
that the tiny barque which they were launching 
on the waters would be still afloat after three 
such tempests as the Reformation, the Revolu- 
tion, and what, to certain kinds of benefaction 
was almost equally fatal, the coarser Utilitarian- 
ism of recent times. 
As regards the more permanent endowments 
—in distinction from the single gifts—the 
question is often asked, What exactly were 
the intentions of the donors? Whom did 
they propose to benefit, and with what ultimate 
object? On this point there cannot be much 
doubt for those who have studied the deeds of 
foundation. What they looked to was the 
encouragement of what may be called the 
higher professional study:—not the production, 
so to say, of the mere artificer, on the one 
hand, nor on the other, the maintenance of 
what is known as original research. The sheer 
love of speculation, of study for study’s sake, 
must always and everywhere be the vocation 
of the very few, and can hardly be legislated 
for. The monastery, if any place, would have 
been the appropriate soil in which such a plant 
might from time to time spring up. But the 
founders of most of our endowments never 
dreamt of adding to the monastic establish- 
ments, nor contemplated any permanent 
residence in our buildings here. Their 
provisions taken together, seem to point to 
the design of securing that thoroughness of 
study which can only come of leisure, and 
that dignity of tone which is hardly attainable  
-P-A-G-E-32
    24 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
where the struggle for bread begins too soon. The object of the foundation was to stimulate that spirit, and secure those results, and then to encourage the student to go out and take his place in the struggle of the world. This points to a very different aim from that of the monastery, which kept its hold on the recruit for life. 
Did then the results answer to the founders’ expectations? Did the system, whilst it was in its first freshness, breed the sort of men whom they had in mind when they made their pro- visions? This is a question of historical facts and can only be answered by an appeal to such facts. Let us confirm ourselves to a dozen years towards the beginning of the 16th century, close upon 400 years ago. During this periods 64 men seem to have dwelt within our walls. Of one quarter of these nothing more is known: of the remaining 48 we are able to ascertain something definite. This in itself is a striking fact; for, as everyone who has edited a School or College Admission Register well knows, it is no light task to ascertain the career of three-fourths of the men who entered it as lately as a generation ago. 
Of these men three became Bishops— Shaxton of Salisbury, Skipp of Hereford, and Repps of Norwich. Two others were amongst the foremost physicians of their time—Sir Wm. Butts, physician to Henry VIII., described by a contemporary as “the refuge of all students, and the chief guardian and ornament of the
-P-A-G-E-33
  IDEALS OF THE EARLY FOUNDER 25 
University”; and Sir Thos. Wendy, physician 
to four successive monarchs, whose name is still 
in your ears. As rising to State distinction 
must be added Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of 
the Rolls and a distinguished antiquary, and 
Lord Morley. Sixteen were monks, of whom 
six probably became priors of their respective 
houses, and one sub-prior; one or two, on their 
return, were appointed teachers in their own 
houses, to hand on to others the instruction 
they had themselves received. Of course at the 
dispersal these men had to look elsewhere, but 
they mostly did not—like so many of their 
brethren—disappear as mere pensioners; one 
became Bishop of Norwich, another Dean of 
Ely, another prebendary of Lincoln, another a 
Rector in London. Of the secular clergy ten 
held the office of University preacher, viz. were 
of the limited number licensed by the University 
to that function, and they mostly held posts 
of a certain importance. One was Canon of 
Lincoln, two held churches in London, one in 
Norfolk, and so on. Add to these the Chancellor 
of Beverley, two canons of St. Paul’s, and a 
man selected as one of the first Fellows on the 
new foundation of Cardinal College at Oxford. 
Eight men became parish priests; two of them 
in churches in the City of London, the others in 
Norfolk and elsewhere. Two only, as far as can 
be traced, belonged to the class which subse- 
quently became relatively so numerous, viz. 
that of the leisured class, the country gentry, 
and these appear to have wished to make some 
return for the privilege of sojourn here. One
-P-A-G-E-34
    26 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
was Nicholas Buckenham, who added to our 
buildings. The other, Walter Stubbe, is not 
certainly known as a donor, but as his brass 
in the ante-chapel is one of the only two 
ancient monuments here, it seems highly 
likely that he was so. 
What should we say to such a roll-call of 
honourable and dignified success in life, had 
these 64 been the entry of some one recent 
year? The comparison is of course an unfair 
one. The doors of a college are thrown wider 
open now, and many come whose only aim is to 
secure the minimum qualification which will 
admit to a profession, or to fill up an interval of 
life which it is not, at the moment, seen how 
else to dispose of. You will understand that 
Iam not presuming to judge whether this is, 
or was, what ought to be. We merely want to 
get at facts here. Those early benefactors, 
whose names have been familiar to most of 
us for so many years, in this building, what 
did they really contemplate when they gave 
us of their good things? and did the results, 
for a time at any rate, justify them in their 
forecast? I do not think there can be much 
doubt in respect of the answer to either 
question. 
But such success in life, even when it 
assumes the dignified and honourable form 
of office and station rather than of reward, is 
only one element in determining the judgment. 
What test can we adopt of any such higher 
results? In such a narrow field we cannot 
look for brilliant originality. The men who
-P-A-G-E-35
  IDEALS OF THE EARLY FOUNDER 27 
largely add to knowledge, or improve our 
methods of speculation, must always be so 
few that their appearance will seem casual. 
No system can fairly have its success tested 
by the production of such men as these. 
Perhaps the best test for such a purpose is 
to be found in the men of the second rank, 
amongst the larger number who can sympathise 
and carry out, rather than invent, and who are 
prepared to take their venture on what others 
have set before them rather than strike out a 
new line for themselves. 
Now the men of whom we have been 
speaking lived in just one of the epochs when 
such a test becomes appropriate. Most of them 
must have been called upon to part to one side 
or the other in the great division of the 
Reformation. How did they meet the crisis? 
Did a fair proportion of them promptly take 
a side, follow the dictates of conviction or 
conscience, and face the issue? I think, when 
we turn to the facts, the answer will be found 
to be an emphatic affirmative. We would fain 
head our list with a martyr, but that is denied 
us. We have no Latimer or Ridley or Bilney to 
show. But in the next rank, to speak of those 
who risked and who suffered short of death, 
there is no small number; quite enough to 
justify the well-known saying of Bishop Nix as 
to the character then borne by Gonville Hall. 
Confining ourselves to a period but little longer 
than that we considered before, I find no less 
than eight or nine who must be ranked in this 
honourable class. The number seems to me to
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
be large, when we remember how many of the 
total of residents were monks, whose lifelong 
training made any willing change of this sort 
almost impossible. 
As the men I have in view are mostly not 
of the eminence which entitles them to notice 
in general History, some of them indeed might 
be almost said to be unknown, I mention their 
names. The best known is Shaxton, Bishop of 
Salisbury, and for some time Fellow. He was 
prominent in the early days of the Reformation: 
was repeatedly imprisoned, and condemned to 
the stake, but escaped by recantation. John 
Skipp, Bishop of Hereford, went some way in 
the same direction, and was charged with 
sedition. Edward Crome was for many years 
Fellow, and had the high approval of Cranmer: 
“when he was but president of Physic Hostel 
his house was better ordered than all the houses 
in Cambridge besides.” He was repeatedly in 
trouble for his opinions, and was imprisoned in 
1554. Sir Wm. Butts, though a friend of 
Cranmer and decided reformer, did not, I believe, 
suffer. Sygar Nicholson, University printer, 
and for some years a resident pensioner here, 
suffered the most. He was long imprisoned, 
and is said to have been tortured with much 
barbarity. Dr. Warner, Fellow for some 10 
years, and afterwards Rector of Winterton, 
went at his risk to comfort Bilney, the Norwich 
martyr, before his death. Simon Smith, also a 
Fellow, was a friend and associate here of 
Latimer and others of like stamp, and a 
prisoner for his opinions. Patmore, Smith’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
    IDEALS OF THE EARLY FOUNDER 29 
rector at Hadham, Herts., was a prisoner for 
two years in the Lollard’s Tower, Lambeth. All 
of these were more or less prominent men here, 
as members of the little cluster of early Cam- 
bridge reformers—Latimer mentions several 
of them when addressing his persecutors, “Do 
you not hold Nicholson, Smith, Patmore, with 
many others, in prison at this very hour?” 
These names lie but just beneath the surface 
of current history: if we were to dig lower 
we should doubtless come upon others. What 
a significant hint is there in the will of Thomas 
Ocley, a Fellow who was cut off young in 1537. 
He gives all his goods to Nicholas Ridley and 
others, “to dispose of as they do know, and 
shall by searching of Scripture, all affection 
put away,” decide. No wonder that Bishop 
Nicks of Norwich gave utterance to the 
ominous and often quoted description: “There 
is a college in Cambridge called Gunwell Haule. 
I hear no clerk that hath comen out lately of 
that college but saverith of the frying panne, 
tho he spake never so holely.” 
Time fails, or one would like to emphasize 
how here, as in all such crises, we find the men 
trained in any institution worthy of the name 
of Liberal and Catholic, parting asunder, and 
then meeting later on in hostile array. It was 
so during the Romish reaction in the days of 
Elizabeth, and still more so, both in religion 
and politics, in the time of the Revolution. 
Surely this is the stamp of the highest training. 
It is not merely the dramatic interest which is 
aroused by finding those who had sat side by
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
side here meeting again as judge and prisoner, 
or facing each other in the angry struggle of 
controversy or across the field of battle. Of the 
hosts who gathered in support of opposing 
principles at the time of the Revolution, one 
could hardly say, without actual enumeration, 
on which side those from our walls were found 
in greatest numbers. 
For a time of course those who have been 
brought up under the same influences will 
preponderate on one side. But if such tendency 
became overwhelming and remained persistent, 
then we should say that a college had sunk 
to a seminary, and that doctrines had been 
set above principles. We must not say that 
this diversity of conviction and career was 
the conscious aim of those whom we com- 
memorate to-day. But I feel little doubt that 
it was involved in the principles underlying 
their provisions, and no doubt that it was on 
the whole the outcome of their sacrifice. May 
others, in the days to come, say as much of us 
and of our efforts!

IV. 
THE COLLEGE BENEFACTOR. 
(Address delivered in the College Chapel, 
Sunday, October 30, 1904.) 
You have just listened to a long catalogue 
of names, almost all unfamiliar to you, and 
many dating from times so remote as appar- 
ently to preclude all possibility of present 
reference to ourselves. Nothing as a rule 
sounds more uninteresting than a roll-call of 
bare names. Think with what indifference 
anyone—especially a young man—glances 
through the list of deaths in a newspaper! 
And yet even there, if we could lift the veil 
in each successive case, what a tragedy of 
passion and emotion would be disclosed. Here 
a career cut short at the moment when the 
prize of life seemed almost within grasp; there 
the catastrophe of a ruined and blasted life 
recklessly cast away; here the desolation of a 
loving home; there the bitterness of remorse 
for conduct which nothing can now reverse. 
It is well perhaps for the purposes of practical 
life that no such vision in all its details is ever 
granted to us. 
What I want to do at present is to spend 
a few minutes in trying to lift, here and there, 
the thick veil which hangs between our eyes 
and the lives and motives of those whose names 
you have listened to in the roll-call of this  
-P-A-G-E-40

  32 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
morning. It is but little we can effect in this 
way. Many of the donors are known to us 
almost entirely by the mere fact of their gifts. 
And if we refer to the original records it is but 
slight help we find. You go down into our 
Treasury, and see the drawers and shelves filled 
with ancient deeds, stained with the dust of 
centuries. When you read them you will find 
them couched in legal verbiage which really 
sounds almost as though it were contrived for 
the purpose of making the gift look like a sordid 
bargain. Some dead man has left land or 
money for the use of students, and in return 
the priest, under penalties, shall sing masses 
for his soul. So the words may run; but the 
facts are generally far other than this whenever 
we can actually succeed in getting at them. 
We must here bear in mind one important 
distinction between ancient and modern life. 
Personal property is abundant almost every- 
where now. A modern donor may sometimes 
hardly know that he has drawn a large cheque, 
or he who receives it know that he has done so, 
except by consulting their pass-books. The 
personal effects now inventoried in a single 
room of any well-to-do person may far out- 
number in range and value the aggregate of 
what any but the really rich once had to leave 
behind them. 
But in old days it was far otherwise. 
Some almost insignificant gift, therefore, the 
mere mention of which would now raise a 
smile, was a serious consideration on both 
sides. It implied a real sacrifice. It demanded  
-P-A-G-E-41
    THE COLLEGE BENEFACTOR 33 
anxious consideration on the part of the 
giver, whether he could spare it, and con- 
sequently, called for gratitude on the part of 
the receiver. He who gave a book during his 
lifetime may have appreciably curtailed his own 
facilities for study. He who gave an ornament 
—plate for the table, a service-book for the 
chapel—may have left his own home or room 
perceptibly the poorer. To part with anything 
would probably involve actually missing it. 
A trivial instance will explain what I mean. 
We of the present day hardly know what it 
is really to suffer from cold, unless perhaps 
briefly on a journey or some such casual 
occasion. But this must have been the 
medieval student’s normal experience during 
winter. Think what it must have been to sit 
and study in an unwarmed room: to spend hours 
in a library where you had with numbed fingers 
to handle the heavy chained volumes: to feed 
in a hall without a fire; the floor of stone and 
no hangings on the wall. But this condition of 
college life prevailed for centuries. Then two 
benevolent men in the time of EHlizabeth— 
Shaxton once Bishop of Salisbury, a former 
student and fellow, and Dr. Bisbey, an old 
fellow-commoner—combined to relieve the dis- 
comfort. A large brasier was provided, and 
land was bought, the rent of which should 
supply fuel. The date of the first occasion on 
which the fire was lighted in the Hall is 
recorded in the Annals, as an important event 
in the College history. 
Such an incident as this excites a smile 
D
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
nowadays, and we might be inclined to class it 
with the rather perfunctory efforts of a village 
coal or blanket club. But the men of that day 
knew better. No wonder the names of the 
donors were gratefully recorded, and a special 
grace was said and a hymn of thanks sung at 
every meal to record the gift, and to praise the 
Lord “who made His ministers a flame of fire.” 
It is this personal element which is so inter- 
esting and so characteristic of early times. 
Each benefactor felt a keen sympathy with 
those whom he proposed to benefit ; each of the 
latter in turn knew exactly who it was whom 
he had to thank. In very many cases the gift 
was probably the outcome of a keen recollection 
of discomforts and privations experienced in 
their own youth. Nowadays much of our 
charity, as of our social efforts in general, is 
carried on almost impersonally, through some 
agency or other. We may be casually asked by 
a stranger to contribute to some cause which 
we do not understand, which assists we hardly 
know whom, we hardly know where.' And the   
1 Take, for example, the case of our scholarships down to 
the time of the first University Reform Commission. The 
scholar at any rate knew whom he had to thank for the help 
he received. Doubtless the conviction that this was a 
charity, rather than a reward which he had rightly earned by 
his merits, had nearly faded away. And of course the 
obligation to pray for the soul of the founder had long been 
legally abrogated. The name of the donor, however, was 
carefully retained, and therefore the historic basis for 
gratitude was left intact. Contrast with this the position of 
the modern County Council School scholar when he comes to 
the University. No notion of gratitude to be displayed prob- 
ably ever enters his mind. Why should it, considering the 
drift of much modern legislation? He considers that he has a 
right to what he has earned, as being first on the list. As to
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE COLLEGE BENEFACTOR 35 
recipient may have even less of personal know- 
ledge, and consequently of rational gratitude in 
this relation, than the donor. 
Of course there are plenty of exceptions to 
such a statement as the above. Do not forget 
that we, as a college, have abundant reason to 
recognise the value and the wisdom of what the 
living hand can do in the way of providing for 
the educational wants of the day and for the 
amenities of life. But, speaking generally, 
there can be little doubt, I think, that such a 
broad contrast as that sketched above is to be 
observed between the positions of the ancient 
and the modern members of such foundations. 
The recognition of this will help to explain 
much that may seem quaint, trivial and out of 
date in such a Commemoration service as you 
have listened to to-day. 
Try to picture to yourself what was part of 
the daily life of a student, say some four or 
five centuries ago. Poor he was of course: the 
whole foundation was miserably poor compared 
with an average monastery. But on every side, 
whatever elements there were to relieve his 
discomforts, to brighten his daily life, and to 
aid him in his studies, could be assigned to 
some known benefactor. He came to pray in 
this chapel—already old in his day, for it has 
stood substantially the same building now for 
more than five centuries. Such few ornaments   
praying for a soul, if such a fantastic medieval idea were 
suggested, it would certainly puzzle any of us to decide 
whose soul it ought to be :—Should we be wrong in suggest- 
ing that of the late Lord Ritchie, as the originator of County 
Councils, or that of some representative ratepayer?
-P-A-G-E-44
    36 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
as then existed here were all of known origin. 
The glass windows, which protected from the 
weather, recorded the names, the arms, and the 
pious wishes of great men in the past. They 
were the gift of the living to the living. Costly 
vestments for the altar were the gift of Bishop 
Bateman, founder of Trinity Hall, and dated 
from the first building of the college. The 
earlier altar vessels came from Bateman and 
Somersham, the third Master; those of a some- 
what later date, and still in use, were a present 
from Archbishop Parker, a sign of his intimate 
friendship with Dr. Caius. The brass eagle— 
long since disappeared, like too many other 
relics of the past—bore an inscription of the 
“eternal friendship” of a former Fellow to the 
foundation on which he had been reared. A 
window expressly recorded the regret felt by 
one of the most turbulent opponents of Dr. 
Caius, and his reconciliation with his old 
antagonists: and so on. 
You might follow the ancient student 
through the rest of the college, and observe 
how, at every step of his course, and every 
stage of his career, he was reminded of those 
who in the past had striven to help him. 
Many of the gifts came from country clergy. 
A priest in the far north, who must have lived 
during the Civil Wars more than 400 years ago, 
left all his books to the library: doubtless his 
mind reverted at the end to the quiet hours 
he had once spent there. One from Hampshire 
gave a sum of money to be freely lent to 
students in necessity: the scholar’s path was no
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE COLLEGE BENEFACTOR 37 
flowery one then. A Bishop of St. David’s gave 
a window to the library: as a deep student of 
the old canon law he well knew its contents. 
From such remote places, on every side, gifts 
came dropping in. 
There is a somewhat prevalent notion, I 
believe, that gifts in pre-Reformation times are 
to be looked on with suspicion. They are often 
regarded as if they had been extorted from the 
dying by the pressure of religious terrors. 
There may have been something of this influence 
in the case of the monasteries, especially in rude 
and turbulent times. But I can find no appeal 
to any such motives in the case of our colleges. 
As already remarked, these were humble institu- 
tions, and did not for the most part arise until 
the commencement of the reaction against the 
monks and friars. In fact, they are often the 
expression or the consequence of that reaction. 
The tyrannous baron, whose lands are extorted 
from him as a selfish precaution on his death- 
bed, is, I conceive, entirely unknown in the 
history of our various endowments in Cambridge. 
Our “nursing fathers and nursing mothers” 
were, in not a few instances, living men and 
women; and, where the donors had literally 
nothing to spare during life, they are generally 
men who had spent their early days under all 
the hardships of a student’s life, and still 
retained vivid recollections of the privations 
from which they strove to save their successors. 
Some of them, as in our own case with Edmund 
Gonville, were simply parish priests, into whose 
hands accident had thrown the disposal of
-P-A-G-E-46
    
38 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
property. Some were flourishing merchants of 
Norwich or some other great town, whose sons 
or nephews were students, and who therefore 
knew well what was wanted. Our buildings 
were largely due to such men. Some belonged 
to the well-known medieval class of statesmen 
Bishops, men immersed in political affairs at 
home and abroad. William Bateman, of Norwich, 
who carried out and added to Gonville’s bequest ; 
the lordly De Spencer already mentioned ; 
Colton, the famous Archbishop; Lynwood of 
St. David’s, the greatest canonist, belonged to 
this class. Such men were deeply devoted to 
the encouragement of sound learning and 
religious education, and to securing this by 
training up young men for the service of the 
Church and the State. 
Men and women of mark and of wealth have 
thus freely contributed throughout the whole 
history of our college. But, after all, these 
represent relatively a very small minority of the 
total. The vast majority of those whose names 
would be included in a complete roll-call of 
benefactors are persons like ourselves; swayed 
by just the same motives as those which still 
have force over every true and loyal son of his 
school or college. They wished to live on in the 
memory of their old comrades; to save their 
successors from some of the toils and privations 
which they had themselves undergone; to signify 
their gratitude to those who in earlier days had 
helped their own career. 
Well, their ideals are not always ours; their 
methods are in large part superseded; many of
-P-A-G-E-47
    
THE COLLEGE BENEFACTOR 39 
the gifts which they secured for us, with painful 
toil and conscious self-sacrifice are nowadays 
heaped about us, almost encumbering us with 
their mass. But the spirit of the donors may 
remain unchanged. 
It is a strange feeling, that of belonging to 
an ancient foundation, one which has been 
doing its appointed work for century after 
century in the past, and will, we would fain 
believe, continue to do so into the far and 
unknown future. Its whole course, as we have 
seen, has been, so to say, punctuated by incessant 
displays of the kindly sympathy of those who 
had once belonged to it. Scarcely a year, we 
might almost say scarcely a term, is thus 
unmarked during our past history. 
The links which thus bind man to man in 
any corporation or fraternity cannot be broken. 
We may neglect them, forget them, profess 
to despise them, but they still exist. Nothing 
can remove that sense of continuity with the 
past which, on a far wider and more solemn 
scale, is expressed in the words of the hymn, 
“«Part of the host have crossed the flood, and 
part are crossing now.” 
The links of attachment are double: pro- 
spective as well as retrospective. If there is the 
tie of gratitude to the past there is also that of 
obligation to the future. 
You remember Robert Browning’s reflections 
at the sight of Trafalgar and Cape St. Vincent: 
“Here and here did England help me; how can 
I help England, say?” 
It is but one here and there who can feel
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  40 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
himself called on to take a place in our roll-call. 
But remember this. The aggregate of those 
benefactions, as we have seen, is made up not so 
much by a few great gifts as by innumerable 
small ones, significant rather as tokens of kindly 
will than for what they might fetch in the 
market. May we not say that the aggregate of 
acknowledgment for them is similarly to be 
sought, not in costly return gifts, but in the 
numberless petty acts of daily life which lie in 
the power of us all; in the effort to use to the 
utmost the privileges now before us; the determination that a mere grasping after 
prizes shall not get the upper hand; a 
resolution that no act or neglect of ours 
shall soil the fair fame of the ancient house; a 
continued effort to smooth the path of others 
and to help them on their way? So shall we 
“fruitfully use those temporal things” which 
men of the past “charitably bestowed for our 
comfort.”

PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE. 
(Being a Paper read to the Caius Historical 
Society.) 
What I propose to do to-night is to give you 
some account of College life as it was 400 years 
ago. I fear, however, that there is not very 
much to be said on this subject. We are 
looking down a long cavernous passage, where 
the light is feeble, and the outlines soon become 
dim and uncertain. But the subject ought to 
be one of some interest to you of the present 
day, for the men of whom I shall speak are 
your predecessors, bound to you by a chain in 
which, however long, no single link is missing. 
That is a rather startling fact when we come 
to reflect upon it. Every one of you is in 
intimate personal relation with some of those 
who belong to the year before you. So were 
they with those who preceded them. And thus 
we may go back step by step, to the very 
origin of the Foundation. Fortunately for our 
country there has been no breach of continuity 
by war, nor even by plague. Till quite recent 
times I doubt if there was ever a single day, 
from year’s end to year’s end, in which some 
fellows and scholars were not in residence, and 
therefore in personal communication. 
To begin. There is one natural prejudice 
which you have to overcome. Those who are
-P-A-G-E-50
re er ee ae 
42 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
familiar with the social prestige and in- 
tellectual claims of any one of our more 
important colleges in the present day, may 
find it difficult to realize what relatively 
humble institutions they were 400 years ago. 
As corporations owning land, and making an 
architectural display, they were dwarfed into 
insignificance by the local monasteries. The 
Prior of Barnwell, with his grand church, 
stately buildings, numerous retinue, and 
ecclesiastical pomp, must have looked down 
from a very lordly height upon any master 
of a college of his own day. And, besides 
Barnwell, there were the three great founda- 
tions of the Friars: the Franciscans, the 
Dominicans, and the Augustinians. The 
former of these, as is well known, had such a 
magnificent church that the University made 
an earnest attempt, unfortunately in vain, to 
secure it for their own purposes after the 
Suppression. And even these great local 
foundations did not belong to the first order, 
so far as our country is concerned. We are 
apt to forget what a lofty standard must have 
been set, by the monasteries all over England, 
of the dignified display which might be 
expected in a really great corporation. 
But again. It was not only in comparison 
with the monasteries that the earlier Colleges 
took a secondary place. There can be little 
doubt that, even within the University, the 
Hostels occupied in some respects the primary 
place in public estimation. At any rate it was 
in them, rather than in the Colleges, that such  
-P-A-G-E-51
  
  PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 43 
young men of rank and wealth as then 
frequented the University were mostly to be 
found. If any difficulty is felt in realizing 
the exact significance of this state of things, 
a parallel can easily be supplied. The 
occupants of the Colleges, as compared with 
those of the Hostels, corresponded pretty 
closely, I apprehend, with the “collegers” as 
distinguished from the “oppidans” of one of 
our ancient schools. Things have greatly 
changed of late years; but older men can 
remember the time when a very distinct tone 
of social superiority was assumed by the latter 
over the former. What may be called the 
statutable precedence, consisting in being on 
the foundation, may easily be superseded by 
the social precedence arising out of rank and 
wealth. 
Suppose then that we were to pay a visit 
to one of our ancient Colleges, what should 
we find? In the first place, it may be 
remarked that some search would probably 
be required before the College was discovered. 
Even within the memory of living men it 
would have been almost possible for anyone 
to walk from where the Fitzwilliam stands to 
St. Sepulchre’s Church, without catching sight 
of any College at all, except Pembroke. There 
was once a high wall in front of Peterhouse. 
Corpus was accessible or visible only by a passage 
past St. Bene’t’s Church. What is now King’s 
Parade was a narrow street of lofty old houses, 
from the top stories of which, it used to be 
said, people might almost have shaken hands.
-P-A-G-E-52
    44 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
High walls in front of Trinity and St. John’s 
hid most of their buildings except the gate- 
ways. And in earlier times the Colleges were 
even more closely packed away behind the 
houses of the town. Suppose yourself standing 
in front of St. Mary’s with your back to the 
church, and try to picture the scene that 
would meet the eye. In front, and to right 
and left, extends uninterruptedly a row of 
dwellings, of which perhaps a still existent old 
building here and there, such as Buol’s present 
restaurant, or the Oriental Café, might be a 
favourable specimen. Over the chimney tops, 
possibly, a glimpse might be caught of the 
turrets of King’s Chapel, then just completed; 
but hardly any other sign of College or Uni- 
versity buildings would be detected. If you 
look at Hamond’s Map of Cambridge of 1590, 
of which a copy hangs on the staircase of the 
University Library, you will easily understand 
all this. But you must remember that this 
map displays one great improvement which was 
then quite recent. This was the so-called 
“University Street” due to the liberality of 
Archbishop Parker; a passage cleared through 
the houses in front and leading directly to the 
Public Schools. 
To get to Gonville Hall, you would go a 
little further along the main street, past where 
our Gate of Humility stands, and turn down 
Findsilver Lane—Trinity Lane as we now call 
it—which, also, was hedged in by houses on 
each side. Picking your way through the filth 
you would have to walk carefully; for the lane
-P-A-G-E-53
    
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 45 
bore a bad reputation, and was commonly called 
by a name too course to repeat. In fact at one 
time a Royal Injunction had been directed to 
the masters of Gonville Hall and Michael House, 
the two houses which faced each other there. 
It stated that such a “horror abominabilis” 
encountered the students on their way thereby 
to the Schools, owing to the state of the drains— 
open gutters presumably—that the authorities 
were to put them in order at once. “Otherwise,” 
it went on to say, in language whose vigour the 
modern sufferer from such nuisances might 
wish to see revived, “we shall provide another 
and more severe remedy for you and for them.” 
And this dirty lane was one of the principal 
thoroughfares of the town. It provided practi- 
cally the only access to the Schools and Library; 
to King’s College, Clare, Trinity Hall, Gonville 
and Michael House, as well as to several of the 
larger hostels. 
Half way down this lane you would come 
upon a couple of ancient buildings to the left, 
with a small gateway between them. This was 
the whole of the show which our College had to 
make outside. These old buildings were already 
somewhat decayed, for they represented the 
nucleus of the original College. They were the 
houses bought by Gonville’s executor when the 
foundation was placed on its present site in 
1858. Entering by the small gateway, the only 
means of access, we should find ourselves in the 
present Gonville Court, which then constituted 
the entire College. Any modern occupant would 
recognise it. In front, as you enter, stands the
-P-A-G-E-54
    46 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Chapel; essentially the present building, though 
its red brick surface was not faced with masonry 
as now. To the right of this stands the Master’s 
chamber. This latter occupied the site of the 
present passage-way between the first two 
courts, and also included the entrance porch of 
the present Lodge. To the right stand the 
Library and Hall. Here, again, the ancient 
erection of brick and clunch is mostly still 
standing, though concealed by its eighteenth 
century coating of ashlar. The square windows 
which now replace the ancient narrow lights, 
give it of course a very modern look. To the 
left is a block of students’ chambers, of which 
however no trace is left in the existing edifice. 
These were the buildingserected by the liberality 
of Lady Elizabeth Clere, and at the time in 
question they were quite new. Like nearly all 
else in the Court, these buildings would be 
constructed with the old red brick, mixed 
perhaps with the common clunch. Stone, as 
you know, was a very rare material in Cambridge. 
The so-called “ Stone-house,” the nucleus of the 
original College, was quite an exception; it 
acquired its name because its materials were 
unusual. It was probably somewhat in the 
style of the well-known “ Pythagoras Hall,” the 
ancient Norman house at the back of St. John’s 
College. 
So much for the material fabric. What is 
there to be said about the personal element? 
The Master at the time was Dr. Buckenham, 
a man of some mark and influence in the 
University. As Vice-Chancellor he was active
-P-A-G-E-55
    
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 47 
and efficient. He compiled a list of charters and 
other documents, known at the Registry as the 
“Old Black Book.” He also took part in an 
important arbitration between the University 
and the Prior of Barnwell. That he was a man 
of personal influence may be concluded from 
the variety of gifts and bequests which accrued 
to the College during his time. The east side of 
the Court, as I have just said, was completed. 
The Elie Almshouses, still connected with the 
College, came into our patronage about the 
same time. In fact Buckenham seems to have 
been one of those very useful men who, though 
not themselves rich, seem to possess the knack 
of securing a good deal of help from those who 
are rich. One wealthy Norwich merchant gave 
us the chantry of St. Michael’s Coslany. Another 
presented a bell for the Chapel: it was after- 
wards exchanged as being too big, but I have 
no doubt that our monkish residents, when 
they heard its tinkle, must have smiled in pity 
as they thought of their own numerous and 
deep-toned bells. The quaintest of these gifts 
deserves closer description. It came from one 
of the well-known Lestrange family of Norfolk 
and consisted of “seven score ewes and three 
score lambs,” “to be delyvered to the sayde 
master and felowes at midsomer.” The College 
in return—we have the deed in our Treasury— 
binds itself, under its common seal, to pray for 
the soul of John Lestrange himself as well as 
for those of “his wyffe, his fathere and mothere, 
his both brothers, his father yn lawe Thomas 
Lestrange esquyer, and for the soul of all his
-P-A-G-E-56
  
  48 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
benefactors and all good Crysten soules.” Dr. 
Caius tells us that the sheep were sold—very 
naturally, as we had no convenient land on 
which to pasture them. 
Several of the fellows and scholars of the 
time were also men of either mark or promise. 
In fact, if we take into account not actual, but 
proportional, numbers, it may be doubted if the 
College has ever more completely fulfilled the 
ideal, entertained by the various founders. (The 
principal members here referred to are recorded 
in the previous essay.) 
Now whatever views may be entertained as 
to the primary duty of encouraging scientific 
research and scholarship, and carrying on the 
instruction of the young, there can be little 
doubt as to what was the intention of most of 
our original founders. Rightly or wrongly, 
what they desired was that the recipient of 
their bounty should lay a solid foundation by 
study here, and then go out into the world for 
the service of the Church and State. If we 
compare what was thus achieved by the men of 
1520 with the corresponding performances of 
their successors from two to three centuries 
afterwards, the contrast presented is not so 
entirely in favour of the later date as those who 
represent it might wish to believe. 
But what have we to say, it may be asked, 
about those who were not members of the 
foundation: about “the ordinary students,” in 
the language of the present day. They certainly 
did come into residence, though not in large 
numbers: to what classes of society did they
-P-A-G-E-57
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 49 
belong? In the case of most of our Colleges it 
is impossible to ascertain anything definite on 
this point. There was no system of matri- 
culation till long afterwards, and anything in 
the way of College Admission Registers was 
then quite unknown. Our own register,—due 
to the foresight of Dr. Caius,—does not begin 
till 1560. When students from the outside did 
come into residence in a college they seem just 
to have settled their accounts with the steward, 
or in later days with their tutor, by some 
private arrangement. No reference to their 
presence is made in the regular College 
accounts. 
Fortunately for us, as it so happens, our 
own College books supply an exception to this 
almost universal blank. For a number of years, 
especially towards the beginning of the six- 
teenth century, a list of names is given at 
the end of each half-year’s accounts, headed 
Pensionarii: that is, it comprises the men who 
paid for their board and lodging. It is merely a 
list of surnames, as it stands, and needs a good 
deal of interpretation; but by reference to the 
University Grace books, and various other 
sources of information, we can recover a num- 
ber of facts about the majority of those who are 
thus recorded. So far as I know, this inlet into 
the past history of University life is almost 
unique. ¥ 
It will perhaps surprise you to know that the 
most important constituent, numerically, con- 
sisted of monks. College life was, of course, a 
mere episode, and a brief one, in their career; 
E
-P-A-G-E-58
50 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
and careful precautions were taken to prevent 
the comparatively secular life in the University 
from alienating their thoughts from their life- 
long service. As I have elsewhere given a 
detailed account of this element in College life 
—(see the following essay)—no more need be 
said on this head, beyond the fact that these 
visitors formed a decided majority of the 
occasional students. Those at Gonville Hall 
came mostly from the Benedictine Monastery 
at Norwich; from the splendid Cluniac Priory 
at Lewes; and from the House of the Augustin- 
ian Canons at Westacre in Norfolk. 
The next constituent element consisted of 
parochial clergy. This, again, may cause sur- 
prise, for to most people it will seem rather an 
inversion of the natural course of things that 
men should come to College after, instead of 
before, their ordination. But we must remem- 
ber that in those days an extremely small 
proportion of the parochial clergy, especially in 
the rural districts, were University graduates. 
It was not until after the Reformation that the 
helps to poor students, in the shape of ‘bible- 
clerkships’—scholarships as we now call them 
—sizarships and so forth, came to be generally 
introduced. In Gonville Hall, for instance, in 
1520, there were only three scholarships in 
existence, and all these were then of quite 
recent introduction. 
From a very early date a certain number of 
the beneficed clergy had come to feel a wish for 
study in College, for a degree, and for whatever 
professional advancement might follow from a 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 51 
degree. They consequently applied to their 
bishop for permission to leave their cure for two 
or three years in order to study at Cambridge 
or Oxford. Anyone who consults the Bishops’ 
registers and Act Books will find there a 
number of such licences for non-residence for 
the avowed purpose of study. Sometimes these 
parish priests appealed to the Pope; for similar 
permissions are to be found among the Papal 
Letters, of which several volumes have been 
published. I will give a single instance, of 
early date, as it is one of special interest to us. 
In October 1405, a papal dispensation was 
granted to Thomas Aylward, vicar of Havant in 
Hants., allowing him to let the fruits of his 
benefice for five years, whilst studying at a 
University. Now it was this Thomas Aylward, 
as Caius tells us in his Annals, who founded 
what was called a “chest,”—that is, a small 
lending bank—for poor students at Gonville 
| Hall. Such benefactions were not uncommon 
in those times. We have no documentary 
evidence as to where he went for his studies, 
but I should think there can be little doubt 
that it was in Gonville Hall that Aylward came 
to reside, and that his keen realisation of the 
difficulties and hardships of the poorer students 
had prompted him to show his gratitude in 
this substantial way. 
As the Reformation drew near, this class of 
residents became somewhat more numerous, 
and a fair proportion of them are to be found 
amongst our pensioners. Some of these belong 
to the same class as Aylward; that is, they 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
were comparatively wealthy or well-born. For 
instance, one or two members of the De La 
Pole family, sons of the Duke of Suffolk, were 
pensioners at this time. Humphrey Pole, in 
fact, found life so pleasant here that he stayed 
on apparently for some 15 years, though he 
held preferment elsewhere. So, seemingly, did 
William Boleyn, an uncle of the unfortunate 
Queen of Henry VIII, for we find him in 
residence here for many years after his M.A. 
degree. These men rented good chambers, and 
evidently made themselves thoroughly com- 
fortable during their College life. 
But besides these rich and well-connected 
priests, there were not a few from the ranks of 
the ordinary parochial clergy. Their appear- 
ance in the University at this period was 
doubtless closely connected, partly as cause, 
partly as effect, with the religious upheaval 
of the Reformation. No district could be so 
remote but what the leaven of the Reformation 
was beginning to work in it. There must have 
been many country parishes where the parson 
was anxious to learn something about the new 
views. A typical illustration of this class is 
afforded by Thomas Patmore, rector of Much 
Hadham, Herts., who resided in the College for 
some two years about this time. Foxe, in his 
Book of Martyrs, has something to say about 
him, as he was deprived of his living for his 
opinions, and imprisoned for two years in the 
Lollards’ Tower at Lambeth. Side by side with 
him might have been seen Sygar Nicholson, 
well-known as the University printer, and also
-P-A-G-E-61
  PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 53 
as a sufferer for his religious opinions. As 
Latimer indignantly remarked, some years 
later, when addressing one of the persecutors: 
“Do you not hold Nicholson, Smyth—(this was 
Simon Smith, a fellow ‘of Gonville Hall)— 
Patmore, with many others, in prison at this 
hour ?” 
Besides the clergy, regular and secular, a few 
others would also be found who belonged to 
a class of society more commonly found in 
College to-day. That is, there would be some 
whose parents were in easy circumstances or 
who belonged to the professional classes. Asa 
rule such men were rather rare visitors in the 
Colleges, but their names are now and then to 
be found on our lists. Thus, there can be little 
doubt that the “Her,” who is entered amongst 
the pensioners of 1509, may be identified with 
the Nicholas Hare, afterwards M.P. for Norfolk, 
Speaker of the House of Commons, and Master 
of the Rolls. And we know that a few years 
later, Thomas Gresham, the famous merchant 
and founder of the Royal Exchange, was 
similarly a resident. For a long time this fact 
only rested on the testimony of his friend and 
contemporary, John Caius, but we have since 
found the name recorded as a pensioner in the 
bursar’s accounts. 
It is a strange picture that thus rises up 
before us when we try to realise what was the 
state of the society in College at the time. 
They must have met together every day, 
especially in Hall and in Chapel. Fancy an 
assembly, of some 25 or 80 men altogether,
-P-A-G-E-62
    54 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
gathered round the table at meal times ; in that 
same building which we have just recently 
restored as an annexe to the Library. It was 
a critical period, when religious passions were 
strongly excited, and when the merest utter- 
ance of a wrong opinion might at any moment 
lead to imprisonment if not to death. One of 
the charges against Patmore, whom I have just 
mentioned, was that, when at Cambridge he 
had once declared that “he did not set a bottle 
of hay by the Pope’s curse.” One cannot but 
wonder whether this remark was a retort 
hurled across the table at one or other of the 
monks who were sitting there with him. In 
after life these old College pensioners must 
have sometimes met again: perhaps on opposite 
sides, or after wide changes of opinion. Peter 
Valentius, for instance, was a resident in 1521. 
He had already distinguished himself by his 
reforming zeal, and by a bold attack on 
the Proclamation of Indulgences. After the 
example of Luther, he posted a defiant notice on 
the copy affixed against the gate of the Schools 
at Cambridge. Foxe records a visit Valentius 
paid to two of the Marian martyrs, shortly 
before their death. Of the members of the 
Commission who condemned these men two 
bear names known in the College, and may well 
have been personally familiar to Valentius. 
These were Shaxton, who had been a resident 
fellow in 1520, and Robert Steward. Steward 
resided as a pensioner for several years about 
the same time. He was subsequently Prior of 
the Monastery at Ely, and after the Suppression
-P-A-G-E-63
    
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 55 
became the first dean of the Cathedral. Thomas 
Bacon, a fellow in 1521, and afterwards Master 
of the College, was also present at the death of 
these two martyrs. 
‘As to the daily life of these ancient residents, 
it need hardly be said that this would seem 
terribly monotonous and severe to modern 
apprehension. The Chapel service was at 5 a.m. 
in Dr. Caius’ time, and we may be quite sure 
that it was not later than this a generation 
before. Every resident, of course, had to 
attend; Bishop Bateman, in his statutes, had 
laid down stringent regulations on this point. 
It may be remarked that the importance of the 
College Chapel, in the daily routine of life, had 
been gradually increased. At the outset, the 
building was only to be used as an “oratory,” 
for family prayers, as we should now say. For 
daily attendance at mass, and for all the more 
solemn ceremonies, the students had to attend 
at the parish church, St. Michael’s. By a suc- 
cession of Papal and Episcopal concessions, the 
privileges of the College had been gradually 
extended. The last of these was a bull of 
Alexander VI., which granted permission to the 
Master and Fellows to reserve the Sacrament, 
and to bury their dead within our walls. This 
was in 1500, and, as far as we know, advantage 
seems speedily to have been taken of the last 
permission. The brass still remains which 
records the burial of Walter Stubbe, brother of 
a Master of the College, in 1514. There is, as 
you know, another brass, of much the same 
date, to some unknown man in plate armour.

  56 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
The coats of arms, which would have served to 
identify him, have unfortunately disappeared ; 
so we are unable to say whether he was one of 
our pensioners. But it is hardly likely that any 
one would be buried there who was not at the 
time a resident in College. 
Though the number of attendants at 
worship was not large, the services were 
probably—in accordance with pre-Reformation 
practice—of a somewhat ornate kind, at least 
on the greater festivals. The College possessed 
many vestments and other ornaments. In fact 
Dr. Caius tells us that, in his day, “the precious 
vestments of white linen embroidered with 
gold,” which were amongst the original gifts of 
Bishop Bateman, were actually still in use on 
the more solemn festivals of the Virgin. If any 
of you had the opportunity of visiting the loan 
collection at the Church Congress at Cambridge, 
you can judge how elaborate and splendid such 
things could be in medieval days. 
As to the vessels, or the most part of them, 
we know the subsequent fate. When the per- 
missible ornaments were restricted by law, Dr. 
Caius seems to have saved as many of the old 
ones as he could, and to have preserved them in 
his chambers. These were routed out by the 
Fellows shortly before his death, and destroyed, 
with much glee, in a bonfire in the court. The 
Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Byng, reports the trans- 
action to the Chancellor, with evident satis- 
faction, and described the destruction of what 
he calls the “Popish Trumpery.” The list 
included “vestments, albs, tunicles, stoles,
-P-A-G-E-65
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 57 
manicles, corporos clothes, with the pix and 
sindon, and canopy, besides holy water stoups, 
with sprinkles, pax, sensars, superalteries, 
tables of idolls, masse books, portuises and 
grailles, with other such stuffe as might have 
furnished divers massers at one instant” :—a 
small Art collection in itself. They burnt what 
they could and smashed up the rest. So the 
new treated the old! 
It need hardly be said that a small society, 
consisting of such elements as I have described 
above, was necessarily of a somewhat studious 
and quiet character. Much of their time was 
probably spent in the College Library. In fact 
the opportunity of using the library would be 
one of the main inducements to a residence in 
College. In days when students were mostly 
very poor, and books were mostly very scarce 
and dear; and when moreover the student had 
to go to the books, instead of expecting the books 
to come to him, the help afforded by a good 
library would be invaluable. The bulk of the 
volumes would of course still be in MS., and it 
need hardly be said that they were all carefully 
chained to their shelves. 
That ancient library, as most of you know, 
still exists, having been recently restored and 
converted into a second Combination room. 
The walls are in large part the ancient walls, 
and the roof contains the ancient timber beams. 
The windows on the inner side were walled in 
long ago, and those looking towards the court 
were enlarged. The glass which once adorned 
them had been the gift of, and still recalled the
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
names of, some famous old scholars ‘and prelates. 
Amongst these was William Lyndwood, Bishop 
of St. David’s, a notable writer on the Canon 
Law. Not a little of his work had probably been 
done there, before those shelves, in the days 
when he was a student here. Our library, 
thanks partly to Bateman, was rather strong 
in that department. 
One would like to have a true picture of that 
library as it once was :—to try to recognize some 
of the few students who might have been found 
there, say on some dull day in winter, in the 
dimly lighted building—it was of course entirely 
unwarmed—as with numbed fingers they 
handled the iron chains which secured the 
precious volumes. They are probably working 
up some question which has to be keenly 
discussed at the next “opposition” or “reponsion” 
in the Schools, when they stand for the Civil or 
Canon Law degree. Or they may be preparing 
for their next sermon ad clerwm in St. Mary’s 
or ad populum at St. Paul’s Cross, if Theology 
be their faculty. It may be remarked that, so 
far as the College was concerned, all their work 
had to be done by themselves, as there were no 
lecturers or tutors in existence yet. They 
occupied very much the same position, in fact, 
as those whom we now term “Advanced or 
Research” students:—(no enquirer into the 
past will be surprised at finding that some 
vaunted modern improvement is really little 
more than a re-introduction of customs familiar 
centuries ago). They already knew something of 
their subject; and were attracted, partly by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 59 
society of learned men, but mainly by the local 
advantages for study. Their actual work had to 
be carried on mostly on their own initiative, 
and, of course, the Library corresponded some- 
what to the modern Laboratory. 
If we were to follow them into the Dining 
Hall we should again find the life simple and 
severe. Here, also, recent and successful restora- 
tion will enable you to some extent to recall the 
past; for the ancient Hall has just been put 
back, as nearly as possible, into its old form; the 
floor was of stone, covered in the usual way with 
rushes. The walls were bare, in all likelihood ; 
and, as Dr. Caius tells us, no attempt was yet 
made to warm it even in the depth of winter. 
In fact, these latter alleviations were at the 
prompting and bequest of Bishop Shaxton, 
already referred to as a Resident Fellow at the 
time. He it was, who—doubtless keenly mindful 
of what he himself had once undergone in the 
days when he was a poor bible-clerk—combined 
with one or two other generous men to provide a 
brazier to stand in the Hall. He also furnished 
a supply of charcoal for it, but this only for the 
three months from All Saints’ day to the 2nd of 
February. This was first started in 1565. It 
shows how what are now considered the barest 
necessaries for the poor were once the coveted 
luxuries of the comparatively well-to-do, that 
this gift was to be nightly celebrated by a psalm 
of thanksgiving. Those who were not present 
at this were to have no place near the fire. 
It was Shaxton, too, who bequeathed some 
“hangings,” tapestry presumably, to cover the
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
nakedness of the bare walls; and who, remember- 
ing what was the ordinary fare at table, left 
a sum of money wherewith, as he phrased it, “to 
solace the company at Christmas.” 
If we could watch this company at meal-time, 
we should probably see them all sitting together 
at one table; for the elaborate distinctions of 
fellow-commoners, pensioners, and so forth, 
were seemingly an introduction of later days. 
The Master of course was always present. 
Scarcely any food was allowed to be taken in 
College except in common at the public table. 
At the time in question the dinner hour was 
probably about 10 and the supper about 5. 
The whole assembly might perhaps number 
about 25 or 30 at most; nearly half of these, as I 
have already said, consisting of monks, whom 
we can figure dressed in the distinctive garb of 
their various Orders. The ordinary fare at table 
was very plain. A bible-clerk would be reading 
the lessons or some religious work. This was 
an office of recent introduction in our College, 
the bible-clerk being what would now be called 
a scholar. By Bateman’s statutes silence was 
commanded at table; a Fellow was to read the 
scriptures; and when there was any talk in the 
College it was always to be in Latin. To the 
professional student, especially if, as was not 
unfrequently the case, he had studied at foreign 
Universities, this last condition would be no 
burden. Hrasmus, I suppose, was just as glib in 
Latin as in his native Dutch. But we can 
hardly suppose that the country clergyman or 
the miscellaneous “pensioner” found such a
-P-A-G-E-69
  
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 61 
regulation easy of acceptance. It does not need 
much knowledge of human nature to guess that 
the practical result was very much what it was 
in girls’ schools of a generation or two ago, when 
the pupils were forbidden to speak to each other 
in any language but French. Such waiting as 
was required was presumably performed by poor 
students, who afterwards sat down at the table 
and finished what was left. This was certainly 
so a little later, when they were called sizars. 
But had these men any “amusements”? I 
am afraid that, in the current sense of the term, 
they had to go without them. Of course no 
gathering of Englishmen, which included young 
men of family and wealth, could fail to furnish 
those who wanted to indulge in the amusements 
of their class; in hawking, hunting, and so forth. 
I need hardly say that Cambridge in those days 
offered magnificent opportunities for such sport, 
as indeed it continued to do for centuries 
afterwards. There was the limitless range of 
the Fens to the north; a wide extent of entirely 
unenclosed land round about the town; and all 
the open down country towards Newmarket, 
which offered such attractions to James I. a 
century later. But the few University students 
who could indulge in such pursuits would 
probably be found in a Hostel rather than in a 
College. It is a significant fact that whereas 
Caius, compiling his statutes some 80 or 40 years 
later, thought it necessary peremptorily to 
forbid every such kind of unscholarly pursuit, 
Bateman, our earlier legislator, did not think it 
needful to refer to the subject in any way.
-P-A-G-E-70
    62 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Caius, for instance, forbids the students to keep 
“fierce birds,” presumably falcons and hawks. 
This, of course, was in the Elizabethan days, 
when young men of family were beginning to 
flock to the Colleges. 
As to games, properly so called, I have spoken 
more fully elsewhere (see essay VI.). I will only 
say now that Football, at any rate, was probably 
already a popular amusement amongst the 
younger students. It certainly was so a genera- 
tion later. Here, again, we have the evidence of 
Dr. Caius’ prohibitions. He absolutely forbids 
what would be called “Inter-collegiate” play, 
and confines the game to the College precincts. 
Were they, I wonder, to kick the ball about in 
the College court? There was nowhere else, for 
they can hardly have been suffered in the 
Master’s or Fellows’ gardens. 
If we may trust the account which Caius 
himself gives of the habits of the youths of his 
own day—he “came up” in 1529—one would 
almost suppose that their sole diversion and 
main occupation was found in attendance on 
the public disputations in the Schools: that 
they spent their time in preparation for their 
own performances there, when they came to 
graduate, and in critical observation of the 
performances of their companions. If any 
relaxation from such a strenuous occupation 
was needed it was found in the amusement 
provided by the preparation for, and performance 
of, a Latin play during the Christmas holidays. 
‘When an old man lapses into the retrospective 
vein and begins to contrast the present with the
-P-A-G-E-71
PRE-REFORMATION COLLEGE LIFE 63 
past, we naturally feel inclined to take a 
certain discount off the comparative estimate 
which he offers. But after all due allowance 
has been made, there can be little doubt that 
these discussions played a really important part 
in the life of such students as we are considering. 
The inmates of a College were, as I have said, 
somewhat of a picked class. They had mostly 
come here with a view to professional advance- 
ment, and skill in academic exercises would be 
an important element in professional success. 
There was no such thing then, remember, as 
the Union or a Debating Society. If a man of 
ready wit and fluent speech wished to display 
his powers, and to win a public triumph over 
his opponents, this was his only opportunity of 
doing so. Even in the eighteenth century, when 
the Mathematical Tripos was beginning to domin- 
ate, considerable interest was still felt in the 
School disputes. A brilliant attack or defence 
probably attracted thesame sortof noticeas would 
an unusually good speech at the Union now. 
That there was also a rowdy element in the 
University even in his own day, Dr. Caius 
admits, and he has given a description of what 
in modern language would be called a “rag,” 
which occurred just before his own time. Need 
I say that he assures us that the miscreants 
came from outside, and that the members of 
his own Hall were passive victims? He has 
recorded the event in his Annals. He says that 
in 1521 one of those frequent disputes between 
the “Northern” and “Southern” factions in 
the University assumed the form of a serious
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
riot. The Gonville men mostly belonged to the 
latter side; that is, were born south of the 
Trent; but the former faction was very strong 
in Cambridge, Yorkshire men, in particular, 
being always numerous. The students at 
Gerard’s Hostel, on the other side of the 
road,—mostly northerners,—in their general 
animosity against their neighbours, and har- 
bouring special spite against Humphrey De La 
Pole, as a prominent southerner (so Caius tells 
us), made an organized attack on Gonville Hall. 
They set fire to the entrance gate, “rushed” 
the College, invaded the kitchen and buttery, 
spilt all the liquor they could find, and would— 
but for the promptitude of the butler, who hid 
the silver vessels and other articles of value in 
the College well—have plundered the place. 
It is a curious illustration of the bitterness of 
these party divisions, that we are assured that 
the assault was encouraged by the Vice- 
Chancellor, a northerner by origin, though he 
pretended to dissuade his party from any dis- 
play of violence. (‘Ad quod facinus tacito nutu 
provocabat Johannes Stachouse, ejus anni pro- 
cancellarius, homo ejusdem gentis et factionis; 
verbo tamen dissuadebat.”) William Tayte, the 
principal of Gerard’s Hostel—he had been 
proctor 20 years before—was, we are told, the 
main contriver of the outrage. According to 
Caius, Tayte came in the end to feel some 
penitence for what he had done, and shortly 
before his death gave a number of books to the 
Library. But his name still stands in the 
Annals as one of our malefactors.
-P-A-G-E-73
VI. 
MONKS IN COLLEGE. 
About the time, towards the middle fifties, 
when the country at large was beginning to 
feel a revived interest in the constitution and 
condition of the old Universities, and was 
coming to the decided conclusion that they 
stood in need of some reformation, few com- 
plaints were commoner than that which was 
directed against the so-called “monkish” 
character and position of the college Fellow. 
The resemblance was a rather superficial one, 
for the essence of the religious life lay in its 
incessant devotion, not to study, but to prayer 
. and praise; and in its perpetual enforcement 
of these duties, under the triple vow of chastity, 
poverty and obedience. It would have been a 
strange sort of monastery in which the abbot 
was generally married, and which any monk 
might quit at once, in case he should feel 
inclined to go out into the world; and where, 
moreover, each brother had at least one or two 
rooms for his own private use, and could spend 
his time just as he pleased. It is no doubt 
true that if we go some centuries back this 
contrast becomes less striking. Though there 
was not in general, strictly speaking, any vow 
of obedience to the Head on the part of the 
Fellow, it is certain that the Master possessed, 
and often exercised, a considerable amount of 
autocratic power; a power the exercise of which
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  66 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
would have startled the whole house a couple 
of centuries later. Moreover, the common, 
as distinguished from the individual life, 
was a much more prominent and permanent 
characteristic in early times. Attendance at 
the college chapel was compulsory twice daily, 
and the meals were taken in common—there 
are, for instance, stringent regulations in the 
statutes of Dr. Caius as to the amount of food 
which the fellows might have in private, in 
their own rooms. Though there was never, 
I believe, a common dormitory in colleges, it 
is well known that privacy, in the modern 
sense, was quite out of the question. Hxigencies 
of economy rendered this impossible; for neither 
space nor money could be afforded to lodge each 
man separately, even if the extreme youth of 
the scholars had made this desirable. These, 
however, were recognised characteristics of life 
in earlier days, and are very far from bringing 
us back to any form of life so minutely regu- 
lated for religious purposes as to entitle it to 
be called “monkish.” 
These remarks are intended to be pre- 
liminary to a slight sketch of the state of 
things when real monks actually did reside in 
our college buildings. That a certain number 
of them came into residence here and at Oxford, 
for the purpose of study, in the times before 
the Reformation, is well known to everyone 
acquainted with the history of the University. 
Certain colleges or halls were thus specially 
frequented by members of this or that religious 
order—thus Buckingham College, out of which
-P-A-G-E-75
  MONKS IN COLLEGE 67 
Magdalene was refounded, was mainly fre- quented by Benedictine monks; and as we shall presently see, Gonville Hall was a favourite place of resort for Augustinian canons. But, though this general fact has long been familiarly known, nearly all details have been entirely wanting. The fact is that an almost im- penetrable cloud of obscurity hangs over the social life and condition of all college students 
in early days, except those who were actually on the foundation. There was no University Matriculation—at least none is recorded—until 
1544, The earliest general College Admission 
Register—that of Gonville and Caius—does not commence until 1560. It is true that the names of those on the foundation—that is of fellows, scholars and certain college servants—can often 
be recovered from a very early date, as they are generally recorded in the bursar’s account books. But of the class which would now be called pensioners, such as form the bulk of the students of the present day, we know almost nothing whatever. Their very names are totally lost, except where, now and then, owing to their celebrity or to some other cause, their connection with some particular college or hall has been preserved. This is the case, for instance, with Sir Thomas Gresham. There is, I believe, no other evidence of his having been educated at Gonville Hall, than the remark, casually made by Dr. Caius in his Annals, that the founder of the Royal Exchange had been 
  
? Since this was first written Gresham’s name has been found in some old account books of the time.
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
one of his contemporaries here. The early 
pensioners in fact seem to have been considered 
as not strictly belonging to the college: not 
being on the foundation, they were scarcely 
taken more account of than if they had been 
“ parlour-boarders ” at some modern school, and 
their names are scarcely ever recorded. 
There are, however, a few exceptions to this 
general rule. There is a short period during 
which a ray of light is let in upon this 
constituent element of college life. In our 
earliest Compotus, or Bursar’s Book, which 
commences in 1422, and extends (unfortunately 
with many gaps) to about 1528, there are 
certain years in which, for some cause, the 
names of all the pensionarii resident in the 
college at the time are recorded. This is 
generally the case from 1509 to 1528, for in- 
stance, and it is desirable to make the most 
of the light which is thus afforded. In the 
half-year’s account, made up to Lady Day 1513, 
we have the following list :—

These, with the Master, seven Fellows and 
three scholars, make up apparently the entire 
resident body of the college at the time; so 
that, numerically, these pensioners were an 
important element in the constitution of the 
society. The youth who heads the list, De la 
Pole, as a son of the Duke of Suffolk, stands 
of course in a class by himself, and doubtless 
paid a fancy price for his lodging and board. 
He is, I think, the only one in the list who at 
all corresponds to the fellow-commoners of 
later times; to those, that is, who came here, 
as youths of family, not primarily for the 
purpose of professional study or to obtain a 
degree, but rather for such general culture as 
residence here might be hoped to encourage. 
Two or three of the remainder are Masters of 
Arts, probably staying on with a view of 
securing the higher degrees of Doctor in 
Theology, Civil or Canon Law, or Medicine. 
The rest are mainly monks; and it is to them 
that I want to call attention, as it shews how 
in a small college—and Gonville Hall was then 
one of the smallest in Cambridge—a consider- 
able number of students were sent up by their 
respective monasteries. Some, it will be seen, 
are specifically described as being monks in the 
above list; in the case of others, we find their
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  70 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
names recurring in subsequent years under 
similar designations. Mayner, for instance, 
resided for six or seven years, and is generally 
described as canonicus; 7.c. he was presumably 
an Augustinian canon from Westacre, in 
Norfolk. Brycotte belonged to the same Order. 
The above list, as it stands, may seem little 
more than a mere string of names; but it 
acquires a very different significance when we 
study it in the light of the information yielded 
by the Visitation of the Norfolk and Suffolk 
monasteries. Some of the greater houses secured 
papal exemption from all control of this kind, 
but the others were duly subject to regular 
episcopal Visitation; and the results of some of 
these Visitations have been preserved. They 
contain reports of the inspection, by the Bishop 
of Norwich, of all the religious houses in his 
diocese which were not exempt from his juris- 
diction. The earliest Visitation of those which 
are thus recorded is in 1494, the latest in 15382:— 
on the very eve of the Suppression. The reports 
are mainly made up of statements of breaches 
of discipline, for the most part of a trifling 
character, given by the priors and others in 
authority. They also contain complaints, by 
the monks, of curtailments of their privileges, 
and such other matters. 
What concerns us here, however, are the 
references which they contain to University life 
and study. In one religious house after another 
we find it noted that a monk is absent at the   
1 They were published by Dr. Jessopp for the Camden 
Society, No. XLII.  
-P-A-G-E-79
  
MONKS IN COLLEGE 7 
University, in pursuit of his studies; or if he 
could not be sent there, it is complained that 
the due provision for his support at College had 
been withheld. Many of the monasteries were 
too small or too poor to be able thus to support 
students at a distance; but such houses as the 
great Benedictine Priory at Norwich, and the 
Augustinian Priory at Westacre, seem generally 
to have had two or three at least of their younger 
members in training at Cambridge. This was 
especially the case with Westacre, a house 
which, as Dr. Jessopp tells us, was much 
favoured by the sons of the Norfolk gentry, 
and in which several of the names from the 
above list may be found. Where the monastery 
was too poor to support a student out of its 
corporate funds, he was sometimes sent at the 
expense of his own friends. Thus in Butley, in 
1514, a small house in debt at the time, we are 
told that “Thomas Orford est bonus gramma- 
tista et deditus litteris, et amici volunt exhibere* 
eum in Universitate sumptibus suis.” The 
Bishop directs that this should be done. In 
1526 their income had improved, and the Bishop 
gave orders “quod exhibeatur scholaris in 
Universitate sumptibus domus.” At Norwich, 
in 1582, three or four of the monks complain, 
“quod scholares non exhibentur more solito:”— 
“conqueritur de scholaribus non exhibitis more 
solito in Universitate.” At Westacre in 1520 
  
1“ Eehibere”’ was the technical term for supporting a 
scholar at the University: exhibitio being the name for 
the stipend. The popular distinction between a scholarship 
and an exhibition was of much later date.
-P-A-G-E-80
    
72 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
the number of the resident canons is short, 
“quia tres in Universitate,” and so on. 
But to come to details in respect of some 
of the men in our list above. In the visitation 
of Westacre in 1520, Magister Mayner, Canon 
of the Priory, is described as “idoneus preceptor 
pro confratribus.” He had then just returned 
from college, where he seems to have spent 
about seven years in study, and to have finally 
graduated as Bachelor in Divinity. His name 
recurs at the same Priory in 1526. Thomas 
Brycotte, or Byrkhed, who appears as a 
pensioner in our books from 1514 to 1523, 
where he is generally described as canonicus, 
states at the Visitation of 1520 that “propter 
ejus absentiam in studio, non novit statum 
domus:” he had only recently returned from 
college. “Belham” is, I apprehend, the same 
as Robert Bekham, who appears with Mayner 
in the Visitation of Westacre in 1514, when he 
complains of his exhibition being insufficiently 
paid: “ipse deponens studiens Cantabrigie 
percepisset pro uno anno viii Marcas pro victu 
et vestitu suis, et quod recepit nisi xls.” William 
Reppes, or Rugg, whose name is on our list, is a 
man of some note, as he afterwards became 
Bishop of Norwich. He was a Benedictine of 
Norwich Priory, and is mentioned in each of 
the Visitations of 1514, 1520 and 1526. In 1514 
he was sacristan and was selected to preach 
the sermon on the occasion of the Bishop’s 
visit. In 1520 he is described as prior of the 
cell, or dependent house, at Yarmouth. In 
1526 he was sub-prior at Norwich, on which
-P-A-G-E-81
  MONKS IN COLLEGE 3 
occasion a scandal is charged against him by 
one of his brethren. He- became Bishop of 
Norwich in 1536. 
It will be noticed that the residence of 
monks from Lewes Priory, in Sussex, is recorded 
above ; and this is repeated in several following 
years. At first sight this seem a departure from 
the otherwise almost uniformly Hast Anglian 
character of the college; but it is probable that 
county connections and associations had, as 
usual, something to do with the presence of 
these visitors. The great priory of St. Pancras 
at Lewes was a considerable landowner in 
Norfolk; and, as a matter of fact, the college 
still holds lands in that county which were 
purchased from the monks in the fourteenth 
century. So little is known however of the 
occupants of the monastery at this particular 
time that we have no means of identifying 
the individuals referred to in our list. In the 
years 1521-3 the Bursar’s accounts include, 
amongst the pensioners, the Prior of Horton. 
There can scarcely be any doubt that this is 
Horton in Kent, which was a dependency of 
Lewes. If so, the person in question was 
probably Richard Gloucester, alias Brisley, the 
last Prior of the house, who surrendered it to 
Henry VIII. a few years later. 
If it be asked what were the reasons which 
induced these monks to come to college, the 
reply must be that the attractions were very 
much the same as those which have brought 
most other students here during the centuries 
which have elapsed since then. Here and there
-P-A-G-E-82
  4 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
the dominant motive may have been sheer love 
of speculative study, but the bulk of students 
were doubtless attracted by hopes of profes- 
sional advancement. Then, as 400 years later, 
an academic degree had a market value. Even 
the inferior degrees, and the training which led 
up to them, served to qualify the young monk, 
on his return to his house, to act as a teacher 
of the novices, and thus to better his position. 
We are told of Mayner, after he had left college, 
that he was “idoneus preceptor pro confrat- 
ribus”; and similar reports are given of others. 
The superior degrees were still more important 
for advancement in the Church. The Doctor of 
Divinity, and, even more, he who had devoted 
himself to the Canon or Civil Law, had openings 
before him in the business of the State at home, 
and in political missions abroad, which made it 
amply worth his while, on merely professional 
grounds, to devote himself to the requisite years 
of study. It is often forgotten what a large 
amount of important work must often have 
been thrown upon the abbots and priors of the 
greater Monasteries. At home there were privi- 
leges to be secured or regained, and attacks to 
be warded off, which must have involved them 
in transactions with the Bishop, the Archbishop 
or the Courts at Westminster. Then, too, there 
were frequent appeals to Rome which had to be 
personally looked after. And from time to time 
the newly chosen prior had himself to go to 
headquarters in order to make his election 
good. For all these purposes some knowledge 
of the Canon and Civil Law must have been
-P-A-G-E-83
  MONKS IN COLLEGE 5 
essential. Bishop Bateman, when he founded 
Trinity Hall, knew enough of the courts at 
Rome and Avignon to be aware of this. His 
object was to secure that some of the secular 
clergy, as well as the regulars, should be versed 
in this essential science. Probably, too, the 
academic degree, with the comparatively wider 
training and knowledge of the world which it 
involved, counted for something in the selection 
of an abbot or prior. It is certainly a fact that 
a very considerable number of the heads of 
religious houses at the time of the Suppression 
were graduates of Cambridge or Oxford. Besides 
one or two of those referred to above, we may 
mention Steward, the last prior of the house of 
Ely, and the first dean there after the Suppres- 
sion, who was a member of our college. With 
more knowledge we could probably identify 
others also. 
It may be remarked, in passing, that the 
cause which since the Reformation has been, 
numerically speaking, far the most influential 
in supplying our colleges with students—the 
fact that an academic degree has generally been 
required by the bishops as a qualification for 
ordination—was quite inoperative in earlier 
times. A University training must have been 
the privilege of a very few comparatively of the 
parish priests, and was in no sense a requisite 
for ordination. A study of such lists of ordina- 
tion as can be found in most of the bishops’ 
registers in pre-Reformation times, shews us 
that the great majority ‘of those who entered 
the priesthood, or received the minor orders,
-P-A-G-E-84
    
76 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
came direct from the religious houses. Speak- 
ing roughly, it is doubtful if one in ten of those 
who received Orders from the Bishop of Ely 
came from any college in Cambridge: they were 
nearly all furnished by the various monasteries 
in the diocese and neighbourhood. 
Besides inducements of professional advance- 
ment, it seems clear that other motives, not 
altogether unknown in later times, had some 
influence in attracting the young monk to 
college. Rigid, monotonous and almost servile, 
as the modern student would probably find the 
conditions of his predecessors 400 years ago, the 
college life must still have been a welcome 
change of experience to any thoughtful youth 
from the cloister. We may well suppose, too, 
that there was something flattering to their 
sense of self-importance in the knowledge that 
they had been selected from their brethren in 
order to be sent up to the great University. 
Evidently the young men did not think lightly 
of themselves. For one thing, they probably 
insisted on riding to Cambridge instead of going 
on foot. Certainly, at some monasteries, candi- 
dates for Orders considered it beneath their 
dignity to tramp it to Norwich for that purpose. 
Thus at Butley—by no means an ‘important 
monastery—two of the monks make this a 
definite subject of complaint: “Confratres 
transeunt pedestres pro ordinibus recipiendis, 
in scandalum domus”—“solent exire pedites et 
non equitare.” This was one of the houses 
which regularly sent students to the Univer- 
sity; for many years they had a comfortable
-P-A-G-E-85
  
MONKS IN COLLEGE 77 
room (honesta camera) reserved for them at 
Gonville Hall. For the credit of the house, too, 
it was doubtless insisted that their dress and 
appointments should be quite up to the mark. 
Some amusing indications of this feeling 
may be detected in certain complaints from 
several of the brethren at Norwich Priory in 
1582. They declare, of two of their number, 
Norwych and Morton—the former of these, by 
the way, had been a student at Gonville Hall— 
that their heads had been quite turned by 
being sent to college: “Dedignantur ceteros 
confratres, sunt inflati spiritu alti cordis, et 
indebitantur in Universitate.” So, again, at 
the Benedictine house of Hulme in Norfolk, in 
1514, Roger Multon is complained of “quod est 
inceptor brigarum, et fuit in Cantabrigia per 
septem annos, et nihil boni fecit.” “He did no 
good there”: “he got into debt.” There is 
something strangely modern in the tone of 
these complaints. One seems to have heard 
them, from time to time, in the vernacular 
tongue, from this or that disappointed parent. 
Evidently the young man fresh from the 
University did not treat his seniors with the 
respect to which they considered that their age 
entitled them; but there were probably much 
deeper causes than this to account for the 
discord. The leaven of the Reformation was at 
work in Cambridge, and nowhere was the effect 
more distinctly traceable at this time than in 
our own College. It was of Gonville Hall that 
Bishop Nix, of Norwich—the same who con- 
ducted the Visitations in question—asserted (see
-P-A-G-E-86
    78 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Essay IV.) that “no clerk came from the college 
but savoured of the frying pan, spake he never 
so holily.” This distinctive religious character 
was only applicable during a short time, but 
the young monk who came into residence here 
during the period with which we have been 
concerned would have been thrown into social 
intercourse with such men as Shaxton, Skipp, 
Crome and Nycholson. The three former were 
fellows of the college, and the latter a pensioner 
about this time. Bearing this fact in mind we 
may accept with some so the charges 
of conceit and insubordination. It is scarcely 
likely that the young monk who returned to 
some remote monastery, after several years 
spent in the society of these men, should fail to 
find serious causes of difference with those of 
his brethren who had stayed behind. 
With the suppression of the monasteries this 
state of things passed away, and we can well 
suppose that the sudden stoppage of what must 
have been in the aggregate a very considerable 
source of supply to the Universities should have 
been seriously felt. On the old system the 
promising students were selected by their own 
houses, and supported in college at the cor- 
porate expense. As the author of the interesting 
account’ of Durham Priory says, “If the master 
did see that any of them (the novices) were apt 
to learning, and did apply his book, and had a 
pregnant wit withal, then the master did let

the prior have intelligence. Then, straightway 
after, he was sent to Oxford to school, and there 
did learn to study Divinity.” The scholarships 
and sizarships which began to multiply rapidly 
soon after the Reformation, and which only 
existed previously in very small numbers, were 
in great part called for in order to supply the 
want created by the destruction of the religious 
houses.

  VII. 
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE IN 
ENGLISH HISTORY. 
Much light has recently been thrown upon 
that eddy in the current of religious thought 
which is sometimes called the Counter-Reforma- 
tion, and which was so prominent during the 
middle and later years of the reign of Elizabeth. 
The work of Dr. Jessopp, at once learned and 
deeply interesting, gives, under the title of “One 
generation of a Norfolk House,” a quantity of 
general historic information, beyond the details 
concerning the Walpole family. It is to this 
work, and to the seven bulky volumes of Mr. 
Foley, which deal with the lives of the earlier 
English Jesuits, that I was mainly indebted 
for my first reference to many of the names 
which follow. The facts however are largely 
drawn from our College records or from un- 
published MS. authority, and ought therefore 
to have a certain value of their own. What is 
attempted in the following pages is nothing 
but a “large scale map” of a very small portion 
of the province of general English History. 
They are intended to illustrate the Roman 
Catholic revival solely as this is displayed in 
a single College during a few years of Queen 
Elizabeth’s reign. 
In order to understand the significance of 
the details which follow, attention must be
-P-A-G-E-89
  
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 81 
directed first to a few of the national landmarks of the age and reign. Queen Elizabeth came to the throne November 17th, 1558, and the Romish ritual almost immediately became illegal in England. But, for the first twelve years or so after this date, there was little that could in any reasonable sense be called persecution. In November, 1569, occurred the Northern rebellion, and a few months after- wards the famous Bull was issued in which Queen Elizabeth was formally deposed by the Pope. This marked a crisis; for the English Government replied by an Act of Parliament which not only made it treason to introduce into the realm any Bull from Rome, but attached the same penalties to any exercise of his functions by a priest ordained abroad. As Dr. Jessopp puts it, “any Catholic priest admitted to his Orders on the other side of the Channel, and venturing to exercise his functions in England, did so at the peril of his life; and whosoever dared to receive absolu- tion at his hands incurred the same penalty, with forfeiture of all his worldly goods besides.” Doubtless it was maintained that what the priest was punished for was his inferred treason and not his avowed religion, but the fact remains that the former was simply inferred from the latter. The mere fact of his appear- ance in the country rendered him liable to be drawn, hanged and quartered, and brought a similar liability upon those who harboured him, As regards the corresponding College dates, Dr. Caius died in July, 1578, and was succeeded 
G

82 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
by Dr. Legge, who remained Master for more 
than thirty years. It was these two men who 
are primarily responsible for the character 
of “Papistry” which for a time the College 
seems to have enjoyed. The charter of founda- 
tion, by which Caius was appointed Master, 
was obtained in Queen Mary’s reign, when of 
course he must have accepted the Romish 
doctrine, in which he had been brought up. 
He was not in any way disturbed, like so many 
of his colleagues, at the turn of the wheel which 
go speedily followed ; but he probably owed his 
immunity rather to his scientific reputation, 
and his signal services to the cause of learning 
by his recent foundation, than to any sympathy 
on his own part with the reformed faith. He | 
conformed, of course, to the established ritual, 
but the constantly repeated charges against 
him are some evidence of the direction in which 
his inner sympathies lay. Dr. Legge, we must 
remember, was expressly selected by his pre- 
decessor, a fact which in itself would imply 
some community of belief and feeling, even if 
we had not the direct testimony of Dr. Sandys, 
Archbishop of York, to the fact. The Arch- 
bishop, in an often-quoted letter to Lord 
Burleigh, complains that all the popish gentry 
of Yorkshire were sending their sons to this 
College, in consequence of the notorious sym- 
pathies of its Master and President. 
Those who are familiar only with the 
existent state of things may be prompted to 
enquire what could be the influence or power 
of the Master over the opinions of the students ?  
-P-A-G-E-91
  AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 83 
The reply is that this influence could be con- siderable, especially at that time. For one thing the Master had the practical, if not legal, appointment of every tutor; and, after the tutor was appointed, he could assign pupils to him at his choice. The doings of Dr. Caius in this way show that his power was pretty nearly arbitrary and supreme, and the Arch- bishop of York’s complaint against his successor, Dr. Legge, tells the same tale: “He setteth sundry of them (the sons of the Catholic gentry) over to one Swayl of the same house,” in order to keep them under special infiuence. Then again the students, especially the Fellow Com- moners—and it was to this order that the sons of these country gentry largely belonged—came 
up at a very early and impressionable age. They lived with their tutor by day and by night, so that instead of modifying their con- victions by free intercourse with the various companions whom they met at study and at play, they were mostly under the pressure of one persistent influence. To which we may add that for students from the remoter parts of the country there were but very few vacations, so far as regards absence from College, so that such influence as the tutor could exert would be nearly unbroken. 
The College at this time, like the country at large, was rent with religious disputes between 
the two parties which may be described, after their extreme members, as Puritan and Papist. 
It is owing to the existence of these disputes, 
in fact, that much of the information here
-P-A-G-E-92
    84 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
given, is obtainable; for the former party 
persisted in making one complaint and appeal 
to the Visitor after another, against their 
adversaries, not a few of which complaints 
are still to be found in the MSS. at the Record 
Office and British Museum. The Puritan party 
amongst the Fellows was much the most 
numerous, in spite of the Master’s influence ; 
for no less than seven of the Resident Fellows 
at this time (1582) signed a series of protests 
from which the following extracts are taken 
almost at random (Lansdowne MSS. No. 
xxxiii.):— 
“That St. Quintin (Anselm, son of Gabriel 
St. Quintin, Esq., of Harpham, Yorks.), Mr. 
Swale’s pupil, did openly call Mr. Nowell dean 
of St. Paul’s a heretic.” 
“That Dr. Legge had by his importunate 
labour brought in one Depup to be Fellow; a 
man notoriously vicious and suspected to be 
popish, to whom the founder had so great 
misliking that he gave especial charge that he 
should never be Fellow.” 
“That one Osburne (Edward Osburne, men- 
tioned presently) being convicted of Papistry, 
the Master did not expulse him.” 
“ Bive of the Scholars, Mr. Rokewood, Sayer, 
Flack, Foster, and Barwick, gathered them- 
selves together to consult whether it were law- 
ful for them to dissemble any longer.” (We 
shall see the results of such consultations in 
the subsequent history of some of these men.) 
These statements are supported by a mass 
of depositions from the Fellows individually.
-P-A-G-E-93
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 85 
Thus Mr. John Paman, under date of June 7, 
1582, testifies: “that St. Quintin was called 
before the Master by him and the words being 
confessed the Master promised due punishment 
for them, . ... yet this deponent could never 
yet hear so much as any private correction to 
be taken for the same.” Then comes a com- 
plaint against a youth Fingley, of whom more 
will be said presently, who was suspected to be 
one of the seminary priests hovering about the 
place; “he perverted the youth of the house. . . 
he absented himself from common prayers and 
sermons in such wise as he could not be drawn 
unto them by warning and correction often 
used by this deponent.” “That Mr. Stapelton 
(son of one of the Yorkshire squires already 
mentioned) was well-known to the Master both 
to be corrupt in religion, and to have been free 
of speech therein unto others, and that this 
deponent had complained unto the Master of 
the same Stapelton.” Of the obnoxious Mr. 
Depup he declared “that he was popish it is as 
well-known by the common report that always 
was of him, as that he was vicious.” 
From another appeal which follows, signed 
by the same seven Fellows, it would seem that 
their opposition to the Master had brought 
them into some danger:—“ Besides our extreme 
injuries and late intended expulsions we are 
more and more daily molested and contemned, 
not only by the inferior scholars for whom we 
have small redress, but especially by Mr. Booth 
(a Fellow of the College, and apparently of the 
Master’s faction) their common instrument,
-P-A-G-E-94
  36 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
who to our faces openly doth deride us, and 
some by name shamefully revileth, and offereth 
also further violence. The inferior scholars, 
whom the Statute otherwise ordereth, will not 
do us as much as common reverence; the Deans 
that have the government of the youth are 
resisted by them, and are so far from due 
correction that, being rescued one of another, 
the Deans themselves are shamefully abused, 
buffeted and beaten down, and the scholars 
therein maintained and encouraged.” All this 
outrage is laid to the charge of the President— 
the “one Swayl” of Dr. Sandys’ complaint— 
who “forthwith, by his absolute authority 
restored into commons and sizing (extra 
commons) the same scholar whom one of the 
Deans had before put out for his open contempt 
and intolerable abusage.” This is dated July 18, 
1582. 
Further long depositions follow, directed 
against the same Mr. Swale, the President, and 
Mr. Booth whom he persisted in supporting. 
Thus, “Mr. Vavisour (another of the Yorkshire 
squires’ sons), being a sober, wise young gentle- 
man, said unto Mr. Church that he thought 
that his Tutor (Mr. Swale) was a Papist, 
because that when he requested him to buy 
him a Calvin’s Catechism, or Beza’s Confessions, 
he was offended with him and willed him to 
learn his belief and ten commandments, which 
were sufficient.” “Item that Mr. Swale, being 
divers times complained unto, for that his 
pupils were corrupt in religion, made always 
this answer, that it made no matter for boys  
-P-A-G-E-95
    AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 87 
what religion they were of, because they were 
unstable and unconstant, and would daily 
change their opinions.” “Item that Cutting, a 
singing man of the King’s College, his ordinary 
and almost only companion, being troubled in 
mind, exclaimed against him, first in the open 
streets and afterwards in his sickness, crying 
out, Mr. Swale a dissembling Papist.” “Item ; 
Mr. Swale, being complained unto of certain 
scholars that were playing at cards in their 
chambers, (a practice forbidden by statute 
except during the general relaxation at Christ- 
mas), and that in the time of the sermon, he 
used no reformation or punishment.” 
In the course of the dispute something more 
is divulged about the suspicious Fingley, but 
he is such a characteristic product of the time 
that a fuller account of him is given further on. 
The next charge, trifling as it may now 
seem, was getting perilously near to one of 
treason:—“Two young gentlemen of the house 
made report to this deponent that they did 
see a crucifix of silver and gilt about Mr. 
Bapthorpe’s neck (he will be mentioned later 
on) as he lay in his bed.” One of the clauses 
of the Act of 1570 proclaimed that “if any 
person shall . . . bring into the realm any 
tokens, crosses, pictures, beads, or such like 
vain superstitious things, from the Bishop or 
See of Rome, and shall deliver the same to any 
subject of the realm,,. . . then that person so 
doing, as well as every other person as shall 
receive the same... shall incur the penalties 
of the Statute of Premunire.”
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  88 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
In the course of this deposition by Mr. Richard Gerrard we get a momentary glimpse of one of those deaths in College which were so sadly frequent under the insanitary conditions 
of the time: he “deposeth that Barnham was reported to be the bringer up of Huddleston 
deceased, which Huddleston had been instructed 
in papistry, and that the report was that Barnham did read popish prayers unto Huddleston in the time of his sickness; and 
that the said Barnham had written certain verses in commendation of the papists of our College. And further this deponent affirmeth that he did see wax candles carried to the said Huddleston’s chamber by a serving man which he believeth were burning about the dead body until ten of the clock; and he affirmeth that he did see and handle red cloth which was carried to the said Huddleston’s chamber to the end mentioned in the article, et aliter nescit deponere.” John Huddleston, admitted in 1578, 
aged 17, was a son of Hdmund Huddleston, Esq., and was born at South Weald, Essex. His family was well-known for its Romanist sympathies. 
In the course of the dispute nearly every- thing that had been quarrelled over in the College, for some years past, is dragged into light: Mr. Gerrard concluded, for example, with 
such depositions as the following, which seem rather a descent from the high matters of Church and State with which he commenced:— “deponit: that the College is much annoyed with hackney horses: that the excessive lewd singing and organs; that it could not but be
-P-A-G-E-97
  
  AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 89 
inconvenient ; and he believeth that if animalia 
may not be nourished ad delicias that then such 
animalia are not to be maintained as do spend a 
great part of their time idly in music to the 
great trouble of others:”—and all this complaint 
before the piano had been invented! 
So much must suffice for the goings on 
within the College walls. As regards the 
religious careers, and the vicissitudes or 
sufferings attendant on those who left the 
place with the resolve to stand by the old 
faith, one preliminary remark must be made. 
Those who fell under the penal legislation 
were either priests or laymen, the former 
being liable to capital punishment, the latter 
to heavy and continued fines. The best known 
of the priests were probably those who joined 
the order of Jesuits; but the seminary priests 
were much the most numerous. I give the 
names of all of both of these latter classes 
whom I have, so far, been able to determine. 
The evidence of their joining the Church of 
Rome, or becoming members of the Jesuit 
body in particular, is mostly drawn from Mr. 
Foley’s “Records of the English Province of 
the SJ.”:—but it was only in a few cases 
that he was aware of the Cambridge residence 
and training of the men whose names follow. 
The data furnished by our College records have 
therefore some historic importance. 
The following members of our College are 
known to have actually joined the Jesuit 
Society. 
The most famous of them was probably
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Richard Holtby. He was a son of Lancelot 
Holtby, and was born about 1552 at Fryston 
in Yorkshire. The description of his father as 
being “mediocris fortune,” does not of itself 
imply any very definite information as to his 
social status; but as he spent four years at 
Northallerton School the family must have 
been in fairly easy circumstances. He received 
part of his education at Caius College, having 
entered in 1578 after two years’ residence in 
Christ’s College. After a time he migrated to 
Hart Hall, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 
1575-6. As a Jesuit priest his career was an 
exceptionally long and fortunate one; for 
though, like his brethren, hunted and dogged by 
spies and informers, he escaped apprehension, 
and after a long life of active wanderings, mostly 
in his native county of Yorkshire, he died 
peacefully in extreme old age, May 15, 1640. 
It is from the personal description of one of 
these informers that we gain the graphic touch 
that he was “a little man with a reddish 
beard.” So remarkable does his immunity 
seem—he frequently visited York Castle, at the 
time that Henry Walpole was a prisoner there, 
previous to his execution—that Dr. Jessopp 
infers that he must have had some powerful 
friends in the background. He became Superior 
of the English Jesuits, after the execution of 
Garnet, May 3, 1606. 
Another recruit was William Flack. He 
was the son of Walter Flack of Mellis, Suffolk, 
and entered our College in 1579 at the age of 18. 
His name was mentioned above as one of the
-P-A-G-E-99
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 91 
little band that resolved “no longer to dis- 
semble.” He left the College soon after, and, 
with Gregory Seare, was admitted at Douay 
in February, 1582. He was ordained priest at 
Valladolid. He rose subsequently to be Rector 
of the Jesuit College of St. Omer, and afterwards 
of that of Ghent. He died in old age at St. 
Omer, December 18, 1637, aged 76. There seems 
no evidence of his having returned to brave the 
persecution in England. 
Christopher Walpole was the sixth son of 
Christopher Walpole, Esq., of Docking and 
Anmere, a wealthy Norfolk squire of the same 
stock from which Horace Walpole was de- 
scended. He was a younger brother of Henry 
Walpole, of whose cruel torture in the Tower, 
and subsequent execution at York, a very 
graphic account will be found in Dr. Jessopp’s 
work. He was admitted into the Society of 
Jesus at Rome, September 27, 1592. He was 
afterwards in Spain, and was confessor and 
spiritual father at the college of Valladolid ; 
where he died in 1606. Like Flack he does 
not appear to have returned to run the risk 
of being hanged in England. He was admitted 
to our College in December 8, 1587, and was a 
scholar on the foundation until Michaelmas, 
1590. 
Robert Markham was a son of Thomas 
Markham, Esq., of Ollerton, Notts. He was 
admitted at Caius in 1584, but as he was not 
a scholar on the foundation, and did not 
graduate, there is no means of determining 
the length of his residence here. He appears
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
at the English Jesuit College at Rome, August 
1, 1598, and was admitted as a convictor, 
what apparently we should term a “fellow- 
commoner.” He took the oath of admission 
soon afterwards. He left for Perugia in 1596, 
on account of ill-health, and died not very 
long afterwards at Loretto; without being 
re-admitted into the Society. From informa- 
tion supplied by Sir Clements Markham it 
appears that he was a promising youth, and 
had been for a short time in the employ of 
Lord Burleigh before joining the Romish 
Church. A letter from him to his brother 
Griffin (also a Romish convert from our college), 
dated from Rome in 1595, shows the difficult 
position of men of his religious views. He 
says that he had contemplated serving in the 
Turkish Wars, but could not obtain admission 
amongst the knights of Malta; and would not 
join any power at war with England. 
Reginald Eaton was a son of John Eaton 
of Southwell, Notts. He entered in 1577, but 
we have no record of the length of his stay 
amongst us. He afterwards became a priest, 
being ordained at Rheims in 1587, joined the 
Jesuit order in 1610, and was fortunate enough 
to reach old age, as he died in 1641. 
Charles Walgrave was of Cossey, Norfolk, 
and entered our College in 1598, a date when 
men of his sympathies were becoming scarce 
in the English Universities. He too belonged 
to an important family of Norfolk gentry: 
the present Earl of Waldegrave is descended 
from his uncle. After two years’ study at
-P-A-G-E-101
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 93 
Cambridge, he went to Flanders. The Jesuit, 
Father Gerard, seems to have been the in- 
fluencing agent in his change of conviction, as 
he was of so many others of the gentry of the 
Eastern Counties. Charles Walgrave entered 
the English College at Rome and joined the 
Jesuit Order. He received the Minor Orders at 
Rome; but as he was not a priest he seems to 
have escaped the capital charge, on his return 
to England. He lived for many years on his 
estate in Norfolk, as a lay recusant, doubtless 
suffering the heavy and continuous fines 
imposed on those of his opinions. 
The list of “seminary priests,” viz. of men 
trained and ordained at the various Roman 
Catholic colleges, who did not join the Jesuit 
Society, is a larger one. Some of these were 
regulars, some seculars: those at present 
identified as belonging to us are the following: 
Robert Sayer (or Seare as he is called in 
our books) was a son of John Sayer, of Redgrave, 
Suffolk, and was admitted here in 1576 at the 
age of 16. His anti-Protestant opinions soon 
attracted attention in the College, and he was 
ultimately refused a degree with us; though 
he appears to have succeeded in graduating 
B.A. from Peterhouse in 1580. This was one 
of the grounds of dispute between the Master 
and tutors. Mr. Gerard, in his depositions, from 
which we have already quoted, complains that 
Dr. Legge “took displeasure against him for 
staying one Sayer from his degree, and upon 
that occasion made complaint of him to his 
father (Gerard’s father was a prominent man,
-P-A-G-E-102
ee ee 
| 94 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Recorder and M.P. for Chester, etc.) at the 
Assizes in Lent, 1579.” He afterwards became 
a Benedictine Monk at Monte Cassino, and 
gained celebrity as an author under the 
religious name of Gregory. In 1595 he went 
to the monastery of St. George, at Venice, 
where he died, and was buried October 30, 
1682. 
The connection of Richard Cornwallis with 
Cambridge life was longer and closer than that 
of any of the others. He was a son of Henry 
Cornwallis, Esq., of Coxford Abbey, Norfolk. He 
entered our College in 1585, and graduated B.A. 
in 1588, M.A. in 1592. He was one of the first 
Frankland fellows (December 2ist, 1592), from 
which he passed to a senior fellowship which he 
retained until Michaelmas, 1596. He held more 
than one College office, being dean during the 
last year of his fellowship, and having been 
appointed “Humanity Lecturer” (what was 
afterwards called “Prolector rhetoricus”), for 
the year commencing Michaelmas, 1592. 
This last appointment is significant when 
we remember the proclivities of Dr. Legge, for 
the office was in the sole gift of the Master, and 
it was very rare, if not quite unprecedented, for _ 
it to be held by anyone not at the time an actual 
fellow. He was already thirty years of age 
when he entered the English College at Rome, 
being one of the many converts whom Father 
Gerard had gained over during his stay in 
Norfolk and Suffolk. He had considerable diffi- 
culty in making his escape from England, and 
suffered some months’ imprisonment before
-P-A-G-E-103
  
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 95 
finally succeeding. He was ordained priest at 
Rome 1599, and sent to England in. 1601. 
Luckily he escaped detection and lived to return 
to Spain, where he died about October, 1606. 
Edward Osburne was another student who 
soon became notorious during his College 
career. He was a son of John Osburne, of 
Kelmarsh, Northants, and was admitted at our 
College in 1574, at the age of 19. Like some 
others, he was refused a degree at Cambridge. 
He entered Douay, and was ordained priest 
there in 1581, being soon after despatched to 
England. Under the pressure of family 
influence, and fear of State persecution, he gave 
way and recanted, but seems afterwards to have 
rejoined the Romish Church. In a letter from 
the Recorder of London (Strype, Ann. III. 1-125) 
he is thus referred to:—‘“One Osborne, a 
seminary priest, came drooping into a chamber 
where Mr. Topcliffe and myself were. Him we 
examined, and it appeared that he was a semin- 
ary priest and had dwelt at the Hospital at 
Rome four years, and after he was professed 
into the house of the Franciscans, being bare- 
foot friars that live by begging; and that he 
lived by begging, and that he laboured by 
cutting wood and bearing it on his back.” 
It was through him apparently that a fellow- 
townsman was gained over to the same cause, 
viz., John Roberts. This man was a son of 
Lawrence Roberts, of Kelmarsh, and entered 
our College in 1576. Osburne brought him to 
Douay, after his first visit to England in 1588. 
He went to Rome, where he was ordained priest
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
in 1587. He was got into England from Spain 
by a clever ruse of Father Parsons. He and a 
dozen others were sent over in the guise of 
English sailors who had formed part of the 
expedition against Spain, and had been taken 
prisoners. In spite of suspicions they escaped 
detection. He has been confounded with his 
namesake the martyr, who was, however, 14 
years younger (v. Dom B. Camm’s Life of 
Roberts). 
Charles Yelverton, of Bawsey, was a son of 
Humfrey Yelverton, Esq., and was admitted 
here in 1590. Like Cornwallis, he was con- 
nected with the College for a considerable time, 
graduating B.A. in 1598, and (on the evidence of 
our register, though he does not appear in the 
University lists) as M.A. in 1597. He was a 
scholar on the foundation for seven years. He 
was admitted at the English College at Rome in 
1601, through Gerard’s influence. His own 
statement, on admission, contains an interest- 
ing account of his studies at Cambridge: 
“Sometimes I applied myself to the humanities; 
sometimes to philosophy; and, as it is the 
fashion everywhere, I was at one time eager to 
learn Greek, and at another Hebrew.” 
Henry Rookwood, son of Robert Rookwood, 
Esq., of Stanningfield, Suffolk, belongs to a well- 
known Romanist family; his brother Ambrose 
was executed for complicity in the Gunpowder 
Plot. He entered our College in 1579, but 
we have no evidence as to the length of his 
residence. In the MS. collections of both Davy 
and Blois, at the British Museum, he is
-P-A-G-E-105
  
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 97 
described as a Romish priest; doubtless, there- fore, he was a seminarist. 
Another name may be added to the list. of seminary priests with approximate certainty, 
viz., that of Nicholas Foxe, son of Thomas Foxe, gentleman, of Thorpe, Yorkshire. There can be little doubt that he was the Nicholas Foxe who was ordained priest at Douay in 1581. He had entered our College in 1578, but like most of those who seceded from the English Church, he took no degree here. 
John Weldon, another seminarist, was executed at Mile End, October 5th, 1588. He is described as “some time of Caius College” ; indicted “for that being born within her Majesty’s dominions he was not only made priest at Paris by authority from the See of Rome,” but had entered this land sent by the Pope. (Lansd. 982, p. 105.) He seems to have been a son of William Hewet, of York, captured in England (v. The Month, January, 1879). William Deane, son of Thomas, of Grassing- 
ton, or Linton, Yorks., was admitted a pensioner in 1577. His family connections seem to have been with the old faith, as his father is called a rebel. (Cath. Rec. Soc. v. 26.) He was ordained 
priest at Douay. Being sent to England he was soon captured, imprisoned, and banished. Returning, he was convicted on the usual grounds, and executed at Mile End, August 22nd, 1588. 
Edward Dakyns, son of John, of Brands- 
burton, Yorks., was M.A. of Trinity Hall when he was introduced into the College. He 
H
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
was tutor to R. Creswell, son of a Yorkshire 
squire, of a notorious recusant family, and was 
evidently one of the Master’s supporters. The 
Fellows complain that “they did never hear of 
any punishment that the said Creswell sus- 
tained for his fault [absenting himself ostenta- 
tiously from chapel] and that his tutor was 
very unlikely to correct him for such a fault.” 
Dakyns made the usual journey to Douay; was 
ordained abroad; returned to England and was 
banished. What finally became of him is not 
known. 
The last name on my list is that of John 
Ballard. He, too, is well known, since he 
suffered death as a traitor, with the customary 
processes of being drawn, hanged and quartered, 
for complicity in Babington’s plot. He is 
described as “ Cantabrigiensis,” and a graduate, 
at his first appearance at Douay, and as there 
seems to be no one else of his name—certainly- 
no graduate—at Cambridge about this time, 
there can be no doubt of his identity. He 
entered our College in 1570, being a son of 
William Ballard, of Wratting, Suffolk. He was 
a seminary priest, but he cannot be fairly 
claimed as a martyr, since his death was 
distinctly due, rightly or wrongly, to political 
and not to religious causes. 
One other name of decided literary interest 
may be added to the above list. It is possible 
that some reader may succeed in identifying 
the man beyond doubt. Henry Walpole, the 
eldest of the brothers and the instigating cause 
of the conversion of most of the other members
-P-A-G-E-107
  
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 99 
of his family, was present at the execution of the Jesuit Campian at Smithfield. He was deeply affected at the scene, and on his return 
to his rooms in Gray’s Inn he expressed his feelings of grief and admiration in a series of stanzas (printed in full by Dr. Jessopp). These verses were sternly suppressed by the Govern- 
ment, and amongst the persons who suffered for 
endeavouring to spread them was a certain 
Stephen Valenger. He was condemned to the pillory, and to lose his ears, and committed to the Fleet prison in 1586, “for certain libels of Edmund Campian”; these libels being appar- ently Henry Walpole’s verses in commendation 
of the martyr. He refused to divulge the 
author’s name. Now there was a Fellow of our College of the same—very peculiar—name, in Dr. Caius’ time, who disappears from Cambridge 
some years before the death of Campian. It is highly probable that our Stephen Valenger is the same man, but we should be glad of further 
evidence. 
The above list, with the exception of the last 
man, is confined to priests or men in Romish 
orders. In their case any return to their own country involved a high probability of being drawn, hanged and quartered. The names 
which follow belong to a different category. It comprises laymen, who were subject only to fines. At least this was the punishment for 
ere absence from the parish church, but, if they went a step beyond, they incurred a good hance of being hanged as well. For instance, 
o harbour a Romish priest was a capital

offence. The father of one of our own students 
—Richard Langlaye, Esq., of Howthorpe, York- 
shire—was actually hanged at York, Dec. 1, 
1586, for the crime of sheltering Romish priests 
in his house. This was two years after his son 
Christopher was admitted at Caius. The name 
by which these laymen were commonly known 
was Recusants, from their refusing the oath of 
allegiance in the form prescribed. They ren- 
dered themselves liable, by so doing, to a fine, 
simply crushing to all but the very wealthy, 
of £20 a month. The list of Recusants furn- 
ished by our College alone would probably be 
a long one; and the following names must form 
but a part of the list which could be compiled 
by careful study of the existent records in 
Fetter Lane, the British Museum, and the 
various Episcopal Registers. 
For instance in one such list alone, about the 
year 1587 (Lansdowne MSS. No. 55), I find the 
following list of names amongst others :— 
Norf. Mr. Jerningham of Cossey. 
Mr. Edward Rookwood and his wife. 
Mr. Thwaites that married Benning- 
field’s daughter. 
Mr. Robert Constable, of Bowthorp. 
Suff. Mr. Mannock, the elder, of Stoke. 
Mr. Mannock, the younger, with his 
wife and brethren. 
Mr. Benningfield of Redlingfield and 
his wife. 
Ess. Mr. Rooke Green, of Sampford. 
Sur. Mr. Nicholas Lusher, of Shoolands. 
Salop. Mr. Bannister, of Wem.
-P-A-G-E-109
  
\ 
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 101 
Yks. Mr. Ralph Bapthorpe, of Osgodby, and 
his wife. 
Of these, Robert Jerningham was the father 
of Henry and Thomas, who were admitted in 
1589. Edward Rookwood is probably the man 
admitted in 1575, brother of Henry the priest, and 
of Ambrose of the Gunpowder Plot. Thwaites 
is most likely Richard Thwaites, of Hardling- 
ham, admitted in 1577. Robert Constable is 
either our student of 1574 or his father. The 
younger Mannock entered our College in 1564; 
one of his sons became a Jesuit. Benningfield, 
or Bedingfield, must be the father of our 
student of 1608, as the latter seems to have 
conformed, and was afterwards a Judge. Rooke 
Green, of Sampford, had two sons here in 1564. 
Nicholas Lusher is either our student of 1578 
or his father. The same may be said of Mr. 
Bannister, of Wem. Ralph Bapthorpe, of 
Osgodby, was admitted in 1576. He died at 
Louvain in 1617, and, after his death, his widow 
entered a convent there, where she died six 
years later. It deserves notice that of all the 
men just mentioned only one seems to have 
graduated; a tolerably plain evidence that an 
English University at that time did not suit 
the needs or requirements of this class of 
gentry. 
As was said, this list of Recusants concerns 
one year only: it might be largely extended by 
anyone who had the time to work through the 
necessary documents. We should probably 
find that besides the landed gentry above 
included, and the avowed seminarists, there
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
was a considerable class of men who had 
studied sufficiently for the priesthood, but 
were debarred by scruple from English Orders, 
and shrank from the terrible risks attendant 
on those persons who were admitted to Orders 
by a Romish bishop. Almost the only career 
left to them was that of tutor or secretary in 
some wealthy Romanist family. Thus there 
can be no doubt that the Nicholas Goodrich, | 
who was admitted in 1597 and graduated B.A. 
and M.A. respectively, in 1600 and 1604, is the 
same man who was returned as a Popish 
recusant in 1615, being at that time a private 
tutor in the family of Lady Sulyard, at 
Haughley, Suffolk. He had been a scholar on 
the foundation in our College. The following 
extract from the State Papers (January 1591-2) 
supplies another example: “One Kydman, a 
M of Arte, and student of late of Keyes 
Colledge, Cambridge, was there ; a noted papist; 
and is now one of my Lord’s (i.e. Harl of 
Shrewsbury) secretaries.” There were prob- 
ably a number more of similar cases, but it 
is only by the most casual references that we 
can identify them. 
One general remark may be made about the 
various men included in these notes. With 
very few exceptions they come from the country 
districts of England, and belong to the aristo- 
cratic, gentle, or at least superior yeoman 
classes. Of the crowds of youths who came to 
us from the large towns of Norfolk and Suffolk 
—from Norwich, Yarmouth, Lynn, Ipswich, 
Bury, and so on—I do not find one who swelled
-P-A-G-E-111
AN ELIZABETHAN EPISODE 103 
the ranks of the Romish priesthood, or suffered 
in pocket as a recusant. So far as this goes it 
certainly supports the common view that at the 
time in question, at any rate in the South 
and East of England, the dispute between 
Protestant and Romanist was much the same 
as that between the landed gentry and towns- 
men, between the agriculturist and the trades- 
man. 
The facts thus roughly put together are but 
a fragment of what might be collected with 
sufficient time and labour. As originally 
compiled they were confined to the limits 
appropriate for a College Magazine; that is, 
they deal with none but members of our own 
College, and their nearest relations. But when 
we remember that the same influences were at 
work, more or less as the case may be, in every 
other College in each University, we can form 
some idea of the scale of what has been termed 
the “Counter-Reformation” of Queen Elizabeth’s 
time, and of its importance in the history of the 
Church and of the nation.

VII. 
DR. CAIUS: AN APPRECIATION. 
(Celebration of the Quater-centenary of the 
Birth Year of John Caius, October, 6, 1910.) 
Our University and our various colleges have 
a long and noble list of benefactors to record. 
In not a few of these cases, if we enquire into 
the facts of their personal history, or read 
between the lines of the ancient deeds in our 
Treasury, we shall find that the wreck of an 
earthly life, or the utter disappointment of all 
family hopes, had something to do with the 
gifts. Our founders are not always, nor perhaps 
in the majority of cases, to be found amongst 
those whom the world commonly reckons as the 
prosperous and the happy. 
But, amongst all our many benefactors, I 
doubt if, in some respects, a more tragic figure 
can be found than that of John Caius. Picture 
him, in middle life, about the time when he was 
contemplating the refounding of this college. 
He was already, by his industry and economy, 
in possession of an ample fortune, and might, 
like so many others in Elizabethan days—for 
instance, like his medical contemporaries, 
Wendy and Butts—have made it his ambition 
to “establish a family” in the country. That 
aim he entirely set aside. Or, he might have 
devoted his fortune to founding a new and 
important college. This he might easily have
-P-A-G-E-113
DR. CAIUS: AN APPRECIATION . 105 
done, and have left poor Gonville Hall to linger 
on in obscurity and decay. He preferred to 
sink such personal ambition, and just to add his 
name to the ancient and restored college. 
At the age of 48 he handed over nearly all his 
possessions to Gonville Hall, and then returned 
to his hard work and lonely life in St. 
Bartholomew’s. How lonely that life was we 
know from a contemporary account. Appar- 
ently he had, at that time, no other intention 
than just to continue there till the end of his 
days. He practically gave his all, and then 
went back to the drudgery of professional work. 
I doubt if, in the whole long history of charit- 
able endowments, we can find a case to set 
against this:—one of such almost entire self- 
effacement. 
Two years afterwards, Thomas Bacon, whom 
he had re-instated as Master in the enlarged 
College, in such vastly improved circumstances, 
died. The Fellows wisely seized the opportunity, 
and begged their one help and hope to take his 
place. He reluctantly consented. As he tells 
us, he found the College on the verge of ruin, 
through the negligence and inefficiency of those 
in authority. And this, notwithstanding what 
he had already done for them. 
As you know, his rule in College was not a 
success. That is the pity of it, and what makes 
his figure, as I have said, such a tragic one. It 
could indeed hardly have been otherwise, for he 
belonged, heart and soul, to an order of things 
which was passing rapidly away; or rather was 
being roughly kicked aside. In religion his
-P-A-G-E-114
    106 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
sympathies were with the ancient Faith. In 
the University, what he cared for were the 
teaching, the ceremonies, the discipline, even 
the pronunciation, of the past. 
In College he soon found himself confronted 
by a turbulent band of Fellows: several of them 
bitter Puritans: nearly all young—at the height 
of the dispute the oldest of them was hardly 25 
—hostile to authority, and supported in their 
hostility by a powerful and growing party 
outside. Not one of them achieved the slightest 
distinction in after life, or seemed to feel 
anything but angry contempt for what filled 
the Master’s heart with veneration. 
It was a bitter and undignified squabble. 
The Chancellor is appealed to. The University 
authorities are invoked. The Archbishop is 
dragged into the quarrel. The Fellows protest 
that the Master is a tyrant: they denounce him 
as a Papist: they also denounce him as an 
Atheist. That was their side of the question. 
The Master, on his side, was not voluble, but he 
was certainly prompt and resolute. He pro- 
ceeded to expel one Fellow after another. Nay, 
if one of their pitiful petitions now in the 
Record Office is to be credited, he set them in 
the College stocks, and threatened them with 
the rod. 
Squabbles of this kind were unfortunately 
only too common in our ancient Colleges, 
though they were not often pushed to such 
lengths. What is really unique here is the 
serene and lofty spirit with which Caius, whilst 
he continued to struggle with the individuals,
-P-A-G-E-115
DR. CAIUS: AN APPRECIATION 107 
never ceased to study the welfare of the College. 
Not for a moment did he falter in his pursuit of 
the ideal which he had set before him. No 
insult or opposition seemed to have the 
slightest effect on his designs. He calmly 
continued his benefactions. He added fresh 
estates to his already grand donation. He built 
anew court. He gave many books, and valuable 
plate. He devised a new seal, and other em- 
blems. He wrote the Annals, and compiled a 
set of Statutes. One can really only compare 
his attitude to that of some wise and devoted 
attendant in a nursery of spiteful and fractious 
children. She slaps them and sets them in 
the corner, as occasion requires, but nothing 
that they say or do can make her for a moment 
forget their best and highest interests. 
But this could not last for very long. 
Gradually Caius grew feebler, and more irritable 
or more sensitive, whilst the opposition to him 
spread and grew more virulent. At last the 
Fellows saw their chance and seized it. They 
got access to the Master’s private rooms and 
had a hunt there. Keenly they must have 
enjoyed the fun of rummaging about for the 
“Popish trumpery” and the “ Massing abomi- 
nations” which they had so long denounced, 
and which rumour said he kept in hiding for 
the expected time of religious change. They 
found what they sought. The next chapter in 
the story is the strange and scandalous scene, 
enacted in the court outside, when a rabble rout 
of fanatics, headed by the Vice-Chancellor and 
the Master of Trinity, might have been seen—
-P-A-G-E-116
    108 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
from 12 to 8, one December day—dancing round 
a bonfire like street-boys on a 5th of November. 
They were smashing and burning those symbols 
of the old faith which Caius had so fondly 
preserved. 
Thus closed his career in Cambridge. He 
retired, broken down in heart and body, to his 
lonely home in St. Bartholomew’s. And fools 
counted his life to be madness. 
He paid one more visit, a very brief one, to 
his still beloved University and College. He 
was in the last extremity of weakness, and 
had to be carried on a litter. He just came to 
arrange matters for his successor, and to give 
directions for the construction of his tomb. A 
touching description is given of his weakness 
and suffering in his farewell letter to his old 
friend Matthew Parker. 
I wish he could have been with us to-night ; 
though I confess I should feel rather nervous 
about his judgment on my historical efforts. I 
seem to hear him repeating what he said to 
Parker: “Young men be so negligent now-a- 
days.” Much, of course, of what we now say, 
and do, and think, would be utterly alien to 
him. But I would fain believe that he might 
notice some things of which he would fully 
approve. Consider these two:—The revived 
study and appreciation of the past, and the 
better understanding of ceremony and symbol. 
When I first joined the College, the country 
was in the midst of what Carlyle, I think, 
called the “ Scavenger age.” Nowhere were the 
characteristics of the time more unfortunately
-P-A-G-E-117
DR. CAIUS: AN APPRECIATION 109 
displayed than in dealing with our old buildings 
and our old statutes. You know the fate of our 
ancient library. It was just gutted, and con- 
verted into sets of undergraduates’ rooms, in 
which the occupant of a 15th century building 
might not be disturbed by the sight of anything 
which looked a day older than himself. That 
room, as you know, we have endeavoured 
suitably to restore. Perhaps some day the 
windows may be replaced: windows given by 
Bishop Lyndwood, the great canonist; by 
Boleyn, great grand uncle of the unfortunate 
Queen, and by other famous men of the past. 
Caius has described them. 
Take, again, the ancient hall, still standing 
and in use till 1854. This room is, in a special 
way, connected with the memory of Caius. It 
was there that the ceremonial banquet was 
held, which he has so fully described in his 
Annals; when, in the presence of all the chief 
dignitaries of the University, he solemnly 
handed over his Charter of Re-foundation. 
That building has now been restored—like the 
library it had been defaced out of all recognition 
—and we may fairly regard it as being publicly 
opened to-day, The possibility of doing this we 
owe, as you mostly know, to the wisdom and 
generosity of our late friend and Fellow, Charles 
Monro. His memory comes back very vividly 
to me to-night, for it was at a table in that old 
hall that I first made his acquaintance, as we 
sat there on our arrival as Freshmen. 
There is another point of sympathy; at least 
one in which the Spirit of the Age is tending
-P-A-G-E-118
110 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
towards sympathy. If there was any one 
characteristic which was dominant in the mind 
of Caius it was the love of fitting ceremonial, 
and the significance and help of symbolism. 
There can be no mistake here. Every holiday- 
tripper, as he is hurried through our courts, is 
reminded, by the three well-known gates, how 
it is through humility and virtue that the 
young man should strive to attain to honour. 
His Grant of Arms must, I should think, be 
almost unique at the Heralds’ College. Most 
assuredly it is his voice, and not that of 
“Norroy,” that we hear, as the symbols are one 
by one explained, and we are reminded that the 
two serpents and their base indicate “ Wisdom 
with Grace founded and stayed upon Virtue’s 
stable stone.” And in the solemn dedication in 
the old hall, to which I have already referred, 
the same notes are struck. He pointed to the 
Cushion—it lies there on the table before us— 
with the words, “We give thee the Cushion of 
Reverence ” :—to the Caduceus—there it is—and 
said “We give thee the Rod of prudent Govern- 
ance.” And so on, throughout the ceremony. 
But I must close. I have, I fear, employed 
far too many words to be a suitable eulogist of 
John Caius. You know his own sentiments, as 
expressed by himself on the tomb in the chapel. 
As Thomas Fuller said, “ Few might have had a 
longer; surely none ever had a shorter epitaph 
—Fui Caius.”

“* Studens Vulgaris, or common British undergraduate. 
Variety: Cantabrigiensis. A hardy triennial. Habitat: 
abundant in meadows and by rivers, in winter and spring ; 
has been found also in chapels and lecture rooms. Flowers 
profusely in May and June. Seeds occasionally later on. 
Use in the Pharmacopeeia: has been recommended as an 
irritant in obstinate cases of anchylosis, or tutor’s stiff- 
jaw.’ (Old Herbal.) 
It has been remarked, with some shrewdness, 
that if anyone wishes to know something about 
the life and habits of any particular class of 
men,—say the student of early times,—he will 
find some help in a careful study of the prohibi- 
tive legislation of the day. If it is desired to 
ascertain what he actually did, enquire what he 
was ordered not to do. If, for instance, he was 
peremptorily ordered to wear short hair' and a 
long gown, we may conjecture that, as a matter 
of fact, it was generally the hair that was long 
and the gown that was short. If he was for- 
bidden to attend bull-baitings, to go fowling in 
Chesterton marshes, or to bathe in the river, we

upon his heade, but that he be polled, notted, or rounded after 
the accustomed manner of the gravest Schollers of the 
Universitie, etc.’? (See Cooper’s Annals, II 161, for the 
whole edict. With due insertion, or omission, of negatives it 
probably gives a good picture of the ‘‘scholler” as he 
occasionally displayed himself in 1560.)

gain a clue as to where we should be likely to 
find him of a summer’s afternoon. There is 
much truth in this suggestion, for legislation is 
not made at random, and it is seldom thought 
worth while to forbid a practice until it has 
become tolerably frequent. We shall therefore 
find an appeal to statutes and college orders a 
useful aid in studying the life and habits of our 
friend. 
The first fact to be impressed on the mind is 
the extreme youth of the ordinary student, or 
rather of the junior portion of the students. 
This latter qualification is important, as it will 
explain a good deal that is often misunderstood. 
At the present day, the “man” is generally 18, 
or more, when he enters; and he seldom stays for 
much more than three years. In the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries the “lad” was seldom 
more than 16, and often under 15 or even 14, at 
admission; and he very frequently resided for 
six or seven years. The practical difference, in 
respect of taste and habits between 18 and 22 is 
slight; but the difference between, say, 14 and 
22, is enormous. Take, for instance, the practice 
of flogging. The present-day student is shocked 
at the bare idea of such a practice ever having 
been tolerated. But I have never heard that the 
sixth-form boy—say at the colleges of Eton and 
Winchester—feels that his dignity is in the least 
impaired when some one in the third or fourth 
form suffers at the master’s hands. So in the 
olden days in the colleges of Cambridge. The 
youth of 17 or 18 was generally as safe from 
corporal punishment then as he is now; in fact
-P-A-G-E-121
  
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 113 
decidedly safer than one of his age often was at 
a public school a generation ago. Why should 
the boy of 14 not be flogged at college as he had 
been till the other day at his school? The 
practice was common enough everywhere; and 
his brother, in business as an apprentice, was 
certainly not immune. And what else was to 
be done with a rebellious boy of that age? You 
could not “gate ” him, for the entire college was 
then, in the present sense of the term, perma- 
nently gated. You could not curtail his cook’s 
bill, for he had none; and his ordinary allowance 
of commons would, probably, bear but small 
reduction. Impositions would be of small 
deterrent force to one whose whole time was 
already supposed to be claimed for work; and 
as to fining him, the father would quickly be 
heard from had that plan been attempted. 
There was really no other effective resource, and 
the only surprise to me is that the practice was 
not much more prevalent than it actually 
appears to have been. That it was occasionally 
resorted to we know, though the popular legend 
as to Milton’s experience in this way is certainly 
without foundation. But in our college I am 
bound to say that I have never found a single 
instance recorded or referred to. Fines, where 
available; 7.e. where the delinquent held an 
office for which he was paid, or had reached an 
age at which he was likely to have cash in his 
pocket, are mentioned often enough in our 
Gesta; and so are rustications and other penal- 
ties. But in all the various entries in our 
college records, and in all the depositions and 
rT
-P-A-G-E-122
    114 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
complaints made in turbulent times, I have 
never seen but one reference to the practice, and 
that is hypothetical, or rather optative, as 
describing what the tutor would have wished to 
do. It was in the days of the Popish disputes in 
Dr. Legge’s time. The student was Thomas 
Barwick, a gentleman’s son from Westhorpe, 
Suffolk. He was 16 at his admission, and must 
have been a year or two older when he was sent 
away for defiantly parading his “ papistry ” ; 
declaring, amongst other things, that he would 
not receive the sacrament because there was no 
priest to consecrate. His tutor, Dr. Swale, 
stated that he was averse to this expulsion, and 
that, for his part, “he would only have beaten 
him openly in the hall for the same, and so have 
retained him, whosoever had said him nay, for 
he was but a boy and so to be used.” 
The actual punishments recorded in our books 
refer to such offences as would naturally occur 
amongst a lot of young men and boys, living in 
somewhat disorderly times, and many of them 
with a rather rough bringing-up. The students 
of that day do not seem, like schoolboys of 
the past generation, to have indulged in pugi- 
listic fights ; or, if they did, no notice was taken 
of this. But there are occasionally deeds of 
violence recorded. Thus in 1627 John Gray, a 
third-year student, was publicly admonished in 
the chapel for assaulting an unfortunate sizar, 
his junior by a year or two, and nearly knocking 
his eye out: the offender is also ordered to pay 
for the medical treatment of his victim. In 
1608 Raphael Edwards, also a third-year student,
-P-A-G-E-123
  
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 6 
was fined ten shillings for attacking a freshman, 
Jermy, “laying violent hands on him, pinching 
him and turning him out of his bed-room” i 
perhaps the fact that Jermy was a fellow- commoner had something to do with the magni- 
tude of the fine here. In 1627 George Drane, a student of 21, was admonished because he had struck another student with a stick, and drawn a knife upon him. Somewhat later, in 1675, 
John Dennis, afterwards famous as a dramatic 
critic, was fined £8, deprived of his scholarship, 
and recommended to leave the college, for 
drawing his sword and wounding a fellow- student; they were both bachelors of arts atthe time. This entry is interesting as showing that the practice of wearing arms,—utterly at variance with academic law and ancient custom, 
—had begun to creep into college life. 
From these accounts it would appear that students, like modern sailors, carried their own knives (presumably clasp-knives) for use at meals, instead of having them supplied from the kitchen. Dr. Caius forbids the wearing of any arms “ultra cultellum ad ciborum usum.” In the inventory of Leonard Metcalf, a student at St. John’s, “a meat knife” is one of the few articles of furniture mentioned. In one or two cases, in our Gesta, assaults with knives are recorded and punished, intimating that the students had their weapons at hand. In fact Caius expressly enacts (Statutes, § 50), that if any student “abutatur cultello cibario, aut non deponat jussus ” he shall be expelled. 
The same readiness of attack was not
-P-A-G-E-124
    
116 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
confined amongst themselves, but was shown 
towards the Fellows also. Amongst the 
Gawdy MSS. (Brit. Mus.), there is a curious 
illustration of the manners of the University 
in the early Stuart period. The writer was 
young Gawdy’s tutor. “Not long since your 
kinsman being at the College buttery at 
Beaver’, at the permitted hour of the clock 
between 8 and 9 at night, the dean coming in 
charged him to be gone. He told him he would, 
and was presently departing. The dean told 
him, Unless you had forthwith gone I should 
have set you out. Upon that your kinsman, not 
brooking that speech, turns back and puts on 
his hat, and told him, Seeing that he used him 
so he would not yet out. Upon thatthe dean 
strikes him in the face with his fist. He, being 
a man ofa spirit, could not forbear, but repays 
the dean with interest. For this he was con- 
vented before the Master and Fellows. He was 
deprived of his scholarship and warned within a 
month’s space to provide for himself elsewhere.” 
Gawdy was at this time a Bachelor of Arts. 
The students’ dress has always been a cause 
of trouble to their tutors, if not to themselves. 
The fullest discussion of their habits and 
tastes in this direction is contained in a report 
to Archbishop Laud in 1687: 
  
1 Beaver, or Bever as it is commonly spelt, was a slight 
repast, probably consisting of bread and beer, taken in the 
evening. It was not provided in the Hall, but those who 
wished went to the Buttery for it. Likely enough the 
occasion led to something of a social gathering there. It 
may be remarked that dinner was then about midday, and 
supper at five or six o’clock.
-P-A-G-E-125
  
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 117 
“The clericall habit appointed for students 
here is generally neglected unless it be in 
King’s Colledge only, wherein they reteine the 
ancient manner both for color and fashion, with 
the use of square caps from the first entrance. 
At Trinitie, and otherwhiles at Caius, they keep 
their order for their wide Sleeve Gowns, and for 
their Caps too when they list to put any on, but 
for the rest of their garments they are as light 
and fond as others. And others, all that are 
undergraduates, wear the new fashioned gowns 
of any colour whatsoever, blew or green or ‘red 
or mixt, without any uniformity but in hanging 
sleeves. And their other garments are light 
and gay, some with bootes and spurs, others 
with stockings of diverse colours reversed one 
upon another, and round rustic caps they weare 
(if they were any caps at all) that they may be 
the sooner despised, though the fashion here 
of old time was altogether ‘Pileus quadratus’, 
as appears by reteining that custom and order 
still in King’s Colledge, in Trinity, and at Caius, 
whose Governours heretofore were more ob- 
servant of old orders than it seems others 
were. But in all places, among Graduates and 
Priests also, as well as the younger students, 
we have fair Roses upon the shoe, long frizzled 
haire upon the head, broad spred Bands upon the 
~~ 1T cannot recall any other reference to this colour: Can it be a tradition of older academic usage? The Scotch 
student does, or did, wear a red gown ‘“ when he lists to put 
any on.’’ It may be remarked that the present custom of 
each college having its distinct gown (blue at Trinity and 
Caius) dates only from the first half of the last century. 
Before then all the students alike wore a plain short black 
gown, as at Oxford.  
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
shoulders and long large Merchant Ruffs about 
the neck, with fayre feminine cuffs at the wrist. 
Nay, and although ruffled shirts, ‘Camicie circa 
collum rugate,’ be expressly forbidden by the 
Statutes of the University, yet we use them 
without controule, some of our Drs, heads and 
all, to the laudable example of others” (v. 
Cooper, Annals, IIT. 280). 
As regards their sports, naturally, those 
who had a chance were fond of frequenting the 
royal and aristocratic sport of bull and bear- 
baiting. But there were great difficulties here, 
for the University set its face against the 
pursuit within the limits of their jurisdiction, 
which for such purposes extended to four or 
five miles around the town. The attempt to 
secure the sport sometimes succeeded at 
Chesterton, though when the University 
Authorities got wind of the affair they quickly 
came down to check it. Thus, in 1581, Dr. 
Andrew Perne, Master of Peterhouse and Vice- 
Chancellor, writes to complain to Lord 
Burleigh, the Chancellor, of the way in which 
“the quietnes of our honest studies, in godly 
exercise of virtue, religion and lerning” is 
broken into. He encloses the depositions of the 
proctor, who reports that “ upon a complaynt of 
the resorting to a bearebayting at Chesterton 
of a great multitude of younge schollers,” the 
proctor, accompanied by the bedell and several 
Masters of Arts, proceeded thither. It was on 
a Sunday; April 22,1581. “He there found the 
bear at stake, where he had been bayted in the 
sermon time, between one and two of the clock
-P-A-G-E-127
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 119 
in the afternoone. He asked the bearward by 
what authoritie he bayted his beare there, who 
answered that he was Lord Vaux’s man and 
had warrant from the justices.” The proctor 
replied that it was against the privileges of the 
University, and “commanded this bearward to 
cease from that disordered pastime, to which 
the bearward submitted” (Lansd. MS. 88). 
This was not, however, until the proctor and 
the esquire bedell had had an awkward time of 
it. The crowd “added contumelous speeches, 
terming the proctour a petty officer, and the 
vice-chancellour’s man: whereat the standers 
by began to showte and laughe at the proctour.” 
As to that dignified University official, the 
bedell, he nearly took an active, but involuntary, 
part in the pastime, for the crowd “violently 
shoved and thrust the bedell upon the beare, in 
sort that he cold hardly keepe himself from 
hurt.” It may be remarked that Chesterton 
was always a favourite place for such sports; 
and that the University often had occasion 
to complain against the town how they 
“endevored, by theire bearebaytinge and bull- 
baytings, and such like vaine games, to hinder 
the quiet of the Universitie, and to draw over 
the students from their bookes.” 
Another, and safer place, for baiting the bull 
and the bear was on the top of the Gogmagog 
Hills. Till the middle of the eighteenth century 
there was no enclosure’ or plantation on the 
  
1 This enclosure has deprived us of what must have been 
the most striking spot, for scenery near and far, in the neigh- 
pbourhood of Cambridge. Every Cambridge man knows the
-P-A-G-E-128
    
120 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
site of the Duke of Leeds’ estate. The fine old 
British camp of Vandlebury, now hidden by the 
thick growth of trees, then stood out on the 
bare downs, as such camps commonly do; and 
the tracks, for there was no regular road, 
straggled over the grass and through the camp. 
This old camp was a very favourite place for the 
sport, and though the wily proctor may have 
lurked about the precincts of the town to inter- 
cept his prey, on its way out or back, it is not 
likely that he could effect much in such an open 
country. By an order of the Vice-Chancellor, 
May 29th, 1574, it is declared that “no scholler, 
of what degree soever he be, shall resort or 
go to any play or games either kept at Gog- 
Magog Hills or elsewhere within five miles of 
Cambridge.” 
The only game, in the modern acceptation 
of the term, which we know to have been 
largely played at this early date was football. 
Historians of cricket like to trace back the 
rudimentary forms of their science to an early 
date; but its subsequent developments have so 
altered its character that there is reason to 
  
magnificent view over the fens still obtainable near there ; 
but from the camp itself crowning the summit of the down, 
the view around must have been finer still. The spot, it may 
be added, is one known to ancient legend. Readers of Scott 
will recall the striking scene where Marmion rides into a 
Jonely moor at midnight, and blows his horn, to test the truth 
of the legend that he would encounter a ghostly knight with 
whom to break a lance. Many readers, however, do not 
know that the original scene of the legend—placed by Scott 
in the north of England—was this Vandlebury camp. (A full 
account of the legend has been given by Mr. A. Gray, Master 
of Jesus, in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian 
Society, No. LYIII.)
-P-A-G-E-129
  
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 121 
doubt whether we ought to use the same name 
to denote its earliest and latest’ forms. But 
that a game which a modern spectator would 
entitle, as did those who played it in the reign 
of Elizabeth, “football,” was popular, is toler- 
ably certain. I have no doubt either that this 
is the game referred to in Caius’ Statutes, 
under the term “pile reciprocatio.” It has 
been fondly and vainly translated “catchball,” 
but that Caius should definitely refer to it as a 
common practice, and prescribe that it should 
only be played in the College courts or gardens, 
and that no matches should ever be played with 
those outside the College, is proof of its popu- 
larity. And that such popularity cannot be 
ascribed to any other boys’ game in Elizabethan 
times seems fairly certain. 
Its early popularity is shown by a decree of 
the Vice-Chancellor, December 9th, 1580, which 
forbad any scholar “of what degree or condition 
soever he were, should at any place or at any 
time hereafter, play at the foot-ball but only 
within the precincts of their several colleges, 
not permitting any stranger or scholars of other 
colleges or houses to play with them or in their 
company, and in no place else. Andif any person 
being not adultus shall break or violate any part 
of this decree and order, he shall for every default   
1 Since the game really became “ Cricket” it has always 
been popular. The earliest local reference I have seen is in 
the Life of Henry Venn (student at Jesus, 1742-5). It is 
recorded of him that he was one of the best players in the 
University. Football, on the other hand, in spite of its early 
prevalence, seems to have died out absolutely for very many 
years, its present popularity being of recent origin (see the 
last article in this volume).
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
be openly corrected with the rod in the common 
schools by some of the University officers.” 
Anyhow “Fote bale” was freely indulged in, 
and matches with outsiders were carried on, all 
statutes to the contrary notwithstanding. The 
following report from the Vice-Chancellor to 
Lord Burleigh shows what sometimes came of 
these matches, and is an indication that Caius’ 
restrictions were not so foolish as they might 
be thought. It is a complaint against the con- 
duct of the parish constable of Chesterton, 
dated May 7th, 1581, about the same time as the 
bear-baiting incident. 
“Thomas Parishe, being head constable, 
dwelling at Chesterton when ther was a match 
made betwixt certayn schollers of Cambridge 
and divers of Chesterton to play at the fote bale 
abowt two years past, the sayd schollers resort- 
ing thither peaceable withowte any weapons, 
the sayd townsmen of Chesterton had layd 
divers staves secretly in the church-porch of 
Chesterton and in playing did pike quarrells 
agenst the schollers, and did bringe owte their 
staves wherewith they did so beat the schollers, 
that divers had their heads broken, divers being 
otherwise greatly beaten, wear driven to runne 
through the river, divers did cry to Parish the 
constable to keep the Queenes peace, who then 
being a player at the foote bale with the rest, 
did turne to the schollers willing them to keep 
the Queene’s peace, and turning himself to the 
townsmen of Chesterton willed them to beat 
the schollers downe.” Another witness deposes 
to the same effect :
-P-A-G-E-131
  
THF EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 123 
“When they were hotte in playe sodenlye 
one cryed Staves! and incontinently some came 
forth with the staves and so fell upon the 
schollers that they caused them to swymme over 
the water. And Longe John, servant to Mr. 
Brakyn, did folowe one Wylton, scholler of 
Clare, with a Javelyn; and if this deponent had 
not rescued him he beleeveth he would have run 
the said Wylton throughe.” For his behaviour 
on this occasion the Vice-Chancellor succeeded 
in having the constable sent to the castle. 
One recreation against which the University 
was especially severe was that of bathing. 
There is a decree of the Heads, May 8th, 1571, 
which is entitled, “That no one goe into the 
water.” It is announced that if any scholar go 
into any stream, ditch, or other piece of water, 
whether for swimming or bathing, by day or by 
night, within the county of Cambridge, he shall 
on the first offence be sharply and severely 
scourged, openly and publicly, in his college 
hall, in presence of all the fellows, scholars, and 
pensioners; and on the following day again, 
with similar publicity, in the Schools, before his 
lecturer and his class, by the proctor or his 
delegate, shall be scourged, no excuse or peti- 
tion to be listened to. On a second offence he 
shall be summarily expelled. 
This unusually severe regulation has given 
rise to comment, and has been quoted as an 
illustration of the narrowmindedness of the 
authorities. It is quite possible that the pro- 
hibition is partly due to the natural impulse 
of those in authority, when they hear that
-P-A-G-E-132
ee TT EL TC ET ey ee eae eee 
124 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
anything is being done, to send and tell the 
perpetrator not to do it. There was, however, 
somewhat more justification than is commonly 
supposed. There was no’ boating at the time, 
and therefore if any student went into the 
water it must have been for the purpose of 
bathing. And in the general absence of neigh- 
bouring ponds it would naturally be to the river 
towards Grantchester that they would resort. 
But a glance at the Grantchester parish register 
will show what a fatal place the river was then, 
as it has ever since been. Over and over again, 
both before and after this statute, is there an 
entry of such and such a student—sometimes of 
two or three together—being drowned within 
the bounds of the parish. In fact, as is well 
known, the repeated occurrence of such fatal 
accidents in recent years has requircd special 
regulations. I cannot but think, therefore, that 
this recognised danger had something to do 
with the prohibition, and was included amongst 
the “many and grave causes” which called it 
forth. It was the upper part of the river, above 
Cambridge, which was then, as now, the 
dangerous part, as it abounds with deep holes   
1 There may have been a little boating earlier; but, in 
the absence of references, I should conclude that it did not 
become common till the eighteenth century, and at first only 
by the use of sailing boats. There was fine scope for this, as 
the water communications in the neighbourhood were very 
good, and access was thus easy to Whittlesea Mere, the large 
Jake near Ramsey long since drained. John Venn, of Sidney, 
refers to such an excursion in 1782. It may be added that, 
in a diary by the same, we have one of the earliest references 
to boating on the upper part of the river: ‘‘ October 23, 1779. 
went in canoes up the Cam to Hauxton, with Gambier and 
‘Wollaston.””
-P-A-G-E-133

and is much choked with weeds. It was here 
that Byron’s friend and contemporary, C. S. 
Matthews, Fellow of Downing, an excellent 
swimmer, was drowned. His screams and 
struggles, when entangled in the weeds, were 
remembered many years afterwards by some 
who had been his contemporaries. The lower 
part of the river was kept clear by the constant 
barge navigation, and, being artificially widened, 
was comparatively shallow. 
The sporting undergraduate has always been 
amongst us, and in early times his opportunities 
in this way, so far as the authorities suffered 
him to cultivate them, were unusually abundant 
in the neighbourhood of Cambridge. Even as 
late as toward the end of the eighteenth century, 
Gunning tells us how, after lectures were over, 
he had only to go as far as the marshy ground 
—it commenced on the sight of the present 
Lensfield Road—to make tolerably sure of 
getting a shot at snipe. A few of the richer 
students probably indulged in the high amuse- 
ment of hawking—Dr. Caius expressly forbids 
the keeping of “fierce birds.” Some others went 
in for hunting and coursing—in 1606 the 
authorities issued an edict against those “ who 
have kept greyhounds and some of them 
hunting horses, for coursing and hunting.” 
It must be remembered that in that day and 
long afterwards—as we can see in Loggan’s 
maps of 1680—there was hardly anything but 
open ground—“the fields” as they were called 
—for many miles round Cambridge: and the 
limitless marshes were close at hand.
-P-A-G-E-134

Hunting and Hawking must of course always 
have been the amusements of the few, but the 
commoner sort had ample opportunities of 
indulging their taste. It does not cost much, 
as the modern schoolboy and those around him 
know, to start a catapult—and such, we may 
assume, was the nature of the weapon inter- 
dicted under the name of a “stone-bow ”—; and 
armed with this he could follow his prey in the 
marshes towards Trumpington and Cherry 
Hinton. In 1606 the University after reciting 
how “divers scholars, specially of late years, 
have used to shoot in guns, crossbows, and 
stone-bows, where they have wandered abroad, 
to the destroying of the game and mispending 
of their time, . . . . they shall incur the 
penalties specified”: i.e. if non adulti, of being 
corrected in the schools by the rod; and if 
adulti, of maken open confession of their fault 
in the said schools: in either case to lose a year 
for their degree. 
Most of the faults for which punishments 
are recorded in our books are not of a very 
serious nature, being generally the pranks of 
high-spirited or mischievous boys. For instance, 
we find a couple of youths fined, and threatened 
with rustication, for “ hollowing in the pump at 
night.” Doubtless they had found a place 
where there was a fine reverberation; and we 
may conjecture that the authorities, after long 
and frequent disturbance in their slumbers, 
having at last succeeded in catching the 
offenders, were determined to make an example 
of them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 127 
Perhaps the most characteristic distinction 
in the goings on in ancient days, as compared 
with modern, is to be found in the Christmas 
festivities. Instead of the colleges being, as at 
present, empty and silent at that season, they 
were full of youthful and noisy life. Owing to 
the difficulty and danger of long journeys in 
the winter months, most of the students who 
resided at a distance remained in College during 
this season. There they kept high festival. 
The hall would be at their service for masks 
and revels, and for many kinds of games: a 
good fire would be kept up in it for their 
comfort: cards even were allowed;—this is 
expressly mentioned by Dr. Caius in his 
Statutes, as a concession for the season; and 
doubtless many a song and story served to 
enliven the long and dark evenings. There are 
frequent references in our books and elsewhere 
which indicate what scenes of mirth and 
disorder the Christmas plays in the hall some- 
times led to. For instance, in 1579, the Vice- 
Chancellor complains to Lord Burleigh, the 
Chancellor, about the conduct of one Punter, of 
St. John’s, “he was detectid of much disorder ; 
as namely that he had uncased, as they call it, 
one of the stagekeepers of Caius College pluck- 
ing off his visor”; that he had then proceeded 
to make a disturbance at Trinity, and “had 
almost set that house and St. John’s together 
by the eares.” Finally, “to revenge himselfe 
for that repulse had prively crept into Benet 
College, and takinge upon him the habite ofa 
stagekeeper did assault one of Trinity, whom
-P-A-G-E-136
  
128 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
also he afterwards challenged into the fields.” 
Such an entry also as this, from our Bursar’s 
book of 1616, is probably by no means a solitary 
one, “ for mending the hall windowes broken at 
the comedie.” 
So much for the student himself and his 
ways in College. But two other closely con- 
nected questions may be asked, as to which 
there is so much prevalent misconception that 
it seems convenient to offer a few words of 
definite statistical answer. They refer to the 
comparative social status of the student in 
early times, and to the nature and locality of 
the schools at which he had been trained. If 
by “early times” we propose to go back 850 
years, to the days of Queen Elizabeth (quite far 
enough for present purposes), it may be asserted 
with some confidence that there is one, and 
only one, trustworthy source of information 
on these points. That source is the Caius 
College Admission Register, commencing in 
1560. There is here recorded, by the wise 
directions of Dr. Caius, full information as to 
every student; in respect of age, birth-place, 
parents’ name and status, and, what is rarer 
still, mention of the school, and often of the 
Master’s name, where he had been educated. 
As far as is known, no other college in either 
University has any records to compare with this 
in respect of completeness and antiquity. The 
Register has been published, so that the reader 
can, if he pleases, verify or amplify the facts 
adduced. 
The complaint commonly urged takes some
-P-A-G-E-137
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 129 
such form as this: that the Universities from 
having been once the studying places of the 
poor, have become the idling places of the rich. 
Rich and poor are comparative terms, and need 
some explanation, and reference to time and 
place. Of course the average student of that 
day was very much poorer than his modern 
representative. But then, asa rule, so was his 
father, and probably to at least an equal extent. 
For instance. Sons of the country clergy have 
for 800 years formed a large constituent element 
amongst the students. Let any one examine 
and analyze a number of the wills of country 
parsons of Elizabethan times and he will soon 
realize how great has been the advance in 
respect of ease and comfort. A similar com- 
parison would yield similar results in the case 
of the shopkeeper and the yeoman or farmer. 
If therefore class be compared with class there 
does not seem to be much difference between 
the past and the present. 
What therefore must be intended, or should 
be intended, is that the proportions in which 
the students were drawn from the different 
classes in question have altered, and altered to 
the disadvantage of the poor as compared with 
the rich. Now this is a question which, whether 
important or not, must really be settled by 
appeal to facts. At the risk of seeming para- 
doxical, it is here claimed that no intensity of 
political convictions will by itself suffice to 
answer the question. 
Let us start with 1564, by which time things 
were settling down after the religious changes 
K 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
130 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
of the previous reigns, and take the first hundred 
entries in which details are furnished. The 
result is as follows:—12 of the parents are 
described as “Esquire”; 17 are “gentleman”; 
8 are merchants or citizens of London; 4 are, 
respectively: nobleman, knight, doctor of medi- 
cine and doctor of divinity. The remaining 59 
are described by a customary term “mediocris 
fortunez.” It need hardly be said that all the 
really poor must be found amongst these latter. 
But many deductions would have to be made. 
For one thing some of the families thus referred 
to are included in the Herald’s Visitations, and 
were therefore armigeri or esquires. Again, 
there is abundant evidence to show that not a 
few were really well-to-do. For instance, Stephen 
Perse, the great Cambridge benefactor, belonged 
to a family which, judging by wills and similar 
evidence, ranked amongst the gentry. It is 
impossible to give convincing proof, but the 
general conclusion left on my mind is that, as 
regards class preponderance there is very little 
difference to be found between the past and the 
present. 
Take another batch, 20 years later, viz. from 
1584. The results are not dissimilar: viz. 26 
Esquires; 28 “gentlemen”; 41 med. fortune; 
12 yeomen; 9 clergymen (their sons are now 
beginning to become frequent); 6 London 
citizens; a sheriff; an LL.D.; and one described 
as “tenuis fortune.” ( 
Another way of regarding the subject is, 
instead of recording the social status described, 
to record the college status actually adopted.
-P-A-G-E-139
  
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 131 
We find 100 students thus grouped: Fellow 
commoners, 18; pensioners, 50; sizars, 87. This 
is a test of poverty, more than of social position. 
Sometimes the sizar was a younger brother of a 
pensioner; very frequently, especially in the 
following century, he was a clergyman’s son. 
The institution of sizars was the method 
adopted by our forefathers to enable poor men 
to obtain a College education. The sizar was 
boarded, lodged, and educated almost gratu- 
itously, and he had in return to give his services. 
Some were called public sizars. These did the 
work of butler and steward; they are of very 
ancient standing, coeval with the origin of 
colleges. The majority, however, were of some- 
what laterstanding. They were called “private,” 
or “proper,” sizars; and were assigned to the 
master, fellows, and fellow-commoners. They 
waited in Hall, and acted in every detail as 
valets to their employers. In all other respects 
they were treated as ordinary students. They 
underwent the usual examinations and exer- 
cises, graduated, obtained fellowships, and rose, 
according to their merits and capacity, to all 
the offices and dignities to which this was an 
entrance. Four out of the eight masters, who 
succeeded Dr. Caius, began their careers in this 
way. 
The successive steps of the change at Caius 
College are fully recorded in my Biog. History 
(III. 274). Till 1708, the sizars who had waited 
sat down at the fellows’ table, and finished what 
was left. In that year a separate table, with 
attendance, was provided for them: whether
-P-A-G-E-140
ee en ae 
132 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
the remains were dished up and warmed, is not 
stated. In 1767 they seem to have struck against 
waiting at table; it was then agreed, “to allow 
the butler £20, and the remainder of the com- 
mons, to provide two servants to wait at the 
fellows’ table.” The change of feeling towards 
the sizar, and his consequent revolt, seem to 
have been the product of eighteenth century 
practice and sentiment. In 1745 the sizars were 
forbidden to wear the same gown as the pen- 
sioners. In so far then as special provision was 
made for the encouragement of poor students in 
old times this was the plan adopted. And if, 
what is by no means certain, a larger proportion 
of poor was then admitted, it was due to this 
cause. 
All this is now a thing of the past; far 
removed from modern conventions. No one 
proposes to revive it. But when we pique our- 
selves upon the improved fellow-feeling to 
which the change is due, a few plain words 
seem called for. It need not be said that there 
is a lot of rough and menial work to be done, 
not only in a College but in the household of 
the most democratic of politicians, and in the 
rooms of the most reformed of clubs. The 
servants are doubtless treated with considera- 
tion and civility, but they are kept strictly 
apart, and no one will maintain that they are 
offered any prospect of advancement whatever 
except within their own department. 
Our forefathers adopted an intermediate 
plan. A certain number of selected servants 
stood also in the position of students, and  
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 133 
enjoyed all the substantial advantages of 
students. Their servitude was merely tem- 
porary. Not a few of them became Fellows and 
tutors of the College, and in the course of some 
years were in a position of authority :—very 
possibly over the sons of their former masters. 
Modern sentiment condemns this system. 
It regards the whole body of the students as a sort of family or society in a sense which can- 
not be predicated of a village, parish, or town; and holds therefore that social distinctions 
which are right enough in the latter must be excluded from the former. Our forefathers held 
that the distinction between the gentleman and 
the small tradesman was an unquestionable 
fact of life; why make a point of ignoring it in 
College ? 
How this difference of feeling has arisen is 
hard to say; but itis partly due, I suspect, to 
the growing love of athletics, and to the greater 
age and wider liberty of the students. These 
causes tend to throw the members of one 
college together into a more coherent body 
than was formerly the case. In ancient days 
there was very little of what we now under- 
stand when we talk of “College life.” There 
was no common boat or cricket club, no 
musical or debating society, from which the 
poor butler or steward would find himself 
excluded by having to work in the kitchen or buttery; or the “private sizar” from having to 
attend to his master’s wants. 
When we try to look at the matter from 
the point of view of our ancestors, another
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
consideration must be borne in mind. The 
position of “menial dependence” on the part 
of a youth, of the age of a student at that time, 
was not considered as at all degrading. Every 
one acquainted with the habits of the sixteenth 
and seventeenth century is aware that it was a 
common practice for poor relations to be 
employed in domestic service. And, to take a 
closer case in point, many of the younger sons 
of the gentry,—gentry in the strictest sense of 
the term, as being included in the Heralds’ 
Visitations, — were apprenticed to city mer- 
chants. The duties demanded of a young 
apprentice were, to say the least, as menial as 
those demanded of a college sizar. 
To sum up. The modern charge is that the 
sizar-system degraded a student to the position 
of a servant. The reply would have been that 
it raised a servant to the position of a student. 
Is it quite certain that the change marks the 
growth of real sympathy and appreciation 
between class and class? 
Where did these boys get their schooling, 
and what sort of knowledge did they acquire? 
The question is one of some literary interest. 
Everyone knows what a dispute has raged 
about Shakespeare’s opportunities in this way, 
and as to whether he really did pick up a little 
Latin and less Greek. Some, judging from the 
list of subjects directed to be taught at an 
important school, have gone near to assuming 
that he would have had the sort of chance 
which a boy would now enjoy, say, at Repton 
or Shrewsbury. Others have gone the length of
-P-A-G-E-143
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 135 
denying contemptuously that a local school 
at a place like Stratford could have taught 
anything worth mention. Here again it 
may be well to consult the statistical facts 
available. 
Had Shakespeare come to Cambridge he 
would have entered about 1579-80. I have 
selected 200 school-entries of nearly this 
date. They include the successive entries of 
pensioners and sizars; that is, the poorer class 
of.students. Fellow-commoners are omitted, 
because they did not come really for the 
purpose of study; moreover they were often 
even younger than the others, and had been 
instructed by a chaplain or tutor at home. 
Owing to repetitions these 200 represent the 
schools of 107 students. The lads must have 
mostly come straight from school, as many of 
them were only 14 or 15 at the time of entry; 
and few were over 16 or 17. 
The schools which head the list in respect of 
numbers are: Ely, Bury St. Edmund’s, Nor- 
wich, Stevenage and Saffron Walden. The 
following list comprises all others from which 
three or more students are recorded: Hast 
Dereham, St. Paul’s, Haton Socon, Eton, Mer- 
chant Taylors, Aylsham, Stevenage, Clare, 
Harrow, Grey Friars’ London, Ipswich, Holt 
(Norf.), Wisbech and Botesdale. Those, with 
one or two entries, are as follows: Aston, Ashby 
de la Zouch, Averham, Baldock, Barnard Castle, 
Bassingbourn, Bedford, Bennington, Belgrave, 
Boston, Boxford, Brandon, Brandsby, Braintree, 
Brentwood, Burton, Canterbury, Cambridge

bridge, Tuxford, Twyford, Walsingham, Walkern, 
Warcop, Westminster, Weston, Worsbrough, 
Wymondham, York. 
Such a list as this gives rise to some 
reflection, especially when it is compared with 
what a corresponding list of the present day 
would show. It is, of course, largely an East 
Anglian list, as is natural where Cambridge is 
concerned. Regarded as schools sending boys 
to College, many of the places mentioned will 
be strangely new to most readers. Of course it 
is not maintained that every one of them was a 
“school” in the strict sense of the word; it is 
possible that in some case it was a private 
venture of some local parish clergyman. But 
the fact remains that they were places where 
enough was taught to enable a boy to come up 
to the University. Wherever he was born he
-P-A-G-E-145
  
THE EARLY UNDERGRADUATE 137 
found such opportunities within a few miles of 
his house. 
So far as the Shakespeare problem is con- 
cerned, the answer seems decisive. Unfortu- 
nately Stratford is not in the list, for very few 
of our students came from Warwickshire. But 
it is incredible that that county town should 
not have afforded the facilities obtainable in 
scores of smaller towns and villages. 
Whatever the boys learned, or did not 
learn, at their school, it is quite certain that 
they must have acquired a fair knowledge of 
Latin. Most of them graduated and became 
parish priests. For their degree, and the pre- 
liminary exercises, that language was essential, 
and it was a common medium for use in the 
parish registers. Not afew became Fellows, and 
for all of these that language was one of daily 
use. They may not have been able to compose 
elegant verses in it, but they could mostly read 
and write it with ease. 
As feeders of the University many of these 
schools have quite dropped out. Some have 
actually ceased to exist; others probably have 
not sent a boy to college for 50 years or more. 
To what causes is this due? I cannot but 
think that the main reason is the deter- 
mination of the richer classes, quite irrespective 
of political opinions, to keep their sons apart, in 
schools by themselves. As there are not enough 
rich parents to support more than a compara- 
tively small number of schools, the rest are 
starved. The determining causes of the 
selection may be various; the accidental
-P-A-G-E-146
    138 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
presence of an unusually good master, a 
favourable position, or a better endowment. 
Some of the schools had a fixed sum of money 
left to them. As this fell in value all chance 
of getting good masters vanished; this was, for 
many years, the ruin of the Perse School, at 
Cambridge. In this relation two places in 
our list deserve a minute’s notice; Fulbourn, 
Cambs., and Tuxford, Notts. From the inform- 
ation of the Vicar, I learn that the endowment 
of the former had become so insignificant that 
permission was obtained to divert the money to 
the Board or parish school. Tuxford still has a 
school building and a master; but, for the same 
reason, it cannot attempt anything but a 
merely commercial education. Enquiry would 
probably elicit similar explanations in other 
cases.

ACADEMIC “SPORTS.” 
[Under this title were contributed from time to time short 
sketches of various eccentric members of the College. Such 
people hardly fall wnder the designation of ‘‘ Academic Life”’ ; 
but, as the reader will very likely not have made their 
acquaintance before, I have let them stand.] 
The “ sports” to be described here are not of 
the familiar sort which attract gate-money and 
lead to international rivalry. Any discussion of 
such as these would offer but small scope in the 
college history of centuries back. It is proposed 
to use the term rather in the botanical than in 
the conventional sense. We may take it for 
granted that the careers which a University 
training is mainly intended to encourage are of 
the sober, commonplace and useful kind. How- 
ever much we may admire eccentricity, we do 
not expect that foundations shall be endowed 
for the purpose of propagating it. Genius will 
always take care of itself, but the main crop of 
the academic tree must be regarded as consist- 
ing of the successful and worthy clergyman, 
lawyer, doctor and so forth. And whatever else 
may be the merits or demerits of those whom 
we propose to record here, they certainly do not 
belong to any of these classes. It was not in 
the expectation of such fruit that the tree was 
planted. 
Everyone who has been at school or college 
will have numbered amongst his acquaintance,
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
and perhaps amongst his friends, men of the 
general type which follows :—Men of uncertain 
habits and probably of picturesque career; 
whose stay in college was always precarious, 
and whose departure was often abrupt; who, 
whilst they were amongst us were probably 
seen more than they were heard by their 
lecturer, and heard more than they were seen 
by their dean. They are a godsend to the 
College Biographical historian in his generally 
rather monotonous task. 
1. A TURBULENT COUNTRY GENTLEMAN. 
In the seventeenth year of Queen Elizabeth 
a young gentleman from Nottinghamshire 
entered our College. His admission is thus 
recorded in our Register: “Gervase Markham, 
of Laneham, Notts.; son of Ellis Markham, 
Esq. School, Laneham, four years. At St. 
John’s College one year. Age 17. Admitted 
pensioner minor April 21, 1576. Tutor Mr. R. 
Swale. Assigned the first lower cubicle to the 
north, on the west side of the Caius Court.” 
The first thing to be noticed about the young 
man is that he is not the distinguished bearer 
of that name. There was a famous author, 
Gervase Markham, also of Nottinghamshire, and 
probably a connection’ of our man. He wrote 
a number of works on subjects which interest 
country gentlemen, and was, during the reigns 
  
} Sir Clements Markham informs me that he was a fourth 
cousin.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 141 
of Elizabeth and James, one of the principal 
authorities on the treatment of the horse and 
dog, on the management of cattle and tillage of 
the land, to say nothing of other subjects. Our 
man, though he was the occasion of vigorous 
correspondence on the part of others, did not, 
so far as is known, ever pen a line of his own, 
except in challenges to a duel and in one or two 
letters to evade taxation. 
He first became known to fame as one of the 
principals in the desperate duel, “so much 
talked of yet in these parts,” as the author of 
the notice in the old Biographia Britannica 
remarks. The duel arose from a family quarrel 
between Sir John Holles (father of the better 
known Denzil) and the Earl of Shrewsbury; 
the former having broken off a match with 
the family of the latter in a way which was 
violently resented. This was taken up by 
Captain Orme, a retainer of Holles, who at once 
fought with one Pudsey, gentleman of the horse 
tothe Karl. The result of this first affray was that 
Pudsey was killed. Then Markham must have 
his turn, and the historian tells us as follows :— 
“Gervase Markham was a great confidant, 
or, as the phrase is now, gallant, of the Countess 
of Shrewsbury, and was usually in those days 
called her champion. A proper handsome 
gentleman he was, and of a great courage. He, 
after Pudsey was slain, let fall some passionate 
words, accusing Sir John Holles as the cause of 
that quarrel, and as being guilty of his death. 
This coming to the ears of Sir John he sends 
him a cartel to this effect :—
-P-A-G-E-150
    142 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
For Gervase Markham. 
Whereas you have said that I was guilty 
to that villany of Orme in the death of Pudsey, 
I affirm that you ly; and ly like a villaine, 
which I shall be ready to make good upon 
yourselfe, or upon any gentleman my equal 
living. 
JOHN HOLLES. 
Markham returned for answer that he 
accepted the challenge, and would accordingly 
give a meeting at such an hour alone, or, 
with either of them, a boy of fourteen or 
under; the place Worksop Park, and the 
weapons rapier and dagger. Sir John Holles, 
allowing of the other circumstances, excepted 
against the place being the place where his 
mortal enemy the Earl of Shrewsbury then 
lived, which he thought neither reasonable for 
himself to admit, nor honourable for his enemy 
to propound, and therefore urged that a more 
equal place might be assigned. Markham, taking 
advantage of this as if he had declined the 
encounter, published it accordingly to his 
disgrace. Holles finding this unworthy dealing, 
and that he could not have an equal place 
assigned him, resolved to take that opportunity 
which fortune should next offer him, and such 
an one shortly after offered itself. To the 
Christening of his second son Denzil, the Lady 
Stanhope his mother-in-law was invited as 
god-mother; after which performed she returned 
from Haughton to Shelford. Holles, accom- 
panying her part of the way over the forest 
of Sherwood, it fortuned that Markham with
-P-A-G-E-151
. ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 143 
others of his company met them and passed 
by. So soon as he saw that Markham was 
passed, he took leave of Lady Stanhope, galloped 
after and overtook him. When, observing how 
unworthily he had dealt with him, they both 
alighted and drew their rapiers. I have heard 
him say (the writer was a cousin of Markham’s) 
that upon the first encounter he used these 
words, Markham, guard yourself better, or 1 
shall spoil you presently ;—for he said he lay 
as open to him as a child: and the next pass 
he ran him through (the lower part of his 
body)—up to the hilt, and out behind towards 
the small of the back. With this wound 
Markham fell, and was carried off the field by 
those in his company, whilst Holles, with his 
servant and a groom who only were with him, 
returned to Haughton. The news coming to 
the Earl of Shrewsbury he immediately raised 
his servants and tenants to the number of 
a hundred and twenty, with a resolution to 
apprehend Holles, so soon as he knew that 
Markham’s wound was mortal; which Lord 
Sheffield, afterwards Earl of Mulgrave, under- 
standing, he speedily repaired to Haughton, 
with three score in his retinue out of Lincoln- 
shire, to assist his cousin-german, in case the 
Earl should attempt anything. An old servant 
of Holles told me he was present when Lord 
Sheffield came, and that his master going forth 
to meet him, he asked him how it was with 
Markham, he replied that he thought the 
greatest danger was that he had spoilt his —— 
(misbehaviour). I hear, cousin, says Lord 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  
144 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Sheffield, that my Lord Shrewsbury is prepared 
to trouble you; take my word, before he carry 
you, it shall cost many a broken pate. And 
he went in and remained at Haughton until 
they had certain account that Markham was 
past danger, who indeed recovered and lived 
after to be an old man, but never after eat 
supper nor received the sacrament; which two 
things he rashly vowed not to do until he 
were revenged. 
Thus much of his history Carlyle was 
acquainted with, and in his Essays (IV. p. 316) has 
given, from the same source, some account of 
the duel. But he does not seem to have known, © 
though it would have much interested him, 
certain later experiences of this disreputable 
old gentleman. During his middle life 
Markham seems to have been in the army, 
and, on the authority of his tombstone, to 
have performed good services in Ireland and 
abroad. 
He finally appears, in the clear light of 
history, during the troublous times preceding 
the Civil War, when the “State Papers, 
Domestic” have a good deal to say about him. 
The Sheriff of the county writes (January 26, 
1635-6) that Markham will not pay his tax: 
“at the time of the assessment he found not 
any one refractory except Mr. Markham... . 
Out of £800 per annum in land, and as it is 
thought £40,000 in money, he spends not £40 
in all manner of expenses, and has none to 
leave all this to but two bastards that he will 
not acknowledge.”
-P-A-G-E-153
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 145 
This was in consequence of Markham’s reply to the Sheriff’s demand “If he had been com- manded to present to him his head, he would as willingly have done it.” A few days later he complains that Markham “had reproached. the Sheriff with ill language.” On this the Lords of the Council ordered him “to render satisfaction to the Sheriff, and to be conform- 
able, or to expect to be called to a strict account.” Next appears the sergeant-at-arms, who had a warrant from the constable to arrest the delinquent. But it does not seem that much came of this. It is reported (March 4, 1635-6) that “Markham is so infirm and useless in all the parts and members of his body that he is not portable to London. He has not been able to stir out of his chamber these five years, nor has he been able to come out of his bed these two years.” Apparently however the apparition of the sergeant was at last effectual, as a letter is sent by Markham himself (March 12) imploring the king’s pardon “in the humblest manner that his heart can devise,” and dated “from his poor house at Dunham.” It is plain from the terms of his letter that his refusal to pay the tax was due to no feelings of patriotism, but was the obstinate resolve of an old miser. His end was not far off; and the next, and last, that we hear of him, is the assurance of his monument, a stately erection in Laneham Church, that “he was captain of the Horse in the said county (Notts), who long served her Majesty in her war, with extraordinary proof, in Ireland, and the Low Countries.”

2. A SEMINARIST MARTYR. 
In a previous essay (An Elizabethan Episode) 
there are references to a supposed Popish priest, 
or spy, said to have been introduced and 
encouraged by the Master, and who was called 
Fingley. As no such name was to be found in 
our Admission List, there seemed at first some 
reason for supposing either the name was an 
alias, or that the imagination of the Protestant 
opponents of the Master had been allowed too 
free play. Such suspicions have been since 
found to be unjustified. John Fingley was a 
real person, and one of those—not few in 
number—who sealed their faith by martyrdom. 
He was a Yorkshireman, like the Master, Dr. © 
Legge, and the President, Mr. Swale, and was 
born at Barnby. Of his family nothing seems 
to be known; but, as he entered as a sizar, he 
probably sprang from a yeoman or trading 
stock, rather than from amongst the gentry 
who at that time formed the great bulk of the 
sympathisers with the Romish Church. He 
matriculated as a sizar, from Caius College, 
December, 1578; but, as already stated, his 
name does not appear in our Admission 
Register. This may have been an accidental 
omission, but in the light of subsequent 
disputes it looks more as if the registrar of 
the college had deliberately excluded him. He 
first appears as the sizar, or domestic servant, 
of Hugh Crescy, son of Nicholas Crescy, Esq., 
of Blyth, Notts.,a pupil of the Master. He was 
soon, however, taken up by Dr. Legge, who put 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 147 
him into the place of college butler. This was a very ancient office, dating indeed from the time of the original statutes of Bishop Bateman, and one which was always held by a student of the college. The butler and steward were what were called public Sizars, as distinguished from the private or proper Sizars who waited on the Master or individual Fellows. They had strictly defined duties in respect of looking after the amount and quality of the food supplied in college, and always ranked amongst the scholars. In fact they were termed pre- eminently “foundation scholars,” or “scholars of the college,” in order to distinguish them from those now understood by the name, and whose endowments were the results of private beneficence. As college officers they were appointed by the corporate body, and this was the ground of much of the complaint about the man in question, as the Fellows objected that Fingley had been unlawfully intruded by the Master’s sole authority. 
As regards his college career, our source of information consists of a quantity of depositions and complaints now preserved at the British Museum (MS. Lansd. 88). They are the outcome of one of those quarrels between Master and Fellows which seem to have been almost the normal state of things in former days. In this case the majority of the Fellows were much incensed against the Romish proclivities of the Master, who, they asserted, took every 
opportunity of encouraging Papistry. As to Fingley, they made up their minds that he was
-P-A-G-E-156
eT ee Ce 
148 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
a priest in disguise, and that he had been 
introduced into the college for the sake of 
performing private mass at the lodge, or the 
rooms of other secret Papists. In this com- 
plaint they were apparently anticipating, for 
he was probably not ordained till later, but 
there can be no doubt that they were right in 
their judgment of his sympathies and efforts. 
The following are the principal passages in 
their depositions—addressed to the Chancellor 
of the University—which refer to Fingley:— 
“Item. That one Fingley, belonging to the 
Master, and made butler of the house by him 
without consent of the Fellows, was a great 
perverter of youth in the house, and one that 
never came to prayers nor sermons, as the 
Master well knows, and yet greatly favoured by 
him.” . . . “That Barwick (one of the 
President’s pupils) made answer that he had 
heard there was a mass said by Fingley in our 
Master’s great chamber over the parlour.” 
. “That Sayre (a student who afterwards 
became a Benedictine monk) had been of great 
familiarity with Fingley, a pernicious Papist.” 
8 «That Fingley did first attend upon Mr. 
Cressy, the Master’s pupil, and afterwards upon 
the Master himself (i.e. as sizar), and that he 
was made butler of the house by the Master 
without consent of the Fellows, and contrary to 
the statutes of the college, which is a proof that 
the Master greatly favoured him, and that the 
common rumour was that the said Fingley did 
labour much to pervert youth secretly; and he 
well knoweth that the same Fingley came very  
-P-A-G-E-157
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 149 
seldom or never to prayers or sermons, neither 
did he ever hear the said Fingley was sent away 
by the Master on any displeasure, but that his 
lewd dealing being detected he ran away for 
fear of further punishment by others.” 
From all this it seems clear that Fingley was 
already an earnest and active supporter of the 
Romish cause. He came to the college just at 
the most critical time. The majority of the 
Fellows. were certainly on the Protestant side, 
but the heavy weight of the Master and 
President was in the other scale, or at least 
was supposed to be so; and this supposition 
was quite enough to bring to the college a 
crowd of young gentlemen—largely from the 
Master’s own county, Yorkshire—many of 
whom were avowed Romanists, and many more 
in decided sympathy with the old faith. 
Of Fingley’s subsequent career there is not 
much to say. It was very short, and ended, like 
that of two or three of his college contem- 
poraries, on the gallows. He appears to have 
resided within our walls for about three years: 
and then, for a short time, disappears from sight. 
He was admitted at Douay College, the principal 
training place for the seminary priests, February 
18th, 1579-80; where the Diary says of him, 
“venerunt ex Anglia duo juvenes, Christopherus 
Ingram et Joh. Fingley, Cantabrigienses, qui 
statim se Theologiw studio addixerunt, et ad 
communia nostra admissi sunt.” He was 
ordained sub-deacon, February 21st, 1580-1; and 
priest by the Bishop of Chalons, at Rheims— 
where the college was temporarily situated—
-P-A-G-E-158
    150 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
March 25th, 1581. He was sent to England, 
April 24th, 1581, just about the time when his 
name was being so much mentioned in the 
depositions above referred to. He does not 
appear to have revisited Cambridge: his name 
could hardly but have been referred to if he had 
—but probably went at once to his native 
county, Yorkshire, and worked there during the 
few years which were left to him. We catch 
one glimpse of him in prison, when he is 
referred to as “priest of God, put into a low 
prison, into a deep and darksome dungeon,” at 
York. Nearly all else that is known of him 
may be given in the words of Bishop Challoner, 
the historian of the sufferers belonging to the 
Romish faith. “After many labours in gaining 
souls to Christ in the northern parts of 
England, he was apprehended and committed 
to York gaol; and being brought up to trial was 
condemned for high treason, for being a priest 
made by Romish authority, and for having 
reconciled some of the Queen’s subjects to the 
Church of Rome. He was hanged, bowelled, 
and quartered at York, August 8th, 1586; and 
suffered death with a generous courage.” 
8. AN ASTROLOGICAL FELLOW. 
Towards the middle of Queen Elizabeth’s 
reign a young man from Yorkshire entered our 
College. His origin and training are thus 
described :—“John Fletcher; son of Thomas, 
husbandman. Born at Hebden, Yorkshire.
-P-A-G-E-159
    
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 151 
School, Leeds, under Mr. Hargraves, three years. 
Age 21. Admitted pensioner, February 5, 1577-8. 
Assigned a cubicle, with his surety Mr. Paul 
Gould, M.A., fellow.” He was a scholar on the 
foundation. Graduated B.A., 1580-1; and M.A., 
1584. Became a Fellow of the college about Lady 
Day 1587, and remained so till his death, October 
14, 1618. He held the college offices of catechist, 
bursar, and salarist; and was for some years a 
tutor in the college. He was buried in the 
college chapel, where there was formerly a 
monument to his memory. 
Such are the mere facts of his academical 
career; but he seems to have acquired a wide 
reputation, in England, in a department of 
Applied Mathematics never much encouraged in 
the University, and now discredited under the 
name of Astrology. He was, for instance, con- 
stantly consulted by Sir Christopher Heydon 
during the writing of his Defence of Judicial 
Astrology. We have now, in our library (MS. 
No. 78) nineteen letters to him from Sir Chris- 
topher, full of questions upon obscure points in 
his science :—these letters were doubtless placed 
there after Fletcher’s death. The father, it may 
be remarked, had chosen Fletcher as his son’s 
tutor, presumably on account of his special 
reputation. Most of these letters are occupied 
with technical points of no present interest, but 
there is an incidental remark in one of them 
which deserves notice. Sir Christopher asks 
Mr. Fletcher to cast his son’s nativity. This is 
a duty which seems to have dropped out of the 
modern round of college demands on the part of
-P-A-G-E-160
ee ee 
152 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
parents and guardians; though I have not the 
slightest doubt that our present indefatigable 
tutors would rise to the occasion at once, if the 
demand were made upon them, and cast the 
nativity of any pupil who would supply them 
with the requisite data. Ifthey want to do this, 
it may be remarked they have now the advantage 
of being able to employ Fletcher’s own astrolabe 
for the purpose. Fletcher’s reply as to young 
William Heydon’s future career is unfortunately 
not to hand, as none of his letters are preserved. 
This is a pity, for the young man’s career was a 
tragic and peculiar one, and would have given a 
good opening to the tutor for an exact forecast 
of his pupil’s fate. He fell in the ill-managed 
expedition to the Isle of Rhé under the Duke of 
Buckingham in 1627, where “he was carried by 
a rabble of flying soldiers into the sea, and there 
drowned.” 
At one time Fletcher came into a certain 
public notoriety, and a good deal is to be found 
about him in the State Papers, Domestic. In 
January, 1592-8, a certain Mrs. Jane Shelley, of 
London, got into trouble, or at least into 
suspicion about matters religious and political. 
It was an awkward position at any time in the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and especially so just 
after the time of the Armada. The exact 
grounds of suspicion against her do not appear, 
but. we gather that one person at least whom 
she consulted feared that “there would be alter- 
ation and rebellion before long.” Her own 
contention was that she had only wanted to 
know about her private affairs. She admitted  
-P-A-G-E-161
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 153 
that she “had a conference with Fletcher, of 
Caius College, said to be skilful in Astronomy, 
and moved him to set a figure how she should 
recover certain money and jewels; he told her 
that she could hardly get them, as Baxter (the 
delinquent) had pawned them.” (We are not 
told whether this was a scientific deduction on 
Fletcher’s part, from Astronomical data, or 
whether Mrs. Shelley had unintentionally let 
out the fact.) Then she enquired about her 
husband, “he being a prisoner and a dead man 
in law, and whether he would escape that year 
or the next, but he made her no answer.” Then 
she asked about her deed of jointure, which some 
one was keeping from her, but according to her 
account Fletcher here became still more oracular, 
for he only replied that “ knaves be knaves.” ~ 
The above is the lady’s account, from which 
one would almost gather that she had just run 
down by the morning train for a consultation 
with the occult authority. Really she seems to 
have paid a visit of some duration, and to have 
extracted a good deal of amusement out of it, 
considering her husband’s very awkward position 
at the time. 
Now follows Fletcher’s own defence, as given 
in his deposition before the Privy Council in 
London. I give a full copy of the original in the 
Record Office; the summary in the printed 
Calendar is not merely (as it should be) very 
brief, but by a blunder nearly all the most 
graphic part, referring to our College Courts, is 
attributed to some one having no connection 
with us. He says:
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
“February 17, 1592-3. Mrs. Shelley cam to 
my chanber about Midsomer was a twelve- 
month, and demanded of me how she might 
recover certaine things againe from a minister, 
Nathaniel Baxter, who had deceyved her of 
them: to whom I answered, to sue him in Lawe 
would tend to her great infamy, besides the 
charges. Then she said she had a good friend 
Mr. Pechover in London, to whom I counsalyed 
her to repair for his helpe. In my window laye 
some Goozeberyes latelie gathered, which she 
tooke and did eate. Thereupon, to pleasure her, 
I said that there were more in the garden’; 
whether she was willinge to goe. Wherafter 
she had gotten a few more goozeberies we 
walked four or fyve times in the alley. When I 
demanded of her whether she was widowe or 
wife; she said, I have a husband, yet as though 
I had none, seinge he is a dead man in lawe; 
and thereupon told me what had befallen her 
husband. Asked me yf I could tell whether her 
husband should escape deathe in Januarye or 
Februarye followinge, whereof she doubted. I 
answered that I was lothe to deale in such 
matters, and yet I could do her noe good except 
  
1 Presumably the same as the existent garden in the 
Tree Court. It was, of course, larger in those days, as, until 
the erection of our present New buildings, it extended as far 
as Trinity Lane. Being surrounded by a high wall it was 
well secluded. Very likely much of the rest of the Tree Court 
may have served the same purpose. This was mostly 
bought by Dr. Caius in 1565; but until the erection of the 
Legge and Perse buildings, some sixty years afterwards, was 
perhaps also used as a college garden. The hinges of the 
gates which closed it are still remaining inside the archway 
of the Gate of Virtue.
-P-A-G-E-163
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 155 
I had her husband’s nativitie; thinking thereby 
to shake off her question; so after that tyme 
she departed. An other tyme she cam to my 
chamber, but she would not staie, because she 
said Mr. Butler’ the physician had greatlie 
rebuked her for cominge to schollers’ chambers. 
So I walked with her abroad into the fields, 
where she was importunate with me to resolve 
her the question of her husband’s deathe. But 
I answered her that I could not pleasure her. 
Amongst other talke which I have forgotten 
she asked me if I had heard of a night spell. I 
said noe; for I never regarded such matters. 
“An other tyme upon a Sondaie in the 
afternoon, after sermon, she sent her laundresse 
to me to desire me to come to her in Mr. 
Bradshawe’s garden, to whom I answered that 
I was lothe to be seene with her so often alone, 
especiallie seinge I could do her no good; and 
bade her tell her Mrs. that now I could not well 
come, but an other tyme I would come to 
her. But Mrs. Shelley shortlie after sent one 
Tompson the clerke of St. Edward’s parishe, 
whom by chaunce she met in the street, to me 
againe to desire me to come to her in the 
foreseyd garden.’ Then to satisfie her, I went 
to her in the said garden; where she sittinge

brated physician of his age” (Cooper, Annals, III. 119). He 
was a fellow and benefactor of Clare College. 
2 The reference to the ‘alley,’ and to the likelihood of 
other Fellows coming in, make it plain that this garden is, as 
before, part of our Tree Court. I do not know what ‘ Mr. 
Bradshaw’s garden’ was: possibly an adjacent plot, or one 
now included in the ‘ president’s garden.’
-P-A-G-E-164
    156 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
and I walking up and down by her in a streit 
alley where twoe could not walke together, and 
said: ‘You will not sitt because I smell of 
garlick, which I have eaten to amend my 
stomacke.’ To whom I said, ‘I doe not like your 
physick, neither do I refuse to sit down there- 
fore, but because the seat would beraye my 
gowne; as also some of the house who might 
come into the gardeyn should not see us sitt 
together. Then after she tould me divers 
histories of persons and famylyes, who were 
decaied and overthrown (whose names I do not 
remember, not greatlie attendinge her speeche) ; 
but, said she, if troubles should arise those 
persons who heretofore had hardlie dealt with 
others might possiblie be hardlie dealt withall 
againe. To whome I said, asI remember, that 
it was not for her or me to deale in these 
matters, but praie to God that such troubles 
might not ensue; and those persons who now 
did most desire then might soonest feele smarte 
therefore. Amongst other speeches at lengthe 
she said: And in faithe what saye you of my 
husband. Whether shall he escape or noe? To 
whom I said: Mrs, I can doe you noe good in 
these cases. And nowe I must leave you, 
because I must go to praiers nowe att fower 
oclocke. And so I departed. 
“An other tyme she came into our colledge 
courte, and there walked a while ; and meetinge 
with a scholar of our colledge called Codlinge 
she sent him up to me to desire me to come to 
her in the court. When I came we walked a 
turne or twoe and then she rested in the porche
-P-A-G-E-165
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 157 
of the colledge called Porta Honoris, and took 
furthe a booke, whether printed or written I 
knowe not, and said, I have been readinge of 
this. At length she said: Seinge you will tell 
me nothinge, tell me what husband my mayde 
(whom I love) shall have; to whom I said, Yf 
you will be so good as bestowe some porcion on 
her to helpe her to a good husband, doubtless 
she shall doe well. I see, saieth she, you are 
not willinge to tell me anythinge, and so I 
leave you. And so departed discontented, since 
which tyme I never see her nor heare of her.” 
One would willingly have another glimpse 
of Mrs. Shelley; but unfortunately, History 
itself, like Mr. Fletcher, can only say that it 
“never see her nor heare of her” again. But 
it is a queer picture we get of this garralous 
dame fluttering down from London to our quiet 
college courts to consult the astrologer about 
her own property, and her maid’s prospects in 
life, and whether her husband was to leave her 
finally next January, by way of Tyburn. As 
she flirted, on a midsummer day, amongst the 
gooseberry bushes in the Tree Court, or on the 
secluded bench in the Gate of Honour (then 
generally kept shut), did it cross her mind that 
Fellows of colleges might marry,—some time 
after January, or when they had obtained a 
living? If so, she was disappointed, for Fletcher 
stuck to College, and died there twenty-three 
years afterwards. 
As I have said, Fletcher’s own Astrolabe is 
now in our Library, available for the use of his 
successors in the tutoriate. An expert in such
-P-A-G-E-166
  
  158 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
matters (Mr. Knobel), who has kindly examined it, has dated it about A.D. 1490; so it was already 
of some antiquity when it came into Fletcher's 
hands. It is referred to in the College Annais, where Fletcher is said to have given us a sphaera aenea cum capsula. The case is, I understand, a feature of considerable interest 
about the instrument, being a very fine specimen of stamped French leather work. 
4. A BisHop’s BuAck SHEEP. 
Soon after the Restoration a youth entered our college, whom Titus Oates must have looked up to as a senior, and from whom even 
he might perhaps have learnt something. His admission entry runs thus:—Francis, son of John Buxton, gent., of Edgefield, Norfolk. Born at Saxthorp. Schools, Holt and Norwich. Age 16. Admitted sizar, June 27, 1661, under Mr. Ellis. 
His career was an utterly shabby and dis- reputable one, but it helps to illustrate the times: and it certainly shows one of the difficulties under which ecclesiastical discipline 
had to be carried on in England. The racy and 
outspoken language of the Bishop, Dr. Lloyd, is perhaps the principal redeeming feature in the story. 
Mr. Buxton began badly whilst a student, for it is recorded of him in our Gesta (April 20, 1664), that he was “admonished the second 
time for a fault too gross and heinous to be recorded.” Presumably the supply of clergy
-P-A-G-E-167
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 159 
was short at this time, just after the Restora- 
tion, and the authorities did not see their way 
to being too particular. Anyhow this incident 
did not stop his career; for he graduated B.A. 
and M.A. in due course, and retained. his 
scholarship till 1668. 
We next hear of him as being ordained at 
Norwich (not by Bishop Lloyd): deacon, Jan., 
1678, and priest the following March, to the 
curacy of Runcton, Norfolk. What scandals 
he may have created there we have now no 
means of knowing, unless the parish register 
may throw any light on his misdoings. But 
a few years later we hear enough of his 
behaviour from the graphic pen of his diocesan. 
Amongst the MSS. known as the Tanner 
Collection, now in the Bodleian Library, are 
a number of letters from Dr. Lloyd, then 
Bishop of Norwich, from which the following 
extracts are taken. 
Writing to the Archbishop of Canterbury, 
February 22, 1685-6, he says: “There is an un- 
toward clergyman now in the gaol here whose 
name is Buxton. He is guilty of horrid 
villanies. He was suspended by Bishop Reynolds, 
excommunicated by Bishop Sparrow, and since 
my coming he hath . . . . He shot a brace 
of pistols at a shopkeeper in this city, charged 
with bullets; and the last week he quarrelled 
with a poor housekeeper here and smote him 
with a weapon called the Protestant Flail, and 
the poor man is desperately wounded. Upon 
this he was committed, and I told the justices 
not to bail him.” The Bishop then goes on
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
to enquire whether a cleric may be degraded 
in any case which is not capital. The next 
letter about him is a few months later, viz. 
June 4, 1686. “I had him safe in prison in 
the castle of this city (Norwich). But the 
King’s gracious pardon set him at liberty: and 
thereby insured him, as it did many more, from 
any further proceeding from me.” Buxton at 
this time was promising amendment, and was 
desirous of obtaining a licence to preach. 
Apparently he obtained it, after making public 
confession and recantation of his offences of 
drunkenness, profanity and incontinency. Once 
more the Bishop writes, April 1, 1687, as follows: 
“My old friend Buxton whose submission and 
confession your Grace hath seen, hath, in the 
Passion Week, adventured upon a clandestine 
marriage. The motive was five guineas, as I 
am informed. The young woman’s name 
was Mrs. Rant, an orphan, her portion £1500. 
I do not know what to do with the villain, 
for he hath neither benefice nor cure; and 
therefore no suspension but that of civil 
magistrate can reach him, viz. that sovereign 
one per collwm.” 
What became of Buxton after this we do 
not know. Perhaps he drifted up to London to 
enlarge his business of carrying on clandestine 
marriages. Those who think that the character- 
istics of the “Fleet Parsons,” as pictured by 
Fielding, Smollett and others, are exaggerated, 
will understand that, with a supply of recruits of 
this stamp from the counties, anything that the 
novelist has described could easily be paralleled.
-P-A-G-E-169

5. A BUCCANEERING PHYSICIAN. 
Amongst the irregular products of our University system Thomas Dover certainly 
deserves some recognition. His title is a three- fold one. As the inventor of the “powder,” he must be still familiar to the childish stomach, 
or to those who have the control of it. As an adventurous leader in a daring privateering,— 
one might almost say buccaneering,—voyage 
round the world, he greatly distinguished himself. Finally, though not “the only begetter” of Robinson Crusoe, he was at least 
an indirect progenitor of that famous solitary, for he was the actual discoverer of Alexander 
Selkirk on the Island of Juan Fernandez. 
Cambridge cannot claim the monopoly of Thomas Dover, so far as his early education is 
concerned. He came to us from Oxford, where 
he had spent some years, and had graduated in arts at St. Mary’s Hall. Apparently it was the medical reputation of Caius College which attracted him, for he resided some time with 
us and took his M.B. in 1687. From our matri- culation register, and other sources, we learn 
that he was a son of Captain John Dover, gentleman, of Barton on Heath, Warwickshire, 
and that he was baptized May 6, 1662. 
After obtaining his qualification here he seems for some years to have devoted himself to medical or surgical practice at Bristol. This great seaport was then, and had for long been, the starting point for some of the. most adventurous expeditions in which British 
M
-P-A-G-E-170
    
162 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
sailors have ever indulged. Dover must have 
lived in an atmosphere of narrative and rumour 
about the wealth of dollars which by judicious 
daring might be extracted from the pockets of 
Spanish dons in the South Sea. And doubtless 
he numbered amongst his patients not a few 
who had. been wounded in some desperate sea- 
fight off the Spanish Main, or brought home 
stricken with fever in some pestilential swamp 
of South America. Prominent amongst the 
names in the mouth of every Bristolian must 
have been the name of William Dampier, 
the famous buccaneer and circumnavigator. 
Though not of Bristol, he was a Somerset 
man, and had already distinguished himself 
by three daring voyages. 
Dover's first public appearance is in 1708. 
England was then at war with both France and 
Spain, and some of the worthy citizens of 
Bristol saw their way to serving their own 
country, or at least to filling their own pockets, 
by fitting out a small expedition to prey upon 
the Spanish towns and commerce on the West 
Coast of America. Some twenty of them com- 
bined, of whom Dover seems to have been one 
of the most important, from his stake in the 
venture or his personal influence, as he is 
called “President” of the party. Two ships 
were fitted out, The Duke of 800 tons with 30 
guns and 170 men, and The Dutchess of 270 
tons, 26 guns, and 151 men. The articles of 
agreement are fully given in the printed 
accounts, these mostly dealing, as might be 
expected, with the division of the prize-money,
-P-A-G-E-171
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 163 
or “plunder,” as they frankly call it. Dover 
had not apparently any sea qualifications, but 
several good men were selected for command. 
Woodes Rogers, already known as an explorer, 
was first captain of the Duke, Dover being 
called “second captain.” Edward Cooke, also 
an experienced man, commanded the Dutchess, 
whilst the famous Dampier was “pilot” to the 
expedition, as being already familiar with places 
to which they proposed to go. 
What strikes the modern reader is the 
almost incredible recklessness of the whole 
procedure. The smallness of their vessels may 
of course be taken for granted: the great 
Captain Cook, 50 years later, started in a ship 
not very much greater than the Duke. They 
knew almost nothing of the seas into which 
they were to penetrate. The position of Juan 
Fernandez, one of the places at which they were 
to call, was doubtful within several degrees of 
latitude and longitude. The Spaniards had been in nearly exclusive possession for two 
centuries, the seas swarmed with their ships, 
and the towns they proposed to attack were 
mostly fortified. They had few or no charts, 
and for such information as they could procure they mostly had to trust to catching a Spanish 
ship and taking their sailing directions from them. As to the crews who were to navigate 
these ships the following is the description given by their own captain: “many were 
taylors, tinkers, pedlars, fiddlers, and hay- makers, with ten boys and one negro; with which mixed gang we hope to be well manned

as soon as they have learnt the use of arms, and 
got their sea legs.” As to their cleanliness 
we have an indication during the customary 
“crossing the line” ceremony. It was the 
practice to hoist the novices half-way to a 
yard-arm and drop them into the sea. “This 
proved of great use to our fresh-water sailors, to 
recover the colour of their skins, which were 
grown very black and nasty.” Throughout the 
voyage the crew—as was said to be common 
with these privateers —were in a state of 
suppressed or open mutiny. They had barely 
reached the Bay of Biscay when, seeing a 
strange sail, they pursued and overtook it. As 
it proved to be from Sweden, a country with 
which England was not at war, it was let go. 
The crew at once mutinied, because they were 
not allowed to plunder the ship; “while I 
(Captain Rogers), was on board the Swede, our 
men mutinyed; the ringleaders being our boats- 
wain and three inferior officers.” The revolt 
was suppressed and the leaders put in irons. 
Some time after, Rogers tes, “a sailor 
followed by near half the ship’s company came 
aft to the steeridge door, and demanded the 
boatswain out of irons.”, So they went on 
during most of the voyage. The only resource 
of the captains, was, that when a seaman 
became too insolent to them or too friendly with 
his fellows they sent him from one ship to the 
other. Sometimes a large portion of the crew 
were thus shuffled. An occasional resource 
seems to have been to make one mutineer flog 
another, “which method,” says Rogers, “I
-P-A-G-E-173
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 165 
thought best for breaking any unlawful friend- 
ship amongst themselves.” And yet, somehow, 
with traditional luck and pluck, they muddled 
through. They circumnavigated the world in 
@ more than three years’ voyage. They braved 
the terrors of Cape Horn; they stormed a forti- 
fied city; they took many prizes; they crossed 
the vast expanse of the Pacific,—during nearly 
two months they did not apparently sight a 
ship or an island;—and they reached home 
with both their ships and much the greater part 
of their crew. One point deserves notice. The 
sickness on board was very slight for those days. 
It was indeed insignificant when compared 
with that which befell Lord Anson’s similar 
expedition which was fitted out at national 
expense, and regularly commissioned, some 80 
years later; but then Anson does not seem to 
have taken the precaution of securing the 
services of a Cambridge M.B. 
Dover’s actual position in the expedition is 
not clearly defined, but there can be no doubt 
that he was one of the leaders. At the same 
time, though they had ordinary surgeons on 
board, he seems to have been always appealed to 
in case of emergency. As may be supposed, con- 
sidering the times and the sort of crew with 
whom he had to deal, his methods were not of 
the mildest. At Quayaquil they encamped near 
a@ mass of putrefying corpses, and some days 
afterwards, when they were at sea, what seems 
like an attack of plague broke out on board. He 
dealt with the patients as follows: “I ordered 
the surgeons to bleed them in both arms,—(the
-P-A-G-E-174
Te ree ee ee ee ee ee 
166 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
patients were over 180 in number),—and to go 
round to them all, with command to leave them 
bleeding, till all were blooded, and then come 
and tie them up in their turns. Thus they lay, 
bleeding and fainting so long that I could not 
conceive they could have lost less than an 
hundred ounces each man.” According to him 
this treatment was completely successful. He 
lost only seven or eight of the whole number, 
and these he says perished because their mess- 
mates would dose them with rum. 
We have two detailed accounts of the expedi- 
tion, one by Captain Rogers, and the other by 
Captain Cooke, which, like all these first-hand 
narratives, are of extreme interest; but there is 
only space here to describe one or two incidents, 
in which Dover took a prominent part. 
After the customary difficulties in rounding 
Cape Horn, during which they got as far south 
as nearly 62°, “which, for aught we know is the 
furthest that anyone has yet been to the south- 
ward,” and after considerable perplexity as to 
the exact position of Juan Fernandez, they at 
last hit that island on the morning of Jan. 31, 
1709. A light being seen on the island they had 
some suspicions that a French or Spanish party 
might be there. Accordingly Dover, with a 
small armed body of sailors landed in order to 
reconnoitre. The result was “our pinnace 
returned from the shore, and brought abundance 
of crawfish, with a man cloth’d in goat-skins, 
who looked wilder than the first owners of 
them. He had been on the island four years and 
four months. . . . His name was Alexander  
-P-A-G-E-175
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 167 
Selkirk.” Thence Robinson Crusoe; though, as 
is well known, Defoe placed his hero on the 
opposite side of America, near the mouth of the 
Orinoco’. 
After spending some time at Juan Fernandez, 
in order to recover from the hardships of their 
passage round the Horn, Dover and his com- 
panions set to work on their real business, the 
plunder of the Spaniard. “In the hopes of 
seeing rich ships either going or coming out of 
Lima: the men beginning to repine that, tho 
come so far, we have met with no prizes in 
these seas.” We find such entries as these in 
Captain Cooke’s journal: “Our prisoners in- 
formed us that a Bishop was coming by sea 
from Panama to Lima, carrying 200,000 pieces of 
eight and a good quantity of plate of his own.” 
He directs one small ship “to cruise with 30 
men for the Bishop above mentioned.” But his 
lordship, unfortunately, caught the alarm and 
stayed on shore. In what was doubtless the 
great object of their ambition, that which had 
fired the imagination of buccaneers, privateers, 
and regular service men for a century, they did 
not succeed. They could not catch one of the 
  
1 Juan Fernandez was at that time entirely uninhabited, 
and only visited at rare intervals by Spanish ships. It lies 
more than 200 miles off the coast of Chile. Several charac- 
teristics of the Island life are reproduced in Crusoe, for. 
instance the presence of goats, and Selkirk’s activity in 
running them down. But there was one detail which must 
have struck Defoe’s fancy, though such a stickler for apparent 
truth could not introduce it into fiction. The island swarmed 
so with cats that they were a main article of diet. Shelvocke, 
a few years later, reports ‘‘they are so numerous there is 
hardly taking a step without starting one.’ Some passing 
ship had once lett a pair there.
-P-A-G-E-176
    168 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
great Spanish galleons which annually crossed 
the Pacific from Acapulco on the (now) Cali- 
fornian coast to the Phillipines, loaded with 
gold and silver. They had not the luck of 
Drake, Dampier, or Anson. But they did not 
do badly on the whole. They picked up a num- 
ber of unconsidered trifles, in the way of coasting 
vessels, each affording its share of plunder; and 
they made two more serious attempts on what 
were called “Manilla ships.” These seem to 
have been the vessels which brought supplies 
‘from the East Indies—the Phillipines, etc.—to 
the towns on the West coast of America. They 
were poor spoil in comparison with those which 
sailed the other way, carrying back the treasure 
from the mines of Peru and Mexico, but they 
were well worth incurring some risk. The first 
of these which they attacked was taken with 
little trouble or loss, as it was only of about the 
strength of one of their own. With the second 
they were less successful. It was a ship of 900 
tons, with 60 guns, and a crew of 450, and their 
total available strength was under 120 men. 
Moreover their largest round shot were six- 
pounders, which, as they say, did very little 
damage to the galleon. After along and despe- 
rate engagement, and repeated attempts to 
board, they were obliged to bear off, having lost 
a number of men, and with their captain, Rogers, 
badly wounded. 
Their principal exploit in the South Seas was 
unquestionably the capture of Guayaquil, an 
important Spanish town in what is now Ecuador. 
In this, Dover took a prominent part; in fact, if
-P-A-G-E-177
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 169 
we were to trust his own words written late in 
life—“ when I took by storm the two cities of 
Guaiquil”—we should have to conclude that he 
was sole leader. On the other hand, Rogers 
considered that Dover nearly spoilt their chances 
by advocating delay when they found that the 
town was alarmed. ‘Captain Dover, the doctor 
of physic”—the seaman is fond of a gibe at the 
physician—“and he fell into a debate of above 
an hour as to whether to attack the place then 
in the dark during this first alarm or not.” The 
majority decided for delay. A ransom of 40,000 
dollars was proposed at first; but finding that 
the Spaniards were using the delay to carry off 
their plate and jewels into the forest, they pro- 
ceeded to attack. The result was what it 
generally was when a party of these desperadoes 
fell upon a fortified Spanish city. They took it 
at once by storm, with insignificant loss. In 
fact they had but two men wounded, and one of 
these by their own fire. They then proceeded 
to get what they could in the way of plunder, 
in which respect they seem to have done fairly 
well, for two young officers “brought back with 
them gold chains, plate, &c., to the value of over 
£1,000.” Having taken the city they recom- 
menced the dispute about the ransom. The 
Spaniards offered to pay 80,000 dollars in 12 days, 
but, suspecting them of a design to send to 
neighbouring cities for succour, the Englishmen 
declared that “they would see the town all on 
fire by three that afternoon unless they agreed 
to give sufficient hostages for the money to be 
paid within six days.” This was agreed to; and
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
the party left the town, grumbling much at the 
thought of how much more they might have had 
but for the misjudged delay in assaulting the 
town. “I was well assured from all hands,” 
says Rogers, “that at least we should then have 
got above 200,000 pieces of eight (i.e. dollars) in 
money, and a greater plenty of such necessaries 
as we now found.” The terms of agreement are 
duly given in Rogers’ narrative. “Whereas the 
City of Guiaquil, lately in subjection to Philip 
V, King of Spain, is now taken by storm and in 
the possession of Captains Thomas Dover, Woodes 
Rogers, and Stephen Courtney, commanding a 
body of Her Majesty of Great Britain’s subjects, 
&e., &¢.” 
After leaving Guayaquil they cruised about 
off the American coast for nearly nine months 
in the hope of securing one of the great Manilla 
galleons. In this, as already stated, they were 
only partially successful. But they picked up 
a number of small prizes, one of which was 
converted into a third cruiser, and put under 
the command of Dover. The selection of a 
commander by the vote of the majority of 
those under him seems to have been a common 
practice in these semi-buccaneering expeditions. 
Rogers strongly objected to the choice, his 
objection being “that owing to his violent 
temper capable men could not well act under 
him, while as a Dr. of Physick he was incapable 
as a seaman himself.” 
At last, on the 11th of January, 1710, they 
started to cross the Pacific. On the parallel 
of latitude they took, the distance to the first
-P-A-G-E-179
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 171 
land they seem to have sighted was between 
6000 and 7000 miles. They had no charts; 
had they met any other vessel it would certainly 
have been a hostile one; and one of their small 
ships was so leaky that the pumps had to be 
constantly at work, “which labour, together 
with being on short allowance, makes our 
people look miserably.” We can well believe it. 
After two months of this lonely voyage 
they reached Guan, one of the Ladrones: 
islands which are now in possession of 
Germany but then belonged to Spain. It is 
an extraordinary illustration of the free and 
easy way in which war was then made in the 
remote regions of the world that whereas on 
the Eastern parts of the Pacific they had been 
in constant and deadly warfare with the 
Spaniards, they found it convenient to adopt 
a different plan on approaching the Western 
parts. They mustered up their best knowledge 
of the language and sent a “civil request” to 
the Governor of the island, to the effect that 
“we being servants of her Majesty of Great 
Britain, stopping at these islands on our way 
to the East Indies”—a rather odd statement 
of the main object of the expedition—* will 
not molest the settlement provided you deal 
friendly with us, &c.” No objections were 
raised by the Spaniards, who at once sent them 
some much-needed supplies, so that, as Rogers 
says, “ being now arrived at a place of peace and 
plenty we all became indifferent well reconciled 
among ourselves.” In fact so friendly did the 
relations become that the privateers invited the
-P-A-G-E-180
    172 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Governor and a party of Spanish gentlemen to 
an entertainment on board one of the ships, 
“where we all met and made them as welcome 
as time and place would afford, with music and 
our sailors dancing.” Probably all the time the 
guests had a shrewd suspicion as to the cargo on 
board, which their hosts had picked up “on 
their way to the East Indies.” 
After thoroughly enjoying themselves at 
Guan they started homewards by way of 
Batavia. Hereabouts, on the 17th of June, 
1710, they met the first ship bound from Europe 
since they started from Bristol in August, 1708. 
From her they learnt, amongst other facts of 
interest, that England was still at war. After 
another three months’ voyage, and encounter- 
ing innumerable dangers and hardships, they 
brought their leaky ships to Cape Town: “the 
Duke having three feet of water in her, and her 
pumps choked.” There they delayed for nearly 
three months, and at last set sail for home: 
this time in company with a number of Dutch 
East Indiamen and several English ships. 
They approached England by way of the West 
Coast of Ireland and the Shetland Isles—pre- 
sumably to avoid hostile cruisers—and reached 
the Thames, October 14th, 1711. 
How far the expedition was successful 
pecuniarily, we do now know; but for certain 
hints by subsequent adventurers we should 
conclude that it led to much dispute and dis- 
appointment. 
After his return Dover seems to have settled 
down to a professional life in England. Though
-P-A-G-E-181
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 173 
he never proceeded to M.D. he obtained recogni- 
tion from the College of Physicians, and 
practised in various parts of the country. It 
may be well supposed that a man of his 
character and antecedents was not likely to 
lead a strictly conventional life. In fact he 
seems to have been in constant disputes with 
the regular physicians. What we know of his 
after life is mainly derived from his Ancient 
physician’s Legacy to his country, of which the 
sixth edition appeared when he was nearly 80. 
It belongs to the class of The Family Doctor 
rather than to that of the professional treatise, 
and abounds with such personalities as this: 
“The case of Miss Corbet was so very remark- 
able that it made a very great noise all over the 
town, insomuch that the gentlemen of the 
faculty seemed to be much alarmed. The 
Right Honourable and Lady Louisa Berkeley, 
being left off by other physicians; and the 
Right Honourable the Lady Rachel Manners 
being likewise left off by her physicians, it was 
agreed on all hands that I kept them alive 
several days longer than was expected by any 
person about.” These were some of his few 
admitted failures. In other cases he describes 
minutely the symptoms of patients whose 
names and addresses he gives. 
He was generally known by the name of the 
“Quick-silver doctor,” from his fondness for 
prescribing this drug. The following is his 
recipe for Asthma: “In the removing of this 
disease, I don’t remember an instance of my 
failing in the cure of any person who has
-P-A-G-E-182
  174 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
applied to me for relief. I make use of this easy 
remedy: An ounce of quicksilver every day, to 
be taken at what hour the patient pleases and 
a spoonful of the gas of sulphur in a large 
draught of spring water at five o’clock and at 
bed-time.” As it happens, his ‘“Powder,’— 
which Dr. Norman Moore tells me is still 
substantially the same composition as that 
which Dover prescribed—is all by which his 
name is now generally known. When and 
where he ended his varied and adventurous life 
I have not been able to discover. 
(Since the above was written some further 
facts have been ascertained. It seems he was 
buried at Stanway, Gloucs., Ap. 15, 1742. For 
this, and other family facts I am indebted to 
Dr. J. A. Nixon. See his account in the Bristol 
Med. and Chir. Journal, March, 1909.) 
6. A BARBARY SLAVE. 
A Modest Vindication of Titus Oates, the Salamanca Doctor, 
Srom Perjury: Or an Essay to Demonstrate him only 
Sorsworn in several Instances. By Adam Elliott, M.A., 
1682. 
Such is the title of a pamphlet which 
contains much matter of interest—not merely 
to readers of a College magazine, in consequence 
of the local connections of the two persons 
principally concerned in it—but to all who are 
interested in the social and political history of 
the time; in which respect it would be difficult 
to find any more graphic description of the
-P-A-G-E-183
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 175 
perils which stood in the way of travellers 
by sea in former days. 
The immediate object of the work—which it 
must be remembered was published several 
years before Oates’ judicial condemnation, and 
at a time when he was still in great popular 
repute—was to cleanse the author’s character 
from some splashes of the filth which Oates 
had been casting upon so many of those who 
had the ill-fortune to come within reach of his 
‘shovel. Elliott was charged with being “a 
Mahumetan, and thereupon circumcised”; and 
also with being a Jesuit and a Popish priest. 
On this latter charge, as a capital one, Elliott 
remarks: “I must indeed confess that of all 
kinds of death I have the least fondness to be 
hanged, and I hate mortally that the butcherly 
Executioner should be rummaging amongst 
my Entrailes; neither can I apprehend any 
pleasure in being drawn up Holborn Hill upon 
a hurdle.” In addition to the more serious 
charges, Oates declared that he had known 
Elliott as a bad subject since their College 
days, when “the sayd Elliott robbed a study 
in Caius, and would have sold the deponent 
some of the books; that he hath confessed 
that he went a deer-stealing”; and that he was 
a@ sizar “whose maintenance was withdrawn 
for his rude, riotous and debauched living, 
etc., etc.” 
To all this Elliott—very sensibly remarking, 
“T had rather the Doctor should swing than I” 
—replies with a counter-statement of some of 
Oates’ perjuries, and with a brief narrative of
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
his own life and adventures during the time 
in question. The following pages are extracts 
made from this narrative :— 
“Tn the year 1664 I was admitted into Caius 
Colledge where I continued until 1668; when 
Commencing Batchlour of Arts I obtained 
Letters testimonial from our Colledge, and 
then left the University. During my stay 
there, I remember Titus Oates was entered; 
by the same token that the Plague and he 
both visited the University in the same year. 
He was very remarkable for a Canting Fanatical 
way conveyed to him with his Anabaptistical 
Education, and in our Academical exercises, 
when others declaimed Oates always preached ; 
some of which lectures, they were so very 
strange that I do yet remember them. 
“In the beginning of 1669 I had the oppor- 
tunity of travelling with some gentlemen of 
my acquaintance, with whom, after a transient 
view of Flanders, which had been the seat of 
war for some years preceding, I had the 
opportunity to see St. Omers also, where 
Oates was once a school-boy. I remember, 
during my stay there, we were civilly invited 
to dinner to the English Colledge; where, to 
give the Devil his due, we met with nothing 
but learning and civility. About November we 
came to Rome; where I saw that Great Beast 
of a Whore, as Oates called him, a Reverend 
old Gentleman Rospigliosi who then was Pope. 
He happened to die a little after my coming 
thither, which was the occasion of my fortune 
to stay here during the election of another Pope.
-P-A-G-E-185
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 177 
“About March, 1670, I parted from Rome; and 
intending home again for England I came to 
Leghorn, where finding an opportunity of the 
Bristol, one of His Majesty’s Friggots, I had a 
convenient passage to Alicante in Spain, and 
from thence to Malaga. About the beginning 
of May I had a curiosity to see Seville; from 
whence I took my course directly to Lisbon. 
There was at that time no vessel designed for 
England in the river of Lisbon, excepting a 
little Ketch called the John of London, laden 
with oranges and lemons, and I was very 
desirous to return home; so that I was obliged 
to take my passage in that small vessel, some 
who seconded my desires alledging that I 
should be more secure in her than in a bigger, 
because she by reason of her smallness would 
keep near the Coast and so out of danger of the 
Turks. It was about the middle of June, 1670, 
Three days after that we met Sir Edward Sprag 
with his squadron, who encouraged us with the 
news that no pirats were in those seas, he 
having lain there about a month; upon which 
we struck out tosea. By the 22nd of June we 
had got no farther than Cape Finisterre; on 
which day, whilst the master and I were at 
breakfast, a Boy who sat at the Helm cried out 
a Sail. By our Glasses we perceived she had a 
mind to speak with us, for she had got out all 
her sails and bore down upon us directly before 
the wind. About ten a-clock up comes the Ship 
with French colours: as soon as she came near 
us, so that we could not escape, she pulled down 
her French and put up her Salle colours, and 
N
-P-A-G-E-186
    178 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
withall gave us a Gun which obliged us to 
strike: Immediately appeared upon the Pirat’s 
deck about 200 Moors, who commanded us to 
put out our Boat and come aboard them. For 
our welcome, and to show what entertainment 
we were after to expect, the Master of the 
Vessel and myself were stripped and tyed to 
the mast in order to be whipped, that so they 
might extort a confession where the Money lay 
hid, if we had any. We satisfied them that 
they were Masters of all in our Vessel; and so 
we were released from the Mast and put in 
Irons below deck. Our cruel and merciless 
Masters, when they heard us complain of our 
condition, would visit us with blows, insulting 
most intolerably over us, lifting up our dejected 
heads and spitting upon our Faces, not vouch- 
safing us any other Name than Dogs. 
“We lay in this miserable condition about 
forty days, oppressed with many inconven- 
iences, so especially I remember with the stench 
of our lodging. Sometimes in the day we were 
permitted to come above deck, to suck in a little 
fresh air, and to wash ourselves; but this small 
comfort was soon forgot by returning to our 
jrons. There was scarce a day almost, accord- 
ing to my remembrance, in which we did not 
either give chase or else were chased ; for the 
Salle man was a good sailor and whenever she 
saw a Sail she immediately made after her; if 
she found her too strong to grapple with, then 
  
1The student of History will remember that it was by a 
“‘Sallee Rover”, a few years before this date, that Robinson 
Crusoe was captured.
-P-A-G-E-187
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 179 
she tacked and stood away. At length one 
morning, when there was little wind stirring, 
we were called up upon the Deck, I thought it 
had been to refresh ourselves, but we found it 
was with labour and toil, for there being a great 
calm all that day, we were obliged to tug hard 
at the oar till ten at night; at which time we 
came up with a French Merchant laden with 
oyl, whom we had been in pursuit of all that 
day. As soon as we came near her, we poor 
Christians were remanded to our kennel. A 
little after, three and twenty Frenchmen had 
the unhappiness to make us a visit, and take up 
their lodgings in the same quarters. It was but 
a miserable comfort methought to have such 
companions in misery, and truly the sight of so 
many dejected souls, particularly a merchant 
(who lost 2500 crowns of cash, besides his 
concerns in the cargo) affected me then with a 
more sensible grief than my own sufferings. 
We were all lodged equally; that French 
gentleman and the meanest of the seamen were 
treated alike: which subjected him to such a 
grief that was too powerful for him, so that at 
length it broke his heart, for he died the next 
day after we landed. 
“At length we came within sight of the 
Castle of Salle. Presently there starts up a 
vessel that made all the sail she could at us, 
and obliged us to tack about and strike down 
along the Barbary Coast. She put us so hard 
to it that we were forced to forsake the 
French Prize and leave her to be picked up 
by our pursuer, which was an English ship
-P-A-G-E-188
    180 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
called the Holmes Frigot, of two-and-twenty 
guns, whom afterwards I saw at my return at 
Cales. Whilst she was employed in taking the 
prize the Salleman in the interim made away, 
and night approaching, in the dark made her 
escape. 
“The next morning all we Christians were 
commanded a-shoar. There they landed us in 
number two-and-thirty. We were above two 
days travelling the twenty leagues. The best 
water we met with was very brackish; our 
provision which our Masters allowed us, when 
we parted from the ship was all devoured the 
first day. Our condition indeed during that 
journey was the most deplorable that ever I 
was in; for our short commons and hard 
lodging aboard the Ship had much weakened 
our bodies; we were very hungry and had no 
meat, exceeding thirsty and for a whole day 
no water, the Sun was very hot and no shelter, 
the Heavens looked like brass and the Earth 
like iron. When night approached our Guides 
made us take up our lodging where there 
were a few shrubs which we set on fire to 
secure us from the lions and other beasts 
of prey, as Wild Boars, of which we saw 
several on our way. 
“At length upon the third day we came 
within sight of Salle, where we were permitted 
to refresh ourselves for two hours before 
we made our public entry into the City, 
which was indeed extraordinary; for we were 
accompanied by several hundreds of idle 
rascally people and roguish boys who came
-P-A-G-E-189
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 181 
out of the town to meet us and welcomed 
us with horrid barbarous shouts somewhat 
like the Irish hubbub. We in the mean time 
were forced like a drove of sheep through the 
several streets, the people crowding to gaze 
upon us and curse us. At evening we were 
conveyed to our Lodgings. It was a large Cellar 
under the Street, arched and supported with 
two rows of pillars; the light it was furnished 
with came through three holes in the street 
strongly grated, through one of which by a 
Ladder of Ropes, we descended into this Room 
called the King’s Masmora, capacious enough 
to hold 800 persons (for very near that number 
of Christians were shut up there at night) 
besides a whole Leystall of filth, in which 
(whosoever’s lot it is to be there) he must 
wade up to the ancles. There I watched all 
night, for sleep I could not. 
“By Sun-rising next morning we were driven 
to a Market-place where the Moors sitting 
Taylor-wise upon Stalls round about, we were 
severally run up and down by persons who 
proclaimed our qualities or trades. I had a 
‘great Black who was appointed to sell me. 
this fellow, holding me by the hand, coursed 
me up and down from one person to another 
to examine me what trade I was of, and to 
see what labour my hands were acccustomed 
to. All the seamen were soon bought up, it 
was mid-day ere I could meet with a purchaser; 
the reason was, a boy of the vessel wherein I 
was taken, in hopes of favourable treatment 
from the Captain who took us, pretended to
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
discover my quality to him, assuring him 
that I was a relation of the now Duke of 
Norfolk. Upon this information the Captain 
put a great value upon me, and that was the 
reason why none would meddle with me; 
until about noon Hamed Lucas (who is 
secretary of the present embassy from the 
Emperor of Fez to his. Majesty) paid down 
600 pieces of Hight for me. 
“I was pretty well pleased with my fortune 
to fall into the hands of such a person, and 
hoped for favourable treatment from him; 
but other Christians who had heard of 
this patron of mine pitied my ignorance, 
as knowing that he was a cunning Jewish 
Merchant, and that he bought me with a design 
to extort from me a great Ransome, though by 
the harshest and cruellest usage imaginable. 
This I found to be too true a character of him 
before night; for after he was come to his own 
house he presently makes me acquainted with a 
piece of his mind and temper telling me that he 
would have me know that I had to do with a 
man with a beard, and who was too cunning to 
be imposed upon. I endeavoured all I could to 
disabuse him, and possess him with a clear 
notion of the naked truth in regard to. my 
poverty; that I should very much contribute to 
the calling in question his prudence and judg- 
ment, because all the town will admire that the 
- wise Hamet Lucas was imposed upon in giving 
600 pieces of Hight for a poor Slave who was not 
worth a maravidi. At which words he was so 
transported with passion that he showered
-P-A-G-E-191
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 183 
down a whole torrent of blows upon me, and 
lighting unluckily upon a stick, he broke my 
head in several places, and never ceased until he 
had made me all in a gore-blood. I was not 
able to stir, and the cruel villain permitted me 
to lie a little while; afterwards he comes again 
afresh, and drags me out of his House into the 
Streets, and then falls upon me anew, beating 
me all along the Streets.. He brought me at 
length to a Black-Moor who was working in 
Lime, commanding me with all cruel imperious 
insolence to serve that Black by giving up lime 
with my hands, which I did till such time as 
my Patron departed; and then I signified to 
the Black that I was very sick, and by signs 
prayed him to let me leave off that work which 
had almost choked me; which by his gesture 
I perceived he allowed. So I lay down upon 
the ground and fell asleep; my Patron pre- 
sently returned, and took such a course to 
awake me that he had very nearly laid me 
asleep for ever; for he gave me a blow in the 
small of my back which created such a pungent 
pain as quite cashiered .all patience and all 
respects of self-preservation. 
“The next day he provided a Jew, who had 
been in Europe and spoke good Latin, to treat 
with me, as if my defect in the Castilian 
language had occasioned the unsuccessfulness 
of his negotiating with me. This Jew I found 
to be a good understanding man, endowed with 
more humanity than generally the people of 
that religion are, which he evidenced by his 
good advice to me, telling me that my patron
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
was a man of violent passions, and that though 
he himself was pretty well satisfied of my utter 
inability, yet if my Patron should be so 
persuaded and find himself bilked in all his 
great expectations, he would certainly convert 
his hopes into an extravagant rage, and then 
put me to some cruel death. Therefore he 
advised me, as not to sooth his vain hopes, so 
neither quite to banish them. You shall give 
me leave, says he, to acquaint your Patron that 
you have Relations and Friends who are power- 
ful and rich; that rather than you should 
spend all your days under the pressure of a 
heavy and cruel Captivity they would make a 
purse of 1,000 Crowns to ransome you. 
“The Christians, usually about Sun-setting, 
were sent to a fountain without the town, to 
bring home in great earthern Jars some of that 
water. Ialso was sent by my patron. Amongst 
other discourse I listened to a seaman speaking 
of Mamora, a Spanish garrison, some twenty 
miles distant from Salle; and that he, sailing 
along the coast had observed it very rocky for 
about eight miles, but the next was a fine sand. 
He said, moreover, that he believed a good foot- 
man might run a race for his freedom in three 
hours, if he had the convenience of a favourable 
night and could scape a number of Tents which 
were pitched all along the country betwixt Salle 
and Mamora, who are very industrious to pick 
up slaves attempting an escape, Upon this 
discourse it entered strongly into my head that 
I should be the person who should win this 
prize; but at present it was impossible by
-P-A-G-E-193
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 185 
reason of my lodging in the Masmora, as also 
by reason of my lassitude at night being quite 
spent with the toil of the day. But if I could 
induce my Patron by any arts to be a little kind 
to me and abate his severity I thought I might 
fall into some capacity of performing what I 
designed. 
“(The sequel is too long to relate in full. 
But, after some time, he so far ingratiated 
himself that at supper one evening, after waiting 
on the company, he was asked to sit down 
and join them. Though they were mostly 
Mahometans there was no stint of wine.) 
«After these compliments were over I sat 
down with the company and composed myself 
to be as merry and agreeable as possibly I 
could. I sung several English songs to them, 
particularly I remember, “Calm was the Even- 
ing, etc.,” in the Mock Astrologer, which was 
new when I left England. They were wonder- 
fully affected with it, and were very desirous 
to have me translate ha, ha, ha, etc., into 
Spanish. They also sung to requite me. I 
must confess I never knew any who seemed 
much diverted with the sweetness of my voice, 
but really when I heard their barbarous Tones 
and damnable dissonant Jangling, I cannot 
deny a piece of weakness which then possessed 
me, which was a pleasure to hear my own sweet 
self chant it. The glass in the meanwhile did 
not stand still. Though I used all art to shift 
it from myself yet I used the same that my 
Patron might never balk it; which at last 
evidenced itself plainly, for he was got very
-P-A-G-E-194
  
  186 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
drunk, and truly I thought that then it was not 
safe nor convenient to my purposes for his 
Slave to appear sober. Therefore I counter- 
feited the humours of a man overtaken with 
drink, so that I afforded exceeding divertisement 
to the soberer part of the Company. Before 
midnight all the Company had got as much as 
they could well carry away, and my Patron 
abundance more. 
“Seeing that my Patron was engaged in a 
deep sleep, from which he would not awake in 
four or five hours, I took out of his bags a small 
parcel of Spanish Pistols (pistoles), which me- 
thought might not be unserviceable to me in 
another part of the world, together with two 
shirts of his (for, indeed, I had none of my own), 
and a pair of shoes; I put out the Candles and 
with all expedition I slipt out of a window 
into the street, where I unsheathed my sword, 
being resolved to attack whomsoever I should 
rencounter in the streets. I came at last to the 
Riverside, near the Castle, where presently I 
threw myself in, but after having been a little 
there, finding myself incommoded in swimming 
by reason of the Sword and other things, I 
swum back to shoar, where I stripped myself 
and laid all upon my back kept together by my 
breeches buttoned about my neck. But my 
proceeding was slow by reason of the burden I 
carried, and my arms were weary. Whereupon 
I unbuttond and let all my clothes, riches and 
armour go together, and swimming on my back I 
at length came to the other side of the River, a 
little weary, and altogether naked and defenceless.
-P-A-G-E-195
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 187 
“Now the dangers began to crowd upon me, 
and I had so near a prospect of them that I 
wished I had never undertook the work; but 
when I reflected on the loss of my Patron’s 
scimitar and the Gold, my desperate estate 
gave me both hopes and courage. So up I got, 
and having almost rounded North Salle, with a 
good speed I made away, having no other 
direction saving the noise of the breaking of the 
Sea upon the Shoar on my left hand. It was 
dark, and there was no path or road, so that 
many times I stumbled and fell over stones, 
which cut and bruised my naked body. To- 
wards day-break I turned to the left over a great 
Bank, on the other side of which I happily fell 
in upon a sand which continued about eleven or 
twelve miles in length, where I exercised my 
feet to the best purpose that ever 1 think I did 
in my life, and then I came within sight of 
Mamora the Spanish Garison, I called out to 
them that I was a Christian, and begged them 
to relieve me. They waved their hats to me, 
and looking behind I saw the Moors coming 
down upon me; then I made all the haste that 
fear could inspire me with, the Spaniards in 
the mean time firing at the Moors to stop 
their eager pursuit. At last with my utmost 
endeavours I reached the little Fort at the 
bottom of which I fell down quite spent. The 
Soldiers carried me up in a Cloak to the 
Garison, where the Governour, after having 
caused a glass of wine to be poured into my 
mouth to revive me, questioned me what I was 
and whence I came (for indeed I was so covered
-P-A-G-E-196
    188 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
all over my body with blood, sweat and dust, 
that it was hard to distinguish me from a Moor 
by my colour) I satisfied him that I was an 
Englishman whom God had been so merciful to 
as last night to bestow an opportunity of 
escaping from a heavy slavery at Salle. By 
noon the Moors being within reach of the guns 
the Governour commanded to let fly among 
them; and I, upon my request to honour my 
Patron (who was among them) had the favour 
to fire two, so that they made haste to be gone. 
“Tt is hard to be expressed what a great satis- 
faction it was to me to see my cruel enemy 
(whom but 24 hours before I dreaded as the 
Indians do the Devil) flee from me and 
endeavour an escape out of my reach with as 
much eagerness as the night before I did out of 
his. Yet when I reflected upon the weakness 
of the Garison which was no bigger in circum- 
ference than the Tower of London; the feeble 
resistance that 400 disheartened half-starved 
sickly Spaniards could make against an in- 
numerable swarm of Moors, I must confess my 
fears did a little qualify my joy and I could not 
forbear wishing that my Patron and I were at a 
greater distance. 
“The next morning early, five Barca-Longo’s, 
which had brought provision from Cadiz, were 
returning home, in one of which I gladly 
embarked, bidding adieu to Mamora (which 
since about two years ago, as I heard with 
sorrow) was taken by the Moors after above 100 
years possession of the Spaniards. Hamet 
Lucas being the first man who entered it.
-P-A-G-E-197
  
ACADEMIC “SPORTS” 189 
“Upon Wednesday morning we were got far 
as A-lanach, another Garrison belonging to the 
Spaniards, at which time we heard much 
shooting out at sea, so that we thought it 
convenient to putin. The town is fortified by 
two strong Castles, well stored with great 
Ordnance, into one of which we were permitted 
to ascend to view a rare sight: a very unequal 
combat yet briskly maintained by one Dutch 
man-of-war against six Algerines. The fight 
continued until noon, when two great Dutch 
men-of-war coming up, the Turks thought best 
to make sail and stand away. Then luckily, 
’ahead of them as they were weathering Cape 
Spartil, appeared six English men-of-war. The 
Algerines being hemmed in resolved rather to 
venture through the English. But Captain 
Beach, with the first broadside disabling their 
Admiral, they altogether tacked and ran ashore 
in the Bay of Arzilla, where they were all set 
on fire, abundance of Christians being relieved 
and abundance of Turks being killed. 
“Next day being Thursday, we set forward for 
Cadiz. There I saw some of those very Moor 
slaves themselves who made me so; there being 
15 taken aboard the French prize I formerly 
mentioned, by the Holmes Frigot, and carried 
to Cadiz and there sold. This gave me a 
pleasant opportunity of thinking how the case 
was altered. The agent prevailed with the 
Dutch Consul to grant me passage for England 
in a Dutch Man-of-War (there being no Eng- 
lish ships of any force then in the River, and I 
was very unwilling any more to hazard myself
-P-A-G-E-198
    190 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
in small vessels). It was the very same ship 
which I saw at Alanache engaged with the six 
Algerines. In the beginning of November I was 
brought to the Texel, having had no conven- 
ience to be removed into any ship in the 
channel by reason of a great storm that hurried 
us over to the Holland Coast. From Amsterdam 
I came to the Hague, where hearing that Sir 
John Chicheley, then envoy from his Majesty to 
the Governour of the Spanish Netherlands, was 
returning for England, I made haste to Brussels 
and obtained passage for England amongst his 
retinue.” 
(Elliott’s subsequent experiences seem to 
have been of a more commonplace character. 
He became rector of a London parish, St. James, 
Duke place, in 1685. He died about the be- 
ginning of the year 1700, having been suspended 
from his parish for part of the time for irregular 
performance of marriages.)

XI. 
UNDERGRADUATE LETTERS OF THE 
17TH CENTURY. 
The members of the Gawdy family, one of 
whose principal seats was at West Harling in 
Norfolk, seem to have been, like the Pastons of 
the same county, great letter writers. There is 
a large collection at the British Museum, known 
as the Gawdy MSS., which contains many 
hundreds of letters written to and from various 
members of the family. Though far from 
rivalling the famous find of Sir John Fenn in 
respect of antiquity, many of them are old 
enough to be of much value. The following are 
selected from the correspondence of the junior 
members of the family, the writers being 
students at Cambridge. The Gawdys belonged 
to the country gentry, and occupied, if not the 
highest place, at any rate a dignified and sub- 
stantial place in the county. In the early part 
of the seventeenth century, Framlingham 
Gawdy, Esquire of West Harling, was a 
prosperous landowner with a large family. No 
less than six of his sons came successively to 
College. It deserves notice that only one of 
them proceeded to a degree. Modern sentiment 
on the subject would regard this as represent- 
ing somewhat of a failure, suggesting, presum- 
ably, idleness or want of ability. But it was 
entirely in accordance with the sentiment of 
the time. It is often forgotten that the society
-P-A-G-E-200
    192 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
in College in those days consisted of two 
really distinct classes, who may be described 
as the professional and the amateur, and who 
probably associated very little with each other. 
The former comprised the sizars—a rather 
numerous body at that time—and the scholars. 
These came with a distinctly professional end 
in view—to take a degree, and in most cases to 
become clergymen. Many of these, of course, 
had a very hard struggle here, and for them 
such amusements as those which bulk so 
largely in modern collegiate life, were quite out 
of the question. The other class comprised 
many of the pensioners, and most of the fellow- 
commoners. If they looked forward to a pro- 
fession it would either be that of the Law, or 
possibly that of the Church, with a family 
living securely awaiting them. The elder sons 
naturally settled down on their estates, and 
followed the duties expected of landed gentry. 
Most of the men of this class — with the 
exception of the few clergy—treated the College 
life as an episode in their general training for 
social life; from College, after a year or two of a 
certain amount of study, they probably went to 
an Inn of Court to get a smattering of Law. 
And then, if they could afford it, and the times 
were peaceful, they might very likely get a year 
or two of foreign travel. It is a different view 
of academic training from that commonly 
entertained now, which sometimes almost 
amounts to the commercial estimate that he 
who quits the University without a degree is 
like one who leaves his money on the counter
-P-A-G-E-201
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 193 
and omits to take away what he came to buy. 
But there is a good deal to be said for the older 
view, if wisely interpreted. 
It may be remarked that there were then a 
number of tutors in every College, in fact almost 
every resident Fellow had pupils, these tutors 
being often personally known to the parents, 
and selected for that reason. Except in the 
case of the very rich the whole College accounts 
probably passed through the tutor’s hands, the 
father lodging a sum of money with him at the 
beginning of term, and the pupil applying to 
his tutor for what he wanted from time to time. 
The diary of a tutor about this time—the well- known Joseph Mede of Christ’s—has happened 
to survive, and gives a very clear account of the 
ordinary expenses of a student, and of the 
books which he read, or, at least, which he 
bought. 
Anthony Gawdy, the writer of the first 
letters, was a poor relation of the squire of Harling by whose help he was apparently 
supported at College. He was probably a nephew or cousin. He took Holy Orders (as the 
reader might infer from his ornate rhetoric), 
and soon obtained preferment in the county.

Nathaniel Dod was a junior Fellow at this

extra to spend in a tavern, or in College, 
rooms, for something more luxurious than the 
very plain fare commonly provided. Gawdy’s 
scholarship was worth some two or three 
pounds a year.

Yor pore kinsman 
ANTHONY GAWDY 
(circa August 1, 1626).” 
Most of the above letter explains itself. The 
Chancellor of the University, referred to in the
-P-A-G-E-205
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 197 
last paragraph, was George Villiers, the famous 
Duke of Buckingham, whose election a few 
weeks before caused so much excitement in the 
University. Need it be said that the “exceeding 
in venison” is not to be taken in an aldermanic 
sense? The students of that day were divided, 
for the purpose of dinner and supper, into a 
number of “messes”; one consisting of the 
scholars, one of the bachelors, two or more of 
the pensioners, and so on. The ordinary fare at 
table, as already remarked, was very plain. But 
there were many Feasts, and on these and such 
like occasions, a certain sum was allotted to 
each table or mess. These were called “exceed- 
ings” or “sizings.” What the Duke seems to 
have done was to send a number of bucks from 
his park and distribute them amongst all the 
Colleges, where the shares were divided amongst 
the various messes. 
“Worthy Sr, my tutor have received the 
money, he is very glad, and I for my parte, 
returne thankes, and that is all, yet thanks 
payeth noe debts saith the proverbe. I acknow- 
lidge it to be true, but how soe ever, though 
they will not paie the principale, yet I will 
endeavour to paye sum interest by my loyall 
love and service. As farre as I understand by 
my carrier you are disposed to bewtowe a shute

One is glad to know that Mr. Gawdy

judge by the private account which follows, 
which seems in addition to the previous one.

Yor poor kinsman 
ANTHONY GAWDY. 
(Addressed) To the right worshipful, Mr. 
Framlingham Gawdy Esqr and High Sheruf 
of Norfolke.” 
As I have said, Anthony Gawdy subsequently 
became a rector in Norfolk. One is curious to 
know whether his flowery style and insinua- 
ting advances towards his patron and relative, 
found their full scope in his addresses to his 
parishioners and his relations with his bishop. 
Unfortunately he has left no published sermons 
behind him. We are grieved to have to say 
that his final relations with the College 
authorities were to say the least of it, some- 
what strained. The incident has been already 
described, in a letter from the College tutor 
(v. p. 116). 
Most of the other letters are from one o1 
other of the sons of Framlingham Gawdy 
Several of them entered as fellow-commoners 
and as already remarked, only one of the siz 
proceeded to a Degree. It seems that they dic 
not keep horses during their residence, but hac 
them sent to Cambridge for the journey hom: 
of some 85 or 40 miles. 
“Deer father in your last letter you wer 
about our coming home, you saide you woul 
send for us a week or a fortnight after th 
commencement: I desire you (if you please) le 
our horses come upon Wednesday being the 1!

Your dutiful and obedient sonne 
WILLIAM GAWDY.

“ Deer father wee did expect you heer at Cam- 
bridge at your going to London. I was chosen 
by the proctours to bee senior brother in the 
Commencement house this yeare, which is a 
place of great credite, but withall very charge- 
able, for I should have given the proctours each 
of them a sattin doublet and should have in- 
vited all the doctors and chiefe men in the 
towne to supper: my tutor tooke some time to 
consider of it, hopeing you would have come 
this way, but you comming not I was con- 
strained to refuse it. I desire you (if you buy a 
newe hat before Haster) to bring downe mine 
ready trimmed with you, for my ole one be- 
ginnes to growe unfitting for a gentleman to 
weare, and I am lothe to buy mee a new one 
because it will not be long ere I shall have that

somewhat the thinner and (if it be possible) let 
it bee made lesse in the heade, and let the 
brimmes bee cut somewhat narrower as the 
fashion is: and I pray let mee have a silver 
girdle of the best sort, and let Frank Gaudy 
bring it with him when you come into the

country at Haster, and I will pay you for it 
againe. I pray you let me receive your letter 
the next weeke by the Cambridge carrier. So 
with my duty remembered unto you craving 
your blessing and hoping to meet you at Har- 
ling a fortnight before Easter I rest 
Your dutifull sonne 
WILLIAM GAWDY. 
From my study in Gon. & Cai. Col. 
18th Nov., 1631.” 
The reference at the beginning of this letter 
supplies just one of those graphic touches 
which we so often miss in the usual historical 
accounts. The office in question was that of 
the collectors—a term which seems to have 
lingered on till recently at Oxford. They were 
candidates for B.A., appointed by the proctors 
to distribute the other candidates into the 
different schools, and to assign the order of 
their disputations. In a sort of way they were 
temporary pro-proctors. But the popular title 
of “senior brother” is new to me, and I doubt 
if any University historian had realized what 
were the conventional demands made upon 
them in the way of gifts and. entertainments. 
“Deer father I shall bee very glade to heare 
from you by Mr. Rawlins when he comes by 
Cambridge. I dayly expect his arrivall with 
my sword by his side. I desire you to send 
it by him when hee comes, for in the meane 
time you have left mee altogether destitute of 
a weapon. My tutor would have my armes
-P-A-G-E-211
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 203 
with the Colledge armes set upon my plate, 
and if it please you I will send it up to you 
to have it done: for there is not one at 
Cambridge whiche can do it well. Basse (his 
younger brother, Bassingborne) is admitted 
and is very much in love with the university. 
‘Wee remember our humble dutyes unto you 
craving your blessing, and so I rest your 
obedient sonne 
WILLIAM GAUDY. 
Doctor Welles is very sicke of a fever and 
wee greatly feare that hee will never escape it. 
May 1 1632.” 
(Addressed) To my very loving father Mr. 
Framlingham Gaudy Esquire in Fleet Street 
at Mr. Wardes house a barber right over against 
the kinges head tavern give these.” 
The reference to a sword is curious. It 
shows—as do other similar references else- 
where—that the dictates of fashion soon pre- 
vailed over statute injunctions. The wearing 
of a sword was stringently forbidden, for every 
student, by Dr. Caius; but young men of 
fashion evidently dressed here as they pleased, 
and as they were accustomed to do elsewhere. 
The plate which he mentions is of course the 
customary gift made to the College by fellow- 
commoners when they left. Mr. Gawdy’s plate 
seems to have disappeared long since. Robert 
Wells, M.D., was a Fellow. He died the next 
day, and left his estate and library to the 
College.

“Sir I beseeche you let us expect our horses 
at Barton Milles (by Mildenhall, a stage on 
the Norwich road) upon the eleventh day of 
December being Wednesday: where we will 
meet them with our hackneys. I feare wee 
shall pay very deere for our Hackneys because 
the King will be at Newmarket about the same 
time. I pray send us word by this bearer 
whether you will send our horses to Barton 
upon the day prefixed: or whether you intend 
some other day. As for the paiment of tuition 
for my brothers, all schollers doe pay theire 
tutors as well absent as when they are in the 
Colledge. Wee remember our Humble dutyes 
to you and crave your blessing. 
I rest your obedient sonne 
WILL GAUDY. 
(Caius Col.) 
Nov. 19, 1633.” 
It is sometimes asked how the men got home 
from Cambridge, at a time before stage-coaches 
were introduced. The very poor probably 
stayed in College, or got a lift in the carrier’s 
cart:—the days were now mostly past when 
they tramped it on foot. The sons of country 
gentry, like William Gaudy and his brothers, as 
  
1§imilar shifts had to be adopted in much later days. 
The first time that my father brought me to Cambridge, as a 
boy, before the opening of the Railway, he drove us in his 
phaeton from London, sending his own horse on to Ware, and 
hiring one to take us thither. He used to tell me that in his 
day the difficulties for students who wanted to go North were 
considerable. The richer men posted, at any rate as far as 
Alconbury on the Great North Road. The poorer got a lift, 
as they could, so far; and then waited at the famous Inn 
there till some coach came by with a vacant seat on the top.
-P-A-G-E-213
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 205 
we see, had horses sent from home to take them 
the whole, or part of, the way. Harling is some 
85 or 40 miles from Cambridge. 
The next is from a younger brother of 
William. He entered in 1632, as “pensioner at 
the bachelors’ table,” a sort of intermediate 
position between the ordinary pensioner and 
the fellow-commoner. 
“Deare father my dutie remembred unto 
you, and I did——receive your letter, and as for 
my box I had it at the carriers on Monday, the 
22 of June, and after the reading I doe intende 
to cum downe, which will bee about seven 
weekes hence, for there will be almost none in 
the house, for they are allmost gone allready, 
and there will not be above 12 at the reading at 
the most, and after the reading the breake up 
commons, and I hope you will send me a peece 
for my money will not hold out; if you do not I 
must borrow it sumwhere, and so hoping you 
all are well, as I am, I rest your obedient sonne 
BASSINGBOURNE GAUDY. 
(Caius Col.) July 4, 1635.” 
The “reading” referred to above may per- 
haps be that of the names of the graduates at 
“Commencement,” the final ceremony of the 
year. If so, it lingered as a survival to very 
recent times, in the reading of the names in the 
Ordo Senioritatis, or Mathematical Tripos. 
“Dear father I writ unto you the last weeke 
by our Cambridge carrier, but because I heard 
not from you againe, I suspect that my letter

cam not unto you. I directed it to Mr Neelsons 
in Fleet Street at the signe of the talbot the 
next doore to white friers gate: but now my 
cousen Doll coming to Cambridge (where she 
determines to continue) I understand by her 
where your lodging is. I therefore hope that 
this letter will bee safely convayed unto you. I 
have bin of late very sicke of an ague, but nowe 
(thankes bee to god) Iam perfectly recovered, 
only my physicke and my dyet in my sickness 
being chargeable unto mee I hope you will con- 
sider mee for it at Easter or else this quarter 
breakes mee. I writ unto you concerning my 
hat which (if you buye a new one before Easter) 
I desire you to bring down with you new 
shagged and a new silver hatband of the best 
fashion, for my old hat begins to be nought. I 
pray you likewise to buy mee a silver girdle of 
the best sort and bring it down with you and I 
will pay for it againe. My cosen Doll arrived 
yesternight at Cambridge with her man, 
goodman Goblet, and intendes to sojourne at 
ones house that was one of Anthony’s mis- 
tresses, but now married toa draper in Cam- 
bridge, I desire you to send for us, as soone as 
ever you come to Harling: in the meane time 
remembring our dutye unto you, craving your 
blessing I rest 
Your dutifull sonne

(circa 1630).” 
If, as is perhaps the case, the reference to his 
cousin Anthony (of the former letters) is to be
-P-A-G-E-215
  
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 207 
taken in its most natural interpretation, it 
suggests a rather strange view of the state of 
things amongst the richer classes in College 
at that time. As to the attire, the statute bear- 
ing on the subject may be quoted: “ ... si 
pensionarius major (v.e. fellow - commoner), 
mulcta esto sex solidi et octo denarii, maxime 
si in publicum prodeat indecenter, hoc est sine 
veste longa et scholastica et pileo quadrato 
capiti apto.” 
“Deare Father, I am very glad to heare by my 
cosen Anthony that you enjoy your health. I 
have bin very much troubled with an ague, but 
nowe I thank god it hathe perfectly left mee. I 
understand by my cosen Anthony that you doe 
not knowe what my Tutor meaneth, in his last 
bill, by Cambridge commons: it is onely 3s. 8d. 
whiche wee pay every quarter for the deanes 
and other College officers wages, as well when 
we are absent as present. I would entreat you 
that my cosen Doll may make us a great Cake 
or twoe, and withall a cheese or twoe will doe 
very well to amend our poore lenten commons: 
whiche if you please to send you may by this 
carrier at his return backe again, who has 
promised mee to call for them as hee returnes 
to Cambridge. Hee is a very honest fellowe, 
and whatsoever you doe intend to send to us at 
any time, hee will safely deliver. So with my 
dutye remembred unto you, and craving your 
blessing, I rest 
Your obedient sonne

-P-A-G-E-216
  208 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
Here again we obtain a graphic little touch 
as to the daily life. The general poverty of 
College fare, especially at Lent, was of course 
well known; but I do not remember to have 
heard elsewhere that the students, like modern 
—or former—schoolboys, had hampers sent from 
home to help them out. 
“Deare father, I am very sorry to under- 
stand, that you have gotten your ague againe. 
I pray God (whoe hath perfectly restored mee to 
my former health) deliver you out of your sick- 
nesse. Cambridge is a very sickly place, for 
there dy many every weeke of agues and other 
diseases. I received the thinges you sent by 
the carrier. I pray let Morris put my spare- 
hawke into the mewe, for I hope shee will prove 
a good one. Soe withe my duty remembred 
unto you and craving your blessinge I rest

“Deer father I am very glad to heare of your 
amendment, I hope shortly to heare newes of 
your perfect recovery. I have heere sent you 
my plate with a pattern of the Colledge armes ; 
and likewise of my owne, because I would have 
them placed in this order that you see uppon 
the forefront of the plate. Within it I have put 
the top of the eare whiche was broken off by 
mischance. You see how miserably it is 
battered broken and crackt, and withall howe

“Sir I hope you will not taxe me of neglect

suppose) out of my study in my absence: whiche

  210 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
The reference to his “study” may need a 
few words of explanation. As is well known, 
one room served for two or more students, 
even of the upper class, till a considerably 
later period than this. But for purposes of 
study, each of these chambers had two, or 
possibly three, very small rooms opening out 
of it. They were scarcely more than cupboards, 
and were sometimes made by boarding off a 
corner of the larger room. They were commonly 
known as “studies.” Some of these rooms still 
survived in the disused attics of the Legge 
Buildings in the Tree Court, pulled down in 
1868. A picture of one of these is given by 
Willis in the Architectural History of Cam- 
bridge (III. 308). : 
The writer of the next letters was a cousin 
of the last, but belongs to the following genera- 
tion. He was a fellow-commoner at Christ’s, 
where he entered in 1654. He took no degree. 
The tutor whom he praises so highly was Ralph 
Widdrington, afterwards Public Orator, and 
successively Professor of Greek and of Divinity. 
We gather, from Dr. Peile’s College History, 
that Widdrington was a dexterous and pushing 
man who succeeded in retaining, during one 
stage of those troublous times, the offices 
which he had obtained during another. But 
the opinion as to his great popularity as a 
tutor is fully confirmed. 
“Honoured Father 
I cannot but acknowledge your care, and 
returne to you many thankes, for placing me

LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 211 
under soe diligent a Tutor, and in so good 
society, but there are some things wanting which I must trouble you to furnish me with. I sent for the trunkes which were my uncle Ro. in which I thought to have found a paire of sheetes, but there were none. I want also half a douzen of napkins which are to be used in the hall which in the meantime I am con- strained to borrowe, and some small table 
clothes and towells and a piece of plate. SoI rest having nothing else wherewith I may subscribe my self

You most obedient son 
BAssINGBOURNE GAUDY. 
I pray bid my brother John send me some of his picters to dress up my study.” 
The reference to pictures for College rooms at that date seems to indicate a very exceptional 
state of things. In inventories and wills of this date such articles are quite unknown. But there certainly would not be much room to spare for them in a “study.” “ Napkins to be used in the hall” were of course a real necessary in the days before forks were invented. They are often referred to, and there were rules forbidding the use of tablecloth as a substitute.
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
“ Sir 
I have had a minde a long time to study 
mathematicks and shall be very glad to busy 
my selfe about it, if you please to be at the 
charge. It will be of some charge because I 
beleeve my Tutor is not skilled in it, and there 
is a man in towne who makes it his whole 
profession and hath teached very many. If 
you think it fitting, I would desire you to 
write to my Tutour to get this man to learne 
me, for it will be better taken from you than 
from me. I desire you to get Glover to make 
me a paire of sarcinate tops out of my mony. 
So I rest 
Your most obedient son 
Bass. GAUDY. 
(Christ’s Coll. circa 1655).” 
It is a pity that we are not given the name 
of the Mr. Hopkins, or Dr. Routh, of the day, 
who made it “his whole profession” to teach 
mathematics. But the reference reminds us 
of the well-known fact that the specializing 
in this direction at Cambridge was a matter 
of later date than this. 
“Sir 
T have at last sent you a booke ruled with 
red lines, but with no clasps, the bookbinder 
says that it is better without. I go on in my 
french and have profitted so far as to make 
a piece of french. Sir I hope you will give 
me a stuffe suit, because you abated the vli;

neither did I use any extravagancy in laying

out the rest. A suit cannot come in better 
time, for mine is very thredbare. I must have 
a coat to it, to weare when I come to Bury. 
Sir I would be glad to have my horse up if 
you do not use him. You may allow that heir 
which he stands you in there, for I suppose 
you never use him after yr journey out of 
Norfolke. The small Pox is reife in towne, 
there dyed a fellowecommoner of Caius Colledge 
last weeke. So I rest yr most obedient son 
(? 1655).” Bass. GAUDY. 
The reference to learning French, repeated 
in the next letter, is one of many indications 
of the widely divergent pursuits adopted by 
men of different status in College. Young 
Gaudy was a fellow-commoner, and had pro- 
bably no thought of taking a degree. The 
scholars and Sizars would probably have had 
no time for such ornamental accomplishments. 
But it is worth noticing that a French teacher 
could then be found in Cambridge. 
“Sir I received yr letter, wherein you gave 
me notice that I shall receive my quarteridge this 
weeke: you bid me send you word how much 
my Frenchman hath had, he hath had 21s. for 
entrance and 10s. for a month’s teaching. Yr 
booke cost 4s. 6d. and my saddle cost 1£. 15s.: 
if you please you may send this up with my 
quarteridge, which is 8li. 10s. 6d. in all. So 
I rest having nothing else wherewith I may 
subscribe myselfe 
Yr most obedient son 
(circa 1655).” Bass. GAUDY.
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
The fee for the Frenchman—a guinea down, 
and ten shillings a month—seems fairly high, 
when we remember the total amount of his 
cousin’s half-yearly bills. Many scholarships 
at that day, were not worth more than forty 
shillings a year. 
“Sir I pray bid Ed. Crosse to carry my 
fowle linnen to Mrs. Oigdons. It seems he 
hath been so negligent as to keepe it all this 
tyme at Mrs. Sharps. The fellowes and my 
Tutour disagree worse than they have done 
yet: the fellows and ye master did behave 
themselves very unjustly in a business con- 
cerning a fellow commoner of my Tutours, ye 
businesse was only thus: they and another fell 
out, and because my Tutours puple had ye 
better, he was admonished, and that other 
escaped free from any punishment. Sir I had 
occasion to write to my uncle Charles, and 
I sent for 2 bookes, viz. Josephus and Camb. 
(Camden’s) britannia. I shall keepe them very 
safe till you shall require them againe. I pray 
bid Ed. Crosse carry my bowles to the carrier 
this weeks, and send him downe to Mary Butlers 
to make haste of my linnen. SoI rest 
Your most obedient son 
Bass. GAuDY.” 
William Gaudy, the writer of the next, was 
one of the few who proceeded to a degree. His 
“keeping his acts in the schools” refers, of 
course, to the system of public discussions 
which corresponded to our modern examination 
system.

  216 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
The piece of plate referred to in the next is, 
of course, the customary presentation by every 
fellow-commoner on his leaving College. Un- 
fortunately, like so very many other pieces of 
plate, this particular piece seems to have been 
lost or sold. 
“May 22, 1682. 
Dear father, I am very glad to heare by Mr. 
Barry of your perfect recovery. I beseech 
God to continue your health. I am dayly 
importuned by the Colledge to set my armes 
upon the plate with the colledge armes. If it 
please you to send mee word this weeke, I will 
send it to you to London with the pattern of 
the colledge armes: it is likewise very much 
battered and bruised and I have a great desire 
it should be mended before I present it to our 
master. If you thinke it fitting when you have 
it with you, you may change it for a better: for 
I have received many favours from the Colledge, 
which deserve to bee recompensed with a better 
piece of plate. I will leave to your discretion, 
because you knowe what is fittingest to be done. 
So with my humble duty unto you I rest 
Your dutifull sonne 
WILLIAM GAUDY.” 
Charles, the writer of the next, was a 
younger brother of William, whom he followed 
to Caius. The reference to a “chamber” per- 
sumably applies to a room of his own: till 
securing this he probably had to “chum” with 
one or more other students.
-P-A-G-E-225
  
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 217 
“Most loving father, my duty remembred 
unto you, sir, is to desire you for to send me up 
some linnin, two or thre paire of sheets and two 
or thre pillowbeares, and a tablecloth, and hauf 
a douson napkins, and two or thre towells, and 
sire as for my bedding you need not to sende it 
up untill I have a chamber, and when I have a 
chamber I will write you worde, and my tutor

these things that I writ unto you sire I will 
pray you to send them up by this bearere 
thereof and hoping you will be mindful of me 
for them and so I rest 
Youer loving sone 
CHARLES GAUDY.” 
Apparently, by the following letter, he 
soon had a chamber provided for him. What 
was the nature of the usual arrangements, it is 
difficult to say:—trifling domestic customs, 
which are too familiar to every one at the time 
to be worth describing, are often those which 
give most trouble to the later enquirer. Perhaps 
the bed and bedding had to be provided by the 
new occupant of a room, whereas those who 
shared a room with others found this ready 
provided. 
“November 1, 1687. 
Most loving father, my duty remembred unto 
you and I have received your letter and my 
linin that you sent me and nowe I have a 
chamber I will pray you to send me my 
beddinge up by the Cambridge wagon that 
comes to Thetford, and I will pray you to send
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
it to Thetford on Satterday and leve it at the 
signe of the grayhound for the carire to call for 
it that come a Monday, and I will pray you to 
send me up some money for I have bene here a 
great while without any; I will pray you to 
send me some as soone as you can and so I rest 
Youer dutifull sonne 
CHARLES GAUDY.” 
The writer of the next, Bassingbourne, was a 
brother of Charles and William. The reference 
to pictures is curious, as current accounts of 
the habits of students of those times would not 
suggest the possession of such luxuries. 
“Honoured father, I am sorry I have put you 
to so much expense, and have so little regarded 
both mine owne creditte and your condition: 
the occasion of it was at my first coming to 
Cambridge, most of it being laid out upon 
necessaryes; but craving your pardon I shall 
behave my selfe with such discretion and 
thriftinesse as that you shall not feare to be 
troubled any more in this kind, but shall receive 
a faire testimony both of my good husbandry 
and my endeavours to satisfye you in my 
studyes ; who is and ever will be 
Your most obedient son 
BASSINGBOURNE GAUDY. 
I pray hasten my plate, for I stand in great 
need of it. I pray remember my love to my 
Brothers and bid my brother John to send me 
some of his pictours.”
-P-A-G-E-227
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 219 
The reference to the “commencement” hardly 
needs explanation. It occurred in July, and 
was the equivalent, as a public ceremony, of 
the modern Degree Day. 
“Honoured Father 
I received my suit the last weeke, for 
which I returne you many thankes. I heard by 
Ro. Green that you had a hatte which was too 
little four you, which if you please to give it me 
I will be a very good husband in wearing it, for 
I have but one, and I weare that every day. I 
hope I shall see you heer at the commencement : 
it will be the publickest as have been these four 
yeares, so I rest having nothing else werewith I 
may subscribe myselfe 
Your most obedient son 
Bass. GAUDY.” 
“Sir, [had presented my duty sooner to you 
if an opportunity had bin presented sooner to 
mee, this being the first messenger I could 
lighte upon since my last arrivall at the 
university. Although it bee somewhat too 
soone to speake of our journey home yet 
(because it may soe happen that I may not 
lighte of another messenger between this and 
Christmas) I would desire you to send us word 
by this bearer what day we shall meet your 
horses at Barton Mills, or what other meanes 
you intend for our coming home. I beseeche 
you, Sir, remember your promise concerning 
my spare hawke. We are all well, I thanke 
God, and we hope the likeof you. Furthermore,
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
remembring our duties, wee crave your bless- 
inge. I rest 
Your obedient sonne 
WILL. GAUDY. 
My brother Fram. has sent my tutors bill 
enclosed. 
November 8th.” 
‘Whether the “spare hawke” was intended for 
use at Cambridge, in defiance of Dr. Caius’ 
statute, is not clear. If it were there can be no 
doubt of the splendid opportunities for the 
sport of hawking afforded by the wide extent of 
waste land in the neighbourhood. Barton Mills, 
near Mildenhall, it may be remarked, was mid- 
way on the journey home. Evidently the 
common practice was adopted of having the 
family horses sent to meet them there, whilst 
the students themselves hired a mount from 
Cambridge. 
“Dear father, heare that Franke Gaudy 
comes downe by the waggon: if it be so 
(although your trunke comes not downe before 
Easter) yet hee may bring my hat downe with 
him very conveniently: the cause why I thus 
hasten you is because my old hat will not bee 
agreeable to my newe clothes which I shall 
nowe buy at Easter, and I knowe not into what 
company I shall happen when I am in the 
countrey. I have taken order that our horses 
may meet us at Cambridge that night that you 
come hether, that we may go downe with you. 
The king defers his coming to Cambridge until
-P-A-G-E-229
  
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 221 
the 19th of this month, and it is a question 
whether he will come or no: so with our dutyes 
remembred unto you, craving your blessing I 
rest 
Your obedient sonne 
WILL. GAUDY.” 
King Charles I, and his queen, did come a 
fortnight afterwards, so we may hope that the 
new hat was in time :—if indeed he was allowed 
to put it on during such a ceremonial academic 
occasion. The customary festivities were held, 
and many honorary degrees were conferred, on 
the occasion of this royal visit,—the first held 
by this king. 
“Sir, I wrot to you the other day, but 
because my messenger proved unfaithfull I 
could not have them thinges sent unto me 
which I expected at his returne. I have taken 
my old messenger into my favoure againe, 
and hee has promised to make mee amendes 
for his former delinquency. I pray send mee 
the bible by him safely packed up by Mr. 
Rawlins: you heard in my last letter what 
hard fortune I had in the losse of my other. 
We doe expect something from you this lent to 
helpe our poore commons; I hope my cousen 
Doll will looke to provide us somethinge. 
Easter drawes neere nowe and I hope wee 
shall see you shorteley. Meanewhile wee re- 
member our dutyes unto you and I rest 
Your obedient sonne 
Win. GAvuDY.”

222 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
The hint given in the above letter, that, 
whereas the practice of fasting in Lent was 
(statutably) kept up so far as the College table 
was concerned, the consequent rigour was miti- 
gated by the conveyance of hampers from home, 
is amusing. It is just one of those little touches 
which we only obtain from private letters. 
Readers of the former letters may remember 
that “cousen Doll” had been appealed to on a 
previous occasion to make and send them “a 
great cake or two,” and to supplement the supply 
with “a cheese or two,” with the same object of 
helping out “the poor lenten commons.” We 
should not have supposed that this resource 
was necessary, for, from a report sent to Arch- 
bishop Laud only four years after the above 
letter must have been written, we are told 
that “Upon Frydays and all Fastingdays, the 
victualling houses prepare Flesh, good store, 
for all scholars . . . upon all such fasting nights 
in schollers chambers are generally the best 
suppers of the whole week, and for the most 
part of Flesh meate all.’ Perhaps the young 
Gawdys found it nicer and cheaper to send 
home for what they wanted. 
“Sir, I received your letter by Tho. Ship 
and the other papers, and amongst them my 
Tutour’s last bill, which truly at the first sight 
did amaze me as well as your selfe, but after 
that I had considered everything I began to fear 
that it was right, for this bill is an halfe year 
bill, that which was behind hand was the bill 
from Midsommer to Michaelmas; he hath had
-P-A-G-E-231
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 223 
but £7 for all this halfe year: my Tutour hath 
sent you the bill at large in his letter. The 
day after I came to towne (Cambridge) I and 
Mr. Anderson, who presents his services to you, 
and Tho. Ship went to buy my gowne, which 
comes to 7li. 12s. 6d., and the making 15s. I 
hav paid it. Sir you writte to me to forbear 
silver buttons, but bothe my Tutor and Mr. 
Anderson did perswade me to it: it did cost 
but 20s. the more: if you think it too much I 
will abate it in my allowance. I have sent you 
mine hatcase, that you may send up my new 
hat: I have very much need on it: if you stand 
in need of money for the present I can stay for 
it this month. I pray send me word how my 
Grandfather doth. So I rest 
Your most obedient son 
Bass. GAUDY.” 
If the price for the gown referred to above 
seems very high, regard had to the then value 
of money, it must be remembered that young 
Gaudy was a fellow-commoner. Did the silver 
buttons correspond to the silver lace of modern 
times? 
“Sir, I have sent you two bookes, viz. 
Martialls Epigrams and Goodwins antiquities, 
and what booke you intend to have next I 
pray you send me word wher you please to 
have it. My Tutour remembers his service to 
you, and desires to be excused by reason he 
doth not writte to you: the reason is he is sicke 
with a quartin ague, and hath been so this 
month. I pray send me the leather wesket
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
you promised me by the carryer. I pray send 
my Tutour up some money as soon as you can: 
so I rest 
Your most obedient son 
BASSINGBOURNE GAUDY.” 
“Sir I received my 50s. and the other mony 
for my Tutour: you bid me take the mony 
which I laid out for my gowne out of my 
Tutours, but it will be as well if I stay the 
longer and have it from you, Shipps bill for 
my gowne comes to 10s. 6d.: my quarter day 
was out last sonday, for although I have not 
been here a full quarter yet I must pay for 
tuteridge and detriments and Barber and such 
things as well as if I had been heer the whole 
quarter. I pray pay Mrs. Pidgeon this quarter 
out of my mony, so I shall expect mony to 
begin a new quarter and that which is behind 
all which I beleeve I owe my Tutour for my 
commons and tuteridge and other things, I 
have sent you two wisks, but I can get no 
paper all over the towne. I would be very 
glad to hear how things are ordered in Norfolke, 
where my uncles live and my brother Fra. 
The paper which you sent me signifyed nothing 
but my income which I received under my 
Tutours hand, in which he was mistaken, for 
it seems my income comes to 12li. 10s. besides 
my chayres. I make no question but that I 
shall live very well upon 60li. per annum. So 
I rest 
Your most obedient son 
Bass. GAuDY.”
-P-A-G-E-233
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 225, 
“Sir After that I had writte my other letter I forgotte one thing which is that you must either make me a blacke taffety wascoat, or else halfe shirts; I would wish you to buy me a black cloacke to weare with my suit when I come into the country; there will be nothing lost by it, for when I have done mourning it will make me a suit. So I rest 
Your most obedient son 
Bass. Gaupy.” 
“Worthy Sir I am deeply ingaged to a prockter in Cambridge a dear friende of myne to doe him so much favour as to give him a Bucke this commensment, and having noe other meanes but yourself to effect yt I desir you would doe me the curtesie to make good that I have promysed: your faithful Brother and Servant 
CHARLES Gaupy.” 
There was, as is well known, much feasting 
and mutual entertainment especially at Com- mencement time. Charles Gaudy did not him- self take any degree, but presumably he felt himself bound, as a man of family, to see that his friend carried out his entertainment in due style. 
The writer of the next was a fellow-com- moner, which accounts for his having a sizar to wait upon him. These private, or “ proper” sizars (the term lingered till lately, if indeed now extinct, at Trinity), were in those days to all intents valets. They waited on their 
Q
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
masters, and with their\payment and free board 
managed to support themselves till they gradu- 
ated. 
“Deere mother. I have received your kind 
tokens by my cousen Gayor, and the pies which 
you sent me, and my cosen Charlie, by the 
carrier: for which thinges and for many other 
kind remembrances my thankes are beyond 
expression. As for a sizer, about which you 
writt unto mee, I am already provided. I hope 
to see you with my fathers permission at 
Harling this Haster, but in the meane time 
money is very scarce with me, which want I hope 
you will soone supply. So, my humble duty 
being remembred unto you, I rest 
Your dutifull and obedient sonne 
WILLIAM GAUDY. 
Gon. & Cai. Coll. 
March 8 (1630?) 
I pray remember me to Mr. Rawlins, and tell 
him that I would pray him to send mee my 
watche as soone as he can conveniently.” 
“Deare father, I have suche an urgent cause 
that I cannot forbeare from writing unto you 
these few lines, wherein I humbly entreat you 
to supply my wants, whiche if you do not my 
credite is in daunger. There are many in our 
Colledge who doo thinke that I am so miser- 
able that I will not parte withe my money, and 
oftentimes doo deride mee for it: which faulte 
(you knowe) lies not in my power to mend 
unless I had wherwithal to shewe myself more 
free and liberall. It is not the covetousnesse
-P-A-G-E-235
  
LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 227 
of my minde whiche makes me thus, but only 
the want and scarsity of money. Every one doe 
expecte of mee, being a fellowe commoner, that 
I should live after the fashion of a gentleman, 
whiche by no means in the world I can accom- 
plishe without the helpe of money. I knowe it 
is your desire that I should live conformable 
to my callinge, whiche if you would have mee to 
do I beseech you (if you tender my credite) to 
send mee your kind answer with some money 
enclosed in it by this bearer. So with my duty 
remembred unto you, in haste I rest and will 
ever remaine 
Your dutyfull and obedient sonne 
Wintiam GaAupy.” 
“Dear father, we arrived at last at Cam- 
bridge, though not without muche annoyance of 
winde and raine: it rained all the way wee rid 
from Newmarket to Cambridge. My tutor is 
not now in the Colledge, nor yet Rob. Eade, but 
we looke for them very shortly. I hope that if 
you goe to London wee shall see you as you 
passe by: if not then yet at Christmas wee shall 
visite you. In the mean time we shall remaine 
your dutifull sonnes, studying (as much as in us 
lyeth) to continue in your fatherly love and good 
opinion of us. My conscience telleth mee that 
as yet I have committed nothing worthy of your 
displeasure and by God’s assistance I hope it will 
long so continue, partly in respect of my owne 
good but principally to give you contentment 
and satisfaction ; for I desire to have my being 
no longer than I continue in your love and
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
favour. So with ower duties remembred unto 
you and craving your blessing, I rest 
Your ever dutyfull and obedient sonne 
WinLiAM GAUDY.” 
(Caius College, 
_ Circa 1637-8.) 
“Most loving Father (my duty remembered 
unto you) I dide receive your letter that you 
sent me in my tutours letter a fortnete agoe: 
I would a’ write then but that I could not 
conveniently write unto you; and the cause 
of my writing now Sir, is to praye you to send 
me some money, for I have been here allmost 
a yeare, and you have sent me none, therefore 
the next time the carrier com this way I 
would pray you to send me some though it be 
but a little; and as for my bedding I pray 
you send it up when you please; and so I rest 
your dutyfull sonne 
CHARLES GAWDY. 
To his loving father Mr Framlingham Gaudy 
Esquire at West Harling, give these. Leve 
this letter at Mr Sneelnes the Tanneries to be 
sent us.” 
As regards the application for money in 
these letters, it must be remembered that the 
tutor supplied, or paid for, every thing that 
could be considered an ordinary requirement 
for a student, books, even clothes as a rule, 
being thus settled for with parent or guardian. 
There were no college clubs, and very few 
opportunities of spending money in ways not 
forbidden by academic statutes. For the poorer
-P-A-G-E-237
LETTERS OF THE 177TH CENTURY 229 
students a very small sum, possibly only a 
few shillings a term, would be really needed 
for them to pay out of pocket. 
(Caius College, 
1687-8.) 
“Most loving Father my duty remembred 
unto you, and my tutour have sent a bill of 
that quarter when I was in the countrie, and 
he would pray you to send 5 poundes by the 
carrier when he come up againe to pay for 
my commons this quarter: and as for the 
sickness ther have died more the last fortnet 
nor this: And so I rest 
Your dutyfull sonne 
CHARLES GAWDY.” 
The reference to “that quarter when I was 
in the countrie” applies doubtless to the Long 
Vacation, when as a rule only scholars and 
sizars were in residence. The “sickness” 
mentioned is presumably the plague, of which 
there had been a very bad outbreak a year or 
two :before, and which was probably still 
lingering in the town. In all the severer 
visitations of the kind the students were as 
far as possible dismissed; the very poor, and 
those who had no home to go to, being allowed 
to remain within the carefully locked College 
gates. 
(Caius College 
1687-7.) 
“Most loving Father, my duty remembred 
unto you, and I dide receive youer letter, and
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
I will pray you for to appointe some body to get 
my thinges ready, that I did write unto you 
before, for I have appointed a carier to bringe 
them up, and when he come this way againe 
he will call for them: and a chamber I have 
not yet and I shall have one as soone as our 
master or my tutour can get me one, and 
when I have one I will write you word for 
my bedding, and so I rest 
your dutifull sone 
CHARLES GAUDY.” 
The reference to a “chamber” above, is not 
quite clear. The ordinary students, as is well 
known, in Elizabethan days were crowded 
three or four together in one room, which 
they shared with their tutor. By 1687, the 
date in question, more rooms had been built, 
and there was probably less crowding. But only 
a fellow-commoner (and Charles Gaudy was not 
one) could have had a room to himself. What 
he was probably looking forward to was the 
comparative luxury of sharing a chamber with 
one companion. 
“Sir my bound deutie unto you remembred 
with hope of your good health, the continuance 
thereof I doo desire to the Lords good will 
and pleasure both now and ever: thankes be 
to God my brothers at Cambridge be in good 
health, and my brother Tho. at Bury and my 
brother Rob. here remember his dutie to you. 
I pray you good father send me a bible as 
soone as you please, for I have great wante of
-P-A-G-E-239
  LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 231 
one to use at church and thus with my humble 
dutie unto you good father remembred I rest 
your dutifull and obedient sonne 
CHARLES GAUDY. 
Thetford, June 5, 1632.” 
The above, if correctly dated, must have 
been written when returning from a visit to 
his brothers, who were then at Cambridge, 
before his own entry at College. 
“Deer father, I desire to let no opportunity 
slippe out of my handes, wherein I may present 
oure dutyes unto you and certify you of our 
wellfare. I am recovered (I thancke God) in 
some sorte from the reliques of my ague; and 
finde myselfe to growe stronger and in better 
plighte. My brother Fram. likewise is very 
well. My tutor nor Robert Eade (fellow of the 
College) are not yet come to the Colledge, but 
wee expect them every day. I pray let us heare 
from you by the next messenger that passeth 
this way, for you would not thinke what joy 
and delighte your letters doe infuse into us. 
But above all if you goe to London our joy 
will exceed to see you at Cambridge. Thus 
with our dutyes remembred unto you, craving 
your blessing I rest 
Your dutifull sonne 
WILLIAM GAUDY. 
Gon. & Cai. Coll. 
October 24 1681.” 
“Dear father in your last letter your will 
was that I should send you word in what time
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
it was fittest wee should come home. I desire 
you (if you can conveniently) to send up our 
horses upon Wednesday next being the 7th 
day of this month; and I pray let not a horse 
for my cosen Anthony be forgotten, who 
remembers his humble service unto you. The 
reason I would come home soone is, because 
I cannot tell how soone after Christmas my 
occasions concerning my commencement will 
hasten my returne. So with our dutyes in 
most humble manner remembred unto you, 
craving your blessing and desiring you not to 
faile at the time prefixed, I rest 
your dutifull sonne 
WILLIAM GAUDY. 
December 2, 1631.” 
“Deer father this is the third letter which 
I have written unto you since you last went to 
London, but because I have not as yet heard 
from you I conjecture that my other twoe have 
been miscarried. I writ unto you the last weeke 
concerning my plate, I would have my armes 
engraven on it; which (because it cannot be 
done at Cambridge) if it please you to send 
mee word the next week I will send it to you 
to have it done at London. Besides it is very 
much battered and broken and I would faine 
have it mended. If you think it fitting you may 
change it for a better. Wee are very well (I 
thank God) only my brother Fram. is very 
poore, and most humbly beseeches you to 
supply his wantes with us. You should comfort 
us very muche to heare from you, though it

were expressed but in towe or three lines. So 
with our dutyes remembred I rest 
Your dutifull sonne 
WILL Gaupy. May 29, 1632. 
To my very loving father Mr. Framlingham 
Gaudy Esquire at Mr Wardes house, a barber in 
Fleet Street right over against the King’s head 
tavern.” 
“Deere father I am not a little glad to heare 
of the perfect welfare of you and all our house- 
hold, considering the distress into whiche you 
were brought when I last left you. I hope that, 
when I come home next, nothing will fall oute 
so unfortunately as to procure our banishment 
from your house, as it happened when wee were 
last in the country. Within this fortnighte, or 
three weekes at the farthest (according to your 
promise when we cum away) wee shall expect 
our horses: I heare by the carrier that our newe 
orchard goes forward with greate expedition. I 
have a longing desire to see it, which desire I 
hope will be shortly accomplished. I have heer 
sent a booke with this letter, whiche is newly 
come out and I thincke it is worthe the reading, 
if it please you to take the paynes to puruse it, 
So with my humble duty remembred unto 
you craving your fatherly blessing I rest

“Truly Sir, amongst all the commodities 
which I enjoy heer at Cambridge, I find nothing 
prejudiciall to mee, but onely that I am so 
remote from my friends whiche if it pleaseth 
you you may supply by giving mee leave to 
come and visite you this vacation, which thinge 
T doe not request of you for the cause of absent- 
ing myself from my studies, but onely for the 
desire whiche I have to see you and my deare 
mother. I would therefore entreate you having 
already obtained leave of my tutor to come and 
see you within this fortnight or three weeks, 
that you would about that time send me an 
easy going horse, whereby the journey may be

“Deare father I hope you will pardon my 
negligence in that you have not received any 
letters from me since my last coming to 
Cambridge, the cause whereof proceedeth from 
diverse businesses wherewith I have bin em- 
ployed since I have taken possession of my newe 
chambers. Truly I am very much beholden to 
our maister for that hee hath bestowed them 
upon mee, for they are as convenient chambers 
as any are in all the colledge, which Mr. 
Rawlings can testify unto you. I have heare 
sent you my tuitours bill, which at the first 
view will seem to be very large, but when you

see the incom of my chamber and my fireing 
this winter, and other necessaries in it, the 
which you shall never find in my bill againe, 
your mind will bee soone altered from your 
former cogitations. I hope you will not be 
unmindfull of my late requests unto you to 
send me another suit of apparrell which I make 
no doubt but you will yield unto, consideringe 
what need I shall have when I come home at 
Christmas. I pray let mee receive your answer

“Dear mother, in the last letter which I

mee that you would send mee the cakes and

very honest fellowe, and hathe promised mee to 
call in our house alwaies, when hee cometh into 
Norfolke which is once a fortnighte, and will 
bring up letter or anything for me which you 
will send. I would entreate you to make me

but as for them things I will leave them to 
your own discretion to send them when you

from mee to London to dwell there, but Iam 
very glad to thincke that I have given him no 
occasion of his departure; the cause of his 
departure being the desire (which I thincke

LETTERS OF THE 17TH CENTURY 237 
It is worth remarking that there is no 
reference in the above letter to a matter on 
which the bulk of his fellow-students were 
probably taking a keen interest. The fifth of 
November was one of the days for the college 
bonfire :—the authorities at that time encouraged 
these displays rather than the reverse. In fact 
the bursar generally entered the charge in the 
college accounts. 
It may be added that William, the writer 
of the above letters, was the eldest son, and 
entered as a fellow-commoner. He was one of 
the very few in that position who proceeded 
to a degree. He afterwards entered at the 
Inner Temple, and in due time succeeded 
his father at West Harling. He was created 
a baronet in 1663. 
“Sir, I writte to you the last weeke to 
desire you to send me some mony for the 
cookes bill, which comes to 12s, but fearing 
that my letter should have misscarryed I 
presume to trouble you again, desiring you to 
send it me. I pray send me those saltsellers 
which you promised me when you were at 
Cambridge. I stand in very much want of 
plate. So remembring my love to my brothers, 
I rest 
Your most obedient son, 
‘ Bass. Gaupy. 
To his much honoured Father William 
Gaudy Esq. at Mrs Sharpe’s house in Bury 
St. Edmunds.” 
Bassingbourne, the writer of the above and 
of the next two letters, was a son of William
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 EARLY. COLLEGIATE LIFE 
above. He was at Christ’s College, where he 
entered as a fellow-commoner in 1654. He 
resided for about two years and a half, but 
did not proceed to a degree. 
It may be mentioned, as an illustration of 
the almost entire absence of what would now 
be called the democratic spirit in the English 
Revolution, as compared with the French, that 
the institution of fellow-commoners was in no 
way interfered with. They remained about as 
numerous as before, and retained all their 
old rank and privileges. 
“Sir, you must needs furnish me with some 
money this weeke by the carrier. He will be 
very trusty to deliver it tome. My tutour gave 
up his quarter bills this weeke to his pupills, 
and my bill which I must pay him this weeke. 
If you have not payd Mrs Pidgeon for the last 
quarter I pray doit. I shall expect an answer of 
this letter and of the last this weeke. So I 
reste 
your obedient son 
Bass. GAvuDY.” 
“Sir you told me that you would have me 
come into the country this Whitsontide. If it 
be your pleasure I may have a very good 
opportunity to come home with Mr Pigeon, 
who will be here this week with Mr Poley 
fellow-commoner. I shall be very well furn- 
ished with an horse, for Thomas Glover offers 
to lend me his horse all the time that I am in 
the country. Sir, if it be your intention that I
-P-A-G-E-247
  LETTERS OF THE 171H CENTURY 239 
should come, I desire you to send me word 
tomorrow, which you may do if you please but 
to wright a letter and send it this night to Mr 
Browne the Wollen Draper who comes to New- 
market, and will deliver it to one that will 
deliver it to mee, the reason because I would 
know so speedily is because I would send my 
things by the carryer to be ready against I come. SoI rest 
your most obedient son 
Bass. Gaupy, 
To his very loving friend (i.e. father), William 
Gaudy, Esq. at Mrs Sharpe’s house in Bury.” 
It will be noticed that the above letters to William Gaudy are addressed, not to W. 
Harling but to lodgings at Bury. This, com- 
bined with the fact that he obtained a baronetcy soon after the Restoration, raises a presumption 
that he was a Royalist whose estates had been sequestrated.

LETTERS OF AN 18ta CENTURY 
STUDENT. 
The following letters I owe to the kindness 
of the late Mr. Albert Hartshorne, of Charlton, 
Shepton Mallet, who sent me transcripts from 
his own large collection of family papers. The 
letters were addressed to Mr. Hartshorne’s 
maternal grandfather, Thomas Kerrich, well 
known in Cambridge as the University Librarian, 
and as a man of much artistic knowledge and 
skill. The writer was Framingham Willis, son of 
Thomas Willis, of Brancaster, Norfolk. He was 
admitted pensioner of Caius College, June 25, 
1767. He was afterwards a Fellow of the College 
from 1772 to 1776, and was presumably by pro- 
fession a barrister, as he entered at the Middle 
Temple. He changed his name to Thurston in 
after life. 
The picture of College life thus presented is 
in several ways of much interest. The date 
corresponds with almost the lowest period of 
the fortunes of the University during the last 
850 years. The total numbers had then shrunk 
sadly since the brilliant days before the Civil 
Wars; and, with the fall of numbers, discipline 
had relaxed, and teaching, both Collegiate and 
University, had almost disappeared. I have 
described the state of things in the Biographical 
History; but these letters give evidence of a 
fact to which I have also called attention, viz.
-P-A-G-E-249
  
LETTERS OF AN 18TH CENTURY STUDENT 241 
that at this time of depression there were never wanting students who in their own quiet way,— with few examinations to help, or hinder, them, and no prizes to reward,—took a real interest in their work. 
“ Dear Sir, 
Since I had the happiness to see you last I have been admitted of this college, where I am now resident. From the observations I have been able to make, I must be of opinion that a College life, for one of a serious turn, and contemplative disposition, is the most delightful situation imaginable. My residence here, how- ever, was at first, a little uncomfortable, where 
T could hardly see a single person whom I had met with before, or anyone who might instruct me in the ways and customs of the place. But this awkwardness is worn off now, and I am almost as perfectly settled in College as one who has led the greater part of his life in it. Since my being here I have taken a view of all the Colleges, which has been I think the pleasantest time I ever spent in my life. You would hardly believe it is in the power of art to furnish out such a multitude of noble buildings as you here meet with. Here is every convenience allotted to the Students that can possibly be expected from the bene- factions of kings and queens. I do not believe, 
as good a painter as you are, that you can fancy finer walks than those about Trinity College, 
R  
-P-A-G-E-250
    242 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
or a more magnificent edifice than the College 
itself. I am, however, so singular as to prefer 
Clare Hall to any of the rest. It is neat beyond 
description ; and though it might not at first 
sight strike your fancy so much as Trinity, yet 
the more you consider, the more you admire it ; 
whereas the surprize occasioned by a magnifi- 
cent appearance wears off, after once or twice 
seeing, and the beauty of it is lost inseénsibly. 
IT have to-day seen the public Library where the 
Learning of all ages is represented, and to which 
something is added every day. The number of 
books in it is supposed to be upwards of seventy 
thousand. 
Can you, my dear Sir, or rather can you not 
yet discern, to what all this prattle tends? 
Can you conceive, why I should lavish uselessly 
ink and paper, to describe to you things with 
which you will presently be well acquainted ? 
In few words it is no more than this. I most 
heartily wish for your company here; and as 
you have no longer any apprehensions of the 
small pox, I see nothing to hinder it. It was 
once I know your father’s intention to have you 
reside here before the commencement, and by 
that means to escape the odious title of a Term 
Jobber. I wish heartily that he may continue 
in that resolution; and be assured you may 
depend on any assistance that lies in my power 
at your first setting out; and perhaps I may 
be well enough acquainted with the College 
custom to give help to one who is a perfect 
stranger. 
I congratulate you and your sister on your
-P-A-G-E-251
LETTERS OF AN 18TH CENTURY STUDENT 243 
recovery from the small pox; to whom as well 
as to your father, pray present my compli- 
ments. 
I am, Dear Sir, 
Your most assured friend, 
and obedient servant, 
Fram. WILLIs. Caius College, 
June 30th, 1767.” 
“Dear Sir. 
Your not coming up to College as soon as you expected, I assure you, is a cutting dis- appointment to me. I had laid my account 
with having a friend resident here, during the 
whole vacation, with whom I might in agreeable 
converse pass away the minutes, which every one must allow for a recreation from study. Such a disappointment is the more severely 
felt at this time, as the University is always very thin during the long vacation; and there will not, in a week’s time be one Undergraduate 
left in Caius besides myself. The objection you make to coming up immediately, I must beg leave to say, is very frivolous. Your being already admitted will prevent the examination 
you so much dread: and let me tell you the examination at a person’s first being admitted, though it were much more strict than it generally is, is very easily passed through, and hardly deserves to be stiled any thing else than a mere matter of form. My Tutor,
-P-A-G-E-252
  244 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
when I first went to him, only desired me to 
construe an ode in Horace, a few lines in the 
beginning of a Satire in Juvenal, not more 
than three sentences in one of Cicero’s Orations, 
and as many verses out of the Greek Testament. 
‘A Homer indeed was: produced; but as it had 
a Latin version quite uncovered, which, if there 
had been occasion, I might with one single 
glance of my eye have had recourse to, it hardly 
deserves to be mentioned. The examination by 
the Master and Dean was still more easy than 
the Tutor’s. 
If this be only an objection started by 
yourself, if the fear of an examination deters 
you from getting settled here, I hope I have 
by this time removed it: and if your father 
has no more weighty reasons to alledge against 
your coming up immediately, I shall still expect 
the pleasure of your Company. 
Your opinion that Magdalen is the worst 
College in the University seems founded upon 
prejudice, rather than on reasonable ground. 
The College is but badly situated, and, I think, 
not overstocked with Undergraduates, but it 
has one ornament, by which it outshines not 
only all the Colleges here, but perhaps all the 
Universities in the world—the best mathe- 
matician' and most able astronomer of them 
all. The Library there I have not seen. I 
apprehend it will be an easy matter for you 
to avail yourself of any advantage, which might 
be open to you from it, if you had liberty

LETTERS OF AN 18TH CENTURY STUDENT 245 
to go and come as you please; for as long as 
I have been in Cambridge I have not once got 
admission into our library. 
Your hint about not contracting too much 
acquaintance at my first setting out, I am 
obliged to you for. It was indeed what I had 
determined against before my coming up. 
Iam, with compliments as before, Dear Sir, 
Your most assured friend 
and humble servant 
Fram. WILLIS. 
Caius College. 
July 18th, 1767.” 
“ Dear Sir. 
Your last letter, bearing date the 8rd of 
August, I did not receive till the 13th of this 
month. Sure Cooper’s people must have been 
strangely negligent in not putting it into the 
post office according to your direction. Your 
questions are so very numerous that I am afraid 
I shall not be able to answer them all in this 
epistle, for want of room: but to begin with the 
first. I must take the liberty to say, that your 
asking me what purpose my residence here 
during the vacation will answer, is absurd 
enough. Pray what end do you think your 
residence here in term-time will answer? you 
will tell me that you come with a design to 
study. I stay here for just the same reason, 
and by the bye, I think this time the most 
convenient for application. For though I like 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  
246 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
books indifferently yet I love to enjoy my 
friends, which it is most convenient to do in 
term time, and there is an inconvenience you 
will be subject to at your first outset which you 
ought to guard against; that is the interruption 
of Loungers. There are but few people of this 
stamp in the university now; they are all gone 
down into the country, and none are left behind 
but those that are studiously inclined. There- 
fore this is an evil I am free from; and indeed I 
got a room up two pairs of stairs in order the 
more to have it in my power to dip (?) the non 
domi upon them. They are a set of people 
whom I much dislike ; for they relish no scheme 
of diversion that you can propose to them, but 
take a pleasure in ruining two hours in a morn- 
ing by idle chit-chat which may be applied to 
good advantage. You desire to know the 
_manner I spend my time in College; but before 
Tdo this, I must tell you that you will be here 
your own master, and may do just what you 
please (so it be nothing wicked) without controul. 
As I can do anything I please at this time 
especially, I spend a part of my time in a 
manner very different from what the rest of my 
acquaintance here do, in a manner which 
perhaps you may call whimsical. I generally 
rise at five, and then read for an hour; at six I 
take a pretty long walk, but so as to be back 
to chapel at seven. After chapel is done, three 
times a week I go to the cold bath, and after 
that I come home to breakfast, which I take 
1 There was then a bathing place in the Fellows’ garden, 
like those still existing at Christ’s and Emmanuel.  
-P-A-G-E-255
LETTERS OF AN 18TH CENTURY STUDENT 247 
care to have over before nine. Then I sit down 
+o read for three hours and a half, and at half- 
an hour after twelve my hair-dresser comes to 
me, and I begin to dress for commons. You 
will be obliged to comply with the custom of 
putting on a clean shirt every day and of 
having your hair dressed. After commons, if 
ever, ’tis allowable to lounge away an hour at a 
friend’s room and drink a glass of wine, but this 
is what I seldom do. At five I sometimes go to 
a, Coffee-house, where you meet with all the new 
pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, &c., and 
drink a dish of tea, coffee or chocolate. At six I 
return to chapel, and after that I take a walk 
on the walks if it be fine weather, if not, in 
some college cloisters. At eight, your bed- 
maker comes to ask what you please to have for 
supper, and gives you a bill of fare, which they 
call here a size bill. They have always very 
good things, but they are exorbitantly dear, as 
you may guess by 8d for a common tart. 
Persuade your father to let you have a good 
allowance; if you keep whole terms, an hundred 
pounds a year will not be sufficient. You will 
be glad to hear that the custom of drinking is 
entirely exploded in polite company; but I 
would advise you never to seem afraid of drink- 
ing, for the bucks here will imagine by that, 
that they can make you drunk very easily; and 
to make a freshman drunk is excellent fun to 
them. Your Tutor or your Master will probably 
ask you to sup with them; if they do not I shall 
be glad to see you with me the night of your 
admission and then you will be in no danger to 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 EARLY COLLEGIATE LIFE 
be led into any excess. Does not your father 
come up with you? 
An old acquaintance ought not to be dropped 
abruptly; always be civil and complaisant to 
him, but never go to his room to sup or engage 
in any scheme with him. He is very expensive 
I am told, and the character that he bears in 
the University is that of a d——d polite fellow, 
one who is a blood in all respects, but that he 
cannot afford to spend so much money. 
Make yourself master of all common arith- 
metick and decimal fractions &c. There are 
many (other) questions to be answered but I 
must defer (them) till another opportunity.

“Dear Sir. 
One of the questions proposed for me to 
answer, in your letter of the 8rd of this month 
was, what studies I have been principally engaged in since my admission. In order to 
answer this I must tell you that we have a 
number of exhibitions here from £8 to £10 
per annum each, which are divided among the 
freshmen every year, according to their several 
abilities. The candidates chuse some particular 
book, in which for three days they are to be

closely examined by the master and fellows, 
or at least by such of them as like the office. 
During this time of probation it is customary 
with us, and has been so ever since the days 
of Dr Caius, to have sugar-roll and sack standing 
in the hall, and battledores and shuttlecocks 
to divert ourselves with, while we are not 
engaged with the fellows; Joyous doings! 
‘Hueis 6& xhéos ofov axovouer, ovdé Te iSuev. 
There is a specimen of the old bard who 
has taken up all my time ever since my 
admission. I hope to make myself entirely 
master of him before I go into Suffolk. You 
ought to know whether such a custom prevails 
in Magdalen, and if it does, you should take 
care to make yourself acquainted very intimately 
with one of the Classics whichever you please. 
I have been somewhat more gay and idle than I 
should have been this last fortnight, in making 
parties to go on the water, and in riding out 
to Newmarket and the country round about 
Cambridge in little one-horse chaises, which 
they call Bougeés (? Buggy). This is a very 
pleasant way of making a journey; and going 
upon the water with a set of no more than 
four friends for about three miles to drink tea 
is what I like exceedingly; but have been 
once caught in a violent shower of rain and 
ducked pretty frequently. If you are fond of 
going on the water you will have a fine 
opportunity of indulging your inclination, as 
Magdalen is close by the river side, and the 
men of Magdalen from being so much on 
the water are called Magdalen rats.

desirous that it should be answered without 
delay, I take the opportunity of to-day’s post 
to write to you. It sometimes happens that 
sheets go with the bed, but more frequently 
they do not; for most people bring up new 
sheets with them at their first coming to 
College, and you may easily conceive that 
after they have been used 8 or 4 years they 
are worth but little to the next inhabitant of 
the room. If you bring up any with you, 
they should be two pair of small sheets. The 
rest of the linen you will want are two table- 
cloths, two breakfast cloths, some napkins and 
6 towels and as many coarse cloths by way ‘of 
rubbers. As to bands I do not think you can 
have them made to your liking in the country. 
I have seen the Mr Tyson you speak of, at 
Dr Barnadiston’s. He has very much of the

that he sat for the medal. I saw a picture of 
him at the same time; a very good one in 
my opinion. 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr Buxton’s 
house while I was in that part of the world; 
but as I went to dine with him and not with 
a professed intention of seeing the house, I 
did not perhaps see so many of the good 
pictures as you did. Mr. Buxton seemed to 
be a man who has some regard to the antiquity 
of his family. All the paintings I saw were 
in two parlours and most of them family ones.

are to expect you here. The proctors for this

COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS SIXTY 
YEARS AGO. 
[Lhe substance of the following paper was read to the 
members of a College Club a few years ago. It may serve as 
a sort of Appendiz to the foregoing historical essays, by showing 
how, and when, some of the various steps were taken by which 
the old order gradually died out. It must be remembered 
that for me, and my contemporaries, the medieval, or rather 
the Elizabethan, statutes were in full legal force. The 
University statutes had been but little changed ; those of the 
Colleges not at all. So far as the law was concerned, we 
lived under the old régime. The remarks which follow were 
intended to show how far custom, as distinguished from law, 
had advanced from the old state of things towards that now 
Samiliar to every student. It need not be said that they are 
the reminiscences of a “reading man.” (The late Mr. Henry 
Labouchere, of ‘‘ Truth,” almost over-lapped me in point of 
time; but I take it that his reminiscences would not have 
overlapped mine.)} 
I have been asked to give some account of 
the manners and customs, the ways of thought, 
and the main teaching influences, prevalent in 
College in my day. 
One natural preconception I should like to 
remove out of the way at once. I am not 
proposing to point a moral by drawing com- 
parisons; that is to say, I do not want to pose 
as an advocate of either the ancient or the 
modern. Each advocate can find plenty to 
say for himself by appeal to familiar quotations. 
The old man may draw out a saying from 
his school-books which begins with “Attas
-P-A-G-E-262
254 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
parentum .. .”; the young man may retort 
with a remark which is older still, and remind 
us that he who asserts that the former days were 
better than these “doth not enquire wisely.” 
We might go on all night pelting each other 
with similar saws and rival authorities. 
Sixty years represents a long stretch in 
modern times. It embraces the period not 
quite of your grandfathers, but one which ex- 
tends some way behind that of most of your 
fathers. It may almost seem to you as if the 
inferences belonged to what are called the 
“prehistoric” class; were of the kind which 
depend upon the polish of chipped flints, and 
the size and proportions of the crania of such 
specimens as have happened to be preserved to 
your own days. Doubtless I am a fossil; but 
then I need not remind those of you who are 
students of natural science how much may be 
learnt from a fossil. Think what it would be if 
some Pterodactyle or Ichthyosaurus—to go no 
further back than that—could be induced to 
give you a verbal account of its actual habits 
and its former environment! 
To begin, then, I apprehend that actual 
College life played a larger part in our ex- 
perience than it does in yours. For one thing 
we were in residence for a considerably longer 
time. Every man, “Poll” and “Honour” alike, 
stayed here for ten terms before he was entitled 
to a degree; that is, he had just half a year 
more of residence. Again, almost every reading 
man spent his Long Vacation here; moreover 
he had three of these, instead of two, and the
-P-A-G-E-263
SIXTY YEARS AGO 255 
Vacation residence embraced on the average 
nine weeks as against the present six. This 
statement does not rest on mere recollection. I 
went carefully into the question some years ago 
by reference to our cooks’ books, which record 
the exact residence of every man, and I found 
that on the average the men of my time spent 
some twelve weeks more in Cambridge than do 
those of the present day: reckoning to the usual 
time of degree. This represents a large per- 
centage in three years. And even as regards 
the Long Vacation, we were already on the 
down grade. Our nine weeks were what was 
left of an original allowance of twelve. This 
reduction had, I apprehend, been made just 
before my time, Dr. Phear, of Emmanuel, 
assures me that, in his first summer of coaching 
(1851) the four pupils who were reading with 
him stayed continuously for twelve weeks. 
Then, too, we were hardly ever away for a 
single night. Except for the emergency of a 
call home, on account of illness or other grave 
cause, it never occurred to us to be absent from 
Cambridge during the course of actual term. 
In those days, as you perhaps know, the 
apparition of a telegram generally indicated 
death or some serious domestic crisis. The 
two main railways were of course then in 
existence—though the Great Northern route to 
Cambridge was hardly discovered—but the 
trains were comparatively few, slow, and ex- 
pensive. A Great Eastern Sunday train took 
three-and-a-half hours from London to Cam- 
bridge—I suppose that many of you could beat
-P-A-G-E-264
256 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
this now by the road; on bicycles, of course, 
without appeal to the motor. Our early dinner- 
hour also stood in the way of any attempt to 
secure even a half-day away from Cambridge. 
From the nature of the case travelling was 
somewhat of a luxury. “Third Class” was out 
of the question, as that involved the “ Parlia- 
mentary train,” which stopped at every station. 
Even the second class carriages were most 
uncomfortable. The first class fare was twelve 
shillings; the same that it had been for an 
outside place on the coach. 
As to education or tuition. The floodgates 
which might be supposed intended to pen in the 
exuberant energy of the lecturer had not then 
been opened, and no inundation of that kind 
yet threatened to cover the face of the earth. 
Of course we had College lectures, but then we 
had none but these. The inter-collegiate system 
was as yet unknown; in fact I am in the habit 
of priding myself on the claim of having been 
the first to introduce it into the University, 
some fifty years ago, in my own department of 
the Moral Sciences. Everyone, so far as the 
regular official instruction was concerned, was 
thus entirely dependent upon his own College. 
The obvious consequences followed. His own 
College may have provided well, say, in Mathe- 
matics, but have been utterly insufficient in 
every other direction. Outside Trinity and St. 
John’s there was probably not a single College 
which provided what would now be considered 
the minimum of necessary instruction, even in 
Classics and Mathematics. Our own College

was, I imagine, rather above the average in this 
respect, for the teachers were competent so far 
as the two main branches were concerned; but outside this narrow range all was a blank. 
Theology, for instance, was represented by a good-natured mathematician—his good nature 
being the cause of his accepting a post declined 
by his colleagues. He did not dive so deep into 
his subject as to consult Alford’s Greek Testa- 
ment, the ordinary popular hand-book of the day; and his grotesque attempts at' comment 
and interpretation, when he trusted to his own 
critical instincts, were the joke of the College. 
I shall not easily forget the feeling of being 
distinctly set back towards school-boyhood, 
experienced by those even who, like myself, 
had come from a second-rate school, but who 
had at any rate some familiarity with the Greek Testament. To a man like the late Professor Bensly, who came here straight from the admirable teaching at King’s College, London, the experience must have been like that of waking up to find himself sitting on the benches of a Sunday school. 
I have said that the teachers, classical 
  
1It is one of the ironies of things that, whilst many learned and ingenious comments, from other teachers, have dropped out of mind, such an illustration as the following is retained. The lecturer was expounding the miracle of the healing of the paralytic recorded by St. Mark. He pointed out that as the subject was calleda young man (rexvov) he could not have been quite grown up: on the other hand, as it took four to carry him, he could not have been very young: “whence we may conclude that he was something between the two.”

and mathematical, were competent. But they 
worked on a system which will rather surprise 
you. The “Little-Go” then occurred just in the 
middle of our career, and we had in consequence 
regular and frequent lectures both in classics 
and mathematics. During the first few terms 
we had to attend these every day from 9 to 11. 
So far, good; but what will now seem odd is 
that we all alike had to attend the same lecture. 
There was no selection or discrimination what- 
ever. I imagine that the initial difference in 
the relative attainments of the freshmen was 
decidedly greater in those days than it is now, 
for there was no attempt at anything which 
could be called an entrance examination. So 
for term after term we all sat side by side, 
listening—or not listening, as the case may be— 
to the same exposition. There was, as I say, 
no selection or discrimination. The brilliant 
scholar from the best public schools, and the 
young man who had given up business and was 
beginning his Greek letters with a view to 
taking Orders; the destined high wrangler, who 
had read his conic sections as a schoolboy, and 
the youth to whom Buclid and his mysterious 
pictures were a daily puzzle, sat side by side on 
the benches of our lecture room, and tried to 
make the most of the lecture, or at any rate of 
the time during which the lecture was delivered. 
This arrangement, prevalent I believe in most 
if not in all the Colleges, was probably one of 
the worst features in the system of the day. 
It compelled every student, practically, to resort 
to a private tutor, for the lecturers, as a general
-P-A-G-E-267
  SIXTY YEARS AGO 259 
rule, gave no assistance whatever out of their official hours. In fact, as they were very frequently private tutors as well, in their spare time, it could hardly be expected that they should do so. I feel quite confident that I never received a single word of advice during my whole time from the tutor, unless it were as to what church I had better attend or avoid. Under the circumstances of our lecture system you will understand that it was quite natural to say, aS One came out of the room, “Now I can begin my work”; and that no sarcasm was intended when we agreed that one great advantage of the Long Vacation was that we were then entirely unhindered by lectures. This absence of specialisation continued for a year, at least, after entry at College: I might almost say, for a year anda half. The Little-Go came, for all alike, at the end of the fifth term, and therefore our classics had to be kept up to some extent during fully half our career. More than this. During our first two terms those who hoped for a scholarship found it necessary to divide their attention almost equally between the two main subjects. It may be one of the perversities to which the old are notoriously subject, but I must confess to a preference of the former system over the latter, at any rate in this particular respect. Unless a man is being trained to become (say) a mathe- matical professor, I do not see any intellectual advantage in his “getting rid of” his classics at the outset. And I should say the same about most of the other professional 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
260 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
or semi-professional subjects included in our 
various Triposes. 4 
The Classical and Theological Examination 
came at the end of the first Lent term, the 
Mathematical at the end of the first May term. 
We were all classed for each of these, and the 
scholarships were awarded entirely by the joint 
results of the two examinations. With the ex- 
ception of two or three petty encouragements 
to chemistry and anatomy there was no such 
thing in the College as a scholarship for any 
special subject. This was not a peculiarity in 
our case; it was almost universal in Cambridge. 
The old conception still prevailed that the 
scholarship was given in accordance with 
general attainments in the common subjects 
of the University course. 
I alluded just now to the non-existence of 
what are called “open” scholarships. Con- 
sidering how readily the clever boy obtains a 
scholarship nowadays at the age of 14 at any of 
our big schools, it will seem rather surprising 
to you that we at Cambridge had to wait till 
the end of our first year before we had a chance 
of such a distinction. And it will be the more 
surprising when we remember that at some 
Colleges at Oxford the modern system of open 
scholarships was already in vogue. The results 
of this difference of practice deserve notice. 
Take my own case. Two or three of my com- 
rades obtained scholarships at Oxford Colleges, 
and for months before they left school enjoyed 
the consequent distinction, and their master 
the consequent credit. I, who was destined for 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  
SIXTY YEARS AGO 261 
Cambridge, could not look forward to any such promotion till a year and a half later. I need hardly point out that, in these days of publicity 
and rivalry amongst the schools and their 
masters, such a disparity of conditions would have produced an almost insurmountable 
handicap in favour of Oxford. As it was, a 
strong inducement was offered to every clever 
boy to have a try there first. A few years after 
my time the consequences became so obvious that Cambridge was driven, in self-defence, to 
adopt the same system. If I may use terms which are risky in times of controversy, I 
should say that the preferential tariff on the 
Isis led to retaliation on the Cam, and that 
this retaliation was justified by its success. The fact is, that the modern conception of a 
scholarship (or fellowship, for that matter) as a pure reward for intellectual merit or industry, 
and as a test therefore, to be widely advertised, 
of the schoolmaster’s labour and skill, though already generally adopted in practice, had not 
yet been fully worked out into its consequences. 
I am not going either to attack or to defend 
that conception, but simply to point out that the ancient view, viz. that such endowments are 
purely charitable gifts—assistance intended 
solely for the poor student—was not altogether 
extinct. A free gift of course is judged by rules 
very different from those which are applied to prizes after competition. The donor, in the former case, gives to those who are in some 
way connected with him, to men of “founder’s 
kin,” to students from his own county, town, or
-P-A-G-E-270
  262 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
school; and no rational person can object to his 
doing so. In my day, for instance, there were 
many scholarships, all of more or less ancient 
foundation, and nearly all confined to this or 
that locality. I happened to be the first scholar 
of my year, but the best scholarship was not 
then available for me. It had to go to someone 
from Norfolk. Of course there were complaints 
against such a state of things, and a few years 
later the growing revolt against these and other 
anomalies led to the first University Commission, 
which carried out such sweeping changes. It 
was this Commission, as you perhaps know, 
which first avowedly and statutably fixed the 
principle that University benefactions were to 
be regarded as rewards of intellectual merit, and 
of that only. As I have said, there was decided 
dissatisfaction felt by those who suffered under 
the old system; but I should hardly say that 
this amounted, as it would now, to a keen sense 
of definite injustice. One took these things, as 
one does most of the long-established mischiefs 
of the world, as something which would be 
better mended, but which did not call for loud 
complaint and outcry. 
The elder Mr. Weller, you may remember, 
rather prided himself on the educational ad- 
vantages which he had conferred upon his 
better-known son; he had, he said, just let 
him run about the streets and pick up infor- 
mation for himself. The College authorities of 
my day adopted a somewhat similar plan. In 
all respects we were left very much to ourselves 
in the matter of our studies. The tutor, Mr.
-P-A-G-E-271
  SIXTY YEARS AGO 263 
Clayton, never lectured. We saw him for a few minutes at the beginning and end of term; that 
is, to report our arrival and to secure our exeats. That comprised our whole intercourse with him, except perhaps an invitation, once or twice in the year, to a big breakfast party, or to the tea which led up to some missionary or religious meeting. To prevent any wrong impression I should like to say that this was not due to indolence or neglect. He was a very kind-hearted and worthy man; and I am convinced that if any of us had gone to him in difficulty or in doubt, he would have given all the assistance in his power. But that was not the custom. Moreover he had the charge of a populous parish in the town; and as the leading representative of the Evangelical party, he was much occupied in religious movements. I feel as certain as one can be that during my first two years I never had a word of private conversation with any authority of the College as to my studies, and equally sure that I never paid an informal visit to any Fellow’s rooms. We selected our coaches by mutual advice and comparison; we decided for ourselves what line of studies we would follow. In saying this, however, it is only fair to remind you that our path was a much simpler one than yours. We had small alternative as to the choice of subjects, or as to the time of exami- nation. There were only two goals for the Honour man, the Classical and the Mathe- matical. On this point I should like to add a few words. Every one knows that the advance
-P-A-G-E-272
264 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
of Natural Science, in respect of the number 
of teachers, and of the amount of lecture room, 
laboratory, and apparatus required, has been 
very great during the last 60 years. But I 
doubt whether you all recognize how great it 
has been. Put it in this way. As you walk 
down Pembroke Street you see some seven or 
eight acres to right and left of you, covered 
with buildings devoted to “Science.” That is 
the grown, or rather the growing, tree: What 
was the seedling 60 years ago from which it 
has developed? I should say that it was a 
small table, such as two people might take 
their tea at; a table not in constant use, but 
brought into the Arts School three times a 
week during the May term. This will need 
some explanation. I am not speaking of the 
medical schools; and exception must be made 
of the Sedgwick Geological Museum, which 
already existed on the ground floor of the 
Cockerell Building in the University Library. 
But it is more than epigrammatically true of 
all the other modern departments. The per- 
former at that table was Professor Stokes 
during his lectures on Physical Optics. He 
had the use of the room just for the purpose 
of his lectures. In 1856, when I attended, an 
assistant followed him with a heliostat, a prism, 
and one or two similar articles, which were 
placed on the table, and removed at the end 
of the lecture. Very likely he had more 
apparatus in his college rooms, but that was 
all that we students knew of. It is possible 
that Miller, the professor of Mineralogy, and  
-P-A-G-E-273
SIXTY YEARS AGO 265 
Henslow, of Botany, adopted similar devices; 
but I have some doubts as to this. Willis, 
the Jacksonian professor, had, I am told, a 
collection of mechanical models; but there 
was no museum in which to keep them. 
Whatever, and wherever, they may have been, 
however, they may be regarded similarly as 
the seedling from which the goodly tree of the 
present Engineering Department, with its 
Laboratory and range of workshops, has grown. 
It is a moot point—which I am not going to 
discuss—whether, in our early years, the effort 
of study, or the actual result obtained, deserves 
most consideration. If the former, we had per- 
haps some advantages. How the Poll-men fared 
I can’t say; by the results of the class-lists, I 
should judge, badly. As to Honour-men: we 
had few or no “tips” or notes of lectures, or 
suggestions as to what books or parts of books 
we should read. There was but little of this, I 
think, from the private tutors, and nothing, I 
should say, from the lecturer. The familiar 
Paley, of the Little-Go, may serve as an illus- 
tration. As we drifted on to the time when he 
became imminent we—I am speaking for my 
friends as well as for myself—procured the book 
and read it for ourselves. I never had a word of 
lecture upon him, and never saw a “tip” or 
sheet, beyond a few hints in the way of memoria 
technica, which tradition has doubtless handed 
on. Perhaps it was due to this mode of treat- 
ment that I found the book decidedly interesting, 
and still retain more than a lingering liking for 
Paley.

Those who are enquiring into the habits and 
beliefs of some almost extinct race of early 
culture naturally ask in the first place about 
| their marriage customs, or the position of 
| women amongst them, and about their re- 
| ligious rites. In our community the question 
is easily answered, for there were practically no 
ladies in the place, so far as we undergraduates 
were concerned. My cousin, Leslie Stephen, of 
Trinity Hall, who was three years my senior, 
used to say that about the only lady he had 
ever spoken to during his College course was, 
he believed, his bedmaker. I have tried to 
recall the occasions on which I was introduced 
to ladies’ society—as I have said, for matters of 
this sort my memory is good—and can only 
remember three or four, and these were not 
exactly lively functions. The female element 
in University society was epigrammatically 
described as consisting of five or six wives of 
Masters of Colleges,! who sat apart; of five or 
1 The ancient dignity and inaccessibility of the Master 
of a College still lingered about the members of that order. 
Whewell was perhaps the last to retain the old attitude, 
which he did till his death in 1866. Towards the end of his 
life I had the following experience. A first cousin of mine 
was staying at the Lodge, and I received an invitation from 
her to come in and take a cup of tea on the Sunday evening. 
On arrival, the man-servant pointedly suggested that I should 
keep my gown on. As I was then an M.A. of five or six 
years’ standing, I rather resented this requirement, and went 
into the drawing room as I was, in ordinary black. There 
‘was no party: only two cousins of mine, and Whewell 
himself—who did not wear a gown. The Master said nothing, 
whatever he looked; but next day I received a serious 
remonstrance from my cousin, evidently inspired by the 
Master, pointing out, courteously but severely, the gravity of 
the offence. Some years before this, when a small boy, I was 
taken by my father on a visit to the Lodge at Queens’ :—the   
 
-P-A-G-E-275
SIXTY YEARS AGO 267 
six wives of professors, upon whom the former 
did not call; and of one other lady, wife of a 
well-known classical coach. Remember, too, 
that there was no May Week (or fortnight) in 
those times. The flower show, which was 
started, I think, in my second year, was the sole 
representative of that chronic festive activity 
which becomes acute during the first half of 
June. No one went to see the boat races other- 
wise than on foot; society, indeed, had not 
clearly ascertained that Cambridge had a river. 
I suppose that most men received a visit, once 
during their career, from their parents and 
sisters. But I should not like to be positive 
on this, and I cannot recall more than a single 
occasion on which I met the family of any friend 
of mine. My own people came to see me once, 
for a couple of days, in the Long Vacation. 
As to orthodoxy, it is difficult, in these days 
of free discussion, to bring home to you how 
undisturbed we—that is, the average quiet 
reading men—were in this direction. Atheism 
of course had a certain vogue in the big cities, 
but in those days it went in its shirt-sleeves 
and corduroys, and smoked coarse tobacco; it 
President was. a contemporary and old friend of his. I 
noticed that his sons, boys of somewhat my age, made a bow 
on entering the room where their father was. This may 
have been partly parental reverence, but I suspect it was 
mainly magisterial authority which was recognized. 
2 Time was when Sturbridge Fair must have afforded, for 
several weeks in September, as gay a time as any student or 
visitor could have desired. But long before my time it had 
sunk from being one of the great historic fairs of Europe, 
recognized by, and feasted at, by University authorities, into 
a two or three days’ gathering of horse-dealers, circus per- 
formers, and so forth.  
-P-A-G-E-276

had not come to cigars and dress-suits, and to 
sitting at table with bishops. I should say that 
the first tremor which foretold the coming 
earthquake was the publication of Essays and 
Reviews a year or two after I had graduated. 
What emphasized the influence of this rather 
dull production was the startling review of it 
by Mr. Frederic Harrison in the Westminster. 
As a rule, no sceptical remarks met our eyes in 
print. Amongst papers of repute there was 
indeed the Leader, a weekly newspaper, and the 
Westminster Quarterly just referred to, but 
they had no circulation here, and lay quite 
outside the path of most of us. Indeed, I think 
the existence of “the infidel” was only made 
known to us by his occasional demolition in 
orthodox polemical works. This was my own 
case, the orthodox writer being Rogers, the once 
well-known and popular author of the Eclipse 
of Faith. <A decided majority of us—in our 
College at least—contemplated taking Orders, 
or had come to College with that hope on the 
part of their parents. Nearly half of us were 
sons of clergymen. 
We were a very church-going, sermon- 
attending folk. Hall, on Sundays, was at 4. 
Chapel at 6. Accordingly, we came out of our 
own service during the course of that in the 
churches; and a very large number of us were 
in the habit of attending the sermon at one or 
other of the parish churches. Trinity Church 
was the most popular. It was then held by 
our tutor, Clayton, the representative of 
evangelical opinions here, who drew large
-P-A-G-E-277
  
SIXTY YEARS AGO 269 
numbers of University men. He held the living 
once occupied by Simeon, and carried on the 
traditions thence established. The intermediate 
link between the two was Carus. Harvey 
Goodwin, afterwards Bishop of: Carlisle, was 
his only rival in popularity. But almost every 
church in the town had its regular or 
occasional visitors. 
As to one prominent characteristic difference 
between the old and the new, I feel a difficulty 
in the want of a descriptive word that shall be 
perfectly neutral. If we speak of your life as 
being “luxurious,” blame seems implied of the 
present; and if we speak of our life as “simple” 
or “severe,” praise seems implied of the past. 
Perhaps, therefore, it is best to speak generally 
of the “ease” of modern life in College. Of 
course this characteristic is not confined to 
College life ; it is displayed everywhere in every 
detail of present society; it is the natural 
and necessary outcome of improved mechanical 
methods and advanced scientific knowledge. 
Vastly more result is obtained by the average 
labour of the average man, and this gain is 
taken out in increased ease and comfort nearly 
all round. 
There is no question, then, that our life, in 
comparison with yours, was somewhat rude and 
severe. Begin with the meals. The Hall, in 
my first year, was for freshmen at 4, for others 
at 5; on Sundays, I think, for all alike, at 4. 
Consideration of the restraints imposed upon 
the digestive apparatus even of the young will 
suggest that such an hour precluded, as a rule, 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
any serious attempt at either lunch or supper; 
and of course it blotted out all thought of 
5 o'clock tea. It was not intended for this 
purpose, but was the temporary outcome of the 
well-known secular drift onwards of the dinner 
hour. Under Edward VI. that hour had been 
about 11; now it is 7 or 8; with us it was 
4or5. Personally I hold that 5p.m. was a very 
suitable hour for purposes of study; but it was 
decidedly hostile to the natural designs of the 
butcher. Lapsing for a moment into auto- 
biography, I should say that breakfast did not 
often go much beyond eggs and bacon; that 
lunch (if the term may be used) was secured by 
cutting bread and cheese at the cupboard door ; 
and that the place of supper was occupied by 
tea and bread and jam. And the dinner itself 
was of the simplest. Nothing was regularly 
provided for the table beyond joints, potatoes 
and cabbage. There were, of course, waiters in 
hall,—gyps and bed-makers—but we did all our 
carving for ourselves, pushing the dish from one 
to another in turn. The wasteful hacking of 
the joints which ensued, may be conceived ; as 
each operator followed out his own ideas 
as to the method of carving. (There is an 
engraving representing a dinner in Trinity, 
date about 1830, which will illustrate some 
of these details. During the 25 years or so 
which had elapsed, by my time, the custom 
of dressing for dinner had dropped out.) Sweets 
and cheese had to be specially ordered — “ sized 
for,” in technical vocabulary. Soup, fish and 
game were absolutely unknown. Let me add, 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-279
SIXTY YEARS AGO 271 
though, that, to the best of my belief, such a 
being as a “teetotaller”! was not to be seen or 
heard of in the whole College. 
As regards our rooms, of course furniture 
was scanty and plain for the most part; but the 
main difference was displayed in the bed- 
rooms. These were historically interesting as 
“survivals” of ancient conditions of life. As 
some of you know—I have gone into the subject 
in my College History—the very notion of a 
separate bedroom was a comparatively late 
introduction into College life. I should doubt 
if a single bedroom had a fire-place, except 
where an original entire chamber had been 
converted into a bedroom. Sometimes the 
sleeping apartment had been obtained by 
making a sort of hutch in the corner of the 
sitting room, separated off by a lath and plaster 
partition; sometimes a whole neighbouring 
chamber had been annexed for the purpose ; 
sometimes one of the ancient “studies” in the 
corner of the main room was retained. There 
was one bedroom in which, literally, a man of 
six feet could not stand up; another, in which 
he could hardly lie down; in several, a bath   
} A few years after this, when dining at Trinity, my host pointed out two Fellows at one of the tables, with the remark 
“They are teetotallers”: somewhat in the tone in which he would have indicated, say, Parsees. There was a pernicious 
practice in college of giving beer-orders. One wrote a sort of 
cheque payable (in beer) to bearer. Armed with this the 
college servant, or other recipient of a tip, went to the buttery 
and was duly regaled. As some of them (e.g. the boot-black) 
came, to every man every term, for this purpose, the results 
were undesirable. I once asked that functionary how ever 
he managed to get through it. He could only reply, “We 
works it off, Sir, we works it off.”
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
was impossible unless you balanced it on the 
bed. In my case, in the ancient Perse Buildings, 
a top attic—once doubtless shared between two 
students—had been set apart for a bedroom; so 
that I went up two pair of stairs to bed. It was 
under the thin sloping roof, with one window 
to the north. In the terribly severe winter of 
1854-5 the water in the jug was frozen apparently 
into a solid block for several weeks, and my 
sponge became as a brickbat. Such washing 
as could be effected was carried on over the 
sitting-room fire. Apropos of this, I remember 
a man remarking, during this or a following 
winter, that he had thrown his sponge through 
the wall of his room. Regard had to the flimsy 
nature of some of the partition walls, as 
described above, and to the consistency which 
a sponge could sometimes acquire in college 
bedrooms, the statement was probably quite 
true. 
I have said something about this elsewhere, 
but as it may be new to some of you I may 
devote a few words to giving a notion of 
our sanitary standard. In the bedroom above 
described I contracted small-pox. Of course 
the doctor (it was Paget—afterwards well-known 
as Sir George Paget, who was naturally aware 
what College rooms were like) at once ordered 
my bed to be brought down into the sitting- 
room; but what I want to point out is the 
sort of precautions against the spread of 
infection, which it was thought necessary to 
adopt. My sitting-room was one of six on the 
staircase. Not a man left in consequence; 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  
SIXTY YEARS AGO 273 
disinfectants and antiseptics were quite un- known; no nurse was brought in ; the bedmaker, in her daily rounds, looked after my wants in the intervals between attending on those of my neighbours; and the tutor dropped in once or twice to see how I was getting on. I just desired a paper, with “Ware Small Pox” on it, to be stuck on my door, and that was all. Of course it was not a very severe case, but I know I felt bad enough, and was in bed for a week or two. I may add that mine was one of three or four simultaneous cases, all similarly and success- fully treated by the above simple method. Nor did I ever hear that the bed-makers, or their “helps,” spread the mischief amongst their own families in Barnwell or elsewhere. There was nothing to call an epidemic in the place in consequence of this. The infection had been introduced by a medical student from the hospital, where there were then several cases. 
No water was laid on anywhere in the College. Our whole supply, for drinking and washing, came from two or three pumps. One of these stood at the corner of the Perse Building, against the wall of the Fellows’ garden, and we used to hear the bedmakers pumping and gossiping under our windows during the greater part of the morning hours. It may be added that almost exactly behind this pump, on the other side of the wall, was a privy in full use. Some years afterwards, when the constant service had been introduced from the waterworks, we had our first invasion 
T
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
of a typhoid epidemic: due, as it happened, 
entirely to the introduction of poison germs in 
the drinking water. 
What was done then, you may ask, in case 
of fire? As it happens, I can tell you, as the 
last serious fire in our College occurred during 
my second or third year. Our methods here, 
though—like those for the treatment of small- 
pox—somewhat out of date, were not quite 
ineffective. One evening, about nine o'clock, 
the bedmaker rushed into my room to say that 
the College Hall was on fire. I was one of the 
first to arrive. The floor was alight underneath, 
and the flames were streaming up against the 
wall from behind the wainscot. Incidents of 
the kind were sufficiently frequent and recent— 
there had been a big fire at Trinity Hall two or 
three years before—for tradition to prompt us 
aright. We ran back for our slop pails, and 
formed a line; several being told off to work 
the pumps. My station was near the top of 
the stairs, from which I could see the fire, 
apparently gaining ground, However, the 
supply of water soon became ample, and we 
extinguished the fire in time, partly owing to 
the exertions of an athletic fellow of the College, 
“Joe” Croker, who broke open the floor with a 
pickaxe so as to let the water reach the flames. 
For colleges on the river bank matters were 
much easier, as water in abundance could easily 
be obtained. Archdeacon Hare, in his sketch of 
John Sterling’s Life, describes how, during a 
fire in the New Court of Trinity, he found his 
pupil—at that time in delicate health—heading

the line of buckets or pails by standing nearly up to his middle in the water. 
Tadd a few trifling matters because, after all, 
the amenities of life are largely made up of a multitude of petty details, Cabs, for instance, 
to convey one to the playfields, or to an evening 
entertainment, were quite unknown. They did 
not begin to ply in the streets till many years afterwards, and of course no one ever dreamt of 
ordering out a fly fromthe hotel. Iam tolerably 
sure that I was scarcely once inside any convey- 
ance except the omnibus, which at the beginning and end of term took one from and to the station. In those days of the paper-tax “the Press” for us was represented by the books we bought, or took out from the Union, or the newspapers 
that we read there or at the booksellers’. You 
might have searched the whole College through, I suppose, without finding a periodical or journal of any sort, except in the Fellows’ Combination 
Room or Master’s Lodge. Cheap magazines—I 
mean those at 1s., not at 3d—started with 
Macmillan in 1859. What we read, therefore, 
were books. Doubtless, if the Strand or Windsor 
had been procurable I should have read it; as it was, I remember, I took to Alison’s History of Europe and similar works, and spent my spare time in the two terms preceding the Little-Go 
in learning German. A moderate supply of novels could be procured from the Union library; for the stern rule of excluding fiction, 
with which the Society started, had been 
abrogated before my time. 
Our etiquette as to dress was rather strict.
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
The “chimney-pot” hat was our only head-gear 
besides the College cap, at first; but during my 
time it began to give way to what would now 
be called a “bowler” of some sort. The straw 
hat was a licence tolerated during the Long 
Vacation: I remember a man pointing to a 
comrade, who had dared to appear in a 
straw, at the beginning of the October term, 
and remarking that “he ought not to do that.” 
Readers of Verdant Green may remember that 
when the hero of that story went to Oxford— 
just about the time that I came to Cambridge— 
the coach in which they travelled was lined out- 
side with hat-boxes. We always carried our silk 
hats with us, either in a box or on our heads. 
On the way to the boats, even, no man wore a 
flannel cap, still less a blazer.’ On Sundays— 
but here the proctors set the rule—no one ever 
walked except in cap and gown; and agcordingly 
the villages for ten miles round were familiar 
with the academic dress. 
‘As to our modes of getting about the country. 
—our private locomotion—you, of the bicycle 
period, may like to know how we effected it. I 
am the more willing to explain this because 
I belong to the now fast dwindling generation, 
which actually practised the art I am about to 
describe. If you will give me your careful 
1 To speak of a “blazer” in the modern sense, 4.6. aS & 
flannel jacket of any colour, is, strictly speaking, an ana- 
chronism. We spoke only of “a Johnian blazer”; the bright 
scarlet of the Lady Margaret club making the application 
quite appropriate. The extension of the term, as at present, 
occurred soon afterwards. Can the athletic supremacy of the 
club (St. John’s was head of the river 1854-7) have had any- 
thing to do with the change of application ?
-P-A-G-E-285
SIXTY YEARS AGO 277 
attention for a few moments I think I can make 
it plain. Conceive yourself, then, on a bicycle, 
from which the entire framework and both 
wheels have been removed. And suppose that 
instead of employing the feet indirectly to work 
pedals they are brought to bear directly upon 
the surface of the earth. You will see at once 
that locomotion in this way is quite feasible, 
though of course tedious and slow in com- 
parison with the present method. We called 
it “walking,” and managed by this device to 
accomplish considerable distances. Indeed, 
there was a somewhat prevalent persuasion in 
my time that the proper thing to do was to 
walk to London in the day. A considerable 
number of my contemporaries—some of whom 
are still alive—fulfilled this duty. Indeed I, 
who appear before you now, have done the 
same. Doubtless you know the roads about 
here as well as we did, and for many miles 
outside what was familiar to us: but do you 
know the country in directions where your 
wheels are apt to be a hindrance? Two very 
characteristic specimens of our local scenery 
became early familiar to me, and would still 
stand out vividly in my memory even if I had 
not visited them since. One of these is the river- 
way to Ely, along the towing-path. Never can 
I forget the aspect of that lonely waste of 
the fen-lands, as I first saw them in winter, 
with the church spires standing out across 
the level, against the evening sky. Another 
such picture is that strange and grand 
monument of early times, the Fleam Dyke,  
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
from its commencement in the fens near 
Fulbourn Station to where it is lost in the 
woods toward Wood Ditton. Wild life, in some 
of its forms, was not then so scarce as it is 
now. For instance, a pair of ravens bred in 
Madingley Park. And I have seen herons and 
the green wood-pecker in the meadows beyond 
Grantchester. 
Apropos of the river, one or two remini- 
scences may be excused. I was always fond 
of the strange and lonely reaches of the Cam 
towards Ely. One long vacation, in August, I 
walked with a friend, by the towing path, to 
Ely. One curious fact struck us. There were 
no gates on the path, but only solidly-built 
stiles. The hoof-marks of the horses were plain 
enough to within a few feet of the stile, and 
recommenced in the same way a few feet 
beyond. In the interval, what became of the 
horses? Did they climb or did they jump? 
It seemed incredible that such lumbering beasts 
could be got over by such means. So we waited 
at one stile to see. True enough, as the barge 
advanced, the horses were stopped to allow the 
rope to become slack. They were then whipped 
up and made to jump. It was plain that they 
sometimes failed to clear the stile, for the top 
bar was scored with hoof-marks, and in some 
cases had been solidly repaired. On enquiring 
at a neighbouring farm-house we were told that 
it was no use putting gates on the path, as 
“those bargees” were such a rough lot that they 
could never be trusted to shut them. (Shortly 
afterwards I was struck by a remark in
-P-A-G-E-287
SIXTY YEARS AGO 279 
Olmsted’s work on the slave states of America. 
Explaining the economical disadvantages of 
slavery he pointed out that, owing to the 
ignorance and coarseness of the negroes, they 
could only be trusted with mules; horses would 
soon be knocked up by their treatment.) An- 
other habit of the bargees may be noticed, as 
it may help to explain some old allusions and 
pictures. In the times rather before mine the 
barges were not usually, as now, punted through 
the town and past the Colleges (see Ackerman’s 
picture of Clare College); the horses were 
harnessed to the barge, and made to tow it, 
the bargee sitting on the back of the horse. An 
old uncle of mine who, as Fellow of Queens’, 
occupied rooms facing the river, retained to his 
dying day recollections of the sufferings of the 
horses and the lurid language of their drivers. 
By my time the river had lost its old com- 
mercial importance as the sole means of access 
for heavy goods, though it was probably more used than it is now. Sedge, for instance, once 
the sole material used for kindling, was still 
brought up in barges from the Fens; and the cry of “Sedge, Oh!” was to be heard of an 
evening about the town. I suspect that the present resined fire-lighters (like Huntley and Palmer’s Reading biscuits) were amongst the “freshmen” who came up just before me, and 
have been in residence ever since. 
But there is more to be said on the subject 
of walking, Remember that it was, with 
the majority of us, the sole mode of exercise. 
There was of course the river, for those who 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  280 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
had a taste that way, and there was some 
cricket for a few weeks in May. But that 
was all. Lawn tennis and croquet were unborn. 
Real tennis and hunting were of course confined 
to the wealthy few. Hockey and football were 
left to boys. I have been since informed that 
some devotees of what was commonly regarded 
as a school game occasionally indulged, in 
obscure places, in the peculiar art that they 
had acquired at Rugby or Eton. But I am 
certain that I never saw the game played, 
and that no friend of mine ever practised 
it. This is confirmed by my brother, who 
was four years my junior. He tells me that 
he remembers a friend coming in to Hall 
and relating that he had seen a number of 
Rugby men, mostly freshmen, playing a new 
game: that “they made a circle round a ball 
and butted each other.’ As to hockey, I 
remember its being once referred to by a 
Rugbeian: “Ah, a private school game.” With 
the exception then of those who boated, no 
ordinary reading men ever did anything 
in the afternoon but walk in the country. 
Don’t suppose that I am drawing invidious 
comparisons, or underrating our disadvantages, 
but I should like to point out one consequence 
of such a state of things. I have been asked 
before now what I had found to be the 
main formative educational influences here. I 
have replied, with strict truth, that I had 
learnt something from my lecturers, more 
from my coach, but most of all from conversa- 
tion with friends; and the main opportunity
-P-A-G-E-289
SIXTY YEARS AGO 281 
‘for such conversation was the daily walk. 
What comes back to my mind most vividly 
in such a connection? I am anticipating a 
little in referring to John Seeley, for I did 
not know him actually as an undergraduate, 
though I became intimate with him soon 
after. And what is the most vivid impression 
of him that has been left stamped on my 
mind? I should say, as the delightful 
companion of a long day’s walk. Memories 
come crowding back to me of hours spent 
on Welsh mountains, and in Yorkshire dales, 
and over the breezy commons of Surrey, with 
that most stimulating of companions by my 
side: and all the time the incessant “give 
and take” of conversation:—(it was nine 
parts of “take” and one of “give,” so far 
as his comrades were generally concerned.) 
Traditions of him may have come down to 
you from those of middle standing who knew 
him here. If so, the picture would be perhaps 
of one with almost an excess of the philosophic 
mind; grave, dignified, and possibly somewhat 
lethargic. I wish I could adequately portray 
the slim, active form of one who was then one 
of the keenest and most subtle of dialecticians, 
brimming over with happy illustration and 
humourous fancy, and with a memory stored 
with poetry and philosophy. Those were the 
early fermenting years, when Ecce Homo was 
taking shape in his mind. Ah, gentlemen !— 
if I could set before you half-an-hour of his 
conversation I should speak to more purpose 
than I am likely to do now.
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 COLLEGE LIFE AND WAYS 
His, of course, is an extreme case, but 
many another walk is dotted with similar 
bright spots. of reminiscence; and the level 
roads and lanes for miles round about us 
here in Cambridge serve to recall hours of 
delightful and profitable intercourse with many 
a dear friend of the past. I do not doubt that 
your interest in the problems of Ethics, 
Politics, and Philosophy is just as keen as 
ours, and that it exists with equal intensity 
during a scrimmage on the football field, or 
a lively rally at tennis, but it will be admitted 
that the free expression of that interest is 
comparatively hampered at the time.

PREFACE 
Too many people consider Play apart from the general social 
movement. This is wrong, for all our modern welfare movements 
are closely linked together and in many places they overlap. The 
Play teacher, Physical director, Health worker, Social worker, 
Religious worker, Americanization worker, and the general Edu- 
cator, all have many interests in common. There are times when 
each must act in the other’s capacity, or at least have an understand- 
ing of the procedure that is necessary. For the reason of this close 
inter-relationship, this book has been written in the hope that it will 
give students and teachers of Play a broad perspective of their pro- 
fession; and at the same time that it will carry an interest and appeal 
to many individuals who are not directly concerned with Play 
activities. 
The term ‘‘Play” has been used in a broad sense throughout. 
It has been used to include many things which the general public 
does not think of as being play. Many educators may think that 
altogether too many values have been claimed in behalf of it. The 
writers believe, -however, that anything that is accomplished in the 
spirit of play is Play regardless of what the popular conception of 
the activity may be. 
The freedom with which the writers have included activities 
within the scope of Play does not mean that they consider that all 
the ordinary tasks of school life and occupational life must be 
“sugared over.” On the other hand, they do not think that school 
work must remain irksome—as some educators would insist—in 
order that benefits may be obtained. The idea is not to remove all 
obstacles; nor is it to put unnecessary obstacles in the way: but 
rather to infuse each individual with a Play motive that is strong 
enough to counteract the distaste he may have for the drudgery that 
is found, not only in work, but even in the highest forms of play and 
art. 
The reader must not get the impression that Play of itself con- 
tributes so many of the benefits that are needed in our life of today. 
Play does possess many possibilities for good, it is true; but there.

must always be wise regulation and direction. Perverted play is a 
possibility just as much so as beneficial play. The claims of this 
book are based on the assumption that the influence of trained 
leadership is present. 
In general, four lines of thought have been followed out in the 
subject matter: first, a background for the present Play movement; 
second, an analysis of the phases of the movement; third, a study 
of the types of play activity, and the methods of organizing them; 
and lastly, the cgnsideration of Play’s place in education. 
An extensive bibliography has been included with each chapter 
in order to assist the teacher who wishes to assign outside reading, 
and to save time for the reader who wishes to get other viewpoints 
on any particular question. 
There has been occasion to quote from other sources. Certain 
chapters have used material resulting from the experiments of other 
workers in this field. The writers are grateful for all assistance 
that has been given in this way. 
The various plays, games, and athletic sports, have been de- 
scribed in another book, Vol. II., “The Practice of Organized Play.” 
The present book deals with them in a general way only.

CHAPTER 1 
THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 
Play is universal. All over the civilized globe girls play with 
‘dolls, boys wrestle, and older people dance and otherwise disport 
themselves. Even certain specific games are found almost every- 
where; a simple childhood game such as our “Blind Man’s Buff” 
may be seen in France or Scotland under a different name; or, the 
game called ‘Fox and Geese”’ in one section of our country may be 
found, slightly altered, as ‘‘Fox and Chickens” in another section. 
Play, a part of our civilized life, is just'as much a part of uncivilized 
life; for explorers, whether searching among the jungles of hottest 
Africa or the frozen plains of Iceland, will find the peoples, both 
aged and young, indulging in peculiar amusements and pastimes. 
ee Ee it in the ruins of ancient Egypt and 
abylonia reveal toys such as dolls, tops, rattles, and various other 
trinkets of pottery and metal, showing that the boys and girls of 
these remote civilizations were wont to play. The Chinese, Koreans, 
Peruvians, Aztecs, and other ancient races have left traces of their 
play in the toys of children and in the drawings and crude sculptures 
that depict boating and hunting, and festival scenes. 
While some form of play has always existed, the present play 
movement is clearly a product of the twentieth century. To-day, 
play exists as a highly organized institution which is being promoted 
and fostered by the public as a whole. It is true that certain races 
like the Spartan and Roman have given national backing to types of 
warlike play, and that the Athenians in the period of their ascend- 
ency gave a play training for the cultivation of bodily beauty as 
well as for the attainment of moral aims in keeping with their idea 
of citizenship. For the most part, however, play has been an 
unorganized activity in which children and adults have engaged only 
on impulse or because certain holiday occasions have been associated 
with merriment. Even as late as our last generation this was its 
status. There are many people who think that the artificial stimula- 
tion of to-day is not in keeping with the play spirit; but the point is
-P-A-G-E-10
    2 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
that this resort is needed to attract children to the play centers and 
to induce the adults to leave their ordinary cares and work, for once 
they become engaged in plays and games there is no loss of freedom 
whatsoever. Play is extended not only in scope of numbers of 
people and of ages taking part, but the curriculum of games and 
other activities has been largely widened and expanded. In accord 
with the rise of play to a movement, many new games are being 
invented by combining features of the older traditional ones. 
Play Among Primitive Peoples 
The thing that the student of play should note is that the forms 
of play become more varied and complex as the civilization of 
human beings advances. ‘There is, in fact, a hierarchy of plays 
ranging from the gratification of physical appetites and the pleasures 
of simple sensation at one end of the scale up to the highest forms 
of intellectual play as found in science and philosophy.” (Bobbitt). 
Among the lowest types of savages the only pleasures are almost 
purely animal ones, such as are found in appeasing the cravings of 
hunger, thirst, and sex, in finding shelter, and in waging successful 
strife against wild beasts and human enemies. The little true play 
that is found also gives evidence of the close contact of man with 
the primitive life, for it is an impromptu and aimless mimicry of 
animals and men, and a crude attempt to express the emotions by 
means of rhythmic movements. As savage life progresses there is 
found an increasing ability in the power of man to appease his wants © 
and otherwise control his environment. Attendant with this new 
freedom, there is a demand for expression of a new independent 
personality. Hence, organized play and art arise. Crude as these 
may be in the beginning, they lift man above the level of the lower 
animals; he is then thinking in the abstract and giving meaning to 
life. He does this of his own free will, without any coercion what- 
soever—he simply desires the pleasure of conscious personality. 
It is not peculiar that savage tribes like mimicry, pantomime, 
and rhythm as they do. Savages are impressed by action more than 
by speech; and consequently they like to dramatize their thoughts. 
Being ‘creatures of strong elemental emotions, they are peculiarly 
susceptible to music, either of voices, or of crude tom toms or other 
musical instruments. Their bodies react somewhat as sounding 
boards, and different vibrations produce different excitements. Pas- 
sions of anger, love, sorrow, etc., can easily be aroused and then
-P-A-G-E-11
  
THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 3 
continued almost indefinitely. Many cases are cited by travelers 
where the performers will continue to dance until they fall to the 
ground completely exhausted. In the crudest forms of the dance, 
the animal dances, the savage will imagine himself invested with the 
spirit of some animal, which, throughout the dance, he tries to 
imitate. The hunting, war, and religious dances are intensely. 
dramatic. In the first case the killing of the prey is vividly por- 
trayed. -Everyone is acquainted with the way in which the Indian 
tribes aroused their braves to a mad frenzy by means of the war 
dance and through the exhortations of the grotesquely painted and 
ornamented medicine man. The place of dances as constituting acts 
of worship is quite natural, there being needed in such instances, too, 
an outlet for the feelings. Peoples that have reached the agricul- 
tural stage of progress also use the dance as the appropriate way to 
express thanks to their gods for an abundant harvest, or on the other 
hand to express sorrow and supplication in time of famine. 
In general, primitive play takes the form of exercise that is 
expressed spontaneously with little or no preparation or organiza- 
tion; it brings into use all the large muscles of the body; it exercises 
the senses in crude and fantastic manner as by bright colors, dis- 
cordant sounds, etc.; it gives vent to a display of imitation, mimicry, 
pantomime, and rhythmic song or incantation; and the particular 
form of activity is done over and over again with monotonous 
repetition. 
The play of the younger children is almost entirely aimless and 
impromptu, and takes the form of dramatic imitation of the pursuits 
of the elders. The play of children is overlooked by the elders until 
the time comes when the boy is strong enough to be considered as 
a hunter and warrior; then he is given practice in these arts. The 
girl approaching womanhood is taken in hand by the older women 
and prepared to assist in the usual tasks of the hut and settlement. 
Only in the case of the more advanced savages do we find con- 
tests or games of strength and skill entering in. Wrestling plays, 
and running and throwing contests and games are then found, and 
even games in which’a ball is thrown and caught. Gambling and 
guessing games are also characteristic of the more highly civilized 
tribes only. When tribes have remained for some time in touch with 
the white civilization, it is not uncommon to find tag, hiding, and 
courtship games indulged in by old and young alike, as well as some 
of our lighter pastimes of marbles, jacks, dominoes, target-pitching, 
and kite-flying.
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The Evolution of Play 
The way in which a play consciousness, both individual and 
group, arises among primitive peoples, has already been explained. 
In any progressive civilization it is easy to see how play gradually 
expands in a variety of ways. An increasing amount of leisure time 
gives more importance to festivity. Too, the time that is no longer 
needed for the hunt and battle has to be spent largely in preparation 
for these things, much as the athlete trains to-day for the contest; 
and so there is a play imitation of pursuits necessary to existence. 
Children seeing these things going on about them, begin to imitate 
then. Too, as tribes progress, these things are handed down from 
generation to generation, and a background of play traditions is 
established. 
It is in lands of plenty like Egypt, where the river Nile over- 
flows and leaves a fertile plain, and in Babylonia, where the river 
Euphrates similarly contributes, that we see the dawn of recorded 
civilization. The fertile land can support a heavy population and 
as certain tribes grow stronger and better organized they conquer 
others and set themselves up as a ruling class. This still further 
increases the time for leisure pursuits. The higher play of man is 
dependent upon adult leisure. With material wants satisfied, there 
is time for art, literature, philosophy, and other intellectual achieve- 
ment that can be preserved for the benefit of future generations. All 
these things in their cumulative value make for progress. 
It is peculiar that as man progresses in intellectual attainment 
he clings to his old customs, outworn as they may be. Therefore, 
while civilization goes ahead in creative, accomplishment, it links 
itself with the past for the benefit of the grown people who need 
restful play and for the little children who need to develop their 
inheritance. As a consequence, we find that many of our modern 
plays are relics of ages long passed by. It was only natural that, 
as man kept improving upon his environment and advancing in 
mental stature, he should choose new modes of living and look upon 
some of his former occupations in a trivial light. Many of the old 
religious ceremonies lost dignity as different gods gained ascendency; 
and the customary rites, though maintained, were considered of less 
importance, the sportive aspect superseding the serious one. Tribal 
customs easily degenerated into mock ceremonies as time went on. 
Thus, for instance, it is claimed that such customs as the bridal veil, 
rice throwing at wedding ceremonies, and the drink to one’s health,
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 5 
are all survivals of once serious rites and profoundly solemn cove- 
nants. Many of our gambling games are remnants of old practices 
in omens, superstitions, and magic. Our well-known children’s sing- 
ing plays are traced back to the old customs of dancing, the once 
serious ceremonial now garbed as play. Children’s counting-out 
rhymes like ‘‘Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo” are said to have originated 
in primitive methods of selecting by lot a person to be a hostage or a 
victim. In the same way, the line games of to-day are compared to 
meetings between hostile groups of old, the words called out—as 
“Pull Away’—signifying a challenge of one side which was an- 
swered in defiance by the other; the circle games, likewise, to old 
customs performed by a group joined in friendship; the games like 
“Blindman’s Buff,” etc., to old ceremonies of sacrifice; the serpentine 
games, to acts of worship in which a sacred tree was encircled. Tag 
and goal games in general are likened to old racial activities, such as 
flight, pursuit, capture, and escape, the last possibly depending upon 
reaching a place of refuge in time. In addition, games like ‘‘Fox 
and Geese” are supposed ‘to be symbolical of a domestic animal 
striving to protect itself and young against a beast of prey; whereas, 
games like ‘‘Baste the Bear” and “Hare and Hounds” represent the 
chase. Many of these conclusions, and more, are voiced by Mrs. 
Alice Gomme in her book of folk lore “Traditional Games of Eng- 
land, Scotland, and Ireland.” She draws the interesting conclusion 
that our children’s marriage games in line-form indicate primitive 
customs of marriage by capture or purchase; while the marriage 
games in circle-form, on the other hand, mean an advance to the 
point where courtship and love were necessary preliminaries. The 
well-known dance “Round and Round the Village” is pictured as a 
survival of a periodical village festival, on which occasion marriages 
were celebrated. 
Most of our modern contests of strength and skill, such as run- 
ning, jumping, throwing, and wrestling, date back to ancient Greece. 
Our first record of athletic contests is that given by Homer in his 
description of the funeral ceremonies that Achilles instituted in 
honor of his friend Patroclus. The origin of the great Olympic 
festivals is wrapped up in myths and legends, and it is not until the 
year 776 B. C. that the names of the Olympic victors were publicly 
recorded. Throughout their course these occasions maintained a 
religious significance. 
The Olympic games showed a high civilization. They were 
proof that a people had advanced beyond the tribal stage and to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
    6 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
status of a highly organized state. There, groups from widely 
scattered territories were invited to compete in the contests and 
festivities that were held, all assembling together for the big event. 
Certainly play in this premeditated and highly organized form had 
progressed far from the impulsive plays of savages. 
This love for strenuous athletic sports and competition is in- 
herent among peoples who possess a strong loyalty to their tribe or 
state and who have not as yet lost their primitive hardihood. Thus, 
in the republics of early Greece and Rome, where the citizens, 
though belonging to a superior class, were still ready themselves to 
take the field, there was a common willingness to engage in virile 
exercises that keep the body hardened and the spirit courageous and 
resourceful. While it is to these particular peoples that we look to 
find the origin of many of our popular athletic contests, still their 
later history shows a citizenship indulging in luxury, entirely content 
to watch hired performers play at active sports, and satisfied at the 
same time to entrust the protection of the state to armies of mer- 
cenaries. Among the early Germanic tribes, where a new idea of free- 
dom, equality, and democratic citizenship prevailed, strenuous sports 
again are found. At first they were largely connected with war and 
hunting. The Teutons were devoted to swimming, wrestling, horse- 
manship, footracing, spear throwing, broad and high jumping, and 
putting the stone; and these sports persisted with them down through 
the Middle Ages.. It is in the period of chivalry, when knights fought 
for land, title, and love, that a new type of contests arose to promi- 
nence. Then fencing, tilting, archery, and genteel horsemanship 
were popular; and along with skill in the new accomplishments, there 
came into existence a spirit of courtesy and respect for opponents 
that manifests itself to-day in the sportsmanship that we consider a 
necessary part of the atmosphere of our games. Our pole vault, bar 
work, and climbing stunts are of comparatively recent origin, the 
founders of the gymnastic movement in Germany having first given 
importance to them. 
It will be noticed throughout, that games signify a certain 
amount of organization, whether little or large: the very fact that 
games have rules shows that people are living under laws and that 
play likewise has been socialized. The most highly developed type 
of game—the team game—while modern in its present form, has 
come to us through a long process of evolution. Tennis is even said 
to date back to the days of the Roman Empire. Football, baseball, 
soccer, cricket, hockey, polo, golf, bowling, croquet, handball, and
-P-A-G-E-15
  
THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT oh 
others have taken centuries to assume their present point of organ- 
ization. A few games, basket ball and volley ball, for example, are 
the invention of our own day and age. 
It must not be thought that all the play which has been preserved 
and handed down to us in this way is of the kind to which only our 
higher instincts are attracted. A reversion to the degrading type of 
play cannot be escaped at the same time. The brutal gladiatorial 
games of Rome find their prototype in modern play in prize fights, 
in bull fights, in the spectacle of fights between dogs and other ani- 
mals, and in the free-for-all brawl, in which the last survivor wins 
the purse. Gambling practices have not diminished in intensity as 
time goes on. The encouraging thing about all this, though, is that 
society no longer countenances any of the above acts; they cannot be 
practiced openly, for the reason that they are under the ban of law 
as well as of public sentiment. 
Play and Environment 
Play is indeed found in all climes and during all ages, but admit- 
tedly it differs in certain respects according to the immediate environ- 
ment of physical and social influences. It is easily recognized that a 
child of the desert will not be likely to play at boating, nor could the 
child of the rocky seashore play at ‘‘Sandstorm.” It is therefore 
pertinent to the material of this chapter to interpose with a few 
notes on the influence of environment in shaping the character of 
play. 
Physical 
In cold regions like Norway and Sweden, we find skating, skiing, 
snowshoeing, tobogganing, and like sports favored by the people; 
and indoor gymnastics are more popular than the competitive 
games. In temperate climates we find the vigorous out-of-door 
games of England and its colonies, and America. But in hot cli- 
mates we find the leisurely pastimes such as those in which the Latin 
_ indulges; and likewise in the hot climates we find that many are 
content to assume the simple rdle of spectators. For sustained 
effort, the temperate zone is quite the most favorable. 
Wherever the sea is found, as in England, Australia, or on our 
own eastern and western coasts, we find water sports such as swim- 
ming, rowing, water polo, and the water joust; and children rapidly 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
learn to take part in them even at an extremely early age. On the 
other hand, inland countries like Germany and Switzerland have a 
strong leaning toward indoor games and gymnastics; and here like- 
wise the children will be found playing games very similar to those 
of their elders. 
Where stretches of sparsely settled land are found, such as in 
Canada, in Finland, in South Africa, there is a predilection to long 
distance running, to weight throwing, to wrestling, and to feats of 
strength; while the complex conditions of city life produce the 
nervous temperament and coordination for the different jumps, for 
motor accuracy and speed, for feats of dexterity and skill. The 
country-developed child is usually a much stronger being than the 
city product, but on the other hand lacks the grace and quickness of 
the latter. Often he is beaten in contests because of a tendency 
towards clumsiness and a lack of quick reaction. 
Social 
The customs and manners of each people often determine the 
type of play in which their interest lies. This is easily shown by the 
statement that all nationalities manifest some interest in sports in 
the United States, even though never having been interested in this 
kind of exercise in their native country. For instance, the German, 
although adverse, and not in the least attracted to team games in his 
own country, becomes interested and proficient in them in this coun- 
try. Another example is that of the Irish, who are a big factor in 
our American games when played here; yet, when an attempt was 
made to introduce baseball into Ireland by American sailors during 
the War, it met with but little or no success. Again, while the 
English rugby is almost unknown in our country as a whole, still it 
is very popular on the Pacific Coast, where the influence of Australia 
and New Zealand is strong. 
The above points do not hold true in the case of foreign-born 
settlers in a country new to them. The habits and attachments of 
the old games are too strong to give up at once. English colonists 
even take their games with them into the hottest of climates; and 
English and South African students at American universities play 
at their own games of rugby and soccer without being attracted by 
the American games going on about them. German districts in this 
country strive to keep up their gymnastic exercises and the social 
spirit of the Turnverein. It is quite noticeable, however, that the 
children of the above-mentioned immigrants seldom are adherents to 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 9 
the physical exercises of the “old” country; they become American- 
ized in games just as in everything else. 
In almost every way play in its various forms is representative 
of the customs and traditions of a people. It certainly is a means 
of determining the trend of a nation’s life, and a mirror of national 
character can be found in the easy-going, long-drawn-out, conserva- 
tive and individualistic English game on the one hand, and the high- 
strung, tense, changing, and success-seeking American game on the 
other. Primitive peoples are attracted to very elementary games 
which are imitative of the life around them, and which involve a few 
movements gone through with monotonous regularity. Decadent 
nations find enjoyment in watching play of the degenerate type such 
as bullfights, cockfights, and professional boxing and wrestling; 
autocratic nations specialize in the disciplined, machine-like, and sys- 
tematic gymnastics; and democratic nations produce sports. All 
through history, democracy has been accompanied by an interest in 
amateur sports. This is true of Greece in its “Golden Age,” and of 
Rome in its “Republic.” The sports of Greece and Rome compared 
to those of to-day, however, were as far lacking in the element of 
team play as were their governments in scope of democracy when 
compared with the governments of to-day. Team games and democ- 
racy are inseparable; the one goes with the other as a training for 
free citizenship. Democracy desires to develop leadership in its 
masses, and therefore is willing to foster the athletic sports which 
call for initiative and a keen exercise of the reasoning powers. The 
social environment becomes thus a criterion for the type of play in- 
dulged in by any people, the type of government, especially, affecting 
and determining the habits of play. 
HISTORICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD PLAY 
Play, it is true, has always been a function of the activities of the 
human family, yet one thing should be kept clearly in mind: that is, 
that play as an activity is not identical with play as a movement and 
as an institution. The general attitude toward play has been to 
regard it as something frivolous, aimless, and childish. It can easily 
be seen how this should exist. The material and content of which 
play consists is largely as follows: a make-believe of occupations 
and customs that were once serious and all important; an imitation, 
especially by children, of the present-day serious occupations of men
-P-A-G-E-18
10 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
and women; and lastly, a play gratification in creative accomplish- 
ment or achievement. The last phase shows play and art synony- 
mous and has been the only one which adults have considered in a 
serious light—here is expressed again the viewpoint that primitive 
peoples had toward their first play. All creative play in its turn is 
discarded for the mere acting of the once real thing. It is from the 
first two phases, however, that the viewpoint of the ordinary adult 
has been formed. Quite naturally, when he engages in activities 
which are ancestral or imitative, he considers his performance as 
rather undignified. He cannot help but connect this play with his 
own childhood, and yet he feels that the desire to act in this manner is 
something to congratulate himself upon, for the very reason that it 
shows that the spirit of youth is still alive in him. While he may 
think his play a childish trait that he has not outgrown, still he does 
not want to outgrow it. At the same time, he feels that this ex- 
uberant spirit must be curbed and subordinated to the more serious 
responsibilities: of life, and should only break forth on occasions set 
aside for frolicsome fun. This idea of associating his own play 
with that of his younger days, is the one that makes the adult fall 
into the error of thinking children’s play is just as trivial. His 
attitude assumes that the child should be allowed to occupy himself 
in such a manner because he is not yet old enough to do real work. 
The most sympathetic view along this line is that of parents, who 
having had to toil incessantly themselves, are anxious to let their 
children play as much as possible before having to shoulder the many 
responsibilities that come with maturity. This lack of serious 
thought toward the play of children is most prevalent among the 
less intelligent classes. Without exception, it means that the smaller 
children are neglected, and that no direction is given to their play. 
As a consequence, the youngsters imitate not only the good but the 
bad characteristics of their elders. 
The Military Attitude 
Certain nations discovered that play could be dicebeedt toward 
a certain desired end. Most often this end has been a military one. 
This was the case in the ancient Persian state and with the Spartans 
and Romans. The Persians made the training of the boy a matter 
of public concern. At the age of seven he was taken in charge by 
the state and taught to hunt and ride, to shoot with the sling and 
with the bow, and to throw the spear. Practically all his education 
was of the physical type. Certain moral virtues, particularly telling 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT II 
the truth and showing gratefulness, were emphasized. The girl’s 
education was of the domestic type, but did include singing and 
listening to fairy stories. 
Warlike Sparta went so far as to give their boys a scouting edu- 
cation that is somewhat similar to the outdoor life of our Boy Scouts 
of to-day, but the courageous, self-reliant, uncompromising, and 
hardened warrior was always the goal in sight; similarly, a health 
training for the girls was to produce strong mothers for the state. 
Part of the boy’s education was to bear all sorts of physical hard- 
ships, to learn to steal without being detected, and to bear pain un- 
flinchingly in public. Obedience and reverence for parents were 
prized moral traits. All music was of the martial type. This was 
a state which, under the rule of Lycurgus, was so severely disci- 
plined that the freemen lived in barracks, and iron money was used 
in order that the citizens could not carry enough to buy luxuries. No 
wonder the God-speed of the Spartan mother to her son: ‘“‘Come 
home with your shield or dead upon it;” no wonder the taunt of 
the Athenians, their rivals: ‘The Spartan’s life is so unendurable 
that it is not surprising he gives it willingly in battle.” 
This idea of parental and state attention to children’s play from 
the standpoint of its military usefulness was taken up by the Romans, 
a stern and practical people. Their play training allowed the 
younger tots to go their way largely unhampered; and as children 
will do, they played with toy carts and houses, dolls, hobby horses, 
stilts, tops, hoops, and at catching a ball. However, when the state 
felt that the children were old enough to be given serious attention, 
a different kind of exercise was in store for them, especially the boys. 
Running and jumping both armed and. unarmed, wrestling, sword 
and spear play, swimming, and horseriding then comprised the play 
—if it can be truly called play under the rigid spirit in which it was 
carried out. So possessed were the Roman people with this one 
ambition of preparing mind as well as body to meet the conditions of 
warfare that their public games, the notorious gladiatorial shows, 
would not satisfy unless much blood was shed. This cruelty was 
considered of practical importance in keeping the people, even in 
time of peace, hardened to the sight of death and suffering. Even 
the Roman matrons, who possessed considerable freedom in family 
life and in public, found great delight in these’ cruel spectacles. 
None of these attitudes in respect to play can scarcely be digni- 
fied by the name of movement. Play was considered as an educa- 
tional factor, to be sure, but only from the one standpoint—the

making of a warrior. This same viewpoint was held later, in the 
period of Chivalry during the Middle Ages, when knights held that 
their sons should learn to throw the spear, fence, swim, use the battle 
ax, ride in armor, and otherwise play at war. It is a pleasure to 
note, however, that a gentler spirit was creeping in, and that the 
youth was brought up with higher conceptions toward his opponents 
and toward women. 
The boy was trained from childhood with this ideal in mind. At 
the age of seven he became a page. For the next seven years he was 
trained in domestic duties and in the deportment of polite society, 
the latter including reading, writing, singing, dancing, chess and 
backgammon, gallantry, and listening to tales of brave deeds as sung 
by the troubadours. At fourteen he became a squire. He now 
waited in attendance upon a knight, and his duties were vigorous 
ones. He learned to hunt and to hawk, to vault and climb in armor, 
to ride, and to become proficient in the weapons of war, such as the 
lance and battle-ax. Running, jumping, wrestling, and swimming 
helped to harden the body for these feats. At twenty-one when he 
was dubbed a knight, he had learned the art of war in company with 
his chosen knight, was ready to tilt in the tournaments, and was 
thoroughly imbued with a spirit of loyalty and gallantry and the 
desire to champion the cause of the weak and oppressed. The tour- 
naments of this time rank as one of the great picturesque sights of 
history. 
The Art Attitude 
By far the brightest page in the history of play down to the 
present day is that which tells the story of the little republic of 
Athens, during the Golden Age of Pericles in the 5th century B. C. 
The Athenian ideal of citizen was soldier, athlete, artist, statesman, 
and philosopher all in one. These people believed in play and prac- 
ticed it. They exalted play to the level where it can be called a 
movement, the only true one outside of our own to-day. 
An examination of the curriculum of studies shows the impor- 
tance attributed to play in the making of this all-around citizen who 
could so enjoy the higher things of life. At an early age the boy 
and girl were given a nursery training that is not inferior in aim, if 
in equipment, to our modern kindergarten. There were infant 
chairs similar to our baby swings, colored rattles, many types of 
dolls, and toy boats, carts, and houses. The familiar toys—marbles, 
jackstones, hoops, hobby horses, stilts, skipping ropes, kites, swings,

THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY’ MOVEMENT B 
and see-saws—were in evidence, though often in a form that appears 
to us as crude and amusing. Then there were also childish games 
that resemble our Tag and our Hide and Seek, guessing games like 
Odd or Even, prisoners’ games, simple ball games, andso on. After 
this stage we must follow the fortunes of the boy, for girls received 
little attention thereafter, women having but little part in public 
life. 
At the age of seven the boy attended school in charge of a pri- 
vate tutor. In general two subjects were followed: gymnastics (for 
the body) and music (for the soul). The latter gave him instruc- 
tion in reading, particularly of Homer, also in writing, arithmetic, 
singing, rhythm, and in the use of the lyre and flute. But it is in 
the palaestra, the school of gymnastics, that we see our modern 
conception of play carried out. Here, the boys continued their free 
play, and were given instructions in running and leaping (for the 
lower limbs), discus and javelin throwing (for the arms and co- 
ordination with the eye), and wrestling (for the whole body as well 
as the control of temper). Dancing was also fostered as an art that 
would add grace to the movements of the body. Other activities 
were swimming, games with ball, and simple boxing. 
At the age of eighteen the youth was initiated into the company 
of the grown men and went through an apprenticeship of two years 
before being received into full citizenship. He continued his bodily | 
exercises but left the palaestra and associated with the elders in the 
gymnasium. In addition to the old sports he had known he was 
now introduced to a five-fold exercise called the pentathlon, and to 
a combination of boxing and wrestling, the pancratium. The gym- 
nasium also possessed a great influence as a social and intellectual 
center, and the youth was brought into contact with the great philoso- 
phers and statesmen. The gymnasium has been aptly described as a 
combination of a modern city club house with a city playground and 
park. 
The athletic skill which the Athenian training developed was 
tested out and exhibited in the wonderful spectacle of the Olympic 
games. So important were these games to Greece as a whole that 
the reckoning of time was dated by the Olympiads, the four-year inter- 
vals between the holding of the festivals. All hostility ceased 
between warring states and the occasion was one of general rejoicing 
and celebration. The athletes contended for the championship in 
all the popular athletic events as well as horseback races and chariot 
races. Not only did athletes vie for superiority, but the great poets
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
and sculptors contested as spiritedly in their lines. To attain the 
prize, the simple wreath of olive, was considered the peak of Greek 
ambition. But there was further honor forthcoming to the Olympic 
victor. His home city heaped honors upon him. Poets like Pindar 
celebrated his name in odes, and sculptors like Myron made him 
immortal in marble. It is quite easy to see why the great Olympic 
games could not remain unstained. The temptations to attain these 
honors were so great that athletes of the professional type did noth- 
ing but prepare for the games, and disreputable practices crept in, 
until by the time the Romans had conquered Greece, all the wonder- 
ful spirit that had once accompanied the games had been entirely 
lost. 
The words of the Athenian men of wisdom still preach to us the 
lesson that the play of the children is important and must be directed. 
To quote Plato: ‘Education should begin with the right direction 
of children’s sports. The plays of childhood have a great deal to 
do with the maintenance or non-maintenance of laws.” Aristotle 
voices the opinion: “It is also very necessary that children should 
have some amusing employment.” Pericles, the statesman, in his 
great funeral oration states the broad aim of Athenian education in 
the following words: ‘We cultivate the mind without loss of manli- 
ness . . . whereas our adversaries from early youth are always 
undergoing laborious exercises which are to make them brave, we 
live at ease and yet are equally willing to face the perils which they 
face . . . We have our regular games to provide our weary spirits 
many relaxations from toil.” 
The art attitude of the Golden Age is summed up in the words 
of Plato when he says ‘The mere athlete becomes too much of a 
savage, and the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what 
is good for him . . . the two should therefore be blended in right 
proportions.” 
The Religious Attitude 
Following the break-up of the Roman Empire, A. D. 486, 
there ensued a period of such great chaos that it is known as the 
“Dark Ages.” Barbarian tribes were overrunning all civilized 
Europe. People turned for solace to a spiritual conception of life. 
Everything was sacrificed to preparation for the world hereafter. 
Inasmuch as the body was looked upon as antagonistic to the higher 
searchings of the soul, every means possible was taken to deny the 
body its natural comforts, and even voluntary measures of self
-P-A-G-E-23

THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 15 
torture were resorted to. It is quite natural that play should be not 
only ignored but vigorously combated in such an age. The monks 
considered it as derived from heathenish practices and also as being 
one instrument of Satan’ for leading the physical self into pleasure 
and temptation. The following quotation expresses a saintly warn- 
ing against allowing children to play: “Play of whatever sort should 
be forbidden in all evangelical schools, and its vanity and folly should 
be explained to the children with warnings of how it turns the mind 
from God and eternal life.” 
The monastic viewpoint of regarding all amusements as sinful 
is found recurring later in the Puritan era. Even to-day we have 
not entirely outlived the religious fanaticism of the days of Crom- 
well, and much of the opposition to the play movement has come 
from people who feel that the only way to salvation is to practice 
rigid self-denial even as regards the most harmless type of pastimes. | 
On the whole, however, the Church to-day has swung over to a 
liberal attitude which even makes it an active promoter of the play 
programme. 
The Scientific Attitude 
Man by nature could not remain long in such an- unworldly 
atmosphere as both the monastic and chivalric attitudes represented. 
Toward the end of the Middle Ages a large number of influences 
brought about a changed attitude. The invention of gun-powder 
meant an end to the ascendency of the knightly class; and that of the 
printing press, likewise, to the clergy’s monopoly on learning. The 
common people began to assert an independence they had never be- 
fore possessed. The spirit of the age was one of questioning and 
of critical research: men no longer were satisfied with superstitious 
beliefs and theoretical speculations. They wanted to find out the 
real existing things of life for themselves; to understand themselves 
and the actuality of the world about them. The contact with the 
Saracens, a scientific people, and the rediscovery of the long lost 
knowledge of the ancients, especially of Aristotle, gave materia] 
which satisfied for a short time only. Then we begin to hear of 
discovery after discovery in the field of science. 
The great progress in the field of the physical, biological, and 
medical sciences, meant a revolutionizing of the attitude toward the 
place of physical exercise in education. The interrelationship of 
the mind and body as one distinct individuality was made evident to 
thinkers. In the Renaissance period, writers like Rabelais and
-P-A-G-E-24
oe ee er eer 
16 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Montaigne in France, Mulcaster and Locke in England, and 
Comenius in Germany, were found pleading for play as a necessary 
thing in the life of children. Rousseau and Richter followed later; 
and as the modern period was ushered in, experiments were begin- 
ning to be made in the practical application of play in the school 
curriculum. 
The scientific attitude not only evolved the idea of play as having 
educational value to the young child, but it attempted to place phys- 
ical exercise on a scientific basis from the health standpoint. Patri- 
otic motives were largely responsible for this latter experiment, 
which resulted in the great national systems of gymnastics in Ger- 
many and Sweden. These in turn have affected all of Europe and 
even the United States. The faults of the attempt to reduce the 
body to a machine-like basis, are in the main a repression of natural 
interests and of individuality. Such a training provides the material 
for exploitation when a militaristic class gains control as in the case 
of Germany. To-day’s attitude goes further and considers interest 
as a factor. The newer studies in psychology have shown that the 
value to be gained from any pursuit is largely dependent upon the 
liking shown for it, and therefore individual tastes and preferences 
must be taken into account. From this standpoint play is superseding 
the formal gymnastics, for true play harmonizes exercise with the 
instinctive tendencies of the mind. 
The Social Attitude 
The present play movement surpasses all others in magnitude 
and in breadth of aims. While placing less emphasis on the esthetic 
side than did the Athenians, still in other ways it has broadened out 
in a manner unknown to the ancients. Above all it is democratic. 
In the past it has been only too true that the leaders alone were 
allowed free scope of their impulses. There were slaves or a down- 
trodden peasantry to do the work. Then, too, the modern freedom 
of women was unknown. The play movement that is known to 
America fosters no class. In fact, through the opportunities offered, 
the child of the tenements may become better fitted for life than the 
pampered and secluded child of the rich home. 
The democratic tendencies of the twentieth century have brought 
about a changed social understanding. Our whole structure of so- 
ciety is built upon team play. Life is now looked upon as a great 
game. The rules allow complete freedom to the individual just as 
long as he acts in accordance with the ideals expressed by the people  
-P-A-G-E-25
THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 17 
as a whole. Therefore, he must be trained to be a social agent, to 
act of his own accord for the common good. Each individual must 
do his part or the cooperative whole must suffer. The state is for 
the people and not the people for the state. As a consequence of 
these tendencies, the scientific attitude, so long focused on natural 
phenomena alone has now been turned on man himself. The social 
sciences are being brought to the advanced level of the natural 
sciences. a 
As never before in all history, the schools are attempting to turn 
out an individual well trained in social relationships. The school 
has linked itself with the community and has taken on the aspect of 
a great social center. Here, young and old alike are taught the 
fundamentals of social citizenship in studies like history, civics, soci- 
ology, economics, and Americanization. This new attitude makes 
the school to-day a promoter of the playground and the gymnasium, 
as well as of extra-school activities such as athletics, dramatics, 
music, debating, and boys’ and girls’ clubs. Not only is this true as 
regards children, but the adult’s leisure time is also provided for in 
the way of recreation and personal growth. 
This social attitude of the school is being reflected in other insti- 
tutions, and the combined efforts of all are creating a high play level 
for the life of the people of our nation. 
THE WORLD PLAY MOVEMENT 
The modern play movement is not the characteristic of a single 
country. It had its peculiar beginnings in practically every country 
and shaped itself according to the especial social and physical en- 
vironments of each nation. Countries of Europe and our own 
United States have been most prominent in the rise of the play move- 
ment and demand a general survey of their respective backgrounds, 
developments, and influences. 
Germany 
Probably ‘Germany has had the most extended modern back- 
ground in the development of physical education and the impulse to 
a play movement. Physical exercise first found a place in a modern 
school when Basedow, in 1774, founded the Philanthropinum. 
Some of the exercises were dancing, riding, fencing, vaulting, plan- 
ing, carpentry, running, and wrestling. The emphasis was on the

first four, the “knightly exercises” of chivalric times. The Philan- 
thropinum attracted wide attention and many institutions were 
founded as offshoots. Salzmann instituted Schnepfenthal; and Guts 
Muths, the successor of Salzmann, elaborated on Basedow’s scheme, 
giving great emphasis to the recreational phases of physical educa- 
tion. The work of these men, Guts Muths in particular, influenced 
continental Europe to a great extent: to wit, Pestalozzi and Fellen- 
berg in Switzerland, Nachtegall in Denmark, Ling in Sweden, and 
Father Jahn and Adolf Spiess in Germany. It is noteworthy that 
the first one to stress strongly the educational side of play was 
Froebel in 1826 and that his studies and experiments resulted in the 
present-day Kindergarten. 
Until the time of Father Jahn there was no popular, general 
participation in gymnastics. Jahn, however, was an aggressive or- 
ganizer. His aim was to arouse a national consciousness in Prussia 
that would result in the throwing off of the yoke of Napoleon. His 
“Turner” associates mingled politics with gymnastics so much that 
they received many setbacks at the hands of unfavorable govern- 
ments. Jahn contributed in the way of equipment by the invention 
of such heavy apparatus as the bars. 
Adolf Spiess is called the father of school gymnastics (for girls 
as well as for boys) just as Jahn is called the father of popular 
gymnastics. Owing to Jahn’s difficulties with governments, Spiess 
experienced much trouble in overcoming governmental hostility, but 
in 1837 gymnastics were allowed in the secondary, teachers’, and 
military schools; and in 1851 there was established in Berlin the 
first Royal Institute for the training of teachers of gymnastics. The 
elementary schools were given gymnastics in 1860; but even then 
there was much prejudice against teachers of physical education, and 
punishment for those who delved at all in politics. 
The politician von Schenckendorff finally succeeded in making the 
government quite favorable to play and physical education, and 
prone to pardon those gymnastic teachers involved in political 
offenses. In 1882 von Schenckendorff established in Gérlitz a good 
organization of physical education in the schools and this gradually 
spread throughout the nation. In 18go, also in Gorlitz, a course 
was established for the training of teachers in play (Jugendspiele). 
The final act of von Schenckendorff in giving the play movement a 
good start was the founding in Berlin, May 21, 1891, of the ‘‘Cen- 
tral Committee” for the establishing of child and adult recreation 
in Germany. Many institutes have been held by the committee as  
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 19 
well as normal courses organized to educate teachers both in theory 
and practice of play. 
It was during the primary activities of von Schenckendorff 
shortly after 1880 that the play movement actually began in Ger- 
many and the first playgrounds were established in Berlin. These 
were simply sandlots for little children and babes. The development 
of the movement in Germany, however, has been primarily a school 
affair. At the present time we find many of the Volkschiilen (the 
schools for the masses) equipped with an outdoor play space (Turn- 
platz) as well as the indoor gymnasium (Turnhalle). The children 
find a great variety of games introduced into their three hours of 
compulsory gymnasium work; also, there is a tendency to give one 
afternoon a week over to play alone. The play periods are super- 
vised by the regular teachers. The Gymnasium, or higher school 
for the privileged class does not have much that can be called play. 
Gymnastics in charge of special teachers prevail. Some attempts 
have been made to introduce competitive team sports into the higher 
schools, but this has been unsuccessful. The school programme does 
not allow much free time—the student on the whole is forced 
through a strenuous day’s work. The universities do not have any- 
thing corresponding to the English or American competitive ath- 
letics. The students form voluntary associations for the practice of 
“turning.” Many also take special instruction in fencing and horse- 
manship. The practice of duelling is common and facial scars are 
regarded as badges of honor. A rather unique part of the ele- 
mentary school is that of journeys, which last from a day to several 
days during the winter and from two to six weeks during the sum- 
mer vacation. They are in charge of the masters and are made 
instructional as well as recreational. 
The municipally controlled playgrounds are rare in Germany, 
but there are on the other hand many private playgrounds. We 
find them especially among the Turnvereins and athletic associations, 
and some of the beer gardens also have them. In Berlin every tene- 
ment house must provide an interior court with a playground and 
this also adds to the number of private grounds. Some of the parks 
and vacant places have been given small play spaces but in general 
the larger part of the work is carried on by organizations other than 
the cities themselves. 
Weare greatly indebted to Germany for its extensive curriculum 
of graded plays and games for younger children and the educational 
application of them. In this connection it is interesting to note that
-P-A-G-E-28
20 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Germany leads all others in the industry of toy-making. The play 
interests of our older American youth have departed from the Ger- 
man idea and have followed the lines of participation in, strenuous 
sports and athletics; still German gymnastic exercises have had a 
great influence on our compulsory physical education work, especially 
that applied to boys’ and men’s classes in high schools, colleges, and 
Y. M. C. A.’s. The apparatus,stunts, in particular, if interspersed 
in the programme to a limited degree, offer a play and recreational 
incentive. 
a 
England Py 
The English- play system is isa nétayal growth rather than a manu- 
factured product of particular educators. For this reason there is 
not such a trustworthy account of its development. From earliest 
times, the liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons have enjoyed sports, games, 
and amusements, and they have preserved these primitive instincts. 
Their system has grown up empirically, such changes as were in- 
evitable being due to efforts to make the’games more social and 
general rather than to the work of innovating educators. 
During the age of chivalry the recreations involved archery, 
dancing, leaping, vaulting, wrestling, weight throwing, and ball 
games; but with the ascendency of the Puritans all these were rigidly 
suppressed. It was not until the eighteenth century that games came 
back into universal favor again. The return was due to the rise of 
the Boarding Schools for boys of the higher classes. These served 
as the nurseries of the national pastimes. At first the teachers 
merely tolerated the sports but with a new generation of teachers, 
who themselves had played, a new interest was added. Arnold, as 
headmaster of Rugby, about 1840, recognized the character value 
of athletics and made them a necessary part of the curriculum. 
Since then, headmasters of all schools through the force of their 
opinions have made participation obligatory. 
The English schools of this type, which correspond to the private 
secondary schools of our country, demonstrate the spirit of athletic 
play at its best. There are large and wonderfully kept fields to take 
care of everyone. Asa result of long vacations, frequent holidays, 
and considerable freedom in the afternoon there is much time avail- 
able for play. Practically every season has its round of sports. In 
the fall we find that rugby football, soccer, cricket, and lacrosse are 
indulged in; in the winter, rugby football, lacrosse, hockey, harriers, 
and practice for athletic events; in the spring, athletic events such as 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT 21 
sprinting, jumping, throwing, long races, wrestling, and boxing; and 
in the summer, cricket, tennis, rowing, and swimming. A very com- © 
mendable feature of the English schools is the close mingling of 
masters and pupils on the playing field. The result is a clean type 
of athletics and an amateurism that is of the highest grade. The 
higher schools for girls give the same emphasis to outdoor sport, and 
the result is that the girl who attends the school is usually possessed 
of enthusiasm, independent spirit, and abounding health. In their 
case the favorite activities are field hockey, tennis, swimming, basket 
ball, track and field, and to a limited extent, soccer and cricket. 
The universities do not make play compulsory; yet, the habit per- 
sists and many athletic clubs are organized. The most prominent 
sports are football, cricket, and rowing, with tennis, golf, hockey, 
and canoeing also well in favor. Much free time is available. 
The presence of a large leisure class in England has helped to 
boom the popularity of all sports of recreational nature with adults 
as well as students. Even with the less favored people, however, 
there is a strong love for sport as is evidenced by their assembly for 
this purpose upon the village green after the working day is. over. 
Professional leagues flourish as in America. The average English- 
man, however, is not content merely to watch but wishes to be a 
participant. 
It can be seen that the English system features‘sports and com; 
petitive play almost to the exclusion of everything else. Even in the 
elementary schools, this type of play is introduced at an early age. 
Only with the recent movement to improve the schools for the com- 
mon people have there been play activities that are graded in dif- 
ficulty according to age. These new Council schools, as they are 
called, have gymnasiums, and a certain amount of gymnastics of the 
Swedish type is required. In the crowded districts some of the 
newer schools have roof gardens for the purpose of organized play, 
while playgrounds are rented in the suburbs for the older children’s 
sport which requires more room. 
The municipal play spaces are not supervised except in the sense 
that a caretaker is provided. There is little apparatus. The social 
center idea has not progressed as in America, although some head- 
way has been made as a result of the efforts of Mrs. Humphrey 
Ward. 
England’s play system, so largely spontaneous, has influenced all 
its colonies. Continental Europe has taken to English recreative 
sports, such as golf, tennis, swimming, and rowing rather than the
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
more specialized sports of rugby, soccer, and cricket. The early 
* colonists introduced outdoor sports into America with the result 
that athletic games furnish the major part of our physical education 
in this country. The Americans, however, have evolved distinctive 
national games of their own such as baseball, football, and basket 
ball. The Americans, too, have built up a play system that is 
broader in the educational aspects and that is more socially-spirited 
in the sense that caste is a negligible factor. In some respects, the 
English still remain superior: these are in the love of sport for 
sport’s sake (less emphasis on the winning side), and in the practice 
of keeping up participation in sport throughout life instead of ceas- 
ing abruptly after leaving school. 
Sweden 
In Sweden the impulse towards gymnastics was given by Peter 
Ling, who was influenced by the writings of Guts Muths in Germany. 
Ling’s motives were primarily patriotic so that his methods were at 
first almost entirely of a military nature. He urged his views so 
strongly and constantly that in 1814 the Royal authorities estab- 
lished a Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics and appointed Ling 
as the director. This institution trained teachers of gymnastics first 
for the army, and then for the schools. It is still in existence and 
is the oldest of its kind in the world. Peter Ling’s son, Hjalmar, 
systematized the exercises for use in the schools, adding new ones 
at the same time. 
The Swedish system has influenced other countries to a great 
extent, especially, France, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Greece. 
England uses the Swedish exercises in its public schools to supple- 
ment the effects of games; and they are also used in the British 
navy. The United States models its so-called “‘setting-up” exercises 
of the army and navy after the Swedish type. Our elementary 
schools and our higher schools for girls also borrow from this for- 
eign source. The schools consider the exercises particularly valuable 
for their effects on posture. 
The play movement in Sweden has taken the form largely of 
artificial stimulation of interest in its gymnastic system; although a 
small part of the day’s programme is given over to games and 
dances. Since the revival of the Olympic games people of Sweden 
have become intensely interested in track and field, and have invited 
American trainers to their country in order to become acquainted 
with the American methods. The Swedes have always ranked high

in the Olympic games, excelling in all-around track events such as 
the decathlon and the pentathlon. 
Sweden has contributed largely to the play movement in America 
in that its exercises are being used more and more, our teachers intro- 
ducing them under the guise of plays and games. 
France 
Until very recently, since the World War, the French have not 
taken to play, nor to sports; and the introduction of physical educa- 
tion in France has been very slow. The first attempt to introduce 
gymnastics into France was in 1817, following close on the Napo- 
leonic Wars; but the outgrowth of this soon centered almost entirely 
on the training of gymnastic teachers for the army. 
The first concerted attempt to introduce physical education in the 
schools came in 1890 through the adoption of the Swedish system of 
gymnastics, and the issuing of a manual on physical training. This 
manual was very elaborate—ridiculously out of keeping with the 
facilities that were available. Only fair results were obtained. 
In the way of sports, the French people have inclined toward 
recreation of a milder type in which the element of team play is 
small—handball, tennis, walking, cycling, croquet, fencing, and 
shooting, for example. M. Coubertin, who was responsible for the 
revival of the Olympic games, agitated a movement for the intro- 
duction of Anglo-Saxon games into France, but with indifferent 
success. 
Organized play made but little headway until the World War. 
The instinct to play was not wanting among the French children, but 
it was stifled by lack of opportunity and by the pressure of studies. 
During the World War, however, the French caught the spirit of play 
from contact with the American and British armies. The American 
Red Cross, in addition, took an interest in giving French children 
an adequate chance to play. Playgrounds were organized and the 
Red Cross directors went from city to city teaching games. The 
most recent trend in connection with the new enthusiasm of the 
French people for play is the hold that sports have taken on 
the women. This has been a big stimulus to the inauguration of the 
first Olympic Games for Women, held in Paris in 1922. 
The Orient 
It has only been in recent years that the nations of the Orient 
have been aroused to an interest in play and athletics. The peoples
-P-A-G-E-32
24 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
of the Far East, however, when once interested in Western Civiliza- 
tion, began to borrow plays and games as well as many ideas along 
other lines. The result has been that the peoples of China, Japan, 
the Philippines, and Hawaii now claim baseball, basket ball, soccer, 
volley ball, and track teams of their own, even going so far as to 
hold Olympic Games of the Far East. In addition, there is a move- 
ment for the public promotion of playgrounds of the type found in 
America. Governments in both Japan and China have been active 
in educating native teachers for supervisors of playgrounds and gym- 
nasiums. Previously, they had been interested in forms of combat 
and personal strength such as wrestling, and the Jiu-Jitsu art of 
defense of Japan. The play movement bids fair to be a factor in 
the rebirth of the Chinese national consciousness. Credit for this 
introduction of the play spirit of western civilization into the Orient 
is largely due to the Y. M. C. A. In the case of the Philippines and 
Hawaii, the American rule has been accompanied by a governmental 
educational programme in which organized play has a very promi- 
nent place. The competitive games are so well organized that dis- 
trict championships lead eventually to a championship of the entire 
territory. 
It may be of interest also to mention that even Siberia has been 
touched by the play movement. In Irkutsk, a city of 150,000, there 
are two playgrounds equipped and cupervised like the modern play- 
ground of the United States. 
South America 
The nations of South America, too, have felt the impetus of the 
modern play movement. The first interest came as a matter of 
chance, the many foreign inhabitants bringing their games with them. 
In this way soccer, pelota, tennis, cricket, golf, track, and baseball 
became known. The first efforts at actually promoting play were 
made by the Y. M. C. A. Then basket ball and volley ball were 
added to the list of popular sports. Of late, many soccer associa- 
tions have sprung up and compete in championships which finally 
lead to international affairs, with great throngs present. Olympic 
meets are now held by the ABC countries. Playgrounds of the 
American type are found in Montevideo, Uruguay, Buenos Aires, 
Argentina, and Rio de Janiero, Brazil. 
The Play Movement in the United States 
Statistical Survey —The play movement in the United States is 
always spoken of as beginning in the late nineteenth century, but it is
-P-A-G-E-33

only too evident that it was a very meager beginning, for the most 
part the struggles for birth. According to records of the Play- 
ground and Recreation Association of America there were only ten 
cities that had established playgrounds in charge of play leaders 
previous to the year 1900. These were as follows: Boston in 1886; 
and then from 1890 to 1900, Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, 
Baltimore, Hartford, New Haven, New York City, San Francisco, 
and Albany. Some authorities also include in this last period the 
cities of Brooklyn, Providence, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Minneapolis, 
and Denver. At least these cities of the latter group. have legal 
documents showing that the play movement was receiving considera- 
tion at the hands of the various city fathers. 
The interesting part of the beginnings of play in the United 
States is that practically all the first cities to have playgrounds had 
independent movements. After Boston’s move, it was still a score 
of years before there came the national organization to facilitate, 
encourage, and urge the spread of the movement throughout the 
country. 
The big impetus came following the organization of the Play- 
ground and Recreation Association of America in 1906. A report 
of this Association issued in 1916 states that in addition to the ten 
cities it mentions above, there were twenty-six others that established 
playgrounds during the period from 1900 to 1906, an average of 
approximately four new cities a year. In the four years that fol- 
lowed the founding of the national organization, eighty-three more 
cities were added to the total, an average of twenty a year. In the 
years 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1913 an average of forty cities a year 
was established. From 1914 through 1916 the average was raised 
still higher, to that of fifty-five a year. In 1916 a total number of 
414 cities, maintaining 3270 centers under leadership, is given. The 
figures of the 1921 year-book show that the remarkable growth of 
the playground movement is still continuing, for a total of 502 cities 
is found. The play centers numbered 4584. The cost of maintain- 
ing them was close to ten million dollars—over ten times as much as . 
in 1906, the first year that figures were obtained by the Association. 
The Background.—The movement that has just been traced was 
not without the usual background. There is no direct connection 
with any previous tendencies, however, for the line of continuity is 
always broken until we reach the movement which Boston inaugu- 
rated in 1886. To find the earliest beginnings of public interest 
some people would take us back to the time when the old New 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
England commons were used by the boys in their games and by the 
forces training under arms. Others would start off with the year 
1821 when efforts were made at out-of-doors physical education by 
the Latin School of Salem, Massachusetts; or the Round Hill School 
of Northampton, Massachusetts, which in 1825 conducted an outdoor 
playground and gymnasium. These attempts were of short dura- 
tion. Similarly, in the period between 1825 and 1830, outdoor 
gymnasiums that were established at Harvard, Yale, Williams, 
Brown, and Amherst Colleges and at the New York High School, 
held public interest for a short time only. 
The incentive for these experiments was largely brought about 
by the efforts of German political refugees who hoped to make their 
gymnastic system popular in this country. Following their. failure, . 
there was no sign of a revival of interest until about 1850 when the 
new German immigration to the United States led to the organiza- 
tion of gymnastic societies (Turnvereins) and ultimately to an en- 
deavor to incorporate gymnastics in the public schools. Somewhat 
later there arose the rival movement to popularize the Swedish sys- 
tem of gymnastics. Both systems have influenced the American 
tendencies in physical education to-day. 
It was in the 1860's that athletic clubs began to be found in 
colleges. Forerunners of municipal interest in recreative projects 
were the free public baths established by Boston in 1866, and the 
vacation school started by the old First Church of Boston in the 
same year. Private.influence opened a vacation school in Providence 
in 1868. The vacation school brought in subjects like carpentry, 
singing, and nature-study, and others not directly in line with the 
usual course of study in the regular schools. In 1872 the first in- 
stance was recorded of funds being voted by a municipality for the 
purchase of land to be used for playground purposes. The city 
voting this money was Brookline, Massachusetts, but no purchases 
were made at the time. Then in 1876 there is another outstanding 
event in the opening of the first known park to possess recreation 
facilities. This was Washington Park, Chicago; but there was as yet 
no thought of supervision. 
The Earliest Beginnings——All these things were introductory 
to. the experiment which took place in Boston in 1886. This was 
the opening of sandgardens for the little children. The idea was 
one borrowed from Germany. A visitor to Berlin, Dr. Marie 
Zakrzewska, was much impressed by seeing little children playing 
at sea-shore games in sand heaps placed in public parks. She wrote
-P-A-G-E-35

to the chairman of the committee of Massachusetts Emergency and 
Hygiene Association and told what she had seen. Interested women 
were responsible for the consequent placing of three piles of sand 
in the yards of the Children’s Mission on Parmenter Street. This 
was the beginning in Boston and it led to inquiries from other cities. 
Miss Ellen Tower, Chairman of the Association, was called upon to 
lecture in several cities regarding the success of the sand gardens. 
Other cities were in a mood to follow Boston’s lead. It was 
becoming only too evident that there must be found some solution 
for the many problems confronting child life—in fact adult life— 
in the fast congesting cities. Foremost of all, stood out the need for 
removing the play of the children from the streets, where danger 
impended every moment; and of offering, instead, wholesome en- 
vironment that would tend to cut down the amount of juvenile crime 
and delinquency. These were phases of an Anti-slums Campaign 
of which Jacob Riis of New York City was one of the most active 
leaders. In addition, the public attention was beginning to be 
aroused to a fuller appreciation of the value of health, and to be 
focused also on the social aspects of education. Laws prohibiting 
play in the streets, citizens complaining about children playing on 
their lawns, accidents and arrests from play stolen in the streets, loss 
of life from swimming in dangerous waters—all these things showed 
how impossible it was for the child to grow up normally in the cities. 
The passing of the child labor laws, the including of long summer 
vacations from the school, and the shortening of working hours for 
the laboring man, were other causes that helped to spread the agita- 
tion for municipal provision for play and recreation, once it was 
- begun. 
Local Developments.—Significant developments began to follow 
on the sandgarden stage, which merely meant supervised play for 
. children of very tender years. In 1889 the Charlesbank Outdoor 
Gymnasium in Boston was opened; it was a place equipped with 
apparatus, running track, and space for games, and also provided 
with supervisors. This took care of older boys and men, and two 
years later, a section was added for women and girls. The Charles- 
bank Gymnasium was the forerunner of the movement for park 
playgrounds which came following 1900 and reached its climax of 
achievement in the South Side Playgrounds of Chicago. Another 
outstanding event, one which reflected the beginnings of the new 
social attitude toward play, was the opening of the Hull House
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Playground in 1894. It was equipped with leaders and modern 
apparatus, and it gave the name ‘Model Playground” to the type 
that became popular at this time and which has since been the stand- 
ard of most school playgrounds. The model grounds, being inade- 
quate in size to permit popular sports like football and baseball, 
were a contributing factor to the invention of space-economizing 
games like playground baseball, and to the adaptation of indoor 
games like volley ball and basket ball, to outdoor use. 
In the year 1899 New York opened several schoolyard play- 
grounds and the significant thing about this step is that it showed a 
growing tendency for public support to the new movement. Chi- 
cago, however, went ahead in assuming public responsibility when in 
1903 it opened the South Side Park Playgrounds. In the short 
time of two years Chicago taxed itself to the amount of $10,000,000 
for park playgrounds—an amount that seemed enormous at that 
time. President Roosevelt characterized this “the most notable civic 
achievement of any American city.” A feature of the new parks 
was that they provided both outdoor and indoor recreational facili- 
ties, the latter being handled by magnificent buildings called ‘“‘field 
houses.”. Armour Square, a recreation center costing in the neigh- 
borhood of $220,000, can be described as typical of all. The field, 
which covers ten acres, contains tennis courts, baseball fields, a run- 
ning track, complete apparatus, and both a wading pool and swim- 
ming pool. It is fenced off into three separate divisions for children, 
men, and women. The field house contains two gymnasiums, several 
shower, baths, an auditorium for concerts, lectures, and dramatics, 
a dance floor, several club rooms, and even a restaurant. Every- 
thing was done to make these recreation centers completely equipped 
from the standpoint of adults as well as children. Many cities fol- 
lowed the example of Chicago in respect to its recreational centers, 
Los Angeles, in particular, making great strides. The latter city 
was the first to appoint a separate recreation commission to over- 
come confusion in administration which results when different agen- 
cies like the Park Board, School Board, and private interests work 
independently. This tendency toward consolidation was slow to 
develop; the lead was afterward assumed by Philadelphia and New 
York. 
Unifying Tendencies—There were a few other events that 
helped determine the course of the playground movement. In 1903 
Luther Gulick organized in New York City the first Public School 
Athletic League. This meant that an interest in promoting amateur  
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE GROWTH OF THE PLAY MOVEMENT — 29 
athletics was in its beginning. In 1906 a great rural play festival 
and field day held at New Paltz, New York, was interesting inas- 
much as it showed the need for play was being felt in other than 
city districts. In the same year was organized the Playground and 
Recreational Association of America, a propagandist body made up 
of the leading men and women in the field of play and recreation, 
health, and social work. This organization helped unify the play- 
ground movement. In addition, its field workers went from city to 
city putting on campaigns of publicity, stirring up local interest, and 
giving practical aid in helping each municipality launch its individual 
movement. 
Other tendencies were beginning to make themselves manifest 
at this time. Certain cities where particular problems had to be 
met became leaders in various trends. For instance, Pittsburgh went 
ahead in broadening the sphere of play activities so as to include 
many things that formerly had not been listed in the category of 
play. An entirely new meaning was given than the old one which 
merely gave play the interpretation of fun and games. Rochester 
made the first move toward having the school plant serve the pur- 
pose of a field house and thereby avoided duplication and economic 
waste. A growing movement to have a comprehensive play system 
put into force by the schools was headed up by Gary, Indiana, which 
probably has gone farther than any other city along this line. 
Since 1910, there have been other, no less interesting, develop- 
ments. Outstanding among them was the growing idea that the play- 
grounds in themselves are of little value, unless supervised by trained 
leaders. About this time, also boys’ and girls’ organizations of the 
type of the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, and others first 
got under way. Camping grew in popularity. With schools as well 
as municipal authorities taking hold of play, there began to be found 
faculty control of competitive athletics, which previously had been 
allowed to run wild. There was also the beginning of efforts to 
get the student body as a whole to participate. 
The War was not without its influence. Its statistics, showing 
one-third of the army recruits unfit physically, its demonstration of 
the marked ability of athletically trained men to assume positions of 
responsibility, and its use of play as a great factor in maintaining 
the morale of the army—all these things were responsible for the 
present boom for compulsory physical education and health training. 
The new importance given to physical education in the schools has 
necessarily meant a shortage of teachers, and normal schools and
-P-A-G-E-38

universities are’ rapidly instituting courses in this particular 
subject. 
Summary.—lIn the way of summary it is well to quote from Rain- 
water, whose book, ‘The Play Movement” (p. 192), gives a very 
complete analysis of the growth of this particular field in the United 
States: 
“The transitions of the play movement are nine in number, as follows: (1) 
from provision for little children to that for all ages of people; (2) from facili- 
ties operated during the summer only to those maintained throughout the year ; 
(3) from outdoor equipment and activities only, to both outdoor and indoor 
facilities and events; (4) from congested urban districts to both urban and 
rural communities; (5) from philanthropic to community support and control ; 
(6) from free play and miscellaneous events to directed play with organized 
activities and correlated schedules; (7) from a simple to a complex field of activ- 
ities including manual, physical, aesthetic, social, and civic projects; (8) from the 
provision of facilities to the definition of standards for the use of leisure time; 
(9) from individual interests to group and community activities.” 
It must not be forgotten that there are certain men and women 
who have given a life of service to the cause of play. Joseph E. Lee, 
Dr. Luther Gulick, George E. Johnson, and Henry S. Curtis are out- 
standing figures who through their writings and personal influence, 
have helped to keep the movement before the people and have 
shaped its course. Philosophical dissertations on the meaning and 
value of play by G. Stanley Hall and John Dewey have helped make 
educators sympathetic with this new phase of school life.

CHAPTER II 
THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 
In the United States many states have passed laws making the 
teaching of physical education compulsory in their public schools. 
They have enacted such legislation because they have recognized that 
it is necessary for the welfare of both the present and the succeeding 
_ generations. There is, in addition, an exténsive movement in~the~ 
way of national encouragement. Moreover, foreign, nations of 
Europe, of the Orient, and of South America are becoming inter- 
ested. Such a condition is highly significant; there must be urgent 
reasons for such a world-wide movement in favor of this particular 
type of education. Some of these arguments are developed in the 
following material. 
The Need for All-around Physical Exercise 
Man’s Active Life Has Disappeared 
A general survey of man’s physical activities previous to the 
present era of civilization shows that he was an active person. In 
the remote past, members of both the upper and lower classes of 
society were forced into all-around physical development: the lower 
classes tilled the soil, erected buildings under the direction of their 
superiors, dug canals, built roads, manned boats, and gave military 
service when drafted for that purpose; the upper classes were con- 
stantly engaged in supervising all work—which was done out-of- 
doors—and were leading military and trade expeditions. There was 
no escape for a man, whether of the one class or the other; the very 
type of civilization demanded an active life spent in a wide variety 
of employments. Later types of civilization until very recently have 
also made the same demands on individuals. The pioneer settlers 
in our own country fought with Indians, felled trees, cleared land, 
and dug stumps; they depended solely upon their own efforts to 
sustain their entire existence. Even in the passing generation we find 
32
-P-A-G-E-41
THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 33 
the majority of people possessed of well-rounded physical develop- 
ment. Almost all were born on the farm and had their daily chores 
to perform; or, if in the city, were brought up: in close touch with 
the daily tasks of their parents, and were called upon to assist when- 
ever they were free from school work. The work was of a general 
nature so that the craftsman or tradesman had to start in the process 
from the beginning and carry it through until the salable article was 
ready for the market. This made for care and pride in the article, 
as individual tastes were given a chance to be displayed. In the 
household duties, the women made their own-bread, churned their 
own butter, fashioned all the clothing, and so on. The whole family 
was called upon to contribute to the problem of everyday living. 
Moreover, the children of this last generation walked to school, to 
town, to the picnic grounds, to the river or lake—they always walked. 
when it was a matter of a few miles. Whatever trade was pursued 
was learned fully: the kind of specialty then differentiated between 
the general occupations of the shoemaker and of the baker, for 
instance, and not between the specialized duties of the designer, the 
detail draughtsman, the pattern maker, the cutter, the shaper, the 
assembler, the finisher, the packer, the carrier, and the salesman, as 
is now the case. Each individual tradesman was all these in one; 
and, in being all, he could not escape the physical development that 
these various activities brought. 
~,Work Has Become Highly Specialized 
In grown-up life, the all-around craftsman has given way to the 
laborer who contributes but one small item to the final product of the 
industry; to the supervisor who uses the telephone, telegraph, mes- 
senger boys, charts, and diagrams; to the housewife who disposes 
of nearly all forms of physical work by means of electrical appliances 
and of ready-made articles of food for the table and garments for 
wear. The individual in general is permitting but casual develop- 
ment of a very few muscles in his body. The very devices that are 
termed labor-saving must be recognized at the same time as body- 
weakening forces. (his is an age of intense specialization with 
almost a total disregar “bodily abilities. The opportunity for 
all-around work that will contribute to the development of the big- 
muscles of the body—this Opportunity _ has quite disappeared. : 
There has been an appalling emigration from the country to the city. 
In the city there has been an evolution from the handy man to the 
‘specialized man. The type of the specialist’s work can be seen in
-P-A-G-E-42
34 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the automobile assembly room, where the worker stands by a moving 
track tightening one particular bolt as one machine after another 
passes slowly on to the next specialist. The tendency in piece work 
is to force specialized labor upon the individual if he wishes to do 
quick work and gain the highest possible wages. 
Chores and Work of Children Eliminated 
So true is it that, until the present generation, physical education 
has been provided by the type of work in which a man was engaged 
that frequently prominent older members of our society to-day will 
deride the present play movement; and, for an all concluding argu- 
ment, will point to themselves as having managed to grow up success- 
fully without having a gymnasium, a playground, or a play-teacher. 
Their argument is sound so far as it applies to themselves, but they 
forget that times have changed. To-day we cannot have access to 
the chores which they extol so highly. ‘These chores have disap- 
peared. The boy’s present apprenticeship lacks the woodpile and 
other kindred sources of muscle building. Errands are scarce. 
Even walking, such as to school, or to the party, is giving way to the 
ride in the motor car or the taxicab. 
Increased Leisure Time Offers Solution 
It can be seen that, whereas the past gave man an all-around 
physical education, the present has robbed him of that phase of life; 
and that there is now a dire need for some method_of regaining the 
degree of bodily petfection that formerly existed. Modern civiliza- 
tion, through the invention of so many time-saving devices, has pro- 
vided one thing that the past could not give—leisure time—and it 
is here that wé\ind the opening that will admit some means of bodily 
development.-It is during the leisure time that the body must be 
trained in the wholesome activity that one’s occupation denies. 
Science, in all its advances, has tended from a medical standpoint 
to prolong life, and to make it less harsh from the standpoint of 
material comforts; but, science has tended also to encourage the 
physical degeneration of the individual. The present conditions that 
it has produced, compared with those of the past, refute all argu- 
ment against all-around physical education; rather, they emphasize 
the immediate and future need of it. Knut Hamsun, in his “Growth 
of the Soil” repudiates the city life and idealizes the all-around 
physical development of man. In a man of that type alone, he tells 
us, are the seeds of life for future civilization planted. We have no
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 35 
such quarrel with the city life; we would not overthrow it as would 
Hamsun, but we do demand that leisure, which. science has granted, 
be used in the physical upkeep of the individual. Unless some 
remedy be supplied, it is safe to say that the decay of modern civili- 
zation has already set in, and that there is a grain of truth in the 
assertions of the present-day anthropologists who predict that the 
future race of human beings will have abnormally large heads, but 
spindlelegs, the latter having dwindled away to mere appendages 
from disuse. 
The Need for Wholesome Recreation Si eS 
/, To Counteract the Effects of Specialized Work 
It has been shown that specialized labor gives niggardly and one- 
sidedly to physical development and that play is needed to supply 
all-around use of the muscles ina normal way. There is a second 
point: specialized labor does not command the interest of the worker 
as does all around general work. The tradesman of the past was an 
all-around cobbler, baker, smith, and the like; he began with the raw 
material and did not leave it until he delivered ’it to the customer. 
His work, then, was of varied interests. As the article which he 
was making went through the process of manufacture, the tradesman 
was given a variety of experiences; and then, above all, he had the 
satisfaction of selling his product directly to the consumer. Not 
only did the worker find plenty of interest in his work, but he did 
his work at home with the good wife close at hand to drop a pleasant 
word at times, and the children to stand around and watch him 
fashion the raw material into the finished product. Then, too, he 
had time to gossip as he worked. His customer would discuss the 
topics of the day with him, and, as a result, both assumed the posi- 
tion of casual philosophers and students of literature. There was 
a certain pleasantness about the work that gave relaxation to offset 
the weariness naturally brought on by twelve and sixteen hours of 
daily work. It was somewhat of a leisurely business; the working 
man mixed his work, play, and literary efforts thoroughly in the day’s 
routine. . : 
To-day, however, such conditions no longer exist; machines do 
nearly every kind of work imaginable, and the operator controlling 
the machine simply puts the unfinished product through one very 
minute step in the process of manufacture. For instance, a man 
operating a punch press shapes one particular type of metal accord-
-P-A-G-E-44
36 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
ing to one particular die; and he may do this same thing thousands 
of times during a single day’s work and repeat it over and over with 
endless monotony-for months and years. Moreover, his machinery 
is noisy, conversation of any length is not tolerated in the necessity 
of speeding up the output, and the result is that the man is isolated: 
one machine with a single type of operation to perform. - Monotony 
enters and with it the relaxation offered by change and a variety of 
interests disappears. The man is almost in the same position as the 
prisoner in solitary confinement who has only thirty-six square feet 
on which to walk and nothing but bare walls and a hard floor to con- 
sider, in attempting to offset the monotony of walking. Strain enters 
in, and the tension causes the working man, after a certain limit, to 
become nervously exhausted, with the work assuming the nature of 
drudgery. This strain has been recognized almost universally dur- 
ing the last decade or so, for we note that the working man’s hours 
are tending to a standard limit of eight hours daily. Almost all 
industrial experts are forced to the conclusion that over a definite 
period of time, the man who works only eight hours a day will 
ultimately produce more and better work than the one who labors 
ten or twelve hours a day. (For this reason the time that the laborer 
must work has been shortened greatly; and, with this lessening of 
working hours, the leisure period of. the day has been increased. 
To Offset Strain of Modern Environment 
Not only has strain entered into our work but also into every 
activity of the day. The modern individual is forced to maintain a 
tremendous pace. Everything is speeded up: his work, his lunch 
hour, his pastimes, and even his time for sleep. The industrial 
revolution is the cause. The cross-country trip by horse and carriage 
or oxen has given way to the mile-a-minute train; the walk or the 
drive with the horse and buggy, to the high-powered motor car; and 
the aeroplane is now beginning to supplant these. The speeding-up 
process together with that of specialization have combined to make 
our daily life one of minutely cooperative affairs, one with many 
appointments that must be kept to the minute. We are always 
hurrying with a timepiece as the autocratic driver. 
The city life is the popular life of to-day. We crave excitement, 
and have unnatural appetites for it.. We want thrills instead of 
repose in quiet companionship, communion with Nature, and the 
reading of the best of books. The devices that brought speed and 
broke down the span of distance at the same time broke up the close

  THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 37 
family and neighborhood ties. The automobile allows people to 
find pleasure where they may; they do not need to cultivate the 
acquaintanceship of their neighbors within the block. 
The laborer leaves the close confinement and monotony of his 
specialized work, dodges the traffic of street cars and automobiles, 
finds his recreation in a crowded, air-stuffed movie house or in a 
speeding auto ride, and sleeps to the accompaniment of shrill 
whistles and horns and the grating of gears. The child finds himself 
shut up in a schoolroom, his activity curbed, with restlessness and 
tension prominent factors of his daily existence. He saves his pocket 
money to see a film thriller. 
This is all wrong as regards the way Nature meant things to be. 
Instead of the condition of noise, hurry, tenement living, personal 
danger, impersonal relationship, and vice—instead of these, Nature 
supplied an environment where space abounds, where air is fresh 
and free, where food and water are pure, and where recreation can 
be found in swimming, hunting, fishing, hiking, skating, and the like. 
Yet man is not so easily defeated when his environment becomes 
an unnatural one. Man has always shown himself to be a most 
adaptable person. The highly developed system of supervised play 
and recreation—to the point where it has become an institution of 
progress—is man’s reaction to an unnatural life with all its disturb- 
ing influences. Even in our play we must heed a caution: we must 
not let our play become so highly competitive and dependent on win- 
ning that it excites our nervous system to an additional extreme 
rather than soothing and stabilizing it, as it should. 
' To Offset the Influence of Harmful Amusements 
The advent of leisure time along with the strain of modern con- 
ditions, however, has brought about a new problem; namely, the use 
to which the leisure time may be put. So long as the workingman 
abuses his leisure time, he is just as subject to strain as before; and, 
in some cases, may be in a far worse physical condition than could 
ever result from the monotony of long working hours in a factory. 
The saloon was one argument against the lessening of working 
hours; for, in such a place, the relaxation was accomplished at the 
cost of bodily injury. The laborer, through shorter working days, 
had more time to spend in the saloon than under the old régime of 
long hours, and, consequently, was quite likely to debauch during 
an entire night, and be wholly unable to report for work the follow- 
ing day. The saloon, however, has disappeared and no longer is
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the place of diversion for the working man—the ‘‘poor man’s club,” 
as it was called. According to some, the problem would here be 
solved, but it must be remembered that although the undesirable 
form of diversion has been removed, nothing has been offered in its 
stead. It must also be recognized that go per cent of the people 
need guidance of some sort for their leisure time. The commer- 
cialized forms of amusement, such as the pool room, gambling dens, 
and dance halls, are the breeding places of many bad habits leading 
to the worst forms of vice. The moving picture shows and other 
passive types of recreation do not suffice. The active, all around, 
and spontaneous forms of play are the ones desired; and schools, 
factories, churches, and clubs are all promoting programmes along 
these lines. 
It is for the reasons just stated that industries have come to 
recognize that their duties are not finished when the working hours 
are shortened, that there is still more to be done, and, in many 
instances, the “‘second mile” is being traveled by the employers. 
The Grand Rapids factory of the American Seating Company has a 
factory magazine, a Senate and a House of Representatives, a base- 
ball team, a bowling league, and other means of affording their men 
useful but recreative expenditure of their leisure time; and the men 
feel that they themselves are doing this. It is very necessary that a 
democratic atmosphere be maintained so that the employees do not 
think that they are being patronized by a programme forced down 
upon them from above—a thing they are apt to resent. This is only 
one example of what tremendous strides are being made in the 
industrial recreation. The Goodyear Rubber Company, of Akron, 
Ohio, and the Carnegie Steel Foundation at Pittsburgh have well- 
paid organized staffs of play leaders, and complete equipment for 
mass programmes of athletic exercise. One danger that must be 
guarded against here is that of professionalism. In the enthusiasm 
and support that is aroused for the team that represents the concern 
for outside competition, the professional spirit may creep in, and 
subsequently the less capable groups are given less and less considera- 
tion until finally they are wholly neglected. So soon as expert 
players are induced to come to a factory, with the promise of ‘‘snap” 
jobs, the good that is accomplished is largely nullified, for the 
workers as a whole are bound to become critical and dissatisfied and 
their morale largely disturbed.

THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 390 
The Sociological Factor of Play SS 
The sociological factor of play is intimately bound up with the 
preceding need for wholesome recreation and with the succeeding 
expression of the economic phasé of play. 
€ question of juvenile delinquency has received careful study 
in recent years. Statistics of many cities, particularly those of 
Chicago as recorded in the proceedings of the Second Annual Play- 
ground Congress, show that wherever a playground has been started, 
the juvenile delinquent has begun to disappear; also, that he has 
continued to predominate only in those districts of the city where 
there are no playgrounds. “Che inference is that much juvenile 
crime is simply the bursting out in some form or other of the child’s 
inherent desire for action. The more this action is repressed or 
undirected, the more extreme is the outburst when it does come. 
Stealing, breaking windows, defying the ‘‘cop,” playing craps, and 
the like are the perversions which the child’s inherent love for 
activity brings about in congested. districts without playgrounds. 
. (The directed playground transfers his ition-from-stealing.apples 
Yrom the corner grocer to an ambition to be a member of the fcamr 
“Bill has been so busy stealing bases this summer he has not had ~ 
time to steal anything else, and has not been seen in our court,” one 
juvenile judge is reported as having said recently. 
The playground is also a social factor in forming community 
consciousness. Not only do children form friendships but parents ~ 
j ikewise. Play brings out the primary virtues of friendship, 
love, and loyalty so necessary fora union of family and of neigh- 
borhood. The closer union of these smaller groups is necessary 
before a larger community consciousness can be brought about. 
Optimism is another keynote of the play situation. The child 
who is stealing, or gambling, or doing things he knows are forbidden, 
is not particularly happy or contented; he is always worried and 
afraid of the outcome. On the playground, however, the child is 
free to express himself without any restraints save those of the rules , 
of fair play. He becomes a happy child, developing in a normal way 
and having an optimistic outlook on life. This atmosphere spreads 
to the homes and creates a similar congeniality there. 
Another element towards social improvement is the industry and 
ambition developed by well-directéd play. Play itself is a growth, 
a progress toward something more difficult—yet unattained, but 
much desired. ‘Here is continual contact with the play instructor,  
-P-A-G-E-48
A 40 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
who can do almost anything, so it seems to the child. The result is 
that the child strives in emulation, and learning becomes a pleasure 
to him. 
The Economic Value of Play 
The economic factor of play dovetails closely with the socio- 
logical. Wherever we find that man is more contented, is under the 
urge of progress, we also find that there is a saving of energy, and 
an elimination of waste; there is forthcoming a better product. The 
betterment of social conditions is reflected — in an im- 
provement of the economic. 
To illustrate: when the delinquent boy is given a chance to 
accommodate his burst of energy in thé activities of the playground 
heis-also made an economic asset. This is true from two points of 
view: first, there is saved the cost of penalizing him for his delin- 
quency, that of keeping truant officers and of paying upkeep for 
_ juvenile courts and of juvenile reform institutions; second, there is a 
new valuation that must be placed on him by his change from the 
irresponsible gangster to the boy educated on the playground. True, 
it does cost money to run the playgrounds. It has been found, how- 
ever, that the cost is very slight in comparison with the other alter- 
native; for example, statistics show that ten Boy Scouts can be taken 
Y) care of by the exact amount spent on one average delinquent boy. 
‘The schools have found that the healthy child-makes faster 
progress. than-the-child-who_is subnormal in physique.) The pupil 
who fails in his studies belongs largely to the latter class, and this 
is especially true of the student who must repeat a full semester’s 
worke {In the sense-that play makes.a positive contribution to health, 
\it@must be-counted_as an“é¢onomie=factor’ in the reduction of the 
enormous amount of money that is being spent on “repeaters. Pay 
The industries have come to consider play in the economic valua- 
tion of their workers for utilitarian as well as benevolent reasons. 
Wherever there are efficiency experts in factories we find that they 
are also advocates of play and of amusements for the workers. The 
Carnegie Steel Company found that short play recesses during the 
working day so increased the efficiency of the workers in the actual 
time they were working, that an increased daily output was the 
result. Inasmuch as play conduces to health, it must also be figured 
from the standpoint of reducing the worker’s days of sickness. 
Then, again, workers who are well contented do not become tran-

sients, and herein is one of the biggest savings to the corporation and 
possibly the biggest reason why it favors broad recreational pro- 
grammes. A big economic loss is involved in breaking in new 
workers; the output is temporarily less than normal; a trained in- 
structor must spare valuable time; and wear and tear on expensive 
machinery is considerably greater when operated by a beginner. 
Summed up, these points stand out: decreased juvenile delin- 
(quency fewer institutions to provide for this factor, decreased shift- 
lessness, poverty, vice; and, from the positive point of view, in- 
creased industry, ambition, and support for the institutions of social 
improvement. The economic value to the nation as a whole is shown 
by the cumulative benefits of the separate communities. 
Need of Play Space in Congested Cities 
In the rural districts there is almost unlimited space in which the 
children can play; but our modern cities, congesting space in every 
possible way, even needing high skyscrapers, have placed play spaces 
beyond the immediate reach of children. The growth of the city 
has meant that there is no place for the children to play except in 
the streets and alleys. Some cities, Detroit for instance, have had 
to close certain streets to the use of traffic several hours during the 
day in order that they might be used for children’s play. Because 
of this condition artificial play spaces need to be created—the mod- 
ern pldygrounds—and economy demands that these spaces be care- 
fully allotted to the different sections of the city in order that all 
may benefit. The playground does not leave the child close to his 
doorstep, however, but may take him several blocks from home, and 
thus away from the guidance of parents. This creates another prob- 
lem demanding solution in the way of wise supervision; otherwise 
the playground will not be given the maximum amount of use, be- 
cause the larger children will monopolize the space to the exclusion of 
the weaker ones. In addition, the apparatus will not be safe. To 
conserve the use of these precious play areas and get the most use 
out of them, it has been necessary to invent space-economizing 
games, such as playground baseball and volley ball, and also to have 
the children organized so that every possible bit of ground is utilized 
in some form of activity. This organization and supervision cannot 
be done by mere police officers with the police type of discipline. 
The children would continue to play in the streets near their homes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
42 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
not making the effort to go to a distant place for something that is 
not attractive. Their physical activity must be organized and made 
attractive by play teachers with winning personalities. The play- 
ground must have magnetic force, and must be run on a self-govern. 
ing principle, as the out-of-school attendance is purely voluntary. 
Play as a Rural Necessity 
There is always much hue and cry about the need for play in the 
cities; but, when one mentions the rural community the answer is 
nearly always that the country children have plenty of play space and 
also receive the healthful exercise of daily chores. While it is true 
that the conditions of the city make the need for play stand out more 
strikingly, there are also many sound reasons why the play center 
should have a prominent place in the rural locality. : 
The rural child needs play partly because of his chores. Though 
these chores develop strong muscles and make the child apparently 
(: healthy being, yet the type of chores is such that it makes him 
stoop-shouldered, weak in lung and heart development, and only too 
, often an ungraceful and clumsy creature. (Country boys of great 
strength are often unable to make high school or college athletic 
teams, for the reason that they are so lacking in coordination. This 
surprising weakness is evidenced too in the inability of the country 
boy to cope with his city brother in passing the playground efficiency 
tests. Play is needed to do away with these irregularities, to make 
the country child what the opportunities of the farm should make 
him;.that is, the finest creature of the nation. 
‘Not only is organized play of physical importance to the coun- 
try child—it is also a means whereby he can become acquainted with 
a large circle of friends. Conditions are such that even though the 
child may have space to play he will have no one to play with, and the 
result is he is almost as bad off as the city gangster who has no place 
in which to play. It must be remembered that in the country as 
well as in the city the full value of play cannot be exacted unless there 
are children, space, and directorship. 
(The country boy needs play because of its social values. He is 
retteent, shy, and narrow-minded unless he can be brought into 
friendly contact with other youngsters of his age. At present, coun- 
try children, until they are educated in play, do not know the mean- 
ing of sportsmanship. 
  
‘
-P-A-G-E-51
THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 43 
The rural community as a whole needs a community place where 
the old and young alike may gather and enjoy themselves to the full- 
est extent. When every rural school becomes a ‘‘country club” there 
will be given a new vitality to the farming industry. This is a big 
problem that rural social workers are aiming at to-day: to develop 
general contentment and an attachment to the farm that cannot be 
broken by the lure of the city. 
_The Need of Play to Overcome Physical Defects 
Statistical studies, especially those of the draft in connection with 
the late war, have shown that many of the physical defects of adult 
life could have been prevented had the proper corrective exercises 
been given in childhood. _Play-can accomplish much in giving natural 
posture, and corrective gymnastic exercises can offset many of the 
physical abnormalities caused by theenvironment of confinement and 
strain under which people are living to-day., This is one of the 
future trends of physical education. Many public schools are 
employing special teachers to take care of this feature alone, much in 
the same way that they employ a special teacher to take charge of the 
ungraded or abnormal children. To show the good that can be 
accomplished it may be well to refer to the statistics concerning the 
physical examination of freshmen at Columbia University. Since 
the movement for remedial work has gone into effect in the public 
schools, the number of freshmen with curable defects has dropped 
from 30 per cent to less than 10 per cent. 
The Need of Play as an Educational Factor 
Recent studies in psychology and pedagogy have demonstrated 
beyond a doubt the value of games, gymnastics, drills, and other 
forms of physical exercise in the school curriculum. They supple- 
ment the other studies in assisting mental and moral growth and the 
aim of the school at large. Such qualities as mental alertness, ac- » 
curacy, concentration, courage, discipline, self-confidence, self-con- 
tfol, sportsmanship, and so forth, are engendered. This is one of 
the most important points of all—but it is not necessary to amplify 
here, as later chapters take up the matter in detail. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
44 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The Need for School Instruction in Proper Health Habits 
The schools have arrived at the point where they offer exercise 
in the form of plays and games, athletic work, gymnastics, and pos- 
sibly military drill. Too, they often require a physical examination 
to determine whether or not the pupil is in normal health. Some 
have gone farther than this, and have attempted to direct the habits 
of the child who is physically defective. This is excellent work so 
far as it goes, but it is not enough. Schools must teach proper health 
habits to the entire group under their supervision; they must put into 
their curriculum the types of physical education that inculcate the 
habits of building up vital resistance. This in itself will mean a 
preventive method. Along thesé lines the schools, and physical 
education itself, have been woefully weak. The field outside of 
muscular exercise has been too much neglected, with practically little 
or no emphasis on hygiene and proper health habits. (Health habits 
should be taught, not ina general theoretical way, but with practical 
hints on how the individual should take care of himself. Physical 
education thus taught should equip the student during the Bae 
years with knowledge essential to keeping the body in as perfect 
working conditions as possible, should make him aware of the danger 
signs which will caution him against exposure to contagious disease, 
and should make him able to be of help when emergencies are at 
hand. 
The Need of Play in Americanization 
All forms of play are most useful in our country in Americaniz- . 
ing our great influx of aliens, both children and adults. The for- 
eigners come to this country with national hatreds centuries old, 
prejudices so deeply rooted that one finds traces of them even after 
they have been settled in the United States for several generations. 
It is not sufficient to teach them how to handle the English language; 
that simply makes them the more easy prey for agitators, and Ameri- 
canization is then much farther removed.. The appeal to the intel- 
lect alone leaves them cold, unresponsive, shy. Play, instead, touches 
the emotions of these aliens and makes them a part of the social - 
group, team-mates in the common cause of happiness, good will, or 
victory, as the case may be, and breaks down the antipathies more 
quickly than can anything else. Elsewhere in this book the influence 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE PRESENT NEED FOR PLAY 45 
of play in-teaching friendliness, kindness, and sympathy is explained. 
Play affords a common meeting ground where people of any race 
can find an interest. The athletic teams in this country, whether 
school or professional, are made up of players of practically every 
nationality. Even new comers who have never played at sports in 
their own countries in the way we do, readily take to them if at all 
encouraged. Especially so do the children of these immigrants take 
to play, just as wholeheartedly as any American of Revolutionary 
ancestry. Because of its socializing influence, Americanization cen- 
ters use play and recreation to attract the foreigner, and often by 
gaining his trust find him responsive to the idea even of exhibiting 
some of the dances and plays of his own country, a thing he takes 
pride in doing. The influence brought about by wholesome play will 
tend to stamp out the spirit of discontent more easily than the fear 
of the police.

CHAPTER III 
HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 
Play is too big a thing to be handled by our schools and public 
playgrounds alone. It is so necessary a phase of our daily life that 
many of our institutions like the church, the factory, and other 
organizations not dependent upon public taxation have incorporated 
it into their programmes in order to further their own social aims. 
So necessary is it too that people find recreation and relaxation, that 
enterprising promoters are able to secure large profits by furnishing 
opportunities to satisfy these needs and cravings. 
For the purpose of further analysis in our discussion, we shall 
classify the agencies which we have just mentioned as being inter- 
ested in promoting play, as Public, Semi-public, and Commercial. 
PUBLIC PROMOTION 
This is the highest type of play promotion. Through such sup- 
port as the community gives, a broad field of play activities is fur- 
nished without direct charge to the players. The purpose is to invite 
universal participation, so that all alike may share in the benefits. 
The programme seeks a better citizenship by fostering play that is 
educational, and yet at the same time filled with wholesome amuse- 
ment. 
The local community does not need to be without help in the 
financing and direction of its play programme. Many of the play- 
grounds in our cities bear names of local benefactors who have 
donated expensive grounds. Playground funds are very frequently 
swelled by subscriptions from organizations such as Parent-Teacher 
Clubs, Rotary Clubs, and others similarly interested in civic improve- 
ment. Industrial concerns, too, may throw open their privately sup- 
ported play spaces to the general community use. National encour- 
agement for physical education is also being given. Another aid of 
most significant value comes from such philanthropic institutions as 
the Playground and Recreation Association of America, and the 
Russell Sage Foundation. The former undertakes surveys of recrea- 
47

  48 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
tional needs and the placing of field organizers to develop new city 
systems, and publishes much literature that is sold at a nominal cost. 
The Russell Sage Foundation likewise publishes valuable play litera- 
ture which is sold very cheaply; and undertakes, to a limited extent, 
the giving of advice and field help. Both institutions are instru- 
mental in the spread of play propaganda. 
Play as a public function requires an extensive plant in putting 
its programme across: municipal and school playgrounds, field 
houses, social centers, parks, and bathing beaches—and these are the 
meeting places used by the public organizations in carrying on and 
extending the many and varied activities which we have included 
in our broad interpretation of the play curriculum. It is the work 
of these institutions with which we are primarily concerned in this 
text; all the many needs and benefits which we ascribe to play in 
education and recreation are being promoted through their pro- 
grammes. The PLAYGROUNDS and sOcIAL CENTERS are the biggest 
factors in the success of organized play, and the succeeding chapter 
has been reserved for the discussion of these two institutions. The 
parks, in so far as they deal with organized play, are treated later 
as one and the same thing as municipal playgrounds. There is, how- 
ever, one feature of recreation found in the parks that is not of the 
nature of organized play; therefore, it will be well to speak of this 
in a few words and dismiss it. This includes the inviting surround- 
ings of trees and greens where individuals may rest, stroll, or use the 
many benches to read in the quiet; and, further, the park bench is 
intimately associated with courtship. The city often improves on 
the natural surroundings by adding winding channels for canoeing, 
and picturesque lagoons where there are swans, ducks, and fishes 
that may be fed. Often, a zoo may be added where the family on 
its outing may see strange birds and animals, and may watch the 
antics of the bears, or the monkeys in their trapeze stunts. Fre- 
quently, the city provides band concerts or other special attractions 
to entertain its people in the leisure hours of the week and on holi- 
days. 
There is but little to say about bathing beaches: the city controls 
them and furnishes attendants, guards, and equipment. These 
beaches are the most popular in the summer time and from the play 
standpoint the interest is in furnishing the opportunity for and in 
giving instruction in swimming, water sports, and life-saving. Usu- 
ally one day in the summer is reserved for a special aquatic pro- 
gramme,
-P-A-G-E-57
  HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 49 
In one way the public type of promotion takes on a commercial 
aspect. This is true most especially of such activities as public 
school and college athletics, dramatics, musicales, etc. Here we find 
that the general public does not participate, but pays an admission 
fee to be entertained by selected and skilled performers. At first 
this brings the idea of commercialism to mind, but it must be remem- 
bered that the proceeds are not used for individual gain, but are 
turned back into the control of the school authorities. In this way 
the extra funds that are necessary to develop talented performers 
for public presentation are forthcoming. Such a semi-commercial 
phase of promotion serves as an entertaining spectacle or exhibition, 
and one that has educational value as well. However, it is always 
confronted with a singular danger: namely, that of becoming almost 
entirely commercial. In athletics, particularly, we are always find- 
ing charges of professionalism of some sort or other. And these 
charges are often true, the result being that many athletes of low 
moral standing are induced to attend our educational institutions 
where they continue to demand favors and easy positions for their 
services. When the commercial factor becomes too strong, the in- 
ordinate desire to win that is kindled makes the students forgetful 
of fair play and considerate treatment of opponents; it may cause a 
disregard, too, for the future health of the players; and (this applies 
to all types of play entertainment alike) it may end in a concentra- 
tion of practically all the play equipment, facilities, and money on a 
small minority of students. In spite of these dangers, however, the 
interschool athletic movement has taken a firm hold on the public. 
Therefore whole chapters have been given later in the book to the 
question of ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND IN COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES. 
The community besides promoting the public type of play is 
a big help in the promotion of semi-public play.activities. This help 
is evidenced in granting the use of public facilities to organized 
groups. Thus we find the industrial and other teams receiving per- 
mits to use the athletic fields in the playgrounds and parks, and - 
certain groups receiving consent to use the gymnasium or rooms of 
the social service building for meetings. Often the play staff 
volunteers to furnish officials, to give advice, and to aid in organiza- 
tion. 
The community exercises authority over all types of play. 
While the semi-public and commercial agencies are allowed, in a 
great measure, to carry on their programmes unhindered, still they
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
must be subject to the censorship of public approval and regulation. 
In this way it can be said that the community actually stands back 
of and promotes all forms of recreation. 
SEMI-PUBLIC PROMOTION 
This type of promotion includes all clubs and organizations 
having an interest in play from the standpoint of the participation 
and benefit of its members. Such clubs usually have a membership 
fee, which must be paid before the privileges are extended. On 
certain occasions admission is charged, but the purpose of the com- 
mercial profit is a worthwhile one. The money taken in does not 
go to individual gain; instead, these fees are used for the upkeep of 
fields or halls, rental or equipment, and the payment of the janitor 
or caretaker; or, in the case of dramatics and music, they may be 
used to pay lecturers, dramatic artists, or musicians. 
Naturally, as groups are organized along many lines, there is a 
great variation in the size of the units, in the type of activities 
favored, and the kind of individuals catered to. These variations 
therefore give rise to sub-groups which, in the main, are three in 
number: (1) Open, where the restrictions on membership are very 
few, the one essential requirement being good character, and where 
the fees of membership are nominal enough to invite the public, or 
may be omitted altogether: (2) Ewclusive, where the membership 
is kept very limited through ballot selection, through limiting the 
enrollment to a certain definite number, or through fees that are 
kept so very high as to exclude automatically all except the very 
wealthy; (3) Informal, where individuals or groups promote their 
own play without connection with any permanent organization. 
Open 
Under the caption of open groups we must include the Boy 
Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, Summer Camps, Y. M. C. A., 
Y. W. C. A., Churches, Settlements, Industrial Organizations, certain 
athletic and social clubs, and miscellaneous organizations where 
play is incidental The Boy scOUTS, CAMP FIRE GIRLS, GIRL 
scOUTSs, and SUMMER CAMPS are recent outgrowths of the play 
movement whose programmes stress the objectives of character- 
building and citizenship, and thereby give a valuable sup- 
plement to our school training. They are so important that they

are taken up under separate chapters in this book and need no 
further mention here. In general, it should be noted that they con- 
sider the welfare of their members along broad lines. For this 
reason, part of their support is provided by the public through drives 
and subscriptions. 
Ne VEC A. 
This organization in its first form was really what the words 
imply: The Young Men’s Christian Association. It was organized 
in the early part of the eighteen thirties and its purpose was the read- 
ing and discussion of the Bible. Soon, however, the work of the 
association increased and the original religious interpretation for 
membership became slightly broader. Buildings were put up and the 
Y. M. C. A. began to take on the character of a place where young 
business and working men could obtain room and board, and spend 
their spare time; especially a place of good influence for the young 
men in the cities, who were working away from home and likely to 
fall into bad habits. Then the physical education phase of the work 
came in and the gymnasium and swimming pool became features of 
nearly every building. At the present time the Y. M. C. A. has 
buildings in nearly every country in the world and gives service to 
any demand that is made. The latest phase of the work has been 
general education: night school courses and correspondence school 
facilities have been offered in a great variety of subjects to many 
young men. The recreational side has also been enlarged: we find 
representative teams in basket ball, swimming, volley ball, track, and 
baseball; and there are reading rooms, pool and billiard tables, and 
bowling alleys. The modern Y. M. C. A. buildings also combine 
hotel and club features with those of an educational institution. 
The influence of the Y. M. C. A. reaches beyond its immediate 
membership. It is a factor in the organization of church and in- 
dustrial recreation; also, in the bringing of religious and social in- 
fluences into the high schools, as illustrated by the Hi Y clubs; and 
in helping to form Student Christian Associations in the colleges. In 
many cases the Y. M. C. A. acts as a student employment bureau. 
The Junior Y is very similar. to the Boy Scout organization except 
that its programme stresses religion much more. ‘This similarity is 
quite noticeable when one compares the handbooks of the two 
organizations. The Junior Y, as well as the Senior, has finely 
equipped and well conducted camps during the summer months.
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
YEG Ae 
This is so much like the Y. M. C. A. in its principles and 
activities that it would be repetition, to a large extent, to give a full 
description of its activities here. It is doing a great service for 
young women. . It offers social, recreational, and educational ad- 
vantages needed by the working girl. 
Churches 
The rise of the church athletic leagues and recreational depart- 
ments may be ascribed to the influence of the Y. M. C. A., the spread 
of doctrines of social service, and the desire to retain the young folks 
in church. This last aim has been justified in many cases; often a 
young man has attended Sunday school simply for the purpose of 
playing on a church team and the influence of the new associations 
has molded in him a more worthy character. 
The new socializing movement of the church makes that institu- 
tion assume something of the character of a social center. It is not 
uncommon for a church to possess a separate building, called by 
such names as “Guild House” or ‘“‘Parish House,” that is used for 
the showing of movies, for dancing, basket ball games and gym- 
nasium work, social parties, lectures, dramatics, etc. Again in larger 
cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit the larger churches have 
organized many small missions in the thickly populated districts 
hitherto unreached by church influences. These community missions 
combine religious, educational, social, and recreational features. 
The church has one advantage in that it has a closer touch and 
more common aim among its members than the public social center; 
the feeling of sociability is already present and does not have to be 
stimulated. In the way of disadvantages, there is the group limita- 
tion of creed; also, the antagonism and lack of support on the part 
of some members who are still Puritan-minded in their attitude 
towards play. 
The church does give definite support to the public play move- 
ment by organizing teams to participate in the various municipal 
athletic leagues—The Twilight Baseball Leagues for example. 
Settlements 
Settlement houses are conducted by the Red Cross, by churches 
in the form of missions, and by individuals or small groups who 
lend philanthropic support. The settlements have social uplift in  
-P-A-G-E-61
  
HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 53 
view and are primarily concerned with bettering conditions in the 
slums and foreign districts of our cities. ‘They have done a great 
work. Their programme, including as it does, child welfare, individual 
help, family help, medical help, betterment of housing conditions, 
Americanization, and improvement of leisure time activities, uses 
play as one of the means to attain the aims at large. Many 
settlements conduct small playgrounds of their own. The work in 
Americanization and in leisure time education makes of the settle- 
ment house a social center where games, singing, and dancing take 
place. Among the foreign people, the chance is given to revive the 
old folk dances and plays of their native lands. The social workers 
have been friendly to the play movement. They were an early 
factor in influencing the public to open up the school plant for social 
and recreational purposes. 
In this social service work, one institution has made its name 
known to everyone—the Hull House of Chicago. Its progress has 
been guided by the inspiration of the famed social worker, Jane 
Addams. Such an achievement has helped to keep alive a faith in 
humanity in this age which has experienced so much of modern war- 
fare and industrial unrest. 
Industries 
Many of the industries have joined in the new social movement; 
and we find them actually taking an interest in the welfare of their 
employees. Naturally, as health is one of the first concerns of wel-. 
fare, much has been done to promote recreation of a proper type. 
Some of the larger companies own their own gymnasiums and 
athletic fields. Here the employees can meet for informal games, or 
for games where the competition is based on the different units of the 
factory: office, supply room, foundry, machine shop, and assembly, 
for instance. The sports that prove successful for the formation of 
leagues are baseball, playground ball, basket ball, volley ball, and 
bowling. An occasional track meet proves popular. The above 
leagues pertain to competition within the factory and aim to get 
everyone in the game. There are, however, selected teams that 
represent the factory much as the varsity team represents the college. 
When such representative teams participate in city or “twilight” 
leagues under the direction of the community recreation authorities, 
the tendency is toward play of an amateur type; however, when the 
leagues are directed by corporations themselves, with games 
scheduled outside the immediate locality, professionalism becomes a
-P-A-G-E-62
54 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
factor, just as it does in intercollegiate athletics. Care should be 
taken that the ideal of plant-wide participation is not lost. 
Athletics form only one part of the new industrial welfare move- 
ment. The health of employees is being safeguarded in other ways. 
There are rest rooms, dispensaries, and sometimes a company hos- 
pital. Health is also considered from the standpoint of leisure. To 
furnish the element of contentment, garden associations are formed; 
exhibitions are staged in the auditoriums; orchestras, bands, and glee 
clubs are organized; amateur theatricals are promoted; and special 
outings and picnics furnished. The employees are further made to 
feel that an interest is being taken in them by other schemes which 
may include a shop government in which everyone has a voice, 
a company bank to encourage saving, a magazine in which con- 
siderable attention is given over to side-lights on shop life and shop 
characters, and a cooperative plan whereby assistance is rendered in 
home building. 
The Bell Telephone Company stands as an example of what 
industries can do for women employees. Many of the above ideas 
are incorporated in the company’s plan to keep its highly trained 
employees at the peak of efficiency—for the idea of efficiency and 
plant unity must be added to that of social sentiment in accounting 
for every corporation’s interest in promoting recreation programmes. 
In the line of active recreation, women workers seem to enjoy danc- 
ing, tennis, swimming, bowling, and basket ball. 
In many cases where industries have maintained playgrounds 
‘through their public welfare departments, the original aim of cater- 
ing to their employees has been enlarged into a neighborhood pro- 
ject, with directed play for all. In this philanthropic capacity, the 
industry allies itself directly with the public play movement. 
Athletic Clubs 
The foremost example of athletic clubs of open type is the 
Amateur Athletic Union, commonly called the A. A. U., which is 
national in the scope of its membership. The A. A. U. requires a 
fee for membership, also an amateur standing; and it rigidly con- 
trols the participation of its members in competitive sports. Its 
programme features track and swimming competition. Sectional 
meets are held as well as national ones. 
There are many types of local athletic clubs. For the most part, 
they are composed of young men, the purpose being to organize 
teams and secure competition. Young men of the same nationality
-P-A-G-E-63
HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 55 
will often group themselves together in this way; neighborhood 
groups also are common. 
Social Clubs 
These have the social aim uppermost, rather than the exclusive 
athletic aim which was noted above. The Unions for men and 
women in the large Universities, which really correspond to social 
centers, must be listed as semi-public for the reason that member- 
ship cards and privileges prevail and outsiders are excluded except 
on invitation. Likewise, the University clubs of our various cities, 
which are composed of alumni from one particular institution, illus- 
trate this class. These organizations confine themselves largely to 
the indoor type of activities, such as billiards, pool, bowling, and 
cards. Usually, there are reading rooms and dining rooms which 
serve the purpose of repose and fellowship. The program is not so 
elaborate as to require expensive fees. Another example is the 
American Legion, which has assembly places for social and recrea- 
tional purposes. The foreign clubs of our large cities group them- 
selves in this manner. They have rich contributions in the way of 
music, dancing, and festivals, and often gymnastics and games. The 
Turnverein as representative of the German nationality illustrates 
this class. There are associations just as typical to represent the 
Polish, Bohemian, Slovak, and other nationalities. The objection 
has been raised that these distinctive racial groupings hinder the 
process of assimilation. This is partly true; but they do carry on an 
important recreation programme that our public play facilities and 
settlement houses are not yet able.to handle effectively. 
Miscellaneous Organizations 
Here we have reference to organizations whose members find 
their ties governed by some particular business, trade or profession. 
Examples are found in the various business men’s clubs, the many 
labor and trade unions, the Grange and newer Farm Bureau. While 
the foremost purpose is improvement in the conditions of the par- 
ticular kind of work, still recreation does enter into the life of 
the association. This is evidenced in picnics, banquets, dances, car- 
nivals, and bazaars. 
Exclusive 
As mentioned briefly before, the membership of the organiza- 
tions referred to as exclusive is limited to a considerable degree,
-P-A-G-E-64
56 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
eligibility for the most part being determined by wealth or social 
influence, and often being dependent on the sanction of the active 
members. This group at large includes our select civic organizations 
such as the Rotary Club, Exchange, and Kiwanis; the fraternal 
societies, such as Masons, Elks, Knights of Pythias, Knights of 
Columbus, Odd Fellows, and school fraternities, for the men, and 
corresponding secret organizations such as Eastern Star, Maccabees, 
etc., for the women; private schools that limit their enrollment and, 
have a long waiting list; and, lastly, the many exclusive city and 
country clubs. 
For the most part the programme is not one of public improvement 
and citizenship, but one of recreation and fellowship that is confined 
to the particular group concerned; although this is not true of the 
civic clubs which have done much to secure community support for 
play centers and for the Boy Scout type of organization. In so far 
as the members are concerned, both the civic and fraternal organi- 
zations maintain first of all the social club idea. In addition, celebra- 
tions, picnics, bazaars, and dances are held, and athletic teams are 
organized to participate in city leagues. To a smaller extent, some 
of the fraternal orders have also given support to the public play 
movement. 
Turning our attention to the exclusive schools, it is not too much 
to say that they offer the best individual advantages in the way 
of play of any institutions in the country. Many private schools of 
small enrollment possess athletic fields, gymnasiums, and swimming 
pools that are superior to those of many large universities. The 
English idea of sport:is followed out: every boy or girl attending 
the school being encouraged to take part in play and then receiving 
very careful individual coaching. 
As regards the exclusive city and country clubs, it must be said 
that they are of but little significance in the community play idea, 
for the reason that their privileges are confined to so small a 
number. The palatial buildings and equipment of the exclusive type 
of city club, and the well cared for greens and boating courses as 
found in the country, offer a wonderful opportunity for entertain- 
ment, but of the amusement type almost entirely. The men and 
women of wealth and leisure who use the advantages offered in the 
way of golf, tennis, swimming, and boating are bound to be bene- 
fited in health and mental well-being. From the public standpoint, 
the good points which must be set forth for the play of exclusive 
clubs are only too often offset by the extravagance of fashionablé 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 57 
yachting and polo, and of over-elaborate dances and feasts; the fact 
that stands out as regrettable is that so much money should be 
squandered on useless and fastidious play when the general public 
is so greatly in need of funds for its recreation. 
Informal 
The type of promotion referred to here is that of self-promotion. 
Its scope includes all the forms of play that are planned by single 
individuals or small groups without a definite organization. There 
are always enthusiasts, singly or in company, for such outdoor 
recreations as hiking, swimming, fishing, hunting, canoeing, skating, 
touring, camping, picnics, and informal or ‘‘scrub” games; and, 
similarly, for such indoor play as reading, cards, checkers, chess, 
and music. Then there are congenial groups which will come 
together of their own accord for dances, lawn socials, card parties, 
or parlor games. In a sense, children’s play at home and in the 
streets is of this type; it is characterized by lack of permanency and 
direction. : 
At first glance it would seem that the informal type of play is 
one of which the public recreational systems need not take cognizance, 
but this is not the case. Above, we have mentioned a list of activi- 
ties that should be encouraged; but it is only too true, that people 
left to themselves will find amusements that are wholly objection- 
able. Children, not knowing the best that is in play, will be apt 
to find their fun in smoking, playing marbles for “keeps,” pitching 
pennies, predatory raids, truancy, and sex delinquencies—all which 
are violations of our best ideals of social conduct; and our older 
youth and our adults often find their way into the commercialized 
vices for their source of pleasure. Therefore, the public play 
movement carries with it the responsibility of combating the ten- 
dency of informal play to degenerate. 
It has been shown that the people need education in their choice 
of informal play. Chosen rightly, this type should be supported to 
the utmost. The public recreational leaders should make them- 
selves a source of information concerning interesting home forms of 
recreation suitable for all occasions, and should be ready to give in- 
struction in certain sports that require a special technique. They 
should also disseminate a knowledge of athletic hygiene and out- 
ing hygiene. In truth, it can be said that the organized play system 
is not successful unless it reacts both directly and indirectly to 
create a wide-spread interest in informal play. Informal play will
-P-A-G-E-66
58 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
be seen at its highest type when individuals will choose wholesome 
recreation and will systematize that part of it which deals with the 
‘regular daily practice of bodily exercise. 
COMMERCIAL 
We can judge somewhat how fully the need of play is supplied 
by noticing the number of commercialized amusements and the extent 
to which they are patronized. By commercialized amusement is 
meant the type that is provided by private concerns in order that 
they may make money from the patrons. It includes not only the 
toys and games purchased and taken home for the play of children 
and of adults, but more especially the amusements for which one 
pays admission. In this class are the baseball parks, bowling alleys, 
‘pool rooms, carnivals, circuses, dance halls, excursion boats, fairs, 
gambling dens, horse races, moving picture shows, burlesques, roof 
gardens, scenic railways, skating rinks, music halls, theaters, etc. 
The sums spent for these amusements by people in our cities are 
enormous, and far exceed all that is spent for schools, playgrounds, 
streets, and municipal improvements met by public taxation. 
Commercial enterprises, always seeking big dividends, really 
anticipated and gave opportunity for play before the public was 
stirred into making appropriations for this purpose. In this respect 
commercialized play has had a great opportunity; but it has largely 
failed. It has considered profit first of all, and in catering to the 
spirit of the modern generation it has fostered amusements that are 
useless and vicious. It has specialized in organized thrills that un- 
duly excite the nervous temperament. Too frequently, as in the 
cases of our movies and professional athletics, the people pay to 
see the others perform, and themselves assume the passive réle of 
onlookers. Almost in every instance the public has been exploited 
in the sense that exorbitant prices have been charged in order that 
the promoters might amass huge fortunes. 
Commercialized forms of play are both good and bad; and 
moreover, many of them that are now distinctly evil influences can 
be converted into useful and artistic forms of play. There is no 
question but that the theater, music halls, and the movies can all be 
molded from the standpoints of art, education, and recreation; 
and, many amusements like pool and billiards, now frowned upon, 
can be made very desirable simply by improving their environment. 
Gambling dens, opium joints, low resorts, and like places of vicious 
surroundings, however, have no worth-while function in our civiliza- 
   
-P-A-G-E-67
  HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 59 
tion and should be wiped out entirely. These latter influences have 
helped to mar and prostitute many legitimate forms of amusement. 
A significant point of commercialized play is that people will pay 
fancy prices to be amused, or for a chance to play. Also, its very ex- 
tensiveness shows that the playgrounds and other municipal provi- 
sions are still inadequate; and that until the demands are met, there 
will always be undesirable forms of commercial amusement. 
SUMMARY 
With this general survey of the impetus behind the play move- 
ment we are able to suggest the most desirable and feasible means of 
promoting play activities. There is no question that the public type 
of promoting play should be greatly enlarged and expanded: every 
city, village, and rural district should feel the influence of the play- 
ground, gymnasium, and social center. School and playground 
exhibitions should be carefully managed so that undesirable pro- 
fessional practices do not creep in. 
The semi-public promotion is also a contribution to community 
welfare. In one way, through close personal touch because of its 
smaller groupings, it can accomplish things better than can a pub- 
lic organization. Therefore, encouragement should be given to all 
agencies of this type, especially so to those which proceed along 
broad educational, social, hygienic, and cultural, as well as recrea- 
tional lines. This is apt to be true of nearly all the open cooperative 
groups. Even the exclusive groups have their uses. Those 
interested in civic welfare should be kept awake and informed as to 
the play needs of the particular community, and their valuable back- 
ing secured; those clubs carrying on fraternal and social spirit have 
an invaluable place, especially in dealing with adult leisure, and, in 
addition, it is possible to get these clubs to participate in the public 
play programme; and even the exclusive clubs of privilege, in spite of 
the gulf between their programme and the public one, do give needed 
recreation to many business and professional men, as well as to give 
publicity to outdoor life and its sport. Then there is the informal 
type of play, which cannot be overlooked. The public needs to 
make its programme so attractive that vicious types of informal play 
will lose their hold; and it must everlastingly encourage people to 
seek exercise and recreation. 
Lastly, we come to the commercial forms of play. Those that 
are vicious should be suppressed; those that are of value should be 
carefully regulated. In the long run, the solution to such problems
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
as arise from this source will be accomplished by the whole-hearted 
promotion of public recreation. This point of view is strongly 
emphasized in the words of Patten in his book ‘“The New Basis of 
Civilization.” “Vice must first be fought by welfare, not by re- 
straint; and society is not safe until today’s pleasures are stronger 
than its temptations. Amusement is stronger than vice and can stifle 
the lust for it.” It is only natural that with the ascendency of public 
promotion of wholesome play we shall find that vice will graduaily 
eliminate itself; for play in its fullest sense is much like humanity 
itself—primarily good and seeking clean expression. 
This discussion makes it evident that the public stands inter- 
related with all other phases of play promotion; also that it carries 
a definite responsibility towards them. All are needed. An interest- 
ing study of recreation made in Cleveland goes to show that the task 
of taking care of the recreation hours of our population is one to 
tax every type of agency. The public playgrounds alone could 
not begin to do so. This study shows that approximately 60 per 
cent of the hours available for recreation are under the direction of 
the individual himself—the type of play we have classed as in- 
formal; such a condition emphasizes the importance of wise direc- 
tion of leisure time activities. As regards the remainder of the 
time—the time spent under the direction of some specific agency— 
the following facts come to light: the public play centers took care 
of 43.4 per cent of the away-from-home leisure hours, with emphasis 
on care of younger children, however, to the extent of 76.5 per cent 
for ages five to fifteen, as against 20.8 per cent from sixteen to 
twenty-five, and 12.5 per cent for all over age twenty-five. The type 
of agency we have classed as semi-public took care of 35.7 per cent 
of the total hours away from home; in this case, however, the adults 
were given the greatest attention to the extent of 62.5 per cent as 
against 17.6 per cent for children under fifteen, and 41.7 per cent 
for ages sixteen to twenty-five. The commercial agencies handled 
20.9 per cent of the problem: ages five to fifteen, 5.9 per cent; ages 
sixteen to twenty-five, 37.5 per cent and over twenty-five, 25 per 
cent. An analysis of this shows them catering mostly to our youth— 
young men and women. 
The publicly controlled play programme, even though it can never 
function so as to take the place of all these various agencies that 
have been mentioned, must still accept the place of leader. It can 
direct the future expansion of play and recreation so that the 
maximum benefit may be forthcoming.

HOW PLAY IS PROMOTED 61 
To date, in spite of all the good that the play movement has 
accomplished it is only a mite compared with the possibilities. The 
public thinks that it has contributed lavishly; but in this, as in other 
institutions supported by taxation, the people fall short. This fact 
is only too evident when it is considered what is paid out each year 
in the United States for luxuries. There needs to be an awakening 
concerning our national habits of extravagance in personal forms of 
amusement. ‘This, the following table of expenditures, as based 
upon the revenue and sales tax, shows conclusively:

Some of the facts are startling. We pay almost five times as 
much for chewing gum as we do for public recreation. For tobacco, 
we spend 200 times as much. The charge per capita for amuse- 
ments other than public recreation (the five listed above) is $58.81; 
whereas, that of public recreation amounts to 8-3/10 cents. It must 
be remembered too, that the item of cosmetics for women is not 
given a place at all in the above list. 
The above amusements, while they may be considered as con- 
ducive to personal pleasure, still tend to be selfish in nature, and 
without any real value. The conclusion brought about by the table 
is that the public recreation movement does not necessarily have to 
be hampered because of the excuse so often given—lack of funds.

CHAPTER IV 
THE PLAY CENTER 
The term “play center’ is a broad one. It may be used to in- 
clude the school ground, park, bathing beach, roof garden, closed 
street, vacant lot, school building, field house, gymnasium, swimming 
pool, factory, hospital, church, parish, settlement, library, art 
museum, home for the delinquent, or many other miscellaneous 
places that play authorities make use of to promote their work. 
Two types of play center stand out, however, in connection with 
organized play. The first of these is the playground as found in 
connection with our schools and parks. The second is the com- 
munity play building, in the form of the field house and newer school 
house. These two types of center taken together offer a programme 
of widest possible nature, and one that is in service throughout the 
entire year. A description of their work is therefore sufficient to 
show in a general way what all the other play centers are doing. 
The Administration of Play Centers 
The question of proper administration has been a perpiexing one 
ever since the playground movement was inaugurated. 
Many cities have maintained playgrounds where the support has 
come through donations or popular subscription, and in this case the 
body of people primarily responsible for the interest has continued in 
control in the form of a Board of Directors usually called a Play- 
ground and Recreation Association.. The great majority of play- 
grounds, however, have been supported by public taxes, and in this 
case there has been no settled policy as to which municipal depart- 
ment should be in control. As a result, several different plans of 
management have been followed; in most cases the authority has 
been vested in the School Board, but the Park Board has also been 
given this responsibility, and of late the idea of a separate Recrea- 
tion Commission has been growing in favor. Still another plan 
that has been followed is to divide the authority, by allowing the 
63
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
schools to operate their own playgrounds, and the Park Boards to 
control the play in the public parks. The extreme of the divided 
type of management has come when in the same city there would be 
found schools, parks, and private agencies conducting playgrounds 
independently of each other. Each of the above plans has its 
special adherents, but in general it may be said that no one of them 
can be effective without a considerable amount of cooperation be- 
tween the different parties whose properties are being used. Possibly 
a lack of cooperation in this respect, and the factor of political inter- 
ference, also, have been the two most serious handicaps that have 
stood in the way of efficiency in playground administration. 
The controversy over which department should control the play 
activities can only be settled by a careful survey of local conditions. 
There are certain advantages and drawbacks in each plan, as the 
following analysis will serve to show. 
The School Board 
The modern type of school has facilities for both playgrounds 
and social centers and already conducts a play programme of its own 
during the school day. There is no other agency that can compare 
with the school in having close touch with the children and neighbor- 
hood conditions. Also, the school is closest to the ideal from the 
standpoint of location. Through the children, whole families are 
reached. Superintendents are aware of the educational value of 
play. Where the schools as a whole have fallen down, the blame 
may be laid to a limitation of facilities. Very few schools have large 
enough playgrounds to carry on the team games which attract the 
older boy or. girl and the adult. Then, too, unless a separate staff 
of teachers is employed for after-school and evening hours, and pro- 
vision made for the summer months, the school cannot properly func- 
tion as administrator of the complete play programme that each city 
should possess. Some one has estimated that only 15 per cent of the 
population goes to school and that even with this small group most 
of its play takes place during out-of-school hours. It is safe to say 
that 80 per cent of all the community play occurs when the school 
is not in session. Therefore if the school is to handle the community 
play programme it must be given additional funds, take on a new force 
of workers, and continue twelve months in session. Gary, Indiana, 
has managed to consolidate such a scheme under the Board of Edu- 
cation, and it has produced gratifying results. Many other cities,  
-P-A-G-E-73
THE PLAY CENTER 65 
especially those of smaller population, have enlarged their original 
facilities, and have been similarly successful. 
The Park Board 
The Park Board scarcely seems the proper municipal department 
to handle the playground and recreation problems. It is true that 
in many cities the Park Boards have attended to this function with 
considerable success, and they must also be credited with having been 
a great help in the early days of the playground movement, when the 
city parks were practically the only spaces available. Even so, how- 
ever, it seems a misplacement of authority and responsibility to let 
the Park Boards handle our community play, especially that of the 
little children. In the first place, such officials have had no training 
in this type of work, neither from the practical nor the theoretical 
standpoint. It stands to reason that they would have only a 
secondary interest in play, and would subordinate it—if not actually 
discourage it for the reason that spirited youngsters wear out the 
grass and in many other ways disturb the appearance of the city’s 
beauty spots. Then, too, the Park Board is invariably mixed up 
with politics, and changes of administration are frequent. When- 
ever the park administration remains in office by virtue of a platform 
of economy, the play programme is bound to suffer. In conclusion, it 
must be repeated that if the Park Boards are to stand as the proper 
solution of play administration, radical changes will have to be made 
in the present composition of the park staff and in the parks them- 
selves. 
The Playground and Recreation Association 
The private Playground and Recreation Associations were a 
great factor in the early history of the playground movement, when 
interest had to be stirred up in the different cities by people who were 
interested in social welfare work. Nearly always these bodies have 
dropped out of existence as soon as the city has taken over the move- 
ment, or have continued in an advisory capacity only. Actual au- 
thority then comes only from the distributing of funds that have 
been raised from private sources. The Playground Associations are 
organized the same as other organizations that have a Board of Di- 
rectors. The directors represent other important organizations of 
the city. Such a board is efficient if the members are really interested 
in the work. They are not paid and hold this position in an honorary 
sense rather than from any special ability in recreation work. They
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
can render a great service, however, in checking up on the work of 
the staff in charge of the recreation work. Because of the stand- 
ing and influence of the members in the community, the Playground 
Association is in a good position to give publicity, secure appropria- 
tions, and enlarge the scope of the work. The members are often 
found acting as volunteer club leaders, chaperones for dances, and 
in other capacities that help to spread the spirit of neighborliness 
and social improvement. 
The Combination Plan 
Many cities have experimented with a combination Park-School 
plan whereby the schools direct their playgrounds during school 
hours, then close them up, shifting the responsibility to the park play- 
. grounds. This means also that the Park Board runs the summer 
playgrounds. The details of dividing authority in this manner vary 
in different cities. In such a division of control, the parks control 
community activities in field houses, and schools usually control the 
use of their buildings for social centers. Such a system carries with 
it considerable duplication of effort, and involves constant over- 
lapping and friction between the two different departments. 
The Recreation Commission 
The special Recreation Commission has been devised in an 
attempt to place all the city resources for play at the command of one 
trained body. This body then is responsible for all public play 
other than that which the school supervises for children during its 
regular day session. The fact that it stands as a board entrusted 
with this one particular purpose makes the school or the park more 
willing to recognize other authority and cooperate in carrying out its 
wishes, than is the case where they have dealt with each other. 
Some other advantages that are claimed for this separate gov- 
erning board are as follows: it gives sole and undivided attention 
to this one thing whereas other departments are already overloaded 
with work that belongs to their own respective fields, and can give 
the recreation problem only secondary attention; it insures specially 
trained leaders in recreation work; it has a budget of its own, which 
cannot be diverted to other use, as has happened when other depart- 
ments have been in control, and have had their budgets reduced, or 
have been entirely out of sympathy with the needs of the play 
center; it is interested in giving publicity to the play movement, and 
by so doing, keeps the public closely in touch with it, and more will-
-P-A-G-E-75
THE PLAY CENTER 67 
ing to back it with funds; and, lastly, it makes it possible for respon- 
sibility to be placed when things go wrong, and praise to be granted 
when good work is done. 
The members of the commission may be elected in the same 
manner as the School Board or they may be appointed by the Mayor 
or City Commission; and may have the same relation toward the 
Recreation Superintendent and directors as does the School Board 
toward the School Superintendent and principals. The Recreation 
Commission plan has proven especially feasible in large cities. 
The Functions of a Recreation Commission 
The functions of the Recreation Commission may be taken to 
apply to any of the administrative bodies that have been described. 
The functions of a Recreation Commission as outlined by the 
city of Detroit are: 
1. To provide a safe place to play. Over 250 children have been killed by 
playing in the streets during the past three years in Detroit. (Report of 1922.) 
2. To decrease juvenile delinquency and crime. Prominent judges in 
United States claim that 70 per cént of the delinquent cases could have been 
prevented, if, during the adolescent period of the boy or girl, a proper place 
to play or recreate had been provided for them. 
3. To build up the health and physique of the people. 
4. To break down race prejudice through competition in play. 
5. To educate through play and games. 
6. To teach citizenship, Americanization, and to assist in the assimilation of 
the foreigner. 
7. To develop a community spirit and civic pride by bringing neighbors 
together in play. 
8. To promote, control, and regulate proper leisure time activities. 
The last function brings up much controversy. Some people 
claim that the Recreation Commission should handle the work of 
investigating commercialized amusements, such as dance halls, pool 
rooms, etc. ‘The experience of certain cities along this line has 
shown that this responsibility is one not to be desired. Even when 
the commission finds that unwholesome conditions exist, there is no 
direct means of correcting them except through appeal to the police. 
Then, too, the problem of vice presents so many angles in connection 
with health, housing, sanitation, and politics, as well as with recrea- 
tion, that it should be given special study. The Recreation Commis- 
sion should proceed on the basis of furnishing wholesome amusement 
that will counteract the attraction of the vicious type; and this is a 
field of opportunity that demands undivided attention.

The Functions of a Recreation Superintendent 
The preceding paragraph has shown the aims at large that the 
Recreation Commission strives to accomplish. This commission 
acts through an administrative officer, the Superintendent or Com- 
missioner. In order to bring about the results that are sought, the 
Commissioner must handle a programme of practical administrative 
duties, as follows: 
He should make a survey of the community and its recreational needs. 
Select and train a play staff. 
Outline and conduct a programme of activities. 
. Superintend the purchase, installation, and care of equipment. 
. Superintend the construction of new play centers. 
. Cooperate with other organizations interested in promoting play. 
Administer office details; i.e., budget, records, salaries, inventories, etc. 
. Keep the public interested in the work that is accomplished. This in- 
cludes newspaper publicity and news items, talks to civic organizations, etc. SI AUR Y Yo 
THE PLAYGROUND 
The Construction of the Playground 
Location 
The location of the playground is all important. No matter how 
well equipped and administered, a playground i is limited in useful- 
ness unless it is convenient to the people it is to serve. The ideal 
location is seldom possible to-day for the reason that our cities are 
already built up and available land difficult to secure. Because of 
present conditions it has been found that little children of pre-school 
age use vacant lots for their play, school children use the available 
space adjoining the school building, and older children and adults 
have to journey some distance to the parks, which are the only 
places large enough to allow the usual competitive type of sport. 
In locating play spaces it is of practical value to know the dis- 
tances that people will go to attend them. Statistics have been 
gathered to show that the limit of distance individuals will go is as 
follows: younger children under six, one quarter of a mile (for 
safety reasons they should not go farther); children from six to 
twelve years, of grade school age, one half a mile; and older boys 
and adults, three quarters of a mile and more, according to the per- 
manence of their organization and the intensity of their interest. 
The effective radius of distance for the community center has been 
estimated at one half a mile. In general, the distance that people
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE PLAY CENTER 69 
will go is governed largely by the extent to which the particular com- 
munity has been educated and interested in play activities. 
There are other factors, besides convenience, that should be con- 
sidered. If possible, the ground should be distant from railroads, 
street car lines, deep water, dumping grounds, low undrained lands, 
and.any other source of danger to the child’s health and safety. 
Size 
The size of the playground is governed largely by the same pro- 
visions that apply to the location; namely, amount of available space 
and funds, and the particular age group that needs to be accom- 
modated. The amount of space required for each child varies ac- 
cording to different authorities. In England the Committee of 
Council on Education has set 30 square feet per child as the mini- 
mum standard; that is, the number of children in the particular 
school would be multiplied by 30 in order to get the play space in 
square feet. In the United States the standard is left to the local 
authorities, but almost everywhere the tendency has been to demand 
a higher minimum and to continue to raise it. The difference of 
opinion ranges all the way from 30 square feet to 300 square feet 
per person, but the higher estimates make allowance for older people 
also being present and playing games like baseball and soccer that 
’ require a large space. The Playground and Recreation Association 
quotes the general opinion as being 140 square feet per child (300 
to an acre) as “the point of saturation”, but suggests that many 
people use a smaller estimate when only little children under ten 
years are to be accommodated. A smaller estimate is also some- 
times justified on the basis that no more than one half the children 
will ever be present at one time. As regards the standard for the 
school, opinion is fairly well settled that each elementary school 
should occupy a city block, and this usually means an acre of play 
space for a school of less than 600 pupils. This conforms quite 
closely to the standard of the playground authorities since only a 
portion of the children will be using the ground at one time. The 
Junior and Senior high school standards for the same number of 
pupils are larger, being two acres or more. 
It is seen from the above estimates that are given that the age 
of the children has much to do with the amount of space required. 
It goes without saying that a small child does not require as much 
space for play as an adult, and that directed play requires less space 
than undirected play. The ideal situation would have numerous 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
playgrounds of one half an acre generously sprinkled around the 
city for the small children, for they are unable to go far to play un- 
less accompanied by their parents or older children; and for the 
older children would have playgrounds of two acres and as much 
more space as possible, but which would not need to be as numerous. 
Playgrounds for community purposes should be reasonably acces- 
sible, and from four to twenty acres in size. 
Divisions 
Quite frequently the individual playground is found divided into 
sections with shade trees or hedges used to denote the boundaries of 
the smaller units. In some places the idea of two sections is followed 
out; one for boys over ten years, and the other for girls and little 
children. The more standard division, however, is the division into 
three sections (such as is found in the Chicago park playgrounds), 
which gives over one half of the ground to boys over ten years of 
age, one quarter to girls over ten, and one quarter to groups of little 
children under ten. The reason for the older boys having more 
space proportionately is that their favored activities, team games, 
demand more room, 
It is evident that some division is necessary. Otherwise the little 
children will be getting in the way of the large players. Again, 
older boys will need. a man director to direct their team sports, 
whereas the little boys and girls will play together under the 
guidance of a woman teacher. The three-fold division answers the 
purpose in a practical way, although some objections are made to it 
on the ground that the demarcation at the age of ten is not correct 
from the standpoint of age interests, that instead the children should 
be separated at the approximate ages of six and twelve. This, 
however, would divide the playground into too many restricted 
areas. 
On the whole the three-fold division at ten continues to prove 
satisfactory, since children of both sexes will play together until that 
age is reached. In one way it has the advantage of allowing plenty 
of leeway in satisfying age interests, and then the director of each 
area can usually provide other interests for the children who happen 
to have older or younger tastes than the average group. A sugges- 
tion has been made that another division be added for adults. This 
seems unnecessary, considering that adult play is mostly in the eve- 
ning when they should be allowed preference in the use of the 
grounds.
-P-A-G-E-79
  
THE PLAY CENTER 71 
The smaller types of playground, such as the ordinary school 
grounds, are rarely found divided and they would lose in value if 
such a project were attempted. The usefulness of the divisions 
applies to grounds where space is fairly ample, where two or more 
teachers are always on hand, and where there are heterogeneous 
groups of people attending. 
Shade and Attractiveness 
Utility should not be sacrificed in order to beautify the grounds, 
but on the other hand the children have the right to enjoy attractive 
surroundings. To the city child, especially, an aesthetic value arises 
in having shade trees, vines, plants, flowers, and grassy plots, but 
they should not be allowed to interfere with the play. There is the 
chance to place these things at the entrance to the grounds, on the 
borders, along walks, and close to buildings, and in such a case, most 
objections to their use will disappear. Vines help beautify the 
appearance of a fence. When trees follow along the walks, it is 
practically as economical as regards space to have a double row (one 
on each side of the walk) instead of one alone, and this is what most 
cities do in this respect. 
However, trees have another important value in addition to 
beautifying the grounds. In the case of the parks, they attract 
picnic parties, who often are induced to make active games a part 
of their outing. In all playgrounds, trees are needed for their shade, 
especially in the sections where the little children play, such as about 
the sandbox, swings, and other apparatus, and about the wading pool. 
They are also needed to shelter the benches where parents sit and 
watch their children. During the hottest periods of the day, the 
shaded portions of the playgrounds are the only ones that are kept 
busy. The trees that are best suited for playground purposes are 
the hard maples and the elms, for they have a large heavy top and 
give a dense shade. They have one drawback—they grow very 
slowly ; but this can be overcome by planting alternate quick-growing 
trees which can be used until the maple and elm trees grow up. 
The hedge also can serve a practical purpose. Many cities use 
the hedge as a fence, especially where it is desired to bound spaces 
within the playground. ; 
Once the playground is beautified, care must be taken to keep up 
its appearance. The trees must be protected against injury, both 
from children and from destroying insects. Of course, in the parks, 
the park officials would see to the upkeep of the plants and flower
-P-A-G-E-80
  "72 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
beds, but on the school grounds, the little children are often inter- 
ested in watering and caring for these things, and under the teacher’s 
direction, they.can be taught a sense of appreciation and responsi- 
bility in this way. 
Fencing 
The general opinion favors fencing. The reasons given are 
several in number. The children are safe from the street traflic; 
otherwise they are apt to run into the street after a ball or to escape 
being tagged, and in the excitement of the game, forget the danger. 
Fencing will make the problem of supervision much easier, because it 
sets the playground apart from the outer world; by doing this it 
gives the playground a distinct individuality and makes of it an 
institution that will cultivate loyalty. Fences make the difference be- 
tween vacant lots and playgrounds. 
Too, the problem of discipline is reduced because people who 
enter the enclosed space usually intend to play instead of to idle. 
Undesirables can be kept out—a matter very difficult otherwise. 
The apparatus and courts are safeguarded, because the grounds can 
be locked up when the director leaves. Furthermore, the playground, 
when locked up, cannot be used as a “hanging out” place. Another 
thing is that at times when the playground is closed, the children are 
not apt to be found climbing about on the supports of the apparatus 
and trying dangerous stunts. 
It is more essential that the small playground be fenced than the 
large one. Ina sense the large park playground is fenced off by the 
park areas that usually surround it; and the location is far removed 
from many of the objections that have been brought up previously. 
The park, also, is usually well policed. In sucha situation, any fence, 
unless a hedge, would detract from the appearance of the park as 
a whole. Ina sentimental way there is an argument against using a 
fence on a large area of several acres. Here, there should be no 
feeling of confinement—nothing that would detract from the idea 
of space and freedom. The city person who is continually hemmed 
in and cramped for space finds much of his enjoyment in visiting the 
park in the sense of repose and freedom that it gives. 
Fences should be high enough to keep the balls inside; and so 
constructed as to deter people from trying to climb over them, and 
to be strong enough to stand up under the strain they are subjected 
to when children run into them or use them to lean upon. There 
are many types of fences which are satisfactory. Steel art fences
-P-A-G-E-81
THE PLAY CENTER WB 
are very good, but are expensive. A hedge of evergreen is favored 
by some authorities, and is a type of fence that is especially well 
adapted to park uses. Woven wire fences are most commonly used. 
These have wooden posts at intervals, and may be further strength- 
ened by the addition of a wooden rail at the top and bottom. The 
_ wire meshes should be fine enough to keep in the balls that are being 
used in the games. 
Fences near sections where ball games are played should be at 
least ten feet high. In some places where they are needed as a back- 
stop for the particular game, it may be necessary to build up addi- 
tions on top of the regular fence. 
Grading 
The playground surface must be level, therefore the grading 
problem must be given consideration. Although technical in nature, 
a few of the more general points may be touched on here. If the 
playground. is on a low level, it may be advantageous to have the 
grounds slope gradually to the center; then the drainage can be 
handled by having small catch basins leading to a larger catch basin 
at the center of the depression. This type of field can be easily 
flooded in the winter time for skating. Another type of playground 
is the one that has the highpoint in the middle so that the water 
will run off toward the sides. ° Still another type, and one that needs 
considerable grading, is the playground that is found along the side 
of the hill. Quite often some excavation is necessary before the play- 
ing space can be made level. This requires special attention, such as 
heavy sodding and arrangement of shrubbery on the terraces. The 
drainage in this case will be in one direction—in the general slope of 
the hill—and following heavy rains, the water will wash out the 
ground and leave gullies. 
Surfacing 
The surfacing problems differ according to the locality and 
nature of the grounds, and according to the games that are to be 
played. No one type of surface can meet all needs. A surface to 
meet all the demands made upon it should be smooth and level, and 
‘firm and springy under the feet; should resist wear, not be dusty, 
and absorb water readily. For general all-around use there is prob- 
ably no better surface than grass turf, yet this is impossible to main- 
tain where the grounds are being used intensively. Grass does prove 
practical for folk dancing, kindergarten plays, elementary games, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
for the larger athletic fields. However, spaces that are being used 
all day long, like the ordinary school ground, or the concentrated 
areas where popular competitive games like volley ball, Newcomb, 
tennis, and playground ball are being played, require a more durable 
surface. Some of the methods of surfacing that have been experi- 
mented with most successfully are given below. 
The simplest type of surface and one that proves fairly satis- 
factory is sandy loam, or better yet, the loam mixed with clay. The 
loam alone is not firm enough; and the clay alone stays muddy after 
a rain, and during a dry spell bakes too hard and cracks. This mix- 
ture is very dusty in dry weather and must be sprinkled frequently. 
Another surface that is recommended is a mixture of clay, loam, and 
fine cinders, placed over a subsoil of coarse cinders or gravel. The 
addition of the cinders aids in consistency and drainage. 
The park playgrounds of Chicago have had fairly good success 
by using “torpedo sand,” a fine, round gravel. This is mixed with a 
sandy clay. The torpedo sand must be renewed from time to time. 
The subsoil is first prepared by placing cinders, which are made wet 
and rolled, and on top of this is placed stone which is rolled. This 
provides good drainage, but the process is too expensive for most 
places. Other cities, Philadelphia in particular, have experimented 
extensively with the surfacing problem. The booklet “Lay Out and 
Equipment of Playgrounds”’ published by the Playground and Rec- 
reation Association gives some of the more detailed and expensive 
processes. 
The surface of gravel, and that of concrete, such as are some- 
times found, are very objectionable. The loose gravel makes an 
unsure footing, and children are tempted to throw the stones. The 
concrete is not only too hot in the summer but the jar from playing 
on it tires the legs and makes a strain on the whole nervous system. 
During the hottest parts of the summer, some cities find it neces- 
sary to treat the playground surfaces so as to hold the dust down. 
Ordinary sprinkling sometimes suffices but more often an artificial 
dressing like glutrin or calcium chloride is necessary. 
Special surfaces are needed for certain parts of the more elabo- 
rate playgrounds. The cinder track and tennis courts are examples. 
Many cinder tracks are made simply by using fine cinders with loam 
(approximately three to one). This is placed over a porous surface 
such as crushed brick, stone, etc., and then watered and tamped. 
Tennis courts need very careful construction. Clay courts are the 
best all-around practical ones. They are the most easily con-
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE PLAY CENTER 75 
structed and the upkeep of them is not great. They are very fast. 
If sloped properly, the water will not stand on them. Grass, asphalt, 
and concrete tennis courts also are found, but less frequently. Ona 
playground where there are several courts, it is advisable to have one 
or two of asphalt or concrete, as these permit tournament games to 
be played while the other courts are drying off after a rain. 
It is well to have sand or sod under the seesaws, at the end of 
the slides, and under the hanging apparatus from which little 
children are apt to fall. 
When the playground surface is used for skating in the winter 
time, a good foundation of two to four inches of ice should be built 
up before people are allowed on it. Then each night a thin layer of 
water should be put on with a hose. To insure good ice the surface 
should be swept carefully before sprinkling, and any open cracks 
filled up with snow. 
Lighting 
Playgrounds that are large enough to serve the working boys 
and girls, and the older people of the neighborhood, should be kept 
open at night, and results go to show that this period is probably the 
busiest one of the whole day. Parents bring their children with them 
and the whole family plays. The presence of older people on the 
grounds helps in the discipline. 
Much of this bustle will cease when darkness comes, but there 
are still many older people who will stay for volley ball, indoor base- 
ball, horseshoe pitching, folk dancing, and other suitable activities if 
the playground is well lighted. .The lighting of the playground is 
not an expensive proposition, and most cities now provide for it. 
The lighted playground not only increases attendance but prevents 
loitering and vandalism after dark. The objections that have been 
made to opening the play-grounds at night have centered about the 
point that gangs congregate together and become unruly. This is a 
problem of supervision. The strong director can make his influence 
felt in the way of guiding the gang spirit toward very desirable ends. 
The Equipment of the Playground 
The fully-equipped playground must provide space and appa- 
ratus for play, and play materials of all sorts. There must be ade- 
quate provisions for the comfort and welfare of the children and 
parents. The accessories necessary for the general maintenance of
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
everything pertaining to the playground must be on hand. The size 
of the ground, money available, and ages of children, and the special 
neighborhood interests, are all factors that enter in when playground 
equipment is being planned. 
In general the problem of equipment may be discussed under 
four heads: ground facilities, play apparatus, play supplies, and 
miscellaneous supplies. 4 
The chart that follows gives a comprehensive list of things that 
belong to a fully equipped playground. The subject is considered 
from the standpoint of a large playground. The smaller play- 
ground: can select the things that it needs the most and can best 
afford.

Ground Facilities 
Field House: The field house is found only on the large park playgrounds. 
Chicago has erected the most elaborate buildings of this type. Its field. houses, 
however, range so high in cost that they are beyond the means of the ordinary 
city. Fuller Park Field House cost $318,000. The Chicago type of field 
house is equipped with an assembly hall, two gymnasiums (one each for men 
and women), locker rooms and showers, toilets, four club rooms, a small res- 
taurant, a branch library, and officers for the directors. Information concern- 
ing the activities of the field house is given in later sections of this chapter. 
Shelter House: Where field houses are not found, some sort of shelter is 
necessary, not only for the rainy day activities, but to store equipment. The 
four or five acre park playground is large enough to accommodate a kind of 
clubhouse and storehouse combined. .This may be built in pavilion style: in 
the lower part the storehouse may occupy the center and the lavatories both 
ends of the building. ‘The top of this building should then be provided with 
a railing and either a canvas awning or a permanent roof. This provides a 
place to gather for stories in case of rain, and when equipped with easy chairs 
makes a comfortable resting room for either the parents or the play-tired 
children themselves. When the playground is used for any kind of community 
celebration or gathering, this building becomes a suitable speaker’s platform, or 
a place for the band to be seated. This building need not be very elaborate but 
can be inexpensively built, and janitor service can be given by one of the care- 
takers of the plot. 
Swimming Pool: The concrete type is generally found. It is well to segre- 
gate the sexes if they are both using the pool at the same time. Separate dress- 
ing accommodations must also be provided. Usually a small frame building 
that is partitioned will answer this purpose. 
Every precaution must be taken for the safety of the swimmers. It is not  
-P-A-G-E-86
  78 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
possible to be too careful. The diving platform should be at the deep end of 
the pool; and then further to safeguard the divers, the bottom of the pool 
should have a very gradual rise in the direction away from the dive. The 
swimming pool should never be open for use unless a director is there for 
immediate service. ‘The swimming director should also give instructions to 
those unable to swim and should appoint some of the best swimmers as 
assistant life guards. ‘The pool must be drained regularly and kept sanitary. 
In case the playground is on the shores of a river or lake it may be necessary 
to rope off a safety area of the water and to provide boats and additional 
guards. The guards should be assigned to different sections of the water and 
given instructions to keep the children within bounds of the protected area of 
the river or lake. 
Wading Pool: Every child likes to wade and paddle his feet in water— 
hence the wading pool. It may be any shape but is generally made circular or 
oblong. The slope should be very slight and to the center, where the depth 
should not be more than 18 to 24 inches. The pool should be built of con- 
crete, but clean sand is often placed around the edges to give a closer re- 
semblance to the beach. Sometimes a fountain effect is given by having water 
jet up in the middle of the basin. The pool must be drained frequently and 
given a good bake in the sun before being filled again. 
Play Apparatus 
Apparatus has its biggest need on the small playground where space is at 
a premium and it is desired to accommodate as many individuals as possible. 
Its appeal too, is primarily to the younger boys and girls, who are most apt 
to be frequenting the small playground. 
‘There are certain pieces of apparatus that have come to be accepted as 
standard for all playgrounds, and these should be purchased first. The follow- 
ing represents the popular preference: swings, sandbox, giant stride, horizontal 
bar, teeters, and slides. All these things hold the interest of the children, and 
have the least amount of danger connected with their use. 
The succeeding paragraphs deal with some of the more common pieces of 
apparatus. It is not necessary to go into detail as the catalogues of the well- 
known playground manufacturing companies illustrate and carefully describe 
all types of apparatus. These companies will also send plans to fit any play- 
ground and will offer expert advice in other ways. 
Swings: The standard swings are so well known as to need almost no 
comment. There is danger in their use, but not so much from falling off, as 
from children being struck while running by. To prevent this, the swinging 
area should be roped off. : 
‘The swings for the little tots should be of the cage or basket kind. In this 
type the child can be lifted into the basket, which is caged in by straps to pre- 
vent falling, and then swung by an older person. These swings are a useful 
adjunct to any playground, especially so in the tenement districts where young 
girls come to the playground with babies in their care. This arrangement 
allows the guardians to be free to play themselves. 
Sand bin: The sand bin is a box that can be made any size depending upon 
the number who are to use it. It may have a bottom, or can be a framework 
only. If the box is set flush with the ground, the sand will not dry out so 
   
-P-A-G-E-87
THE PLAY CENTER 79 
quickly. The sand should be changed quite often to keep it clean and sanitary. 
Utensils such as spades, pails, etc., are sometimes furnished. 
Giant stride: The giant stride is a kind of May-Pole built for rough usage. 
It may consist of a strong wooden pole, or a hollow pipe of five inches in dia- 
meter. This is capped with a hood fitted with ball-bearings so that the top 
may rotate about the end of the pole. To this hood are fastened several ropes 
or chains which reach down almost to the ground. ‘The child grasps one of 
these and with a stride every five feet or so whirls himself about the pole. This 
strain demands that the pole be securely planted in a base of concrete. 
Horizontal bar: The horizontal bar is used by boys. It is not only needed 
for stunts that they will try of their own accord, but is needed for the chin- 
ning event, which is found in practically all efficiency tests. 
Seesaws: Seesaws should not be too high from the ground nor describe too 
great an arc in operation. It is also well to equip them with bumpers so that 
children will not get their feet and legs crushed under them; and for the 
small children it is best to put handles on the boards so that there may be 
something to cling to. Children should be forbidden to stand on the seesaws 
or to try to operate them alone from the center piece; and they should also be 
cautioned against jumping off the one end to give the child on the other end 
of the board a sudden drop and hard bump. A recent type of seesaw has 
springs in the center which prevent the jar that is so apt to come otherwise. 
Slide: The slide of the chute variety is very popular and there is practically 
no danger connected with it. The child has a staircase to mount, and then 
there is a straight slide or a wavy slide ahead, depending upon the type of 
chute. The chute should provide a railing at the top so that the youngsters 
will not fall off or fall down the slide while they are getting seated. The gal- 
vanized finish is to be preferred. 
Other types: Of the many other pieces of apparatus that are listed the 
Merry-Go-Round is as good as any. It entertains a large number of children 
at the same time. There are many varieties, and the director should choose 
a type that is safe; also one that does not run too easily, otherwise the children 
will become seasick. 
The Flying Dutchman corsists of a horizontal plank fastened in the middle 
to a post and fitted with ball bearings so that it will revolve easily. Children 
lie or sit upon the ends of the plank, and are wheeled around by other children 
until they become sick or dizzy. It is too dangerous for general playground 
use. Children get caught between the revolving ends of the plank and cannot 
get out of the way in time. 
In general all the more special types of apparatus try to appeal to the 
natural instincts of the child want to climb, swing, jump, and suspend him- 
self. An excellent combination scheme, including twelve different types of ap- 
paratus, is known by the name of Junglegym. It is compact, safe, and allows 
chance for the children to invent stunts and games upon it. 
Play Supplies 
‘The playground does not necessarily furnish all of the supplies. This is 
especially true of tennis, where the playground rarely furnishes the balls. It is 
also true in the event that outside organized athletic teams receive permits to use 
the grounds. Although the custom is not to furnish any of the equipment for
-P-A-G-E-88
80 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
regulation baseball, the playground sometimes furnishes a mask, protector, and 
mitt for the catcher’s use. Balls should be kept inflated and sewed up as soon 
as a rip appears. They should not be allowed to lie around the playground 
when they are not being used. Nets and removable apparatus should be taken 
in at night. The medicine ball is for the use of older people. 
Miscellaneous Supplies 
A first-aid equipment is absolutely essential, and the director should know 
how to use it. As a precaution it is advisable to have on hand the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of several physicians in the vicinity. 
. Benches are provided for the comfort of the parents who want to sit and 
watch their children play. They should be shaded. Awnings are needed to 
protect the little children’s play where there are no trees to give shade. 
The marking of the courts and fields is a tedious task, but the older boys 
will often help with this. For best results the grounds should be kept well 
marked, as this adds an incentive to play, helps avoid disputes, and is a criterion 
of the efficiency of the director. 
Activities of the Playground 
The bulk of the playground programme of activities consists of the 
well-known types of organized plays, games, athletics, outdoor 
sports, and folk dances, as well as the use made of the various pieces 
of apparatus and of the swimming and wading pools. Since these 
things are classified and dealt with in other chapters, there is no need 
here to consider them in more than a general way. Playground 
activities should be chosen from the constructive standpoint of con- 
tributing to the all-around development of the individual. In doing 
this, it is necessary to make the activities that are to be used corre- 
spond with the age and sex groups. There are several different age 
groupings worked out by people of long experience in playground 
and school work which have been discussed in another chapter of 
this book; and the different interests of the two sexes are also re- 
served for later discussion. 
Regular Programme 
Although not wholly accurate as far as age and sex interests are 
concerned, the three-period division of the playground that has been 
previously described, can be used as a basis for illustrating in general 
the play activities that are most found. The section for older boys 
provides for sports like baseball, playground ball, volley ball, tennis, 
basket ball, and track and field. The section for older girls is mainly 
devoted to newcomb ball, tennis, playground ball, modified track and
-P-A-G-E-89
  
THE PLAY CENTER 81 
field, relay games, field hockey, captain ball, long ball, and folk danc- 
ing. The mixed group of younger boys and girls play Soldier Boy, 
London Bridge, Farmer in the Dell, Jolly is the Miller, and 
numerous other plays imitative and dramatic in nature, with or with- 
out singing; but tend, as they approach the age of ten to separate 
somewhat, and to play group games of simple organization like Cat 
and Mouse, Three Deep, Duck on the Rock, Dodge Ball, Pom Pom 
Pull Away, Circle Ball, Snatch Tag, and Two Old Cat, all of which 
are found in infinite varieties. Such games as croquet, handball, and 
tennis will be used not only by the older boys and girls but by adults 
who come in the evening. A swimming pool, if available, will be 
used by all groups. 
Occasional Programme 
There are many activities of play nature which are not used all 
through the day on the playground, or possibly may come only on 
occasional days. Such activities are interspersed and serve to lend 
some variety. Included in this group are story-telling, handicraft, 
nature-study, gardening, community singing, movies, band concerts, 
novelty stunts, and practice for special events that are planned. 
Along this line there is also an additional programme if the playground 
affiliates with related play movements such as the Boy Scouts, Camp 
Fire Girls, and the summer camp. 
Special Events 
These events are definitely scheduled ahead of time, with the pur- 
pose of arousing interest and bringing out a lot of participants and 
spectators. An event of this type may occur only once during a 
season, but it is the means of arousing intense interest in the par- 
ticular activity. Included in this group are field days, pageants, 
aquatic days, holiday celebrations, festivals, winter carnivals, exhibi- 
tions of work, picnics, excursions, special hikes, kite days, marble 
days, scootmobile days, block parties, and any number of others. 
Summary of Activities 
The previous material, without any attempt at a classification of 
play activity, has served to give a general idea of the ways in which 
the playground is used—also the abundance of play material the 
director has at his disposal. In the way of summary it may be well 
to quote from the application blank of the Playground and Recrea-

Clubs, Adults Gymnasium Summer Camps

Community Singing Orchestra 
Attendance 
Attendance blanks are found on all playgrounds. Statistics are 
needed to show the relative increase or decrease of playground 
interest in. a city as a whole, and in particular localities. Many 
methods of compiling statistics are followed. Most cities count 
morning, afternoon, and evening attendance separately. They keep 
the attendance of the swimming pool and field house separate from 
that of the playground; also count the sexes separately; and keep 
attendance of the various rooms of the field house separately. It is 
impossible to devise any practical method of keeping accurate attend- 
ance records; and for this reason the general custom is to make an 
approximate estimate. Some cities count the attendance at the 
busiest time of each session, and then add one half to it to obtain 
their estimate for that session. It is difficult to compare different 
cities because the methods of keeping attendance vary so widely. 
Often the attendance becomes affected by unforeseen factors like a 
long hot spell, or rainy weather, over which the director has no con- 
trol. 
Play Activities in Winter 
Until recent years, there was a a Vedlaneg to go indoors when the 
winter season came around; but of late a great boom in outdoor 
winter sports, of recreational as well as competitive nature, has taken 
place. There is an exhilaration that comes from outdoor exercise 
in winter time that cannot be equaled in any other season. Skating, 
skiing, and tobogganing are three forms of activity enjoyed by 
youngsters and older people alike. Sleigh riding, once so popular, 
is less frequently found since the automobile has become so common. 
Younger children can hardly wait for the first snow fall, in order 
that they may get out their sleds and coast down hills. Older people 
enjoy snowshoeing and will form snowshoe clubs that include other 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  
THE PLAY CENTER 83 
social festivities. Competition for the older enthusiasts can be found 
in skating and ice-boat racing, in ski-jumping, and in games like 
hockey and curling. Winter carnivals can include skating races, 
fancy skating, novelty races of obstacle and dog-cart order, and 
exhibition games. Schoolboys and girls find further enjoyment in 
snow games (battles, bombardment, dodge ball, etc.) and in the mak- 
ing of snow figures. 
In the northern localities, the playground offers a good location 
for the carrying on of the winter programme, and can be the center of 
many healthy activities. Its situation is apt to be convenient, and 
the surface is level enough so that it can be flooded for skating. This 
popular sport can then be enjoyed with safety, for there is always 
danger in skating on lakes or rivers. 
Good coasting is largely dependent upon the presence of hills 
about the city, although in communities where there are few hills or 
none, we find young folks hitching bobsleds to automobiles. Any 
type of coasting is dangerous if traffic is around, but under safe con- 
ditions, good fun is afforded. Where the city streets are used for 
coasting, the playground authorities should see that particular places 
are closed to traffic at certain times of the day; and further, that 
coasting is restricted to these places. The sport can be furnished 
little tots by making a small artificial slide on the playground itself. 
The reader who is interested in a more detailed description of 
some of the winter activities is referred to books in the bibliography 
which deal with this particular subject. 
THE SCHOOL BUILDING AS A PLAY CENTER 
The play field has been described fully because it is an institution 
of its own and is devoted solely to.a play purpose. However, play 
must also be carried on indoors. The tendency in such a case, except 
where special field houses and recreation buildings have been erected, 
is to make use of an indoor plant that is already in existence, or to 
adapt a new building so that it can be used for play. The new type 
of school is planned to take care of this new use. 
Ordinary Play Use of the School 
The school building as a play center differs from the playground 
in several respects: first, play is only a part of a wide curriculum; sec- 
ond, play is compulsory as well as voluntary; third, the play is regu-  
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
lated on a time basis, each group getting an allotted share; fourth, 
the required play lessons are definitely arranged in progression, and 
the physical fitness of each child is much more carefully looked after; 
and fifth, the individual may receive school credit for engaging in 
play in addition to the enjoyment he finds in it. 
The activities of the school programme are somewhat modified 
from the ones that have been mentioned for outdoor use. Only 
games suited for small spaces can be used. This means that calis- 
thenics and other forms of gymnastics assume more importance than 
they do outdoors. When the programme omits plays and games en- 
tirely then it is called “formalized.” Much true play is inevitable, 
however: all the activities of the kindergarten, for instance, and the 
recess games of the grade pupils, the plays and games that are found 
in the required (physical education) lessons, the athletic practice 
that takes place in the gymnasium after school, and the recreational 
activities that the older people indulge in when they come to the 
school in the evening, are of play nature. In another sense, there is 
a broader scope furnished the play spirit in the school, even though 
there are fewer plays and games that can be used; for instance, 
many of the school lessons are enjoyed, especially where the school 
curriculum is of the newer social and vocational type. 
Certain facilities are needed to conduct the indoor playground. 
Of course the kindergarten room is a playroom. Then, too, the 
class rooms and the corridors are often used for active games; and 
when there is a community project the auditorium and library may 
_ also be classed as play centers. But in the strict sense, the gym- 
nasium and the swimming pool are the centers of the play activities. 
The average school gymnasium should be at least 60 by 80 feet, and 
preferably even larger. A folding partition enables this space to be 
divided in case it is necessary to conduct boys’ and girls’ classes at the 
same time. The height of the playing space should be at least 20 
feet. The gymnasium should possess a certain amount of play ma- 
terial and equipment, as follows: 
Light Apparatus—Dumb bells, Indian clubs, wands. (Number will depend 
on size of class. Dumb bells one pound each. Indian clubs one and one- 
half pounds. ) ; 
Heavy Apparatus—Parallel bars, horizontal bars, horse, buck, ladders, ropes, 
traveling rings. (All attached apparatus should be removable.) 
Game Material—Basket ball, volley ball, indoor baseball, medicine ball, box- 
ing gloves. Courts, should be marked off for basket ball, volley ball, in- 
door baseball, and handball.  
-P-A-G-E-93
THE PLAY CENTER 85 
Athletics—Jumping standards, vaulting pole, starting rack, shot (leather 
covered). # 
Additional Material—Balance beams, spring board, take-off board, rubber mat 
for jumping, 4 mats 5 feet by 10 feet by 2 inches thick, 6 mats 5 feet by 
5 feet by 2 inches thick. Platform for instructor, weighing scales with 
measuring rods, first-aid outfit. 
Certain authorities have set a standard of one gymnasium of the 
above size for a school containing 600 pupils or less. There are 
many plans for the location of the gymnasium. The best place is 
toward the rear of the building and above the level of the ground. 
This gives good light and ventilation and easy access to the play- 
ground; also makes less noise as far as the classrooms are concerned, 
and allows the basement to be utilized for dressing rooms. The gym- 
nasium should be supplemented by shower baths and dressing rooms 
with lockers. The construction of the gymnasium and its accessory 
facilities is an engineering problem. However, there is much ma- 
terial on this particular subject that is easily available. The reader 
who desires to make a technical study of gymnasium construction is 
referred to a number of excellent articles in the reference list at the 
close of the chapter, also to the manuals issued on request by such 
companies as the Narragansett Machine Company and Medart 
Manufacturing Company. 
The indoor swimming pool is usually smaller than the one found 
on the playground. The average size is 24 by 60 feet, with the 
depth averaging 3 feet 6 inches to 8 feet. The water in the swim- 
ming pool must be kept hygienic by approved methods. The pool 
should never be left in use without an attendant in charge. 
Wider Play Use of the School: The Community Center 
In recent years there has been a marked tendency towards open- 
ing the school in the evening for general community use. This new 
movement reverts back in spirit to the old New England town 
gathering; and, coming closer to the present day, to the gathering at 
the old rural school house.. The present idea is to revive the neigh- 
borhood spirit, which because of diverging interests and ease of 
communication has almost entirely disappeared, and also to bring 
about community betterment in every way possible. It has long been 
felt by educational and social workers that the school’s sphere of in- 
fluence should extend beyond that of teaching children—that adults  
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
need to be reached as well. New York, as early as 1888 permitted 
the use of the school for public lectures, and afterwards extended 
this privilege to cover evening recreation. The real awakening, how- 
ever, came in 1907, when the city of Rochester, New York, gave 
an appropriation of $5,000 to its Board of Education to carry on 
social extension work. At the same time, it chose a supervisor, 
E. J. Ward, to promote this new work. It was his decision to depart 
from the field house idea which Chicago had made~so popular at 
this time, and instead to convert the school building into a commu- 
nity building, not only for social and recreational purposes, but for 
civic as well, that started the movement for the school social center. 
Mr. Ward explains his conception of the social center idea as 
follows: 
“The social center was not to take the place of any existing 
institution; it was not to be a charitable medium for the service par- 
ticularly of the poor; it was not to be a new kind of evening school; 
it was not to take the place of any church or other institution of 
moral uplift; it was not to serve simply as an ‘improvement associa- 
tion’ by which the people of one community should seek only the 
welfare of their district; it was not to be a ‘civic reform’ organiza- 
tion, pledged to some change in city, or state, or national administra- 
tion; it was just to be the restoration to its true place in social life 
of that most American of all institutions, the Public School Center, in 
order that through this extended use of the school building, might be 
developed, in the midst of our complex life, the community interest, 
the neighborly spirit, the democracy that we knew before we came 
to the city.” 
Other cities focused their attention on the experiment of 
Rochester, and the idea of the economy of using buildings already 
available, rather than providing expensive “‘field houses,” found a 
strong appeal. Other cities, particularly Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, 
followed suit, and New York City elaborated on its original plan. 
The ‘‘social center” idea was even carried to England, through the 
influence-of Mrs. Humphry Ward. The N. E. A. in rg11 ap- 
proved this new use of the school. A number of cities, outstanding 
among them the city of Gary, Indiana, planned their new school 
houses so that they combined playground and field house facilities 
together with those of the school house in its old sense. The new 
changes meant a new type of school architecture, giving prominence 
to the auditorium, gymnasium, and swimming pool, and including 
sound-proof walls and floors, movable seats, and spacious corridors.
-P-A-G-E-95
THE PLAY CENTER 87 
The rapid spread of the movement was still further increased during 
the World War when the school became the center for many cam- 
paigns and other needed activities. The Community Service organi- 
zation helped to carry this spirit of service and comradeship over into 
peace time. 
The increased use of the school building has tended to give 
Boards of Education a closer insight and sympathy as regards play; 
for, being responsible for its promotion, they began to study its re- 
lation to the educational and social needs of modern life. One result 
has been to include many activities in the school curriculum that 
formerly were considered as belonging to the province of the play- 
ground only; for instance, story-telling, manual arts, music, dramat- 
ics, gardening, and plays and games. This new attitude on the part 
of the school authorities has had its influence on the teachers, many 
of whom now take a training in play at the normal schools and uni- 
versities. Finally, the result has been to bring about a new public 
sentiment towards the school and towards play. The boys and girls 
like to go to school as never before, and their parents catch the en- 
thusiasm that they bring home with them. The average citizen to- 
day is proud of the new school buildings that he has helped to build 
through his vote, and his pride in them is largely due to the sense 
of sharing in the activities. The school plant, under these circum- 
stances, becomes the dwelling place for a large community family. 
Activities of the Community Center 
The community center brings the people of the neighborhood to- 
gether by means of successfully promoted activities.” These activi- 
ties must satisfy the interests of boys and girls, young men and 
women, and adults. Furthermore, in addition to being recreational 
in nature, they should have educational and cultural value. The 
range of activities is necessarily wide, for all individuals will not 
be attracted by the same thing. Some will come for the chance for 
fellowship ; others will come’to enjoy alone some favored occupation. 
Many classifications have been made of the great round of acti- 
vities which is carried on in the community center. For the general 
purpose of acquainting the reader with the material, a division into 
the four departments of recreational, social, educational, and civic, 
answers the purpose. 
The recreational group consists of the active physical exercises 
and games that are found in the gymnasium, such as individual prac- 
tice on apparatus, calisthenics, gymnastic competitions, games like
-P-A-G-E-96
88 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
volley ball, indoor baseball, basket ball, and handball, and folk danc- 
ing; of swimming, which is always popular; of bowling, if alleys 
are available; of games of skill, like pool and billiards; and of 
mental contest games, like checkers, dominoes, chess, and cards— 
the so-called “Quiet room” activities. A prejudice often exists 
against games like bowling, billiards, and pool because of the sur- 
roundings that they are so often associated with; but these amuse- 
ments in themselves are very scientific and fascinating and can be 
made a wholesome influence when properly conducted. 
The social group includes so many things that it is easy to see 
why the school has become so widely termed a- “social center.” 
Everything that partakes of the nature of comradeship and. hospi- 
tality is assigned to this group. The social activities overlap the 
other divisions because they may have value of recreational, educa- 
tional, and civic nature as well as purely social. The following list 
gives an idea of the more popular social features: dancing, motion 
pictures, ‘‘mixer” games, socials, banquets, boys’ and girls’ clubs, 
adults’ clubs, community singing, costume parties, spelling bees, and 
stunt nights. 
Great care must be exercised in promoting social dancing. In 
some communities there is hostility to dancing of any sort, and this 
must be gradually overcome; when social dances are held, they should 
be under the auspices of some particular group or unit that is 
affiliated with the social center, rather than to allow general public 
admission. Careful chaperonage is also of prime importance, and it 
is a good thing to have the fathers and mothers of the young people 
present whenever possible. The success of game-evenings is largely 
dependent upon a capable leader who can through the force of his 
own personality make the people forget the self-consciousness that 
is apt to possess them at first. The group singing is a good thing to 
start off the programme, for it arouses a friendly spirit. In the case of 
the moving picture shows, also, an exceptionally high standard 
should be maintained, only the very best Educational, Scenic, His- 
torical, Dramatic, and Comedy films being selected. The movies 
are the most popular form of entertainment in the United States 
at the present time, and when utilized as they should be, have a great 
educational, as well as recreational significance. 
The educational group also overlaps in the sense that it is 
possible for its activities to be recreational and social at the same 
time. Advantages of this nature are given in the way of lectures, 
branch libraries, reading rooms, exhibits (art, museum, welfare), 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE PLAY CENTER 89 
dramatics, music (vocal and instrumental), debating, festivals, 
pageants, story-telling, handicraft, clinics, and information bureaus. 
These activities furnish the chance for many to develop their 
skill, and, in addition, the talent thus developed gives the opportunity 
to put on exhibitions that will attract a large audience. Dramatics 
and music particularly possess this double value. In the strictly edu- 
cational sense, classes can be offered in mechanical drawing, English, 
history, manual training, domestic arts, millinery, art work, etc. In 
choosing lectures it is well to have a prominent speaker occa- 
sionally, but this is not necessary. Local business and professional 
men can be called upon to talk on their own particular type of work, 
and this proves instructive as well as interesting. Girls appreciate 
instruction in etiquette and how to act the hostess. Music and 
dramatics have come to serve an important place in the play pro- 
gramme. Interest can be helped along by giving frequent short enter- 
tainments, and finally combining the best talent into an annual affair. 
Another good plan that some cities use is to follow the exchange 
idea, having the trained groups of one center visit other centers. 
The last group, the civic activities, includes Americanization 
classes for foreigners, the public forum, patriotic exercises, lectures 
on current events, parent-teacher associations, neighborhood service 
associations, civic improvement societies, campaigns of welfare 
nature, Red Cross, etc. 
Division According to Group Interests 
The groups that attend the community center can be roughly divided under 
the heads of parents, young men and women, and younger boys and girls. 
This answers well in a practical way. The following outline shows how the 
different activities appeal to the several groups: 
All Groups: Public Affairs, Entertainments, Socials, Parties, Lectures, Ex- 
hibits, Musicales and Motion Pictures. Parents and Older People: Parent- 
Teacher organizations, Parents Council, Mothers Clubs, Civic Clubs, Read- 
ing Circles, “Mixer’’ Games (occasionally), Games of skill (Men), Clinics, 
and Welfare Leagues. Young People (Mixed): Socials, Parties, Dances. 
Choral Societies, Dramatics, and Literary Circles. Young Men (And in 
some cases older men too) : Civic Clubs, Debating, Current Events, Glee Clubs 
or other Musical Organizations, Games, Gymnastics, Swimming, Athletic 
Clubs, Social and Pleasure Clubs, Dramatics, Minstrels. Young Women: 
Recreation Classes (Gymnastics, Folk Dancing, Basket Ball, Swimming), 
Social Clubs, Sewing Circles, Choral Work, Reading Clubs, Dramatics. 
Younger Girls Clubs: Many of the activities mentioned for Young Women, 
only changed so as to be better adapted to the younger age; Camp Fire Girls 
of America, Girl Scouts, Audubon Societies, Quiet Games. Boys Clubs: Boy 
Scouts, Dramatics, Athletics, Choral Work, Handicraft, and Games of all

types. (Adults should have first privilege of all recreation facilities in the 
evening. ) 
Location of Activities 
The whole building can be utilized for certain occasions like exhibits and 
carnivals. Of the separate rooms, the auditorium, gymnasium, and kinder- 
garten have the most varied use: the first named because size and seating 
facilities make it fitted for lectures and all sorts of exhibitions and entertain- 
ments where the general public is invited; and the other two because of the 
fact that they are fairly large and also can have their space cleared or filled 
with chairs according to the nature of the occasion. This adaptability makes 
the gymnasium or kindergarten serve for active games or dances at one time, 
and for lectures, club meetings, and social mixers at another time. ‘The class 
rooms are generally reserved for meetings of special groups of limited size, 
like parent-teacher associations, reading circles, boys’ and girls’ club organiza- 
tions, educational classes, etc. 
The corridors also are brought into use frequently, for dances, exhibits, in- 
formation bureaus, and active games. The library serves as a reading room, as 
a place to obtain books, and often for exhibits and general information. The 
dispensary is used for clinics, health demonstrations, and first-aid classes. The 
lunch room, manual training room, domestic science room, and swimming pool 
are each limited to its special field of usefulness. 
Efficiency Needed in Administration 
In its actual working out the community center (often dalled 
“social center” or “neighborhood center”) has fallen behind the 
playground in efficiency. The early experience of the playground, 
proving the need of effective leadership and organization, is being 
repeated in the community center. Because of the varied nature 
of the activities involved, and of the wide variance in ages, interests, 
and stations of the people attending, a big problem is presented. 
The problem of the choice and extent of leadership for the com- 
munity center has not been properly worked out. It cannot be ex- 
pected, as was once thought, that numerous neighborhood units can 
be entrusted with the control of the school building and run the 
programme themselves. A central authority is needed, to organize 
and expand the group activities, to unify the various groups and their 
activities, and to bear the responsibility for the care of the school 
equipment. The tendency has been to put the principal of the build- 
ing in charge of the evening work, but this official has not always 
given the needed enthusiasm to it. Besides, few principals have 
made themselves fully acquainted with the movement; and their 
attitude has inclined to be the passive one of simply permitting the 
building to be used for neighborhood gatherings, and seeing that the
-P-A-G-E-99
  
THE PLAY CENTER 91 
school property is not damaged. The spirit of the aggressive recrea- 
tion or social worker is needed; the type of spirit that actively 
promotes and keeps enthusiasm in the groups that already have 
leaders, that finds leaders for groups that have none, that organizes 
groups where there are none, and that finally welds these various 
groups and their activities into a larger community organization. 
When the control of the school building is turned over to other 
than school authorities in the evening, misunderstandings are apt to 
arise over the question of discipline and care of school property. 
Much of the disfavor which certain school officials display toward 
the new use of their buildings is centered about this one point. The 
recreation authorities have frequently depended on volunteer help to 
run the programme, or have hired inferior helpers who have shirked 
the responsibilities and been late or absent entirely, thus leaving 
groups to take possession of the school without a directing influence 
over them. Complaints quickly arise when such a condition comes 
about, and the movement, most worthy in itself, suffers. 
Another thing that brings the movement into disfavor is the use 
of the gymnasium by teams of professional nature, who charge ad- 
mission for their games. The idea of general participation should 
be fostered rather than that of spectacular displays by a few. Still 
another danger arises when the use of the auditorium or club rooms 
is granted to radical societies or for partisan discussions of poli- 
tics or religion. Rochester, the city that started the social center 
idea so auspiciously, found to its sorrow that free speech could not 
be permitted to any great extent. 
The community center must face the problem of providing 
capable instructors and supervisors. The people who teach all 
through the day cannot give their best work when serving con. 
tinuously at night also. There is not so much difficulty in the way 
of night school educational classes, for here the instruction is more 
or less individual, or at least no group spirit needs to be aroused. 
But in the recreational and social work the leader must kindle an 
enthusiasm which will pervade the group as a group. 
The problem of teachers for the evening community center can 
best be solved by having a schedule that will allow a staff to go on 
duty in the afternoon and carry over into the evening. This plan is 
followed in many playground systems where the grounds are opened 
at night. A small number of the instructors will work in the morn- 
ing and afternoon, while others will start their shift in the afternoon 
and come back in the evening. In the case of the school, some of the
-P-A-G-E-100
92 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
play leaders could serve inthe same manner, directing the after-school 
play leagues, and supervising the social programme in the evening. In 
such a case it would be well to have the day time school principal or 
assistant principal supervise night school classes of strictly educa- 
tional nature, but the play leader could act as assistant night princi- 
pal and handle the remainder of the programme. He could find 
additional help for special work like music, dramatics, debating, etc., 
by an arrangement with the respective day school teachers, who then, 
however, should be relieved of some of their other work. Besides 
teachers, there will be neéded an efficient janitor service, and con- 
siderable volunteer help in the way of chaperones for dances, and 
group leaders for parties, discussions, etc. The play leader can 
head up the work of all these other helpers. The important thing 
to be emphasized is that the school cannot convert itself into a great 
play center also unless the original facilities are greatly expanded, 
and this necessarily means a greater outlay of money. If the com- 
munity center project cannot be done right, it should not be tried at 
all. The whole idea is no better than its actual results in practice. 
School House vs. Field House 
The equipment of both these places as play centers has already 
been shown. Both have had practically the same purpose in mind; 
namely, to provide opportunity for indoor activity, both for young 
and old, to serve the whole community, both day and night, and to 
provide a continuous scheme of activities that will operate both 
winter and summer. There are some differences between these two 
institutions, however, when both are in full operation. The school 
house is busy from early morning to its close at night, while the eld 
house provides for out-of-school play, and therefore is busiest in the 
late afternoon, in the evening, and on Saturdays. The field house 
has nothing compulsory, while most of the day programme of the 
school is of that nature. In the way of activities the field house places 
primary importance on recreational activities, while the school 
similarly features the educational. In their use as a play center both 
emphasize social and civic activities approximately to the same 
extent. The field house has had better administration and better 
workers for its evening programme than the school evening center. 
No objection can be made to the field house as a play center 
other than that of cost. However, all cities have not been able to 
get the magnanimous response that Chicago, for instance, has had in 
the way of backing forits play programme. The general opinion over 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
THE PLAY CENTER 93 
the country has swayed to the idea of avoiding. duplication in ex- 
pense, and therefore favors planning the school structure so that it 
can take care of the double use, all the more so since the school 
building is already open in the evening for night school classes. The 
fact that the school building is apt to be centrally located is another 
point in its favor. 
Conclusion: The Complete Play Center in Operation 
The programmes of the playground and community play building, 
when combined together, make an attractive offering. There is no 
better way of explaining the working of a programme that is planned 
in this way, than to refer to one that is already in existence and which 
is as elaborate and well conducted as any that can be found. This 
is the schedule of activities of the splendid South Park playgrounds 
of Chicago. Here the playground and field house are the two types 
of play center that are present together, and which combine to func- 
tion as one. This programme is taken from the Annual Playground 
Report of 1921.

Such a programme as has just been shown is useful not only in showing 
how the outdoor and indoor work can be correlated, but also in giv- 
ing an idea of the immense choice there is in the way of furnishing 
activities; further, the adaptation to seasonal use offers practical help 
to the playground worker.

CHAPTER V 
BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 
Almost within the last decade there has sprung up a number of 
organizations devoted exclusively to the welfare of our younger boys 
and girls, such as the Boy Scouts, Junior Y. M. C. A., Woodcraft 
Boys, Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, Junior Y. W. C. A., Junior Red 
Cross, Garden Associations, and Audubon Societies. The work of 
these organizations is brought to our attention constantly and in 
almost every conceivable way. It is well for the purpose of our 
study that the Boy Scout movement be chosen as representative of all 
the boys’ movements that have been mentioned. Ir the first place, 
the Scout movement is the largest; it is-also universal, making no 
limitation because of race or creed; and again the range of activities 
is as complete as any. Therefore, the Scout movement will be ex- 
plained in detail. While the Boy Scouts lead far in advance of all 
the boys’ movements as regards size and prestige, the same situation 
is not found when we look at the organizations dealing with girls. 
Here there are two competing organizations that rival each other 
in membership and attainment, The Camp Fire Girls and the Girl 
Scouts, so that each will need to be considered. 
BOY SCOUTS 
The Nature of the Boy Scout Movement _ 
The Boy Scout movement is primarily an educational one. The 
title of this chapter, listing the Boy Scout movement as a play move- 
ment, may be the occasion for surprise, for the activities cover many 
things we are accustomed to speak of as work; and ‘Play’ and 
“Health,” listed as such, occupy only a small portion of the contents 
of the Scouting Handbook—the Scout’s curriculum. The point, 
however, is this: Scoutcraft presents everything—whether it be 
camping, photography, or civics—in a manner that makes it play to 
the normal boy. Such things as the Boy Scout games, camping, 
handicraft, and other activities are in themselves the highest type 
98
-P-A-G-E-107
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 99 
-of spontaneous play; and other subjects like first aid, cooking, star 
study, tree study, and timber judging, which easily may suggest the 
abstract work of the school room, are transformed to the play group 
through the offering of rewards, simple in cost and design, yet dear 
to the heart of every boy and calling forth the spirit of emulation. 
The methods of teaching, too, tend to make the process of instruc- 
tion a playful one. The Boy Scout movement may therefore be 
‘included in the study of Play. 
The Boy Scout Movement is Democratic 
One of the most praiseworthy things about the Scouting move- 
ment is that it recognizes no class, race, or creed. It has been called 
“the great melting pot of American youth.” It aims to “make real 
boys into real men” and it cares not whether the boy be the son 
of an influential capitalist, of the corner grocer, or of the immigrant 
family in the slums. Neither does being a Protestant, Catholic, Jew, 
or Mohammedan discriminate against one’s chances. However, in 
spite of the fact that the movement is non-sectarian, and does not 
attempt to preach any formal religious principle, still the ideals it 
inculcates are in keeping with the highest type of Christian living. 
In fact, while not actually professing to teach a religious spirit it 
really does so in the most effective way, for the Boy Scout not only 
learns what are the right things to do but he also practices them. 
The Scout method is a positive one; it does not say, “Don’t” but 
it does say ‘“This is the thing to do.” The scout is trusted on his 
honor, and his word is sufficient to show that he has lived in a manner 
worthy of merit. 
The Scouting education is still more representative in that it is 
adapted to any locality. The country boy can be a member; so can 
the boy of the city; the American boy can be a member; so can the 
boy of France or Italy. The international character of thé Boy 
Scouts was shown by the Jamboree held at London in the summer 
of 1920, at which representatives of fifty-two nations were in 
_attendance. This was a picturesque assembly with each group 
presenting distinctive displays, and with individual and troop con- 
tests of all kinds, in such varied things as tug-of-war, obstacle races, 
bugling and band competitions, construction models, stamp collec- 
tions, arts and crafts exhibits, and games and contests of all kinds. 
Each boy left with a feeling of good will for the boys of other lands 
and nations. 
The Scout movement lives up to its programme of democracy by

charging only a nominal fee for membership. Then, too, there is 
a distinctive garb to symbolize this great brotherhood of boys. This 
official uniform is made up of khaki material, which though inex- 
pensive looks well, is comfortable, and is unusually strong in its 
wearing qualities. It is not necessary for a boy to be thus garbed in 
order to belong to the Scouts, but he is usually eager to wear a uni- 
form the moment he is entitled to do so and the leaders encourage 
him to earn the money for it. If the uniform is democratic, the 
badges and insignias are just as much so. These are simple and in- 
expensive. They remain the property of the organization so that any 
tendency to transfer the emblems may be discouraged, and so that 
they may be subject to recall if the Scout forfeits his privileges. The 
drill, too, is democratic in that all types of boys are assembled to 
act in unison; this offsets the natural inclination there is at other 
times to separate into small groups or cliques. 
History of the Boy Scout Movement 
This movement, officially known as the Boy Scouts of America, 
has had a phenomenal growth. Though initiated as recently as 
1910 it has grown to embrace a membership of over half a million 
registered scouts and officials. Scouting was not unknown, however, — 
previous to its founding in our country. 
To Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the English General and hero of 
the Boer War, must be given the credit for the original idea. He 
first experimented with material and scouting and camping nature as 
early as 1893 with the aim in mind of making the work of the 
soldiers in time of peace more interesting and practical. Later, this 
training was extended to include character formation. His lectures 
and practices were published in a small book ‘‘Aids to Scouting.” 
This training was carried on successfully with soldiers; with the 
boys of Mafeking in 1899-1900 during the South African war; and 
later with the South African Mounted Police. On his return to 
England, Baden-Powell found that the manual “Aids to Scouting” 
had been used by several private schools as a step to character train- 
ing. This led him to consider the scouting idea as a training for 
boys apart from the military life, and so he experimented with 
groups of boys and in 1908 published the English handbook en- 
titled “Scouting for Boys.” Shortly afterwards he resigned from 
the army to head up the new movement. By 1910 there were 
125,000 scouts in England alone and organized troops were also 
to be found in the colonies, and in Germany and France.

  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS Ior 
In shaping the character of the movement, Baden-Powell was 
influenced by his close personal knowledge of boys and by his notion 
of what was lacking in the training of the average school boy. He 
knew that boys in their teens were adventuresome, and held as their 
heroes the knights, pioneers, Indians, and explorers. The word 
“Scouts” seemed the best to convey the nature of Baden-Powell’s 
new scheme. Character training, practical intelligence, manual skill, 
physical development, health habits, and a spirit of service for others 
and for the state were the things he thought necessary to incorporate 
into the training, in order to remedy the deficiencies of the schools 
and of the existing boys’ clubs and Bible classes. The troop was 
kept small in number so that the Scoutmaster could give very close 
personal attention to each boy. 
The following incident explains the immediate cause of the 
introduction of Scouting into America. In the fall of 1909, William 
D. Boyce, a Chicago publisher, was on a business trip in London. 
Confused by the typical English foggy weather, he asked a small 
boy to direct him to his place of business. The boy was so courteous, 
and so helpful, that Mr. Boyce wished to tip him liberally, but the 
boy refused the offered remuneration. This led to a questioning by 
Mr. Boyce and the securing of the information that the lad was a 
Boy Scout, who was but doing the daily good turn that was expected 
of him. The American was so enthused by the spirit of service in- 
culcated in this boy that he made a visit to the Scout Headquarters 
and came back to the United States loaded with Scout literature and 
with the determination that such a movement was well worth having 
in this country. Through his energy, a number of public-spirited 
citizens were interested in helping to organize the Boy Scouts of 
America, which on February 8th, 1910, was incorporated under the 
laws of the District of Columbia. 
Thus was started the first American Boy Scout troop. The 
movement grew rapidly, absorbing other boys’ organizations that 
were getting under way, and taking on distinctive American features, 
such as the plan of national registration of each Scout. Much credit 
must be given to Mr. Ernest Thompson-Seton and to Mr. Daniel 
Carter Beard—both of themi well known to boys and girls for their 
writings on nature and on handicrafts—for the efforts they con- 
tributed toward making the Boy Scouts a success in every way. 
On June 15th, 1916, the movement had become so well estab- 
lished as an American institution, its accomplishments so well 
known, and its future growth so certain, that the United States
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Congress granted a federal charter to the Boy Scouts of 
America. é 
To-day, the Scouting programme has been adopted by fifty-seven 
countries.representing an aggregate population of nine-tenths of the 
population of the world. More than three million Scouts are en- 
rolled in patrols. 
The Scout movement has been accused of being militaristic. 
It is the opposite of this. The founder, Sir Robert Baden-Powell, 
placed special emphasis on the phrase “‘peace scouting’? and dis- 
couraged military drill. In America the movement is neither mili- 
tary nor anti-military. The uniform, the patrol, the troop, and the 
drill are not so much for military tactics, as to inculcate the habits 
of unity, discipline, and patriotism. The motto “Be Prepared” does 
not mean preparedness for war, but rather preparedness for peace- 
time pursuits—business, service, health, and happiness. On the 
other hand, with the military spirit entirely lacking, the Scouts do 
learn self-reliance and ability to take care of themselves in the open, 
things that are of immense practical value if one is called upon to be 
a soldier. As for instilling patriotism, practically every well-known 
man in American public life has given endorsement to the move- 
ment. ‘‘A monument of genuine red-blooded Americanism” it has 
been called. 
Its Purpose 
The Boy Scout movement aims to supplement the work of our 
schools, by giving a training in the practical needs of life, and teach- 
ing the moral virtues through example rather than precept. The 
whole training is planned for the adolescent age—an age when every 
boy is imbued with a strong spirit of adventure and coupled with it 
a strong sense of honor, a strong feeling of faith and trust, and an 
impulse to be of service. This is the Sir Galahad, Sir Launcelot, 
and Sir Philip Spencer period of his life. A survey of the Scout 
law and mottoes, given later, will show how the Scout is trained in 
matters of honor, courage, trustworthiness, and chivalry. In order 
to make the boy sturdy, self-reliant, handy, and practical, the Scout 
lessons delve into such matters as first-aid, swimming and life-sav- 
ing, cooking, keeping one’s direction in the forest, making shelters, 
carpentry, etc. The Scout is a handy man around the house and 
elsewhere. Another fine thing that the Scout learns is to be ob- 
servant. This in turn makes for interest. Along this line Franklin 
K. Lane says: “All progress is based on curiosity. Only to the in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 103 
quiring mind does enlightenment come, and there can be no such 
thing as an education which is regardless of those things that im- 
mediately surround us—the earth, the vegetables, the flowers, the 
trees, the rocks, the birds, the streams, the animals, the skies, and 
those machines through which the forces of nature work. I am 
conscious every day of the defects in my early education, for I 
should have been taught, first of all, not technical botany, but the 
nature of plants, the difference between plants, and the nature of the 
layers of the earth, and the difference between them, and all those 
other things that would make a walk or a drive a constant panorama 
of delight. As it is, | have walked through the world almost blind- 
folded. Your programme is to give new eyes to boys and girls, and 
men and women.” The writer can remember from his own ex- 
perience, that even though a good share of his boyhood days was 
spent in the woods, he missed a great many of the things a Boy 
Scout appreciates. The environment was present, but not the direct- 
ing teacher. He was like the boy on the undirected playground. 
The boy has interests and they are expressed spontaneously; but 
teaching is needed to give a wide range to these interests, and make 
them educational as well as interesting. The writer missed these 
opportunities, and a great deal of the enjoyment that is offered in 
everyday life was lost. Part of this was regained, later, when he be- 
came acquainted with Nature once more through spending summers 
in camps with boys. This time he noticed the many things. A bird 
would soar over and he would watch its flight. He now knew the 
bird and its many ways. He would pass a tree and its leaves would 
tell him that it was a scarlet oak. 
This is one inestimable value of Scouting: it gives the boy a last- 
ing interest in the things that will always surround his daily life. It 
applies to the city as well as to the country life. The Scout rushes to 
the scene of an accident, not from morbid curiosity, but because he 
knows that he is prepared to help. He watches the telephone gang 
raise a pole, and he is interested because he knows the knots and the 
lashings that are being used. A boy will observe when he is inter- 
ested, and it is the purpose of Scouting to secure the greatest possible 
interest that can be aroused out of each and every activity. Observa- 
tion aroused, the youngster will reason things out for himself.

Methods in Scouting 
Value in Educational Training 
The miraculous growth of these movements, of which Scouting 
is a representative, stands out as a justified rebuke to our present- 
day educational systems and their methods. President Eliot says, 
“The Boy Scout movement is setting an example that our whole 
public school system ought to follow.’ As regards methods, the 
schools are handicapped, because they cannot employ the honors and 
awards which attend each advance in Scouting education, but they 
can strive to arouse the interest of the child rather than to cram 
his mental system with undigested facts. The laboratory method is 
the best. Let the child do that he may reason. 
The Scout Instruction uses playful competition, dramatization, 
and experiment to make its subject attractive. The Scout learns 
tracking by means’of a treasure hunt; first aid and transportation of 
the injured, by means of an accident that is staged; cooking, crafts- 
manship, and the like by trial. These methods give him an interest 
in the subject, out of which develop willingness to observe, to listen 
to lectures, and to do research reading, all of which so often fail if 
tried in the beginning. In the larger sense our schools have neg- 
lected practical training and moral training. That is why the play 
movement, including the many agencies that we are discussing in this 
chapter, has become the leading educational tendency of modern 
times. It connects the lessons of the classroom with the actual re- 
lationships of life as found in practice. The school people have 
lamented whenever a student has been sent forth deficient in 
Algebra, or Latin; yet have bid a hearty God-speed to each graduate 
who has gone forth with high scholastic marks, but without the 
faintest idea of some of the simplest rules of hygiene, or what to do 
in an emergency. The schools have long held to the idea that the 
old classical curriculum is the “tree of all knowledge” instead of 
being just one of the branches. The acceptance of the idea that the 
classical subjects furnish intellectual power that can be transferred 
to every walk of life has long been responsible for the exclusion of 
every other type of training until such a time as the boy’s school days 
were over. We might just as well give him all the history, theory, 
styles, and rules of swimming and then tell him that he is now a 
graduate swimmer. The two processes should accompany each 
other: the concrete and the abstract. Then, our boy graduate will
-P-A-G-E-113
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 105 
be given the right “start off” in life; mental power, knowledge of 
health, understanding of men, a play spirit, and a feeling for what 
is right in conduct, will all be his: none of these will be lacking to 
set him behind with a handicap. 
In view of these things, it is an important and a gratifying thing 
that our schools everywhere are creating new opportunities for 
the boy and girl. The child is being given a chance to grow physi- 
cally, mentally, and morally; and through his physical activity, which 
is being encouraged instead of denied, he is allowed to explore a 
wide range of pre-vocational subjects wherein he may find the call- 
ing that nature adapted him for; and, in addition, he is being given 
a chance to find play interests in the everyday surroundings that will 
be of recreational value to him throughout life. For this reason, 
Scouting should be fostered by the schools as an extra-school activity, 
just as are the athletic teams, musical clubs, and debating societies, 
now recognized as valuable social agencies. One of the outstanding 
features of the National Education meeting held in Cleveland in 
1920 was the recognition of the educational value of out-of-school 
organizations, such as the Boy Scouts. The Boards of Education in 
the cities of Toledo, Chicago, and Detroit, have indorsed Scouting 
as an educational institution. Hartford, Connecticut, and Portland, 
Oregon, have also done this. Some schools, particularly Austin, 
Texas, already grant a limited amount of credit for work done in 
Scouting. Certainly the schools should furnish the leaders for this 
movement. Teachers can be encouraged by extra remuneration to 
devote time as Scoutmasters, in the same way that many academic 
teachers also act as athletic coaches. It is the administrative official 
of far-seeing vision who is linking up the Boy Scout work, etc., with 
his educational system as a whole, and who is thus making the 
schools serve the community in one more capacity. 
The Curriculum 
Scouting education consists of both required subjects and elec- 
tives. In general there are six honors that may be attained. These 
are explained later. The requirements for the first three of these 
correspond somewhat to those of the elementary part of our public 
school system, in that the work is fundamental, broad in nature, 
and is required of everyone. The last three degrees, although re- 
quiring a certain amount of advanced work, also allow a wide lati- 
tude of elective choice. This shows a similarity to the courses of 
our public high schools.
-P-A-G-E-114
106 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The boy first becomes a Tenderfoot, then a Second Class Scout, 
then a First Class Scout. The work is so varied and interesting that 
it holds the boy fascinated in the midst of an environment that will 
conduce to character development, especially of a self-reliant and 
generous type. The boy who earns the right to be decorated with 
the First Class Badge has further learned many more practical things 
—of help to himself and others—than the average boy can hope to 
know. 
The curriculum begins with the threefold aim of ideals and 
character, citizenship, and practicality in mind. Below are listed the 
studies that must be mastered by the boy who wishes to become a 
First Class Scout. They are listed in the order in which they appear 
in the Boy Scout Manual which is the textbook of the course. 
1. Woodcraft: Includes pathfinding, use of the compass, meas- 
uring heights and distances, a study of the stars, birds, reptiles, in- 
sects, fishes, rocks, plants, shrubs, trees, etc. 
2. Wild Life and Conservation: Wild animals, economic value 
of trees, birds, minerals, fuels, etc., precautions against loss by forest 
fires and harmful insects; forest and game laws; etc. 
3. Campcraft: Use of knife and hatchet, fire building, cooking, 
hiking (day and over-night), tent making, rafts, canoeing, rowing, 
and sailing. 
4. Signs, Symbols, and Signaling: Trail marks; smoke, gun, 
whistle, and gesture signals; semaphore and general service codes; 
wireless telegraphy. 
5. Health and Endurance: Physical examinations; physical 
activity; personal hygiene. 
6. Chivalry: The application of the knightly virtues to the life 
of to-day; proper manners; cheerfulness; service; moral strength; 
sportsmanship; religion. 
7. Prevention of Accidents, First Aid, and Life Saving’ Pre- 
cautions against accidents of all kinds; what to do in fires and panics; 
lifts and carries for transportation of the wounded; swimming; life- 
saving in the water; emergency treatments; bandaging; etc. 
8. Games: General games for all occasions: i.e., indoor and 
outdoor, active and quiet; scout games; camp games; games useful 
for entertainment purposes; water games; etc.
-P-A-G-E-115
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 107 
9. Patriotism and Citizenship: History of our country; national 
and local government; significance of the flag; practical duties of 
citizenship. 
10. Drill: Single rank drill; double rank drill for advanced 
troops; salute to the flag; proper dress uniform. (This is not in- 
cluded in the Boy Scouts’ Manual but is an important part of the 
Boy Scouts’ training. ) 
Merit Badge Work 
The merit badge work is open to First Class Scouts. This new 
field covers a wide range of subjects, sixty in number. These are 
the electives of Scouting. They furnish the chance for specialized 
study in practically all the different accomplishments and vocations. 
Here are some named at random: swimming, personal health, car- 
pentry, civics, electricity, bird-study, automobiling, gardening, music, 
forestry, art, photography, printing, astronomy, and taxidermy. 
Swimming, personal health, and public health are the three most 
popular of all the subjects offered; and it is easy to see why, as they 
are useful to everyone, whereas only a limited number of boys would 
be gifted and interested along the lines of poultry-farming, for 
instance. 
The merit badge work offers plenty of chances for the boy to 
develop his hobbies and find the type of activity that appeals to him. 
The aim is one that our new type of industrial education is attempt- 
ing to offer in the Junior high school (which is the Boy Scout age) 
except that the Scout programme has a much wider range of activities. 
In both cases the aim is prevocational; not, vocational. If a boy 
has already determined his future vocation, then this work gives him 
an additional preparation. One of the best things that results from 
the development of hobbies at this age, even though all cannot be 
pursued as a life vocation, is that they can be carried on as interesting 
sidelines to furnish recreation in the leisure-time hours. 
Each merit badge requires the passing of a certain number of 
tests in the same manner that the preliminary orders do. For in- 
stance, to obtain a merit badge for camping, the Scout must sleep 
fifty nights in the open; second, demonstrate how to put up a tent _ 
and ditch it; third, must make a bed of wild material, and a fire by 
rubbing sticks together; fourth, must know how to choose a camp 
site and protect it against the elements, how to build a latrine, and 
how to dispose of the camp garbage and refuse; fifth, must know 
how to construct a raft.
-P-A-G-E-116
108 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Progressive Nature of the Scout Programme 
It is doubtful if any scheme has ever been devised that in itself 
furnishes better incentives for advancement than does the Scout 
programme. The Scout has always something ahead—opportunity is 
ever present. He reaches one coveted goal, and receives the ac- 
companying reward. But along with the glow of gratification and 
pride in this achievement, the boy sees ahead of him another thing 
he covets. He must go on. The emphasis is not on graduation as 
in our public schools but on the admission to a new plane of honor. 
The satisfaction of being admitted to a higher degree is not a boyish 
trait only. See the way in which men spend a lifetime in trying to 
work up to the highest degrees and offices of the different fraternal 
orders! 
Scouting makes a ceremony of each step. There are three com- 
mon degrees, but one may pass beyond these in the manner that is 
explained later. Each time the boy is advanced he receives a new 
badge which he may wear to supersede the old one; and this honor 
is made more vivid and appealing to him by being presented at a 
formal meeting in which the boy’s parents and friends may be 
present along with the most influential people of the community. 
The reward is largely in the inner gratification that the recipient is 
beund to have. This deep satisfaction leads to a desire to have it 
repeated. And so the boy strives for the new goal. 
The Tenderfoot Scout 
The boy is initiated into the order when he becomes a Tender- 
foot. This is a great moment for him. His eyes bulge during this 
investiture. He has now reached his longing to be a Boy Scout. He 
has passed these tests which once looked so hard to him: 
1. Know the Scout Laws, Oath, Motto, Salute, Sign, and significance of 
the badge. 
2. Know the composition and history of the national flag and the customary 
forms of respect due to it. 
3. Tie the following knots: square or reef, sheetbend, bow-line, fisher- 
man’s, sheepshank, slip, clove hitch, timber hitch, and two half hitches. 
It is very important that the Scout Laws, Motto, and Oath be ex- 
plained. The Scout Laws demand that a Scout be Trustworthy, 
Loyal, Helpful (he must do at least one good turn to somebody 
every day), Friendly, Courteous (he must not receive tips for being
-P-A-G-E-117
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 109 
helpful or courteous), Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, 
Clean, Reverent. Each of these twelve is accompanied with a short 
explanation of its meaning, upon which the prospective candidate 
may be quizzed. ‘This is for the reason that he must know exactly 
what he pledges himself to do when he takes the Scout Oath. 
The Scout Motto: this consists of the two simple words “Be 
Prepared,” but they are laden with meaning. They imply that the 
Scout is always prepared both in mind and body to do his duty no 
matter what the occasion calls for. It may be that the occasion 
calls for a helping hand to aid the weak, or of advice to the person 
in doubt, or of saving pain or even life when an accident happens. 
The Scout Oath: On my honor I will do my best— 
1. To do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law. 
2. To help other people at all times. 
3. To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally 
straight. 
After taking this oath the boy is enrolled as a Tenderfoot Scout. 
He starts out on a new life, pledged to do his duty to God, to his 
country, to others, and to himself. 
The Second Class Scout 
There are ten requirements to this order which must be passed 
satisfactorily before the local Scout authorities. Briefly, they are: 
(1) At least one month’s service as a Tenderfoot; (2) elementary first 
aid and bandaging; (3) elementary signaling; (4) track half a mile in 25 
minutes; (5) go a mile at a Scout’s pace in 12 minutes (the Scout’s pace con- 
sists of 50 steps running and the same number walking, alternately); (6) 
proper use of knife or hatchet; (7) fire building in the open; (8) simple cook- 
ing; (9) earn and deposit one dollar in a public bank; (10) know the sixteen 
principal points of the compass. 
The First Class Scout 
This order has the following stipulations: 
(1) have served two months as a Second Class Scout; (2) swim fifty 
yards; (3) earn and deposit two dollars in a public bank; (4) signaling, (six- 
teen letters per minute); (5) take a fourteen-mile observation hike, and 
write an account of it; (6) advanced first-aid; (7) advanced cooking; (8) 
read and make maps; (9) handicraft (make an article himself) ; (10) judge 
distance, size, number, height, and weight; (11) identify species of trees, 
plants, wild birds, animals, and know the stars; (12) give evidence that he 
has practiced the principles of the Scout Law and Oath; (13) enlist a boy 
trained by himself in the Tenderfoot requirements,
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The Life Scout 
The boy who has mastered the difficult requirements of the 
First Class Scout has by no means exhausted the possibilities of 
Scouting. It is possible for him to reach advanced orders by means 
of the merit badge work that has been explained. Only the First 
Class Scout can receive these additional honors. The Scout who 
can pass the five merit tests in first aid, a choice of physical develop- 
ment or athletics, personal health, public health, and a choice of 
life saving or pioneering, is awarded the Life Scout Badge. It can 
be seen that these five subjects are all of general usefulness. 
The Star Scout 
A Life Scout can be promoted to a Star Scout by receiving five 
additional merit badges. These, however, are optional. 
The Eagle Scout 
This is the highest attainment in Scouting education. In addi- 
tion to the ten badges he already holds, the candidate must pass 
eleven more tests. Five of these eleven tests are elective; but there 
are six additional badges that are required: namely, life saving or 
pioneering, according to which one was omitted in the choice as a 
Life Scout, cooking, camping, civics, bird study, and pathfinding. 
Only one who has been connected with the work of the Boy Scouts 
can understand the perseverance, application, intelligence, and 
versatility that are needed to reach this pinnacle of what Scouting 
has to offer in the way of recognition. The recipient has every 
reason to be proud; and he cannot fail to be a figure among men. 
Organization of Scouting 
The Individual 
Boys from 12 to 18 years of age are the eligible candidates for 
Boy Scouts. The average age is fifteen and one-half years. The 
boys are instructed through the Boy Scout Handbook, through the 
influence of their leaders, through the personalities of the many in- 
fluential citizens of the community who speak and assist in other 
ways at the meetings, and through the medium of the official maga- 
zine, called ‘Boys’ Life.” 
The Group 
The group organizations are the patrol and the troop.
-P-A-G-E-119
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS III 
The Patrol: Eight boys make a patrol. Two boys out of each 
patrol act in the capacity of patrol leader and assistant patrol leader, 
respectively. 
The Troop: The troop is made up of patrols, preferably three 
in number, and not more than four in any case. Troops must be 
chartered by the National Council. They are usually found affiliated 
with the playground, social center, the Y. M. C. A., the Church, or 
the public school. The institution sponsoring the troop provides 
leadership, a place for meeting, and appoints the necessary Troop 
Committee. 
The Scoutmaster: The leader of the Scout troop is called the 
Scoutmaster. As qualifications, he must be at least 21 years of age, 
a citizen of the United States, and subscribe to the Scout Oath and 
Law; and he should, in addition, be a man of good character and 
with sympathetic interest in work with boys. It is all the better if 
he knows outdoor life. The Scoutmaster takes charge of the meet- 
ings and outings of the troop and supervises the individual work of 
the boys. He is often assisted by older boys of 18 years or over, 
too old to be active Scouts, yet willing to serve as Associate Scouts 
and act as Assistant Scoutmasters. 
Administration 
Local Units 
The Troop Committee: Each chartered troop of Boy Scouts 
must be under the supervision of a troop committee composed of 
three or more citizens selected by the institution with which the 
troop is affiliated. This committee is the executive committee of the 
particular institution. The members take active charge when the 
Scoutmaster’s office is vacant and a successor is being determined or 
commissioned. In case there is no council they arrange for initiation 
ceremonies and appoint the Court of Honor which examines all 
candidates for merit badges. Often they are called upon to assist 
in the selection of a representative to the local council, in case there 
is one. 
The Local Council: The local council is found in larger towns 
and cities where several different institutions have organized Scout 
troops. Each chartered institution is entitled to elect one of its 
members, other than the Scoutmaster, as a member of the local
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
‘ council. It can be seen that the local council includes ‘‘representa- 
tives of the various religious, civic, educational, and business 
interests of the community.” The local council assists in matters of 
policy, selection of local administrative officials, finance, promotion, 
maintenance of high grade work, and in the choice of a representa- 
tive to the national organization. There are hundreds of local 
councils. 
The Scout Executive and Scout Commissioner: The Scout 
Executive is necessary whenever a town is large enough to possess 
several troops belonging to different institutions. He is a paid 
official. He is the administrative officer carrying out the desires of 
the local council. He creates and maintains morale among the Scout 
leaders, keeps office records, handles the budget, and in general 
attempts to act as an agent in close contact with the community life. 
The Scout Commissioner is a volunteer worker of influential stand- 
ing who is selected by the local council. In case there is no full-time 
paid Executive the Commissioner assumes such duties. Where there 
is a Scout Executive the Commissioner's duties are largely of honor- 
arynature. His presence graces allceremonies. Often he is delegated 
as a representative to the National Council. 
Field Units 
These are under the jurisdiction of National Headquarters. 
The field unit helps in the arousing of Scouting interest in new 
territories, and in the formation of local councils. Where there is 
no local council, the field unit directs the work of the troop 
committee. 
National Unit 
Each local council has a right to send a representative to the 
larger body known as the National Council of the Boy Scouts of 
America. The headquarters are in New York City. There is a 
National Scout Executive in the same way that there is a local one; 
also, an Executive Board, which grants charters, handles supplies, 
appoints officers, and directs the work of the several departments 
mentioned below; and a National Court of Honor, which passes on 
standards for merit badges and awards all honors. In addition 
there are six well-organized departments to take care of the pro- 
motion of special activities: the Supply Department, having charge 
of the Scout uniform, insignia, badges, etc.; the Department of

BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS ee 
Education, which stimulates interest by means of conferences, recrea- 
tional courses, and the like, and gives publicity to the movement 
among educational and religious workers; the Field Department, 
mainly responsible for the extension of Scouting work into new com- 
munities, the organization of local councils, and the appointment of 
Scout officials; the Library Department, which maintains a reading 
list for boys, plans the taking of moving pictures demonstrating 
phases of Scout work, and aids in the publication of “Boys’ Life,” 
and of the weekly magazine “Scouting” which is sent free to all 
registered Scout officials; the Department of Camping, which out- 
lines plans and programmes for camp life and supervises all camps so 
that the work is kept up to the minimum standard of efficiency in 
leadership, programme, sanitation, and food; and, lastly, the new De- 
partment of Sea Scouting, which has developed an extensive pro- 
gramme of nautical work of a nature particularly interesting to the 
older Scouts. 
Other Points of Interest 
Training of Scout Leaders , 
The Scouting movement has a need for trained leaders. Many - 
of the local councils have adopted the wise plan of instituting train- 
ing courses, the prospective candidates for Scoutmasters meeting 
once a week for a period of ten or twelve weeks. Many councils 
give one course of this nature each year, usually in the winter. The 
course usually proceeds along the three lines of training (1) in 
Scout organization and leadership, (2) in the ideals and value of 
Scouting with particular attention to the traits of the adolescent 
age, and (3) in the curriculum of Scouting; i.e., games, woodcraft, 
hiking, and camping, also a working knowledge of juvenile neighbor- 
hood conditions. The successful candidates receive certificates from 
National Headquarters. But their education should not stop here 
if they intend to advance in Scouting. It is possible to broaden their 
ability to serve through keeping up with current events and by read- 
ing the best literature, also by studying some of the problems of 
boyhood and of community welfare work, and most important of 
all, by attending conferences of Scout leaders and, when possible, 
by attending a summer school. Many normal schools and uni- 
versities now give courses for Scout leaders, the subject being listed 
under the department of physical education. Such a training is of 
extreme value to the person wishing to become a Scout Executive.

114 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Good executives can command better salaries than are usually found 
in the regular field of educational work. 
The Boy Scouts in Their Relation to the Community 
The Boy Scouts as an organization assemble on the occasions 
of their weekly meetings, and on their hikes and camping expedi- 
tions. But there are many extra occasions when they are called 
upon as a body to assist in some community or national enterprise. 
They appear in the playground festival exhibitions, at the com- 
munity center rally, and in the parade that features such holidays 
as Fourth of July and Armistice Day. However, there is another 
way in which the Boy Scouts have done invaluable service. The 
individual daily good turn may be enlarged to an object that com- 
bines the organization together in one common aim. This may be 
called unit work. The following extract taken from President 
Woodrow Wilson’s proclamation for a Boy Scout week devoted to 
the furtherance of the movement well illustrates how helpful the 
organization proved to be during the war. 
“The Boy Scouts of America have rendered notable service to 
the Nation during the World War. They have done effective work 
in the Liberty Loan and War Savings campaigns, in discovering and 
reporting upon the Black Walnut supply, in cooperating with the 
Red Cross, and other war work agencies, in acting as dispatch 
bearers for the Committee on Public Information, and in other im- 
portant fields. The Boy Scouts have not only demonstrated their 
worth to the nation, but have also materially contributed to a deeper 
appreciation by the American people of the highest conception of 
patriotism and good citizenship.” 
Other duties not specifically mentioned were the operation of 
thousands upon thousands of war gardens. By volunteering in many - 
cases to relieve the shortage of labor the boys saved many potato, 
corn, and fruit and berry crops. This war service, important as it 
was, only serves to show the aid that the Boy Scouts are doing every 
day in campaigns of a peaceful nature. They are found singly doing 
their daily good turns, which may take such a form as directing a 
stranger to his destination, as assisting an old lady with her bundles, 
as delivering parcels for the charity organization, as administering 
first aid to an injured person, and the like. The “good turn” should 
be performed consciously, the Scout actually having in mind the 
thought that he is being helpful. When we begin to study the peace 
service that the Boy Scouts do collectively we find a multitude of ac-
-P-A-G-E-123
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS IIS 
complishments of community and national import. They may be 
enlisted in a clean-up campaign; they may be exterminating barberry 
bushes, waging war on injurious insects, or distributing health and 
conservation literature; they may be found as traffic aides, as ushers 
at football games, and as the caretakers of stricken refugees in times 
of fire, cyclone, or flood: and, again, they may be making repairs or 
doing chores about the property of the aged or otherwise helpless; 
or, keeping the playground apparatus in repair, and the courts in 
shape. There is no pay asked in return for deeds of this kind. The 
Scout is only fulfilling his oath; is only living up to the command- 
ments of his Law, Scouting teaches him that the reward comes in 
the thrill of doing an act that is worthy and that is appreciated. 
True Scouts cannot fail to be worthy and public-spirited men and 
citizens. 
The Weakness of Scouting as an Institution 
The preceding study has shown that the Scouting education is 
a very necessary part of boyhood life. It would seem then that it 
should be established on a more stable financial basis than at the 
present time; that the money forthcoming to support the movement 
should be partly assured from state and local funds rather than from 
philanthropic subscriptions as at present. The inevitable result is 
that in times of financial depression the subscription drives fall short, 
and as a consequence the Scouting funds become too limited to put 
on the work that should be done; i.e., the result is inferior help and 
smaller enrollments. 
Another result of this dependence upon popular financial support 
is that the Scout Executive and other officials are often handicapped 
in acting according to their best convictions in matters of policies and 
discipline for fear of offending some wealthy donator. The boys 
all admire strong discipline just as long as it is administered fairly 
and without favor; but as soon as any particular boy is permitted 
to be an exception to the rule, one of the best things about Scouting 
fails in its purpose. Still another result of this type of financial 
support is that often the Scout leaders feel it necessary to make an 
impression, and they are apt to exploit the simpler fundamental 
features of their work in the attempt to put on something spectacular 
that will catch the public eye. Too, for the same reason, and 
especially when visitors are present (as often there are) the 
activities are over organized to the extent of being artificial for fear 
that the people who pull the money strings will think that the boys
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
are allowed to be idle. Still another tendency that results is 
of pushing boys through the tests too fast, and too superficially, in 
order to make good comparisons with previous records or those of 
other cities. These shortcomings would largely disappear if the 
public schools could be made the.center for the promotion of work 
of the Scouting type. There would be more uniformity then, a thing 
impossible now, when in one city it is the municipal recreation system 
that fosters the movement, while in other cities it may be the school 
social center, the Y. M. C. A., a church, the Mother’s Club or 
Rotary Club, or a few interested private individuals. 
While the dependence of Scouting upon volunteer help, as in 
the case of the Scoutmaster, is a very commendable thing, still many 
difficulties arise in its practical use. At one time a very energetic 
leader may give his time to the work, and may enlist friends of 
strong personality in the same cause; but when circumstances cause 
such a leader or such a group of interested men to withdraw their 
services, the movement may practically die out in the particular 
locality until such a time as other forceful persons take hold. 
CAMP FIRE GIRLS 
The Camp Fire Girls is an organization of the same relative 
bearing to girls that the Boy Scouts is to the boys. Because the 
larger aims of these two movements are fundamentally so alike, it 
will not be necessary to give space to the Camp Fire Girls equal to 
that allotted the Boy Scout movement. The main difference is in 
the treatment according to sex; the Camp Fire Girls movement 
treats of girlhood needs and is so modeled that it may give the best 
possible training to the young girls just entering womanhood—train- 
ing that they will need in order to undertake the duties of house- 
wives and mothers, or even that necessary to enter upon the business 
or professional vocation: the training is distinctly for the develop- 
ment of the all-around woman. The Camp Fire organization aims 
to inculcate a spirit of service along distinctly feminine lines, and 
also to develop an interest that the girl can use later in the duties 
that a woman assumes as a citizen: namely, helping to better neigh- 
borhood conditions, to alleviate distress, to vote away corrupt 
politics and all kinds of vice, to demand better health, and to see 
. that the child receives proper training and environment in schools, 
on the playgrounds, and in the homes.  
-P-A-G-E-125
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 117 
This order was founded in America by Dr. and Mrs. Luther 
Halsey Gulick. The idea grew out of a camping programme that 
Mrs. Gulick had used for several years to meet the needs of her 
own daughters and their girl companions when in company at the 
summer camps. These ideas and experiences were later extended 
and modified and accepted as the ritual and plan for the new organi- 
zation. The watchword ‘“Wohelo” was taken from the name of 
the camp which had been formed by the first two letters from each 
of the three words Work, Health, and Love. The movement was 
officially founded on March 17, 1912. Since then it has grown very 
rapidly, its most customary afhliation being with the school, social 
center, or church. It has also taken on an international character. 
The local unit of Camp Fire consists of a group of girls number- 
ing from six to twenty. The group meets weekly, but the cere- 
monial meeting, at which time the members appear in the distinctive 
ceremonial gown, occurs once a month. There must be an adult 
leader to take charge of the group, and she is known as the 
“Guardian of the Camp Fire.’ Here is where one difficulty of the 
order arises that is of the same nature as confronts the Boy Scouts: 
there are very few women who can be found to volunteer their 
services for this purpose; and consequently the emphasis to the 
movement in a particular community fluctuates up and down accord- 
ing to the time that can be spared or the energy displayed by the 
people who are fostering it. The difficulty of finding permanent 
management could easily be offset if the movement were linked up 
with our high schools, and a capable woman teacher given extra 
salary for supervising a group of girls in the out-of-school hours. 
Once the organization is secured the leader can begin to work out 
the purpose of the movement; namely, to instill in the girl “romance, 
beauty, and adventure in every-day life,” happiness even when doing 
uninteresting tasks. The movement breathes idealism; in every 
phase of it the girl is shown that she should attempt to find the 
happiness that should be, associated with every routine task. This 
spirit of service, of sociability, of cooperation that the Camp Fire 
girls learns, is something that is very urgent to make for success in 
the new réles that women are playing to-day. It is impressed upon 
-the girl’s plastic mind that the Holy Grail is not to be found by 
searching far and wide, but that it is found within one’s own inner 
spirit. 
The Camp Fire Girls also has various stages of attainment that 
can be reached in a manner similar to that indicated in the dis-
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
cussion of the Boy Scouts; there are three grades known as Wood 
Gatherer, Fire Maker, and Torch Bearer. There are no additional 
higher degrees as in Scouting, but these three, and especially the last, 
are more difficult to attain and require more time than the three 
first degrees in Scouting. 
The work of the Camp Fire Girls is comprised partly of re. 
quired subjects, but the largest part of it is elective in the seven 
crafts of Homecraft, Healthcraft, Campcraft, Handicraft, Nature- 
lore, Business, and Citizenship. Homecraft covers such things as 
cooking, housekeeping, marketing, care of the baby, and so on; 
Healthcraft, such things as personal hygiene, first aid, physical exer- 
cise, and knowledge of games; Handicraft, basketry, decoration, 
gifts, woodcarving, stenciling, and metal work; Campcraft, hikes, 
fire building, shelters, and cooking in the open; Nature-lore, bird 
study, a knowledge of flowers, trees, butterflies, the stars, the 
weather, and other things such as gardening and the care of 
animals; Business Craft, ways of earning spending money, thrift, 
bank accounts, and other forms of saving; Citizenship, stories of our 
country, knowledge of its great men and women, a study of its laws, 
and the many things expected of its citizens in the way of service. 
For each honor won in a craft the girl is given a distinctively colored 
bead, depending upon the craft in which it has been won. In Home- 
craft alone there are 116 electives from which the girl may choose. 
The work of these crafts is similar to the merit badge work 
of the Boy Scouts, but there are these important differences: the 
elective choice starts much earlier in the girl’s progress than in the 
boy’s, and the girl receives a bead for each item of her work while 
the boy receives no award until all the requirements for a certain 
merit badge have been passed. After a certain number of elective 
honors have been earned in one certain craft a girl is entitled to a 
large bead for that craft, known as a Big Honor. 
In order to become a Camp Fire Girl a girl must first of all 
satisfy seven requirements: 
She must be at least 12 years of age. 
Have paid annual dues of $1.00. 
Know the purpose and ideals of the organization. 
Know the names of chief national, state, and local executive officers. 
Know the design, meaning, and symbolism of the U. S. Flag. 
Know the watchword and hand sign. 
Know the name, purpose, and value of the official magazine. apo sites oo toate 
After fulfilling these requirements she must repeat before a 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 119 
meeting of the council fire her desire to be a Camp Fire Girl, and to 
obey the law of the Camp Fire: 
“Seek Beauty 
Give Service 
Pursue Knowledge 
Be Trustworthy 
Hold on to health 
Glorify work 
Be happy.” 
She is then received on probation and works to pass the six addi- 
tional requirements necessary to become a Wood Gatherer and to 
be received into full membership. 
I. The Woodgatherer 
1. Membership for at least two months. 
2. Attended at least six weekly meetings and two ceremonial meetings. 
3. Be able to repeat the Wood Gatherer’s desire. (A pledge of sisterhood 
and of allegiance to the ideals of the Camp Fire.) 
4. Have selected a name and a symbol. 
5. Have made a head band (with a symbolized design). 
6. Earned 14 elective honors, three from Homecraft, three from Citizen- 
ship, and three from Nature Craft. 
With the attainment of the rank of Wood Gatherer, the girl 
is permitted to wear the ceremonial gown of the order, and she also 
receives the silver ring which designates membership in the Camp 
Fire organization. The ring has a design of a bundle of seven 
fagots bound together, with three raised circles on either side. The 
fagots are symbolic of the seven points of the Law, and the circles 
of the watch word. 
The second degree a girl may attain is that of the Fire Maker. 
This entitles her to wear the Fire Maker’s bracelet. 
Il. Fire Maker 
A. Applicant must be able to express the Fite Maker’s desire: 
“As fuel is brought to the fire 
So I purpose to bring 
My strength 
My ambition 
My heart’s desire 
My joy And my sorrow 
To the fire 
 
-P-A-G-E-128

Of humankind 
For I will tend 
As my fathers have tended 
And my father’s fathers 
Since time began 
The fire that is called 
The love of man for man 
‘The love of man for God.” 
B. In addition to memorization of the above, the girl must have passed 
certain other tests in cooking, sewing, and simple knot tying; must prove that 
she has lived in a hygienic manner, and taken a prescribed amount of out-door 
exercise the previous month; must show that she is familiar with causes of 
infant mortality, with certain emergency treatments, and with the principles 
of elementary bandaging; must possess a practical knowledge of personal 
hygiene, of sex, of the duties of a hostess, and of the rules of etiquette; must 
recite some well-known poem, know the career of some prominent women of 
the nation; and must know the words of the national anthem. In all, these 
comprise fourteen required honors; and, in addition, there are twenty elective 
honors that must be passed. The electives are chosen from the seven crafts. 
Ill. The Torch Bearer (entitled to wear the ‘‘Torch Bearer’s 
Pin”). 
1. The applicant must be fifteen years of age and be approved as a “team 
worker.” 
2. Must be able to repeat the Torch Bearer’s desire. 
“That light which has 
Been given to me 
I desire to pass 
Undimmed to others.” 
3. She must also be able to present twenty more elective honors. 
The rank of Torch Bearer may be attained either as that of a 
GUIDE or as a CRAFTSMAN. 
A. Guide 
This is a test of leadership and the applicant must have been a leader of 
three girls for not less than three months in some activity such as craft work, 
hiking, singing, outdoor or indoor sports, study of nature-lore, and the like. 
B. Craftsman 
This is more of an individual test not requiring so much the subjects for 
leadership. This rank involves certain attainments in walking, in knowledge 
of local geography, outing hygiene and outdoor sports, and in practical ex- 
perience as a housekeeper. 
Although the rank of Torch Bearer may be attained either as 
that of Guide or Craftsman, it is also possible for the girl to win
-P-A-G-E-129
  BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUBS 121 
the order in both ranks. No higher degree than that of Torch 
Bearer is given but the girl has an opportunity to win additional 
beads by passing more elective honors. 
Other Features of the Organization 
The Camp Fire Girls are encouraged to make many useful 
things. A thing distinctive to the organization is that each member 
must earn the money that is needed to go to the summer camp. This 
one thing helps keep the organization busy in the winter for there 
are innumerable ways in which the girls can be taught how to earn 
money. ‘There are classes in water coloring, and along this line 
there is instruction given in making Christmas cards and valentines. 
All the handicraft work is not necessarily planned for personal re- 
numeration, however. Many things, such as basketry, stenciled 
smocks, table runners, painted weeds, leather goods, and toys are 
made and distributed among the poor people of the neighborhood, 
each contributor thereby living up to the law “Give Service.” 
Toys, in particular, are made for the children in settlements and 
hospitals. - 
Much stress is placed on the girl’s Health Chart. This Health 
Chart must be lived up to very carefully, day by day. Following the 
requirements for a month enables the girl to receive the Health 
Board Symbol, which she wears with the other honors on the cere- 
monial gown. ; 
Lastly, a word about the ceremonial gown. This is of simple 
lines, fashioned after the buckskin of the Indian maiden. The khaki 
has feather fringes and is decorated with the honor beads that have 
been won. After a girl has chosen her symbol she may incorporate 
it into the dress by embroidery, stenciling, bead designs, or other 
means. This means that the girl can keep adding to the dress as 
fast as she has added more honors to her list. The honor beads 
can be worn as a necklace if preferred. The gown gives a good 
chance for originality and taste on the part of the girl planning and 
working out the design. 
THE GIRL SCOUTS 
It is more necessary to explain the Camp Fire Girls than it is the 
rival movement, the Girl Scouts. This is for the reason that the 
Camp Fire Girls have built up an original idea. The Girl Scouts
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
have not departed far from the plan of the boys’ order of Scouts, 
copying its plan of organization and procedure in many of its details, 
while making minor adaptations necessary for its use by girls. The 
Girl Scouts also are international in scope, the members in England 
where the movement first originated, being known as ‘‘Guides.” 
The American organization at first took the name of ‘‘Guides”’ 
when organized in 1912, but changed to Girl Scouts in 1915. The 
motto “Be Prepared,” the slogan ‘“‘Do a Good Turn Daily,” the 
pledge, and the laws, all suggest the likeness to the brother organiza- 
tion. Then, too, there is the tenderfoot, the patrol, the troop, and 
the Local Council, the Court of Honor, and the National Council. 
All girls wear the uniform of khaki, a feature which stands out 
strikingly at parades and other public functions. 
At present there are 110,000 Girl Scouts in the United States. 
Because of the simplicity of the uniform, and small expense of mem- 
bership, the Scouting order draws many members from the poor sec- 
tions of the city. On the whole, in comparing the Girl Scouts with 
the Camp Fire Girls the point seems to stand out that the former 
emphasizes the virtues of patriotism, democracy, hardihood, and 
forceful service and preparedness, while the latter extols the more 
feminine qualities of artistry, refinement, romance, and cheerful 
helpfulness. Practicality stands out preéminently in the one; aesthetic 
appreciation and high idealism in the other. For these reasons, 
each movement appeals to certain types of girls and it is not un- 
common in the same household to find one member a Girl Scout, 
and the sister a Camp Fire Girl. Some girls belong to both.

  CHAPTER VI 
CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 
General 
Camping, as an organized recreational activity, is as much a part 
of the present-day play movement as the playgrounds themselves. 
Indeed, a camp is merely a large playground which offers many of 
the advantages of city play as well as many additional ones which 
it is peculiarly able to handle. 
Camping is not new. The men and women of to-day enjoyed 
camping in their childhood days though not in a way comparable to 
that which is offered their children to-day. In fact, the camping of 
twenty years ago was close to the nomadic life. A few boys would 
procure an old ‘‘nag,” a tent, a discarded stove, and an assortment 
of canned goods including beans, corn syrup, and condensed milk. 
Parents could not be blamed for worrying as this motley crew made 
its departure. These inexperienced boys with nothing to guide them 
would have to sleep on beds of twigs, cook their own meals, and 
furnish their own amusement. Precautions for health and comfort 
were unthought of. Such a trip would usually continue for a week 
unless the supplies ran short, in which case the stay was abruptly 
terminated. It is a tribute to the camping life that boys would find 
fun in such expeditions in spite of the hardships which had to be 
endured. 
There are some people to-day who decry the departure from 
these primitive methods just described. However, when contrasted 
with the organized camp life of to-day the advantages show up far 
more strongly with the present type. Boys alone cannot be expected 
to have the experience of mature leaders. Neither can they provide 
the advantages which accrue from an organization which specializes 
in camp promotion. With capable organization and leadership, 
boys can, with but little loss of independence, have comfortable 
quarters, the best of food, and.safeguards against danger; and, in 
addition, have their outing attended with the maximum of recrea- 
tion and of educational instruction. It is easy to see why parents 
125
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
to-day have overcome their fears and are glad to see their children 
set out for a camping time under such good care. 
The rapid expansion of the camping movement has not been con- 
fined simply to boys and girls. Adults everywhere have been de- 
manding a vacation time period. The hurry-up methods of our 
modern era necessitate labor at top-notch speed and with such con- 
ditions a rest is an inevitable necessity. Every individual, from the 
high-salaried executive to the day-laboring man, finds it profitable to 
take a vacation, knowing that he will be able to come back to tackle 
his work with renewed zest. 
The most popular outing is the one that takes the person away 
from the hot city pavements and the breathless nights to the cool of 
the lakes and woods, there to enjoy Nature at her best, in the full 
bloom of the summer season. Another thing that makes the out- 
door vacation so practical is that it can be inexpensive. While some 
people have to go to the summer hotel or fashionable resort to en- 
joy themselves, the person of moderate means can have just as good 
a time by renting a cottage or even by setting up a tent by the road- 
side. 
Although camping as a movement has been aided by propaganda 
carried on by physical welfare organizations during the past twenty 
years, still its revolutionizing is due to modern means of transporta- 
tion. With the advent of the trolley, the pleasure boat, and the 
automobile in particular, there has come a nation-wide interest in 
outdoor life. The overcoming of the difficulties of transportation 
has resulted in several things. In the first place, parents can now 
send their children to camp and yet be able to visit them frequently. 
Again, camping stops that formerly would have been impractical 
unless a visit of a week’s duration could be made, now can be fre- 
quented in a day’s outing, or an overnight one; and places that were 
formerly considered inaccessible to all except the most ardent 
hikers, are now visited annually by thousands of people. The result 
has been that lake property has boomed tremendously in value and 
that commercial enterprises have made expensive water improve- 
ments and established profitable amusement concessions. Another 
sight, not uncommon nowadays, is to see our highways crowded with 
automobile tourists who carry all their camping equipment with 
them. This idea has come so quickly into popular favor that many 
municipalities have appropriated money for making attractive stop- 
ping-off places for tourists and for the offering of hospitality to 
them.

  CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 127 
Of late, much excellent printed material has become available 
in the way of personal advice to hikers and campers and of the de- 
tails of organization and administration of the larger groups. 
Many of the popular magazines print each year, with the coming 
on of the wander-lust, short articles filled with practical hints on 
how the inexperienced camper should take care of himself in the 
open; how he should buy equipment, choose stopping-off places, 
select clothing, protect himself against marauding animals and 
against insect pests, pitch tents, build and put out fires, air and dry 
bedding, etc. Moreover, many of the organizations which conduct 
their own camps, such as the Boy Scouts, of America, the 
Y. M. C. A., and others, publish much literature on this subject. 
Types of Camp Promotion 
The recent growth of camping from an occasional and hap- 
hazard mode of life to a nation-wide recreation, has been accom- 
panied by the rise of many agencies which have concerned them- 
selves with its promotion. In this way, camping has been backed 
by many organizations: viz., private concerns; municipalities; 
philanthropies; industries; and institutions such as the Boy Scouts, 
Girl Scouts, Y. M. C. A., etc. Each of these will be discussed 
briefly in turn. 
Private. As usual with any public need, probably the first 
attempts to meet the demand for camping were made by individuals 
seeking profit. This accounts for the springing into existence of the 
many exclusive camps conducted for the sons and daughters of the 
wealthy. In many cases the private school prolonged its term over 
the summer period in the form of a summer camp. This innova- 
tion met with the immediate approval of the people financially 
privileged. In addition to allowing children a good time under the 
best of care, this opportunity freed elders from parental responsibili- 
ties at a time when they were planning vacations or trips for them- 
selves. The private camps are extremely expensive. They afford 
much individual attention, providing tutoring privileges, and lessons 
in horsemanship, dancing, and social finish. The only objection to 
this type is that it reaches too few and even then is apt to be too much 
of a “‘kid-glove” affair where the back-to-nature idea is entirely lost. 
Although no concern of this chapter, still mention should be 
made of the other extreme of commercialized camping in which 
there is no thought of exclusiveness whatsoever. This is to be found 
in the case of business enterprises which buy up desirable land such
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
as lake fronts, and parcel it out for cottages or rent picnicking and 
tenting space. In addition, they add to the natural attractions by 
fitting out inviting bathing beaches and even go so far as to add 
luxurious amusement palaces.. The commercializing of the camping 
desire from this standpoint is not without many benefits specially to 
the poorer class of our people. These benefits, however, can be 
entirely offset by exorbitant fees or allowing vicious influences to 
creep in. 
School and Municipal. Camps of this type usually cater to 
children, proceeding on the basis that the city playgrounds only 
occupy a portion of the boy’s or girl’s time during the summer vaca- 
tion, and cannot possibly give the satisfaction to the city child that 
an outing in the country will do. There are other motives behind the 
planning of these camps: such as, to lighten the burden of the parents 
at the time of the year when the children are free from school and 
so many problems are presented; to lessen the number of juvenile 
delinquents, for the summer is the time when the children, partially 
left to themselves to provide amusement, easily gravitate into mis- 
chief and crime; also, to assist the Safety First programme, for sta- | 
tistics show that there is an appalling list of accidents among school 
children from July to September. 
Necessarily, with the numbers to be accommodated, the time of 
stay of children in school and municipal camps must be very short; 
and the prime purpose has to be that of health and recreation. 
The Philadelphia schools have conducted many experiments 
along the line of short camping trips; and Curtis, in his book 
“Education Through Play,” tells of the work that is being conducted 
successfully at the Interlaken School Camp at La Porte, Indiana; at 
Gary, Indiana; and also at Dubuque, Iowa. Along this line, how- 
ever, America has not progressed as far as have some of the 
European countries, particularly Germany and Denmark. 
In the valuable little handbook “Summer Camps: Municipal and 
Industrial” issued by the Community Service Headquarters, inter- 
esting accounts are given of municipal camps carried on by the cities 
of Los Angeles, Detroit, Bridgeport, New York City, Dayton, Salt 
Lake City, Oakland, Rochester, St. Louis, and Omaha. Some of 
these are conducted for city waifs only, while others such as Camp 
Seeley of Los Angeles plan to givé a good time to adult excursionists 
as well. New York City has.a plot of land that is called ‘Tent City” 
that it rents out cheaply to families desiring the privilege. 
Philanthropic. Two camps of this nature that may be mentioned
-P-A-G-E-137
  ’ 
CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 129 
are the Princeton and the Michigan “University Fresh Air Camps” 
in which a fund is solicited from the students and alumni to maintain 
a camp for poorer children of large nearby cities. Usually, much 
help is obtained cheaply by using university students as councilors. 
Another plan of this kind that has been carried on successfully for 
a number of years is the Detroit Free Press newsboy camp. The 
objects and aims are the same in the philanthropic promotion as in 
the municipal camp; namely, to give the boys and girls a good 
outing. 
Industrial. In this type of camp the aim is to give the employees 
of a certain industry or large store a vacation at a very reasonable 
expense. Again, we can refer to the Community Service handbook 
for complete information concerning the work of successful in- 
dustrial camps. The camps of the General Electric Company and 
of Armour and Company may be cited as typical examples. 
Institutional. By far the greatest success at the lowest cost 
has been achieved by those camps which are controlled by organiza- 
tions such as the Y. M. C. A. and the Boy Scouts. There are many 
reasons for this. In the first place, the fees are very nominal, camps 
merely attempting to be self-sustaining. Again, because of the fact 
that definite units exist previous to going to camp, the boys know 
each other well, and there are fewer cases of homesickness to con- 
tend with. Such organizations have a very comprehensive programme 
which they conduct throughout the year and they can use the summer 
camp to complement the other activities—the camp need not neces- 
sarily be an end in itself. Such an advantage means that a much 
more complete programme can be used to fill up the camping period; 
and monotony need not be feared. Another advantage that accrues 
from this continuous organization is found in the lessened problem 
of discipline at the camp. It is for these reasons that a camp of the 
Boy Scout type will be chosen as representative and will be studied. 
All that has been said of boys’ camps applies equally well to 
those of girls. The only difference lies in the activities which are 
designed especially for girls. 
Camping in the Boy’s Life 
The call of the wild carries an’ sepa to the heart of every boy. 
Especially does this become more pronounced after he has finished 
the confining schdol work of the year. A general idea of the fascina- 
tion and value of camping to boys may best be obtained by repeating
-P-A-G-E-138
130 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY - 
the words of Richardson and Loomis in their book ‘‘The Boy Scout 
Movement.” 
‘Among boys the zest for camping is perennial. Like the 
wanderlust that grips professional nomads, the lure of freedom in 
the out-of-doors seasonally, at least, looms larger than any other 
interest. Though it may drive imagination far afield to the ex- 
travagant and impossible, yet it affords expression to one of the most 
impelling and altogether valuable tendencies of youth: namely, the 
craving which.a boy feels for the novelty of primitive independence 
and hardihood. Such a craving camping appeases. If well-super- 
vised camp life of the virile stamp is possible when these feelings of 
independence, robust adventures, and self assertion are budding, the 
outcome is self-poise, ingenuity, and growth of character of enduring 
benefit. 
“Several years ago it was necessary to preface every article 
dealing with the nature and value of camping for boys by an apology. 
Nowadays, among all thinking people, its usefulness is acknowl- 
edged. It is counted a helpful method of strengthening a boy physi- 
cally, of continuing his education during leisure hours outside of 
the school rooms, and of cultivating social and moral sensitiveness. 
These advantages may be gained in a good camp where emphasis 
is laid upon the established conventionalities of etiquette, personal 
cleanliness, and right conduct. Everyone realizes that it is vastly 
better for a boy to enjoy the fascinating diversions of camp life than 
to flounder in the city or small town without definite responsibilities 
and engaging activities.” 
Certainly, no one can read this extract without feeling that the 
lure of camping is not without its values. Once attracted to camp, 
the boy gets a certain type of experience that he cannot get in any 
form of city education. Away from his parents—often for the 
first time—he is stirred by a feeling of independence and a sense of 
responsibility. He has to do things himself instead of having them 
done for him. He learns to cooperate unselfishly. He must ‘‘chip 
in’ to do his portion of the work, and share the rights to the rooming 
and eating quarters. If he fails in any of these respects the disci- 
pline is often likely to be administered by his camp-mates, for boys 
have their own effective ways of taking care of the comrade who 
shirks his share of the tasks. Furthermore, obedience to the camp 
rules affords a lesson in discipline that reaches even the boy who is 
spoiled at home. The interest in the many things to be seen and 
experienced makes the boy attentive and alert. He meets other boys
-P-A-G-E-139
  
CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 131 
and becomes more sociable and friendly. Nor must we forget the 
effect on his health and physique; he fills his lungs with fresh air, 
sleeps soundly from bodily fatigue, acquires a lusty appetite, and 
builds up a muscle that he is proud to display to his parents on his 
return. Literally, he becomes the “boy of tan” with which the poet 
Whittier has made us so familiar. 
Location of Camp Site 
The choice of a camp site depends so largely upon local condi- 
tions that only a few general rules can be laid down. These are as 
follows: 
1. The source of water supply should be carefully inspected and a sample 
analyzed for typhoid fever germs. 
2. A safe body of water for swimming should be located within easy 
access of the camp. 
3. The grounds should be as high and well drained as possible, and 
cleared of heavy timber growth. The buildings and tents should be so located 
as to get plenty of direct sunlight. 
4. The camp should be fairly well secluded so as to permit the campers 
a certain amount of freedom of dress. 
5. There should be a large open field for such games as baseball and soccer, 
and for camp rallies, etc. 
6. There should be easy access to a source of food supplies, especially of 
fresh vegetables, milk, and butter. 
7. The camp should be located with regard to ease of access, both as to 
automobile and train or traction service. 
8. There should be a large woods nearby for nature and bird study. 
Arrangement of Buildings—The Camp Layout 
No set plan can be laid down for the arrangement of the camp. 
Much will depend upon the slope of the land and the peculiarities 
of the location. Before proceeding with the construction of a new 
camp, however, the best possible advice should be secured either 
from the headquarters of organizations promoting this work, or 
from standard books on camp planning. It is especially true of the 
large and permanent camp that the plans must be adapted to the 
place available, but in the small and transitory camp one can decide 
previously on any number of arrangements and then select a site that 
will suit the plans. 
The complete camp usually has a large permanent building for 
the mess hall and kitchen. In this case the mess hall can be cleared 
and used for indoor gatherings and entertainments. Smaller per- 
manent buildings or cabins will be found for headquarters, store-
-P-A-G-E-140
132 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
house, and hospital. The officers and boys may be quartered in 
small permanent cabins; or, as is more usually the oo in tents that 
will accommodate four or six persons each. 
All buildings should have substantial floors, reese and screened 
sides. The sides should be protected from rain and stormy weather 
by canvas rain curtains or other means. If tents are used they should 
all have wooden floors. Where the permanent mess building is not’ 
to be had, the next best solution is to use the so-called compartment 
tent with fly. 
As regards the location of the buildings on the campus many 
plans are found. One practical plan for the small camp is to have 
the street running away from the lake with the mess hall at the 
farther end and the flag-pole on the open end nearest the lake. For 
the larger camp a different plan must be suggested. A much longer 
street is necessary and therefore it should run parallel to the lake 
front rather than away from it. In this case the mess hall is 
at one end of the street, the bathing beach is handy to campers at 
both ends of the street and behind—away from the lake—is the 
easily accessible athletic field wherein the flag-pole may be located. 
Another plan that is sometimes found has as its basis a large 
building which is complete in itself. This is of the two-story type. 
The first floor can be used as a dining room, club-room, and audi- 
torium; and the second floor as a dormitory and store-room. If pre- 
ferred, the meals can be served on a wide screened veranda. 
Latrines should be located well away from the camp. There 
are many types of these and the details of their construction can be 
obtained from any standard book on camping. Plans for the con- 
struction of an incinerator and instructions as to the correct method 
of disposing of garbage and other refuse must also be studied. 
Equipment List 
The equipment of a camp includes many articles which can be 
enumerated here for the purpose of acquainting the student with the 
things that must be considered in camp administration. Space, how- 
ever, will not permit going into detail as regards the selection of the 
different articles from the standpoint of practicality and economy. 
If permanent buildings are not to be had, then the question of tents, 
both for meeting and sleeping purposes, comes. up. In any event, 
there are the small hike tents that must be carried in stock. The 
other necessary articles follow: beds or cots, bed ticks, blankets, 
stoves and kitchen equipment, tables and benches, table ware, hard-
-P-A-G-E-141
  
CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 133 
ware tools, conveyances, safety outfits for fire and health, life pre- 
servers, diving dock and platform, boats, flagpole, athletic supplies, 
etc. Many camps also equip themselves with signaling and radio 
outfits. 
The question of personal equipment must also be planned ahead. 
Practically every camp now issues instructions to the boys who are 
to attend, advising them in advance what articles to take. This 
equipment list is of two divisions. First, there is a required list per- 
taining to clothing, toilet articles, bedding, and in some cases dishes, 
so that all the boys will be dressed and otherwise provided for in 
uniformity according to a prescribed and simple standard. Included 
in the required list are also miscellaneous useful articles such as the 
bathing suit, pocket knife, electric flashlight, Scout Handbook, etc. 
If there is a camp store, many of the minor things like pencils, 
stationery, needle and thread, buttons, etc., may be omitted from the 
individual list. The second type of personal equipment is recom- 
mended but not required. It refers to such things as kodaks, fish- 
ing tackle, musical instruments, special costumes, and the like. One 
thing that the camp prohibits is the bringing of fancy foods and other 
luxuries, or the sending of them through the mails by the parents. 
Such a practice, if permitted, not only hinders the officers in watch- 
ing over the health of the boys, but makes discontent and envy as all 
boys cannot share the same favors alike. 
Health and Sanitation 
The first thing to be considered under this phase is the selection 
of-a proper site. Other preliminary measures in the way of pre- 
caution are the securing of a physician, if possible, to be in attend- 
ance at the camp,—this makes the task and responsibility of the 
camp director much simpler; the having on hand of a complete out- 
fit of medical supplies; and, the assurance that all the boys who are 
to attend are in good health. These precautions taken, it is 
necessary to attend to the following problems which will arise at the 
camp itself. In the first place it is well to give a talk to the boys the 
day they arrive at camp on proper health precautions as well as 
safety measures. Then, proper inspection of the latrines must be 
made daily; the garbage must be disposed of in a sanitary manner; 
a campaign must be made against mosquitoes, flies, and other 
noxious insects; and, above all, the kitchen and mess hall must be 
kept clean.
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Food and Commissary 
Boys at camp will have prodigious appetites, and ‘‘plenty to eat” 
is one of the attributes by which they judge the good time they have 
had. Plain wholesome food will satisfy them. Luxuries such as ice 
cream, cake, or pie, need only be served occasionally, and this will 
tend to make them appreciated all the more. The commissary detail 
of camp management is an important one not only from the stand- 
point of satisfying the boys, but from the financial success of the 
camp as well, for this is one of the biggest items of expenditure, 
and one which cannot be mishandled either from the standpoint of 
buying supplies or from extravagant serving. It is all important to 
have experienced cooks who will know how to ration and prepare 
food on a large scale and ina variety of ways. 
The Staff of Leaders 
The success of the camp depends almost entirely upon the 
leadership—the directors can ‘‘make or break it.” The leaders must 
be thoroughly experienced in all phases of camping, all which are 
important and necessary; and they must know boys well and be able 
to mix with them. The successful camp makes certain that it has 
one head whose authority is absolute. Otherwise, there would be 
confusion in an emergency, at which time divided authority is as good 
as none. There is another thing that is especially desirable, and 
that is to choose the leaders so that each is a specialist in a certain 
line which he can promote along with his general duties. Often, a 
leader may possess talent along athletic, musical, or dramatic lines 
which can be used to contribute to the camp entertainments; and 
through this means he will also add to his own popularity and influ- 
ence with the boys. There should be a sufficient number of assistants 
so that the amount of detailed duties falling to the leaders may be 
lessened and more time be given to the bigger problems of camp 
welfare. If these assistants are chosen from the ranks of the boys, 
as they often are, the work affords pleasure because of the sense of 
leadership and responsibility involved. The duties that are to be 
performed in any well organized camp are explained by studying the 
following classification of officers and the work that is expected of 
each. 
The Camp Director 
He must be a real executive: one who is able, not only to out- 
line a programme of activities and to work harmoniously with his staff
-P-A-G-E-143
  
CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 135 
so as to secure the best results from them, but also to administer the 
business side of the camp in a wise and efficient manner. He should 
not burden himself with numerous minor duties; but, on the con- 
trary, should so delegate work of this nature that he may devote him- 
self to the larger task of unifying the many interests of the camp. 
He bears the final responsibilities. 
The Camp Adjutant 
This official is really an assistant director. He is the administra- 
tor of the day’s programme: he posts all bulletins, sees to. it that all 
bugle calls are sounded according to time schedule; in fact, he 
officiates much like an army ‘Officer of the Day.” In addition, he 
has charge of the camp store, bank, post office, library, and camp 
statistics. In some of the larger camps a paid secretary is at his 
disposal; but more often some of the older boys are delegated as his 
clerks. 
The Mess Officer 
This officer is usually the head cook and has one or more 
assistants. He buys the daily supplies, arranges the menus, and 
directs the kitchen duties which include the handling of the waiters, 
dish-washers, scrubbers, etc. 
The Medical Officer 
He has charge of the building or tent set aside as a hospital. 
He is responsible for all medical equipment and supplies. He keeps 
a record of all cases that come under his care. Furthermore, he also 
teaches the classes in first-aid work. Another important phase of his 
duties is the supervision of all matters pertaining to sanitation. 
Recreation Director i 
This official supervises all organized recreational activities, and 
is responsible for the care of all athletic equipment. He may also 
have charge of the swimming and boating periods in case this duty is 
not performed by a separate officer. 
Stunt Officer 
The Stunt Officer, or Morale Officer as he is often called, is in 
charge of all the special activities such as Campfire programmes, music, 
entertainments (Stunt Night, Directors’ Minstrel Show, Camp
-P-A-G-E-144
136 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Circus, Mock Trial), and ceremonies such as the Burial of the 
Camp Grouch, Indian Pow-wow, etc. He also promotes the camp 
newspaper. 
The Quartermaster 
The Quartermaster has direct responsibility for all camping and 
hiking equipment. He maintains the storehouse, often with the help 
of boys as orderlies. He issues all the necessary materials for clean- 
ing camp such as brooms, rakes, buckets, and shovels; and super- 
vises the construction of all camp buildings, bridges, signaling 
towers, etc. He keeps inventory of all camp materials. 
Swimming. Master 
This officer has charge of the boats and all other water-sport 
equipment. He supervises the periods when the campers are in the 
water. He selects and details the life-guards and distributes the 
life-saving equipment. He teaches swimming and life-saving, and 
stages water carnivals. 
Educational Director 
The Educational Director arranges classes in woodcraft, nature 
and bird study, first-aid, etc. He plans the curriculum, assigns the 
boys to the classes, and keeps a record of the tests that are passed. 
He appoints the various adult leaders to their respective classes. 
During the free periods of the day he should be available for con- 
sultation and individual help to the boys. 
Hikemaster 
The larger camps employ such an official. The Hikemaster has 
charge of all the preparations for hikes, both day and overnight. 
He knows the desirable hiking routes. He is responsible for the 
issue of rations, hike tents, individual messkits, canteens, haversacks, 
and blanket rolls; also, for their return to the Quartermaster. Be- 
cause of his frequent absence from camp he must be relieved of many 
of the general duties such as fall to the other officers. 
N.B. The arrangement given above is merely a suggestive one 
which is generally adaptable. For instance, a large camp might have 
an extra official such as a Seascout man, while a small camp might 
function with a lesser number of officials by combining the duties of 
two or more of those mentioned. The Camp Director and the
-P-A-G-E-145
  CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 137 
Camp Adjutant might very well be one and the same person; like- 
wise, the Recreation Director and Swimming Master might have 
their duties combined. 
Programme of Activities 
The life of the camp depends largely on the programme of activities 
that is offered. The programme must consider varied interests so that 
every boy in the camp will be reached no matter what his own par- 
ticular likes happen to be.’ A concise statement of a successful 
programme is offered in the following extract from the Programme 
of Camp Brady, compiled by Mr. W. R. Hunt, Field Scout Executive 
of the Detroit Public Schools: 
The Programme must be planned to include (1) Games; (2) Detail Work; 
(3) Instructions and examinations; (4) Campfire programmes and Stunts; (5) 
Troop contests; (6) Hikes and boat trips—both day and overnight; (7) De- 
votional exercises; (8) Free time activities; (9) Special features, such as 
Fourth of July celebrations, moonlight ard night hikes, and war games; (10) 
Swimming and boating; (11) Rewards; (12) Improvements; (13) Routine 
work, such as meals, inspections, setting-up exercises, etc.; (14) Break up and 
set up camp each week; (15) Drill and band; (15) Inspiration. 
There are certain factors to be considered: 
1. Boys who stay only one period need a special programme. 
2. Boys who “stay over”: 
a. Find the percentage in each section. 
b. Plan special programme for them. 
c. Use them as leaders for new boys. 
3. There should be troop organization (or company or tribe). 
a. Adult leader in charge. 
b. Each troop needs to plan a programme for itself as well as a co- 
operative programme. 
There is a certain routine which must necessarily be gone through. 
Outside of the daily routine tasks such as policing camp, meals, 
inspections, etc., the periods must be well filled in with definitely 
arranged activities. The keynote of sustained interest is keeping the 
boys busy all the time. While there should be proper rest periods, 
no opportunity for loafing should be allowed. 
The regular activities of a camp can be roughly divided into two 
groups: namely, the organized and the unorganized. In the first 
group are such games and sports as baseball, soccer, volley ball, 
track, swimming, wrestling, boxing, quoits, and any others that may 
require a definite organization. Such activities are largely recrea- 
tional in nature and stress the competitive idea, cither as between
-P-A-G-E-146
  
138 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the individuals or teams. These sports form the main part of the 
programmes of many camps. The period which has been found in 
many cases to be best adapted to games and sports of this nature 
varies according to the plan of organization of the camp. In some 
camps the afternoon free period is the best to stage organized games, 
while in others the hour following the evening meal is more practical. 
The difficulty of putting on organized ‘competition during the camp 
stay is that either the boys are scattered in various activities so that 
all the teammates cannot be present at the same time, or that the 
camp must demand that all the boys be present on the athletic field 
or in the water at specified periods. Too much of this compulsion 
will react unfavorably on the enjoyment that the boys find in play- 
ing because when at camp their first thought naturally gravitates 
toward swimming, fishing, and explorations—things that they can- 
not enjoy at home in the city. In addition to the competitive games 
and sports that have been mentioned, the boys will find great en- 
joyment and pleasure in novelty races and stunts, and in non-equip- 
ment games conducted on an elaborate scale to reach everyone in 
camp. These latter games are of the nature of War, Siege, Traitors 
in Camp, Treasure Hunt, Reds and Blues, and many others similar 
to the mass games which proved so popular at the war training 
camps. The best time to run these off is usually the evening period 
preceding the campfire. The good point about such a type of game 
is that it can be organized in an impromptu manner with a large 
elastic unit for competition; and in this way, it can be run off suc- 
cessfully regardless of the attendance of certain of the boys who pre- 
fer to spend their time otherwise. As can be seen later the sports 
and games, including water activities, take up only part of the 
organized periods of the camp. The classes in the morning are 
under the direction of the adult leaders, as are the setting up exer- 
cises, drill, meal time, and certain other occasions. 
The unorganized activities, on the other hand, include those 
which the boys plan for themselves and which they are free to under- 
take without the leaders in charge. They may be performed singly 
or in groups. Although there are scattered moments throughout 
the day when the boy is on his own initiative, still the allotted free- 
play period in the afternoon is the only one that allows him much 
free will to carry out his wishes. During this time he may choose to 
go boating, to fish, to read, to gather collections for nature studies, 
to build a lean-to, to visit some point of interest near-by, to take 
kodak pictures, or to play horseshoes, croquet, “catch,” games of
-P-A-G-E-147
  CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 139 
ball, etc. The camp should not interfere too much with these free 
time periods of the afternoon. Rainy days may be given over to 
periods of unorganized activities, but it is better if the leader of the 
camp has had foresight enough to prepare for such occasions with 
“Rainy Day Programmes’’; for on such occasions it is extremely 
difficult for the boy to stay within the confines of the camp shelters 
and keep active. 
Daily Schedule 
All camps follow a definite time schedule. This programme is 
fairly well standardized although camps differ in small details. The 
one that is given below is very practical. 
6:25. First Call 
6:30. Reveille: Everybody out. 
6:35. Assembly and Colors. 
6:40. Setting up exercises: These should be varied from day to day and be 
kept interesting. Mimetic exercises that imitate ordinary athletic 
contests or games and the events of the daily camp life take well. A 
run around the aeld makes a good close. Much depends on the 
imagination and pep of the leader. 
6:50. Morning Dip: Compulsory except when excused by sickness or in- 
clement weather. 
7:15. Breakfast: Boys seated by troops either with boy or adult leader in 
charge. The boys march in to the bugle; following grace, they seat 
themselves. There must be a regular established system of serving and 
caring for the tables: boys alternate in pairs to serve as waiters. 
Under one system each boy washes his own dishes and table utensils; a 
better way is to have the boys take turns in corps in cleaning and 
setting up tables. In this way troop rivalry can be aroused. 
Tent clean-up; airing blankets: Sick Call. 
Fatigue: Assembly of all campers for the assignment of various details, 
each detail to work under the direction of an officer. ‘The different 
troops rotate in the performance of these duties. The assignments 
follow: 
1. Clean up grounds. 
2. Water detail: to provide the day’s supply of water for 
kitchen tank, and for washing stations. 
3. Latrine: cleaning and disinfecting. 
4. Handy squad: for miscellaneous duties. May sweep out 
general buildings, dispose of garbage, make repairs, or go on 
errands, as the case may be. 
8:55. School Call. . 
g:00. Assembly: Scoutcraft Instruction. Half-hour classes. Five minutes 
between classes. Programme arranged in advance by Educational Di- 
rector. Other directors assist in teaching.

latter group. 
Every precaution must be taken for the safety of the swimmers. 
No swimming should be allowed except during the designated periods. 
The approach to the beach must be carefully cleared of all underbrush. 
A safety area must be roped off for beginners; and diving permitted 
only at specified platforms where the water depth is sufficient. The 
whole swimming area must be very carefully patrolled. One good 
way is to select the expert swimmers and detail them as a life-guard. 
They wear special insignia and remain out of the water until the 
main group of swimmers has been recalled. Then they have a special 
swimming period of their own. Usually directors supervise also, and 
then join the life-guard in swimming during the special period. 
‘There are some other precautions: first, talks on the dangers accom- 
panying swimming and boating, and the use of the life-saving devices; 
second, a roll call in which each troop leader reports to the director 
in charge immediately after the swim; third, the adoption of the popu- 
lar “‘buddy” system. Under the last mentioned scheme each bather is 
paired off with a “buddy,” and these two men are not allowed to be 
more than five yards apart at any time; each must look out for the 
other. Any laxity in this regard is punishable by removal of water 
privileges. In addition to these there is also the tag plan. A boy 
cannot enter the water without receiving a tag, nor leave the water 
without returning it. This last plan should be used in conjunction 
with one of the others. 
Recall. 
Dinner. Same procedure as ovreaxfast. Followed by sing and an- 
nouncements. ‘The rest period is set aside to keep the boys from 
exercising during the heat of the day and so close after the heavy 
noon meal. It also provides a time when the boys may rest quietly, 
write letters, read stories, and play games such as dominoes or 
checkers. The camp store is also open for thirty.minutes during the 
rest period. Boys-are limited in their spending. 
Optional and Free Period. ‘The boy plans his own time. Some of the 
many things he may do have already been described under the 
programme of activities both organized and unorganized. 
Afternoon Swim. Same plan as morning except that water games 
and competition are emphasized instead of instruction. 
Recall. Prepare for drill and inspection. 
Drill. The simplest individual and squad movements should be per- 
formed, each troop in charge of an adult leader. 
Retreat: An official ceremony including salute to the flag, general re- 
ports, and passing in review. Some camps may make this elaborate 
while others have only a simple cermony. 
Directors’ Conference, followed by tent or cabin inspection. 
Supper. Procedure same as other meals, noon meal in particular. 
Campus games: This is a free period that is usually occupied with 
games and boat races. The nature of the games has been explained 
under the programme of activities.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 141 
8:15. Camp Fire: The term Camp Fire is used in a general way and does 
not always imply a real fire itself. Sometimes the meeting is in the 
assembly hall as in the case of Stunt Night. The campfire itself, how- 
ever, when offered adds something additional to the campers’ 
programme. This is in the atmosphere of awe and sober reflection that 
comes over everyone who sits around a typical evening campfire out in 
the quiet of the woods. It is one of the most important and im- 
pressive features of camp life. Already, under the heading ‘‘Programme 
of Activities,” advice has been given as to means of filling up this 
period. It should start out’ with enthusiasm aroused by songs, jokes, 
stunts, and things that furnish light entertainment. A good story 
along mystery, biographical, or heroic lines always has a place. A 
short inspirational talk such as “Playing the Game,” “Hitting the Line 
Hard,” or “Don’t Die on Third” makes a good conclusion. As a 
general rule one night is set aside during each section of the camp 
for a minstrel show in which the directors contribute the talent, and 
for a stunt night in which each troop prepares an attraction. Some 
suggestions for stunts are recitations, music, shadow-graph, the clown 
act, circus, athletic pyramid, take-offs on the camp directors, magical 
tricks, and the like. 
9:00. Tattoo—call to quarters 
g:15. Adjutant’s roll call. 
9:20. Taps. All lights out. 
Special features such as occur occasionally but not daily should 
be planned far enough in advance to secure their effective running- 
off. As a general rule the day’s programme aims to be both educa- 
tional and recreational while the evening’s programme plans to offer 
entertainment and.song, and inspiration such as comes from the 
heart-to-heart talks given at the camp fire. Necessarily, the evening 
activities must not be routine, but must offer something new to be 
sprung at each occasion. ’ 
The Sunday programme will have to be modified in minor par- 
ticulars from that given above. The morning classes are omitted, 
as are the afternoon games. A Sunday school service is given either 
at 11 o’clock or at 11:30 in case the morning swim is dispensed with. 
Many visitors usually attend the Sunday dinner. (A good idea is 
to have the boys decorate the tables with wild flowers on this occa- 
sion.) The rest of the programme remains practically unchanged. 
Visitors must not be allowed to come at random, or the regular 
schedule of the camp will be interfered with too much. Except for 
Sunday, the visitors: should not come until late in the afternoon. 
They can then stay for supper and visit with their boys in the free 
period of the evening.

  142 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Individual Camp Emblems 
Among the various stimuli of interest the idea of awarding a 
camp honor or a camp monogram for particularly conspicuous 
activity in camp affairs is one of the most common and also one of 
the most successful. At the Toledo, Ohio, Boy Scout Camp, an 
honorary society has been founded which for eight years has been 
uniformly successful in arousing curiosity and interest. It is known 
as the Order of the Mystic Circle and the following are the require- 
ments for admission as taken from the Campers’ Manual issued to 
each boy who goes to camp. 
In order to get the first degree a camper must pass three requirements in 
each of the following divisions. To secure the highest award, all of the fol- 
lowing must be passed: 
Mental Test 
1. Pass from Tenderfoot to Second Class, or from Second Class to First 
Class, or at least four Merit Badges. 
2. Demonstrate by actual making, ten signs used in scoutcraft. 
3. Name and point out ten different trees and six constellations of stars. 
4. Write an acceptable article of at least four hundred words for the camp 
newspaper—it must be snappy, newsy material. 
Physical Tests 
1. Take part in all athletic games, playing regularly on an official team 
recognized by the athletic director. 
2. Take morning plunge at least six out of every seven in camp. 
3. Swim 50 yards or learn to swim 25 feet while in camp. 
4. Go on a 24-hour hike, cooking meals. 
Moral Tests 
1. Attend Sunday services. 
2. Write home at least four times a week. 
___—3. Show self-control, reverence, and faithfulness in carrying out camp 
~~ duties. 
4. Unknown. 
Social Tests 
1. Demonstrate constant loyalty to and obedience to camp leaders. 
2. Demonstrate entertaining ability by taking part in at least one camp- 
fire a week while in camp. 
3. Volunteer services at least five times a week while in camp. 
4. Spend at least two hours a week in some unselfish service for the improve- 
ment of the camp. 
Other camps have somewhat similar qualifications for awarding 
honors or emblems. One plan is to give different colored emblems
-P-A-G-E-151
  CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 143 
according to the points that are made. They may be insignia to be 
worn or may be ribbons. In general, the qualifications attempt to 
stimulate personal improvement and abilities, neatness, a volunteer 
spirit for irksome tasks, a cooperative spirit in getting into the troop 
competitions, and a respectful attitude towards the superiors. 
Unit Competition 
There are many advantages in having the campers divided into 
units. For instance, if certain equipment is limited, the programme 
can be arranged so that each troop will complement but never conflict 
with the plans of the others. Again, there is the reason that the 
spirit of rivalry can be stirred up, so that the game element can be 
inserted into many things which ordinarily would be looked upon as 
work. 
There are several ways in which the camp can be divided for 
group competition. In events where large numbers are not essential, 
inter-tent rivalry can be used. In most cases, however, the larger 
unit is desirable, and troop (sometimes called company or tribe) 
competition results. 
Naturally, the first thought of using competition is in connection 
with games and contests. But there are many awards that can be 
used in connection with more drab functions. For instance, the troop 
having the best table can have a banner hanging over them, this 
emblem to be moved elsewhere when another table wins. Likewise 
the troop passing the best tent inspection can have a pennant dis- 
played on its totem pole as long as entitled to it. The troop showing 
the best form at drill and retreat can be given the honor of furnish- 
ing the detail to raise and lower the flag for the ensuing day. These 
rewards, trivial as they may seem, do add extra satisfaction to the 
knowledge of a job well done. 
These rewards need not only be counted as an end in themselves, 
to be given out temporarily from day to day. Points can be given 
for each achievement, and then the total of the points can be con- 
sidered over a period of a week or so in a final rating. Then the 
troop possessing the highest number of points can be announced, 
possibly at Sunday noon or evening when many of the parents are 
present. The winning troop can be further awarded with a special 
table treat. 
The following plan, as used in the troop contest of the Detroit 
Boy Scouts of Camp Brady, will serve to illustrate the use of a point 
system for group scoring:
-P-A-G-E-152
  144. THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Conditions of Contest: 
1. Inspection of Tents. Morning inspection will not count toward the 
troop contest. For the winning tent in evening inspection 10 points will be 
awarded. Five points will be awarded for every tent securing an honorable 
» mention at evening inspection. 
2. Inspection of Tables. Three points will be awarded to the troop whose 
members win first place at table inspection after any meal. One point for 
honorable mention after any meal. Where members of different troops eat 
at the same table, each troop represented will receive the number of points won 
by that table. 
3. Details. Ten points will be regarded as a basis for scoring. One 
point will be deducted from each daily score for each defect in performance of 
daily duties. 
4. Advancement. One point will be awarded for each credit slip in ad- 
vancement toward first or second class rank. Five points will be awarded each 
troop for each member completing first class or a merit badge while in camp. 
Three points will be awarded each troop for each member who completed 
second class tests while in camp. 
5. Drill. This event will be judged by a committee to be selected each 
week by the officer in charge of the Sunday afternoon review. “Twenty-five 
points—first place; 15 points—second place; 5 points—third place:—will be 
the scores. A troop will be judged on its performance during its whole time 
on the field. 
6. Baseball. Troop leaders will arrange for a baseball tournament each 
week. First, second, and third places in this tournament will receive 25, 15, 
and 5 points respectively. 
7. Stunt Night. A committee of officers to be selected by the officer in 
charge of stunt night each week will select the first, second, and third places 
in this competition. The points will be 25, 15, and 5 points respectively. 
8. Field Day. This event will be run like a regular track meet with points 
for the meet counting 5 for a first, 3 for a second, and 1 for a third. The 
troops which secure the first, second, and third highest number of points in 
aggregate will receive 25, 15, and 5 points respectively. 
The Problem of Discipline : 
The teachings of the Scout Law and Oath, in themselves, help 
make the problem of discipline easier. If the director has a 
thorough knowledge of boy nature, and possesses the right type of 
personality, he will be able to solve the problems of this kind which 
are inevitable at every camp. A discussion of some of the methods 
that have been used by camps as disciplinary measures may be 
helpful. 
Among the most successful of these is the depriving of the 
offender of the privilege of swimming for a number of days, or of 
dessert at meals. Another satisfactory scheme is the ‘meditation 
log,” to which offenders are sentenced for varying periods. This
-P-A-G-E-153
  CAMP LIFE IN THE PLAY PROGRAMME 145 
log is usually placed in some very conspicuous place and when con- 
fined to it, one is not permitted to talk or amuse himself in any way. 
For many of the group offenses, like talking or “rough house” 
after taps, or bad behavior at the table, the most effective plan is to 
punish the troop as a whole, even though only one or two individuals 
may have been the main disturbing factors. The troop is punished 
by depriving the members of some one thing especially favored, such 
as swimming privileges for the day, or of some special treat in the 
way of ice-cream or watermelon at meal time. A strong lesson is 
conveyed to the offenders when they realize that innocent boys have 
had to suffer with them. Along this line, discipline can be helped by 
including it as a factor in the individual and troop scoring plans. 
There has been widespread discussion as to the advisability of 
such work as digging a stump or chopping wood as a punishment. It 
certainly is effective as such, but the opponents of this practice claim 
that it harms the true view of the nobility of labor. 
Many camps have courts composed of judges selected by the 
boys. A standard list of rules is drawn,up and each has a definite 
punishment attached for its violation. In the majority of cases this 
method of trial and punishment by the boys themselves has been par- 
ticularly effective. 
In the real serious cases, and especially if the offense has been 
repeatedly committed, the boy should be sent home. There is little 
time in camp for the officers to devote to individual corrective 
measures arising from insubordination or from the disobeying of 
the regulations which have in mind the safety of the campers.

CHAPTER VII 
ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
The Present Situation 
The youth who is being brought up in an. environment of 
democratic ideals will always enjoy athletic sports and exercises 
better than any possible form of gymnastics. (It is a good thing that 
this is true; for, in addition to abounding health, the type of 
character that a democracy prizes—energetic, self reliant, resource- 
ful, and social—is produced by vigorous play.) Therefore, one 
would say offhand that athletics should comprise’ the large part of 
physical education in our schools} But it does not. Athletics, as it 
exists to-day, means the public performances of a few carefully 
trained members of the student body;. and these alone receive 
physical education in the view of what it should mean. On the 
other hand, for the great rank and file of our high school students, 
physical education means the less enjoyable exercises of the gym- 
nasium, performed two or three times a week according to the re- 
quirements. Being less enjoyable, the gymnastic exercises are looked 
upon as a task, and executed perfunctorily, so that it is a question 
whether or not the great body of students receive any physical edu- 
cation at all. Exercises performed without mental relaxation and 
inspiration are really drudgery, not physical education, because the 
very definition of the latter describes it as seeking the ‘‘recreation, 
education and development of the individual.” This, then, is the 
big problem: to make athletics really mean a bigger part of physical 
education by the opening of its advantages to the enjoyment and 
benefit of all. 
The disparity between the members ‘actually participating in 
athletics and the student body as a whole, has been so great that 
athletics and physical education are not even considered as 
synonymous; and are now looked upon as separate departments of 
the school, even so far apart as to have separate teachers. Nearly 
all the large schools to-day have a coach and also a physical director. 
The coach is usually a regular teacher in the school, with his 
147
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
programme lightened, so that he can carry athletics in addition. The 
physical director has charge of the gymnasium, compulsory exercise, 
examinations, corrective work, and all that physical education means 
in its broadest sense to-day. At present he really is the physical 
educator, but he is not accomplishing what should be done, because 
his programme lacks sports and games almost entirely, and this is what 
the American youth wants and needs. This does not mean to imply 
that gymnastics should be ignored entirely. A judicious blending of 
gymnastic exercises with an athletic programme would help in adding 
the qualities of formal discipline to the extent desired, also bodily 
development in posture, poise, and strength; but athletics should 
come first and predominate. When athletics, including recreative 
sports, team games, and track and field, can occupy the main 
programme of the physical director—and he will need assistants— 
then athletics will come to mean physical education. This, at 
present, it does not mean at all. 
Athletics, in its present meaning, is one of the social activities-of 
the school. As such, it occupies a very important place and is easily 
justifying its existence: By representing the school-as a whole, the 
athletic team, whether of football, baseball, or track, makes for a 
strong school spirit as no o other agency can. It makes the school a 
chance for expression comes at a perio en the age | interests of- 
youth demand a pledge of loyalty to something. — 
This, then, ‘is the situation as it exists to- day. Athletic: ds 
for what is the most prominent social activity of the school, and---- 
incidentally, physical education for the few who represent the teams; 
whereas physical education signifies the compulsory attendance a 
few times a week at the gymnasium, supplemented by such advice as 
the physical instructor is able to give in matters of hygienic habits, 
or in outlining corrective exercises for the individual. 
THE TWO PROBLEMS 
Why are educators dissatisfied with the above situation? First, 
because many evils have crept into athletics, which have tended to 
offset its limited value as physical education, and also its wider value 
as a social institution; secondly, because the so-called physical educa- 
tion for the masses does not give them the type of exercise they want 
and need the most. oe
-P-A-G-E-157
  
ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 149 
Fortunately, helpful agencies are at work which are rapidly 
bettering the above situation, both as regards athletics and physical 
education. : 
The reform movement is first eliminating, by both direct and 
indirect means, the evils that have caused the many agitations against 
athletics in its present status. Of course, before athletics is good for 
the many, it must be made good for the few. That is why the purg- 
ing of present-day athletics from its evils is necessary before athletics 
can be extended and incorporated into the wider and ideal plan of use 
by the many. These evils are being corrected so rapidly that the 
school administrator to-day is in sympathy with athletics as a social 
agency, whereas ten or fifteen years ago he was hostile in his attitude. 
Historical Sketch 
When one studies the history of secondary school athletics in 
this country, he finds that all the problems inherent to-day are 
traceable to a lack of proper supervision. Sports sprang up so 
rapidly that school authorities lacked the insight to grasp the educa- 
tional advantages that were offered, rather looking upon them as 
amusements, and outside the province of the school. Roughly, the 
history of school sports is a recital of the different stages they have 
gone through as regards the attitude of school authorities toward 
them. Between 1880-1890 came their sudden and rapid growth, 
with opposition on the part of schoolmen, and refusal to permit boys 
to represent the school, until the dangerous misuse of leisure time 
led to toleration. Between 1890-1900 came toleration as a necessary 
evil—but matters did not improve. Tehis is the period of student- 
manager control, with its train of ensuing evils. Teams competing 
under the school name brought such discredit to the school, and such 
annoyance to the teacher, that by 1900 athletics faced either reform 
or abolition. Educational journals between 1900-1905) are filled 
with articles on the question. The decision went in favor of reform; 
and, as a result, we have the organized athletics of to-day, with evils 
still existent but fast on their way to disappearance. The miracle of 
reform took the course of faculty supervision and control—over 
twenty years late, but luckily not too late. There are other agencies 
operating but this is the vital one. At first faculty control took the 
form of strict rules, with penalties attached for violation, but to-day 
social conditions are being created out of which violations seldom 
appear. To-day’s type of discipline over athletics is not the one 
which believes in frequent punishments for violations of the rules; 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
150 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
but is the preventive type which makes punishment seldom needed. 
It is the better way, and makes for harmony and mutual understand- 
ing between the faculty and the student body. As a result, athletics 
is serving to further educational aims to-day and in ever increasing 
power. 
The Fight Against Athletic Evils 
The most serious of the charges that have been made against 
athletics are given below, along with the constructive remedies that 
have been used in each case. 
Only a Few Are Reached 
Athletics has been for the few, not the many; and, instead of 
seeking to train all to moderate accomplishment, has trained the 
strong to excellence. This is a valid criticism if applied rightly. 
However, as long as athletics is justified as a social agency it is serv- 
ing its purpose by training the teams that publicly compete. There- 
fore this criticism must fall at the doors of the Department of 
Physical Education which has as its duties the welfare of all; and 
now that the public is demanding athletics for all, it is the Physical 
Education Department that should meet this demand. 
The Training is One-Sided 
Athletics does not aim to train the strong to symmetrical 
strength, but rather to surpassing achievement in one sport. The 
boy is taught and coached along one line: if a good jumper, he does 
nothing but jump, in order that he may win in his event. Athletics 
must confess to this fault. It is being overcome to a certain extent 
by giving badge tests of different grades, first, second, and third, 
which compel the individual to pass from four to ten different re- 
quirements in order to gain the reward. The tests require versatility 
in different varieties of skill, and tend to make the athlete practice 
on the thing in which he is weak, in order to pass the test—if he fails 
in one requirement, he fails in all. Again, in the track meets, all- 
around events such as the pentathlon and decathlon are being given 
more honor than the individual ones. The new idea of sport for 
sport’s sake, with the winning element less essential, will cause the 
athlete to give up the extra time he has been putting into proficiency 
for one event, into added recreation which will come from a change 
to another field. And, most important of all, physical education in
-P-A-G-E-159
ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS ISI 
its educational sense will mean competent supervision which will 
properly classify all individuals, whether on the athletic team or not, 
and will require a necessary time on exercises which are needed to 
round out. 
Injuries and Over-Strain 
Violent forms of athletic exercise cause injuries and tendencies 
to overstrain. This element will always be present in athletics, but 
the danger can be greatly minimized by supervision which will in- 
spect and properly train the players. The chance of the disability 
has always been greatest with those not physically fitted. Medical 
inspection, which is now being universally required for competition 
on first, second, or class team, is an absolute need. Again, proper 
supervision is classifying participants so that they will be equally 
matched in strength and endurance. Under student management it 
was not an uncommon thing to find a high school team playing a 
normal or college team; but that day has passed. Another factor 
which helps is supervision in giving proper training along physio- 
logical lines. The old type of coach applied college methods to 
high school boys; the new type realizes that high school boys are 
needing much of their energy in growth, and therefore cannot stand 
as rigid and intensive training as the college athlete. Lastly, the 
rules of the games are being adjusted to the age needs of school 
boys. For instance, the “Basket Ball Guide Book” gives twenty- 
minute halves with ten-minute intermission between as the regula- 
tion period of the game; but in the case of school boys, four eight- 
minute quarters are recommended, with two-minute intermissions be- 
tween the quarters as well as the ten-minute rest between the halves. 
While the immediate supervision has been much improved, there is 
still a chance to take issue with the way in which some associations 
conduct meets and tournaments. At many districts and state track 
meets a boy is allowed to enter into too many events. The popularity 
of basket ball tournaments, too, has resulted in an undue strain on 
the players, for alot of games must be played ina short time. The 
basket ball tournaments should not prolong the season unduly, as 
they do now, when winning teams become over-zealous and emerge 
from local and state honors, to take part in interstate gatherings. 
The objection is that these tournaments usually follow close on one 
another, and the players are sacrificed in health for the sake of the 
momentary glory.

  %52 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
No Scientific Basis 
Athletics is not systematically based on the laws of physiology 
and hygiene, and intellectual growth; and therefore fails to meet age 
interests as well as graded gymnastics. This is the argument of 
foreign propagandists who are seeking to institute their respective 
gymnastic systems into our schools. But this argument is misplaced. 
It should be directed at the elementary school in case team play is 
stressed there. No one, however, will deny that the pupils in attend- 
ance at the high school are in the adolescent years of life, and the 
laws of physiology and psychology both show that this is a period of 
rapid organic growth, accompanied by gang spirit—which means 
loyalty, codperation, and sociability. If there is anything that com- 
petitive sports and games certainly accomplish, it is the taking care 
of the needs of the youth at this stage. So that this “‘evil” is really 
not an evil at all. 
Lowers Scholarship 
Athletics is injurious from the mental standpoint, because it 
requires such an amount of time and energy that the players on the 
teams cannot keep up with their studies. This practically obsolete 
evil dates back to the days of student control when brawn and 
strength competed for the school under the guise of taking penman- 
ship, or art, in order to be eligible for the team. ®ut to-day the 
above charge is far from being true. Many statistical experiments 
among the high schools show that athletes_as a class outrank the 
general mass of students in scholarship. And the experiences of 
many athletic coaches would lead to the conclusion that too much 
energy is not used up, by showing that members of football teams— 
which sport takes the most time and energy of any—gain on an 
average of from four to six pounds during the season; and this 
indicates that energy is increased rather than decreased. In one 
way, only, in infrequent individual cases, does it seem possible that 
athletics may be detrimental to school work; and then,-not- forthe 
reason that the games take up time and energy needed for studies, 
but because the person wastes his free time by allowing his mind 
to concentrate on athletics instead of his school work. The writer 
believes, however, that a pupil who has a high regard for his studies 
will be a good student regardless of his outside activities, and that 
this criticism is manifestly unfair in that poor students also are 
found in the dramatic clubs, debating societies, and orchestras, and~ 
yet these activities are not blamed for cases of poor showing in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 153 
classroom. On the whole it does not seem a serious thing as long 
as the averagéof the team nicimbers is above par; and the fault 
seems to lie in the individual, rather than in athletics. 
The Aim Is Wrong 
The aim of athletics is perverted and wrong; the end in view 
is victory, rather than social or intellectual advancement. This evil 
unfortunately exists, and is a serious one, as many faults of athletics 
are incidentally traceable to this one influence. It is one of the most 
troublesome heritages that have come down from the days of 
student management. The student manager, lacking support from 
his institution, went outside to get it. He found out early that win- 
ning teams brought crowds, and with crowds came gate receipts. 
In this way the professional spirit came in and even the faculty 
assumption of control has not been able to make athletics cease to 
be regarded as a source of revenue. This problem is a puzzling one. 
Yet English school boys, with compulsory athletics, and with the 
proper point of view, have shown one solution. Compulsory 
athletics, student subscription as the main financial support, and an 
understanding and sympathetic faculty—these are the things 
necessary. As soon as all students take part, athletics will assume 
its educational meaning; and when athletics does not have to depend 
for its existence upon the drawing of crowds, the necessity of a 
winning team will dwindle. Maryland has taken a step in the right 
direction by appropriating money for the Public School Athletic 
League. 
Coaches Not Best Type 
The coaches are not of the right type to influence growing young 
manhood. This charge was more true in the past than it is to-day. 
It was the overemphasizing of winning that led to the hiring of men 
of narrow training, and low social ideals, who were professionals in 
one line of sport, and who left the school as soon as their respective 
season was over. Because they did not have any permanent connec- 
tions with the school, there was no check over them; and even if 
their methods did lose them a position, the success of their team was 
the biggest recommendation they needed to get a new one. To-day, 
the situation is quite the reverse. Almost universally the coach is 
a regular member of the teaching faculty. He is made to under- 
stand that he is in a position to exert a beneficial moral influence over 
the athletes and the student body, and that his success will be judged
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
along other lines than the mere winning of games. This does not 
mean that it is not essential to have a good understanding of athletic 
games, because without that the coach could not be exerting the total 
influence that is possible; but success is not judged on winning alone. 
It is not an uncommon thing to-day to see sensational winning coaches 
discharged because of questionable tactics employed. At first it was 
a difficult thing to get regular teachers with athletic knowledge for 
the schools, because the university athletes were the only source to 
draw upon, and but a small proportion of them could be attracted 
by teaching salaries. But to-day it is different. Many prominent 
normal schools and universities have recently instituted courses for 
athletic coaches, and give credit for the same. ‘The classes in these 
courses are very largely composed of men who are not athletes. 
They receive theoretical instructions in the coaching of the various 
sports, in training, and in minor first aid. Many men who are not. 
athletes make very successful coaches, and as soon as this became an 
established fact, regular teachers on faculties were led to study 
athletic work during the summer terms. Some did it with the idea 
of coaching; others with the idea of being able to assist the coach. 
The result was beneficial to a wonderful extent in giving a closer re- 
lationship between the faculty and the athletic activities. But few 
“men preparing at normal schools to-day neglect to take these courses, 
and the small school has found much higher ideals as a result. 
Hitherto, the small schools have suffered most, because they have 
been unable to afford a coach, and consequently had to fall back for 
help from alumni or other temporary sources. But now the regular 
principal or teacher takes charge. 
Teaches Wrong Ideals 
Athletics has developed dishonesty, trickery, and unsportsman- 
like conduct, both on the part of the players and of the spectators, 
and by so doing has created a harmful moral atmosphere. Many 
things are contributing to make these assertions almost negative 
ones. The first thing is supervision, which means in the immediate 
sense strong leadership in building up wholesome play standards; 
and, more than that, means a school administration that will back 
the coach, whenever discipline is needed, as against the popular out- 
cry. The second thing is organization. By this is meant the group- 
ing of schools together in associations, so that all can compete under 
the same set of rules, and have an acceptable authority to judge on
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 155. 
questions of infringements of the rules. In the state of Michigan, 
the Michigan Interscholastic Athletic Association serves this pur- 
pose. It divides the schools into classes A, B, and C, according to 
size, and lays down definite rules regarding the basis on which schools 
can compete with each other. Smaller state organizations which fol- 
low in general the state rules are the district associations (such as the 
Saginaw Valley Conference), and the county associations (such as 
the Kent County Association), even down to city associations (as 
found in Detroit). In the case of the state associations the common 
penalty for violations of the established rules is suspension from 
games with other state schools for a period of one year. Common 
organization helps a great deal to remove mutual distrust, and the 
temptation to play “ringers,” etc., as each school knows that the 
other is playing under the same rules, and that there is no advantage 
in lax eligibility. The associations of some states even go a step 
farther by making out a certified list of officials who are known to 
be competent and fair, and compelling schools belonging to the 
association to choose from this list. In this way, one school cannot 
say that the other school tricked them and obtained a partisan 
official; and any complaints would have to be made against the 
association and its certified list—a thing not apt to be done. Proper 
supervision and organization deal with the above problems directly} 
but there is a still more powerful agency dealing indirectly with the 
solution: organized play in the elementary schools and on the play- 
ground, and movements of Boy Scout type. One needs only to look 
at the manner of scoring of games in these fields to know what high 
ideals are fostered. Thirty-five per cent sportsmanship; 25 per cent 
reliability; 40 per cent winning—this is the grading plan of the 
South Park playgrounds in Chicago. Detroit and Grand Rapids in 
Michigan use similar methods. Fouls committed by players against 
the rules count against sportsmanship; and so does jeering the 
Opponent or umpire, on the part of spectators. Such matters as con- 
forming with official regulations as regards compiling of weights and 
statistics, and appearance on time, count toward reliability. It seems 
inevitable that children coming from such a training as this will 
bring a new spirit—and a better one—into the high school. It seems 
inevitable that the ideals that have been created for them will endure, 
and that the remedies for evils in secondary athletics will be worked 
out by inner forces within the youth, with but little need of external 
disciplinary force. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
156 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Result: Clean Athletics 
The preceding paragraphs have shown the need of competent 
supervision as being the fundamental basis upon which reformed 
athletics has been made a reality. Looking at the results, educators 
~ must certainly feel satisfaction in not having supinely abolished 
athletics because it contained forces working for evil results, but in 
having wrestled with the problems in a good old American way, 
and won. Athletics is not entirely free from criticism to-day, but the 
reform movement is working all the while. Athletics may safely be 
said to mean physical education: for those who are fortunate to re- 
ceive its influences. 
Athletics for All: Features of the Movement 
But should educators stop here and be content? Athletics 
would not-yet be physical education for all as well as for the few. 
It is not the intention of this discussion to try to prove the beneficial 
results of athletics. It assumes that games and sports, properly 
controlled and directed, are a great factor in the development of 
youth, physically, mentally, and morally. Therefore, athletics has 
the broader purpose of reaching the mass of the student body, and 
then only will it take its true place as a factor in physical education. 
Having tackled the one problem successfully, educators are tirelessly 
working on the new one. It is a big problem, and demands far- 
seeing vision. Several schemes for universal athletics have success- 
fully passed the experimental stage and are being applied more and 
more as interest awakens. Some of them may be familiar. 
The Efficiency Test 
This provides opportunity for every boy regardless of ability. 
It is non-competitive in the sense that the student does not compete 
against other individuals; but competitive in the sense that he 
competes against his own record. This scheme is borrowed from 
the playgrounds, but the high school has not worked it out as fully 
as has the elementary school. Different grade systems of various 
cities have events numbering anywhere from three to fourteen in 
the test. Detroit has fourteen. The standards of accomplishment 
are graded, and badges or buttons given as the student passes from 
one grade to another. The badge test of the New York elementary 
schools is the best known throughout the country and attempts have 
been made to have it as a universal standard. As said before, high
-P-A-G-E-165
  
ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 157 
schools are experimenting with this idea, but the standards of 
accomplishment have not been tested sufficiently as yet. The 
Y. M. C. A. test is fairly well suited to high school boys. The 
standard test has value because it furnishes an incentive to the indi- 
vidual to improve his physical accomplishments. 
Mass Athletics 
This plan, also, is borrowed from the playgrounds and element- 
ary schools; but the secondary schools have already used it success- 
fully, and the universities have even been led to experiment with it. 
The Western Conference has attempted competition in mass athletics, 
and although only a few of the schools took part, it shows the extent 
to which the idea has spread. The class competes as a unit and the 
average record is the class record. This is compared with the class 
record of an opposing class, or with a previous record of its own. 
The events are usually similar to those of the efficiency test, and re- 
quire all-around ability, and consequently well-rounded practice in- 
stead of specialized practice. One good feature of this plan is that 
the stronger and more athletic boys of the class will coach and train 
the weaker ones in order that the latter can improve their records, 
and thus raise the class average. Trophies in the way of banners or 
cups are usually given to the winning class. The New York state 
syllabus of physical training has a fine list of events suitable for this 
purpose. The Michigan syllabus, under high school events, gives 
tables also. In considering the future of mass athletics, the follow- 
ing conclusions may be stated: mass athletics arouse spontaneous 
interest only when the members of the group competing are well 
known to each other, as in the case of the grade room, or fraternity. 
The attempts at using whole high schools, or whole universities, as 
a unit for competition have failed because the interest is too im- 
personal. One of the greatest possibilities of mass athletics lies in 
the opportunities it affords for statistical tests to show comparisons 
of different cities, or of different sections of the same city. 
Credit 
The above two tests are fine as suited to the individualistic type 
of athletic event, but do not cover the element of team play as found 
in games. So other means must be used in addition to the above. 
No other one helps as much as giving credit for work in athletics. 
Detroit high schools give two hours of credit to members of the 
first and second teams, and one hour to the members of “house” or
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
class teams. Grand Rapids gives one hour credit. Cities in other 
states give credit to the approximate amount of one-tenth of the 
graduation requirements. 
Increased Facilities 
Until recently lack of space and equipment was such a hindrance 
that even the first team found difficulties in being able to play. Now, 
however, almost every large high school owns its gymnasium and 
athletic field; and careful faculty management has conserved the 
athletic funds so that equipment is possible for numbers. 
Minor Games 
To a certain extent, the minor sports are helping to make 
athletics open to larger numbers. Many schools have recently added 
such games as soccer, tennis, volley ball, hockey, cross-country, and 
swimming to their list of sports and have organized representative 
teams for each of them. This gives plenty of opportunity to the 
student who desires to take part in athletics, even though he is not 
good enough to make the football or the baseball team. 
New Games 
Along this line, mention may be made of new games which have 
been invented and which require a minimum of space and equipment, 
and which are very popular. Volley ball and playground ball are two 
examples. 
Classifying Players 
Chicago’s plan of having heavyweight and lightweight divisions 
in its inter-school competition is helping in increasing the scope of 
participants. This is following the playground plan of classifying 
players into groups according to size and age. In certain sports 
like boxing and wrestling, several divisions can be made—as many 
as seven. 
Rural Play Festivals 
Field days, tournaments, and “Olympiads,” as they are called, 
are becoming increasingly popular with smaller schools. With small 
schools in rural communities, the problem of numbers is not a difficult 
one, as nearly all the boys are needed in order to fill the places on the 
team. The problem is to get them to organize teams by providing 
something to look forward to. An opportunity for contesting, with  
-P-A-G-E-167
  ATHLETICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 159 
the minimum of expense, is provided in a practical and attractive 
way by the “Olympiad.” One has only to read the “Souvenir 
Programme” of the Kent County Athletic League in Michigan to see 
how this is so. Frequently, normal schools are found cooperating 
in building up a healthy interest in rural communities. 
The Intramural Idea 
The intramural idea has been growing rapidly and is an innova- 
tion of the university which the public school is finding well worth 
while to study and incorporate. Many high schools have already 
undertaken extensive programmes along this line. The purpose and 
aims of Intramural athletics are explained later, as are the many 
methods used in successful organization. The awarding of points 
for participation with additional ones according to the final stand- 
ing of each helps to keep up the interest in the classes; especially if the 
combined totals of all sports are compared at the end of the year, 
and an award made to the class showing the highest all-around 
efficiency record. 
Miscellaneous 
Additional incentives are found in the plan of organizing honor 
societies, with membership including members of the first and second 
teams, and also of class teams; in the awarding of trophies, both 
class and individual, to the winning class teams; in the picking of 
“All Star” teams from the class organizations, and giving publicity 
to the same in the school publication; and, lastly, by means of the 
graded diploma, which lists the student's social activities along with 
his scholarship record. 
Compulsory Athletics 
In conclusion, it may be stated, almost as a certainty, that 
athletics and games improved and organized as they are to-day offer 
physical education and its many advantages to all students desiring 
the same. The only ones now being neglected by its opportunities 
are those who have no desire to play. There is no way of reaching 
these students except through compulsion, and compulsion in such 
cases is the only thing. One may wonder at that, and express doubt 
that compulsory play could be recreational or hygienic, but the proof 
is present to show that for this type of student it is indeed of value. 
Studies at the normal schools of Michigan, taken since compulsory 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED .PLAY 
physical education to the extent of four hours went into effect, show 
that many persons of non-athletic ability or interests have found the 
play periods enjoyable ones. The reason for this change is a 
peculiarly human one. With athletics optional, the boy who is over- 
studious, and wrapt up in a desire for scholastic honors, regards 
time spent in play as wasted. He would enjoy playing if some end 
were apparent. His case in its relation to athletics is the same as 
that of the average student in his relation to the classroom. If the 
teacher said to the class, ‘‘Here is some outside reading that it would 
be well for you to do, if you wish to—it isn’t necessary and you will 
not get credit for doing it, but you ought to read it for your own 
benefit,’ how many members would do the work? The studious 
ones! The others would regard it as wasted from their recreation 
period. And so it is with athletics: merely saying that participation 
is beneficial, will not induce the non-athletic students to give it the 
necessary time. But as soon as they understand that athletic periods 
are part of the regular work, and that they must be present, there 
is no option, and consequently all reluctance to go to the playground 
vanishes. It is then a regular part of their work, and their minds 
are free from the thought that they are wasting some of their time. 
It is a natural trait that everyone should desire reward for what is 
done. 
Conclusion 
Three aims have now been discussed. By reform, athletics for 
the few is being placed beyond the reach of criticism; by new 
opportunities and incentives, play is being extended to all those 
desirous of participating; and by compulsion, the small part of the 
student body wholly lacking this desire can ultimately be reached. 
With the gradual accomplishment of the aims involved, athletics will 
more and more come to mean the bigger part of physical education.

CHAPTER VIII 
ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
The Two General Phases 
College athletics finds itself in much the same situation as 
athletics in secondary schools. Overshadowing all other phases of 
physical exercise is the attention, publicity, and financial expenditure 
given to the teams that are chosen to represent the school in 
matches with rival institutions. For this competition a few picked 
men are chosen and these compose what is known as the varsity 
team—the word ‘Varsity’ being a contraction of the word 
“University.” Many evils have arisen and continue to arise in this 
system. They are, however, being combated all the while. 
Until very recently the play needs and likings of all other 
students were neglected and the compulsory physical education 
meant that they were shunted into the gymnasium for a small re- 
quirement of formal work. This brings us to the second problem 
discussed under the secondary school system, that of extending 
athletic competition to a wide use by the student body as a whole. 
Late years have seen a great extension of opportunities to take part 
in activities of play nature, through the placing of games in the 
gymnasium hour, and through the development of competition be- 
tween the different classes and organizations among the students. 
Athletics of the latter nature have been given the name 
“Intramural,” the literal meaning of which is “within the walls,” 
taking us back to the olden days when all towns and cities were 
surrounded by walls, and now applied in symbolic meaning to the 
university. Discussion of intramural athletics is postponed until 
later in this chapter. 
The System of Intercollegiate Athletics 
There is no need to give a full discussion of college athletics as 
practically all the features of secondary athletics, already discussed, 
apply just as much to the athletics of the university. There is the 
same inter-school competition only there are greater distances’ to 
travel; there is the spectacle of the game, except that crowds are 
162
-P-A-G-E-171
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 163 
_ increased a score or more times; there is the great use of athletics 
as a stimulus for school loyalty, binding together alumni, not of one 
city or district, but of the whole country. Publicity is magnified; 
the records of the athletes and scores of the games become a sec- 
tional and national affair instead of a local or state one. Wonder- 
fully kept athletic fields and clubhouses, highly paid and specialized 
athletic coaches and trainers, further testify to the extent of inter- 
collegiate athletics as an institution. The football spectacle brings 
crowds, with bands, banners, pennants, flowers, yells, and songs. 
The annual Army and Navy game is a great social affair for the 
high dignitaries of the Nation. The football game is given a promi- 
nence rivaling the old Olympic festival or knightly tournament in 
their days of ascendency. Some prejudiced critics compare the 
spectacle to that of the old Roman arena at its worst. This is biased 
and unfair; and the comparison cannot be made without admitting 
that the whole structure of our own society is crumbling into de- 
generacy; for disgraceful games, whether of Greece or Rome, or 
any other society, have only flourished when the people as a whole 
have been plunged into vice. Surely we cannot admit for a moment 
a comparison that likens this energetic virile country of ours to a 
senile empire. 
The Commercializing of Intercollegiate Athletics 
The very hold that intercollegiate athletics maintains upon the 
American public is the main reason that it has been diverted into a 
vast money-making enterprise. 
This commercializing of athletics has, in turn, manifested itself 
in an inordinate desire to win, in order that large crowds can be 
drawn for all occasions: and accordingly as mammoth crowds of 
50,000 people or more are drawn, there is a scramble for choice 
seats, out of which ticket speculation arises; there is a charge for 
admission rivaling that found at professional exhibitions; and 
financial drives take place among the alumni and other supporters to 
build huge stadiums that will not only guarantee ample seating 
capacity for years to come, but will outrival anything previously in 
existence. This emphasis on the financial end of the game brings 
in a professional spirit and a toleration of ethical standards that 
make difficult the efforts of those idealists who strive to preserve 
school athletics as an amateur institution in spirit as well as in name. 
There is this to be said in defense of the placing of college 
athletics on such a business basis with the main emphasis on gate re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
164 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
ceipts: a large amount of money is obtained that could not be 
secured through public taxation. The administrators of colleges find 
this a practical consideration that silences much of their condemna- 
tion of the professional practices that creep in. This defense does 
carry the powerful argument that through it collegiate athletics are 
practically made self supporting, and many minor sports and 
intramural activities that could not otherwise be carried on are 
enabled to be maintained. 
Present-Day Problems of Intercollegiate Athletics 
In a manner similar to that described under secondary schools, 
many evils arose in the early days of intercollegiate athletics, have 
been fought just as earnestly by educators, and have been gradually 
eliminated. Most of these have already been discussed, but there 
are a few evils that are distinctly related to the college. In general, 
all these go back to one thing—the extensive commercializing of 
athletic competition. 
Proselyting 
First among these is the evil known as proselyting. Proselyting 
refers to the inducements offered by colleges and universities to get 
promising high school athletes to attend their respective schools. 
These inducements are often made by athletic authorities of the 
school, who offer monetary consideration in the way of free tuition, 
board and room, or concessions in the way of snap jobs. Even 
when the athletic authorities refrain from searching out athletes, 
the way is not barred for over-enthusiastic alumni to do the same 
thing, even to the extent of personally footing the bills. The ex- 
cessive competition to secure “ready made’’ athletes results in 
mutual suspicion that the other school has obtained certain star 
athletes through some secret offer or bribe, and this suspicion be- 
comes magnified in its circulation as a rumor. While such a situa- 
tion exists, it is impossible to judge a school fairly as to its athletic 
merits. Quite often a school with a small student body will rise 
to fame in the athletic world through teams that have been recruited 
in the above manner. This does not show the school’s true repre- 
sentative standing. It makes athletics a means for advertising, 
rather than for education. It places a premium on winning rather 
than preserving a friendly relationship with one’s natural rivals. It 
is a great waste of effort, for if all schools alike ceased their activities
-P-A-G-E-173
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 165 
along this line, each would get its fair share of good athletes in the 
long run. 
Professionalism 
Another serious problem is that of professionalism. An athlete 
who receives money for his services loses his amateur standing and 
becomes a professional. This evil is most felt in college circles, for 
the high school athlete is seldom proficient enough to be a financial 
attraction. The college code bars all professionals, but in the en- 
forcing of the law there has been a laxness owing to the fact that 
the sympathies of the great body of players, of spectators, and even 
of athletic and faculty administrators, are divided, more often being 
with the offender than against him. This is for the reason that the 
rule on professionalism is obsolete; it places the emphasis on small 
technicalities rather than on the spirit of truly amateur play. In its 
workings, if applied strictly, many innocent offenders are barred 
from all school competition, while others who knowingly violate all 
the amateur ideals still escape punishment by adopting the subter- 
fuges of playing under an assumed name, or accepting pay for an 
imaginary job. The difficulty of getting proof against athletes who 
are accused of having received money, has led one large athletic con- 
ference to legislate that any player who has participated in any non- 
scholastic game where admission is charged shall be rated a pro- 
fessional as regards school competition. This is a more workable 
law, but it brings professionalism perilously close to the varsity 
exhibitions, where admission is charged. 
Another objection to the present rule is that it favors the wealthy 
class, who do not need to earn money during the vacation periods in 
order to return to college, and have other sources of play open in 
the way of country clubs equipped with tennis, golf, and swimming 
facilities. These, the poorer boy does not have. Our colleges 
should be too democratic to make such discriminations. 
Of all the different sports, baseball causes the most trouble along 
this line. This is for the reason that baseball is a summer sport, 
coming at the time when the athletes are out of school on a long 
vacation. The last few years, however, have seen professional foot- 
ball and basket ball making inducements to the star school players, 
and this is a much more serious thing. No varsity players should be 
allowed to compete on outside organizations while the school year 
is in progress, for he is then doing an injustice to his school and to 
himself. The coach and trainer are giving him all the exercise he  
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
should’ possibly take, and if he attempts more, he is reducing his 
value to his teammates, and also taking chances of overstraining, be- 
sides neglecting his school work. Too, he is capitalizing the name 
of the university to his own ends, for professional football depends 
on college players with strong advertising power, to make a go of it. 
The college should attack all professionalism, not on the grounds 
of an athlete having received a monetary consideration sometime 
during his life, but because of the influence that inevitably follows 
contact with the professional games. The atmosphere of pro- 
fessional amusements is one of low standards of morals and sports- 
manship that result from money easily made and habits of loafing, 
and the college athlete who lingers in it cannot help but carry with 
him the same degenerating spirit when he comes back to his school 
teammates. The school player apes the professional. 
There are too many angles to the problems of professionalism 
to attempt to treat them all in a short discussion. The rule no doubt 
will be improved from time to time. When a fair rule is finally 
settled upon, it should be strictly enforced. This should be done 
through a campaign of education, among the student body par- 
ticularly ; and by a close cooperation with “other organizations that 
are striving to promote sport for sport’s sake. It should not be 
difficult to work in unison with the industrial concerns, where many 
school athletes work during the summers, because industrial recrea- 
tion departments, too, are interested in stamping out professional- 
ism, a menace which has largely disrupted all their broad plans for 
recreation among the employees. 
Scouting 
Scouting refers to the custom of sending a representative of the 
athletic association to attend all the games in which the opponents 
play, with the object of bringing back complete information about 
the strength and weakness of the opponents, both as regards indi- 
vidual players and the methods of strategy. Scouting is considered 
honorable and above-board; the rival institution expects such visitors 
and provides good seats for them as guests. The objection is that 
the cost of sending men to different sections of the country over 
each week-end has no justification except the desire to win. 
Gambling 
The effects of gambling are discussed elsewhere in this book. 
Suffice it to say, that gambling as it relates to college athletics can be
-P-A-G-E-175
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES . 167 
the least condoned of any type. First of all, is the reason that the 
student is risking his parent’s money and not his own. ‘Then, too, 
college athletics have a claim on the loyalty of their followers that is 
not true of the patrons of a professional sport. Gambling disinte- 
grates loyalty to the team, one of the things that should be preserved 
whether winning or losing as long as the players do their best. The 
student who loses money blames the team and the coach, but never 
himself. 
Unwise Schedules 
Long trips, barnstorming tours, and post-season games are relics 
of the professional spirit still clinging to our college games. The 
end sought in such cases is one of advertising. This certainly is true, 
for if an educational aim could be advanced, then weak teams would 
be sent on such sight-seeing trips, too, but such is not the case. The 
effect on the player’s studies can easily be seen. Schools which 
permit athletics to be used in this advertising are bound to allow 
low scholastic standards of the athletes at the same time. College 
athletics must be considered not as an end in themselves, but only 
as a contributor to the larger aims of the school, first of which is 
to give each student a sound course of study, and prepare him to be 
a successful individual and a public-spirited citizen. 
Tutoring 
Tutoring athletes who are behind in their work is a vexatious 
problem. Quite often the alumni contribute to a fund for this pur- 
pose in the event that the policy of the athletic authorities is against 
it. .Where there has been criticism against money being spent for 
tutoring, the idea has been tried out of having a number 
of good students organize themselves into a volunteer tu- 
toring corp. This scheme appeals to the loyalty of the students 
who help, but the initial enthusiasm almost invariably “peters out.” 
The athletes being tutored do not take the work seriously when 
faculty men are not giving it; and the helpers lose interest when they 
find that the lessons they have outlined have not been prepared. 
The first answer to tutoring is that the athlete should not need to be 
tutored. The practice periods and schedules should not encroach 
on his time so much that it is necessary to resort to such unusual 
methods. In justice to the athletic authorities it must be. said that 
in many cases the faculty, too, are forgetting that there should not 
be too much demand on the student’s time. Not infrequently the
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
coach has to keep his afternoon schedule lengthened out unduly in 
order to accommodate students whose class work runs late into 
the afternoon. 
The Training Table 
This evil, once formidable, has practically become non-existent. 
A number of years ago it was customary for the different schools 
to have the athletes eat together, and to pay the expenses of their 
board. Because of the objection made to this financial outlay, which 
verged on the professional idea, most of the leading conferences 
of the country abolished the training table. There is, however, 
much to say in favor of the training table; especially so, where the 
coach is forced to continue his practice so late that the players either 
miss their suppers at their regular boarding houses, or are forced to 
eat a cold meal hurriedly. Either this situation must be changed, 
or else some arrangement must be made which will allow the men to 
eat together at a convenient time, with special attention to the diet 
needed before games and after hard practices. 
The Good Side of Intercollegiate Athletics 
There are many bad things that can be said of our intercolle- 
giate athletics; there are more that are good, otherwise athletics 
would not have flourished and grown in spite of organized opposi- 
tion. The ideal situation, yet one which in many cases is being ap- 
proached to-day, is brought out below in the things that must be 
listed to the credit of varsity athletics. 
Varsity athletics has the opportunity of giving a valuable train- 
ing to the students fortunate enough to win a place on the team. 
Many lessons needed for life are learned. The mingling with other 
young men on the athletic field makes for a broad-minded man, as 
does the meeting with fellow opponents from other sections of the 
country. Added to the liberal spirit, is the spirit of sacrifice of self 
to the attainment of common ends, shared by all teammates alike, 
which brings in the lessons of cooperation, loyalty, and service. 
Examples of honesty, good will, friendliness, and courtesy come up 
daily, each to preach its little sermon of sportsmanship. Then, too, 
the dominating qualities—those of determination, of courage, of 
poise, of leadership—these, and many more of like nature are 
brought out in the participant. 
Indirectly, the varsity games serve in a larger way.. They serve
-P-A-G-E-177
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES _ 169 
as examples of skill for the onlooker to emulate, a feeling that is 
stirred in all spectators who are watching a performance of merit 
—ending in a desire to test out their own skill in a like manner. 
They show the highest degree of technique and teamplay; the be- 
ginner will be attracted by some special feat of skill, which he will 
keep in mind and practice to master for his own accomplishment. 
The varsity game is a stimulus for the participation of the great 
number of students who play on intramural teams, shown by the fact 
that the intramural interest is greatest in those sports the varsities 
have popularized. Varsity exhibitions keep the ideas of physical 
prowess alive in this age when the goal of success is one of seden- 
tary occupation. In every line of endeavor, whether it be art, music, 
science, business, or athletics, the outstanding figures who have 
achieved high attainment serve as the inspiration for those lesser 
lights who are starting out on their careers and seek examples to 
emulate and pattern after. 
Too, as Groos so strikingly brings out in his discussion of wit- 
nessing “‘fighting plays,” the spectators undergo the same sensations 
as those of the actual performers themselves. There are the tense 
moments just as the game is to commence, the breathless suspense 
and quiet. Then there is the struggle, in which the normal onlooker 
takes part. He wants one side to win; to that side he gives his 
loyalty. Groos says, “Inner imitation allows us to take part in fights 
through subjective participation in attack, defense, strategy, risk, 
victory, and defeat.” The elemental emotions are aroused in even 
the most sedate human being. The effect is even more far-reach- 
ing; for if the spectator undergoes the tension that follows the 
course of the struggle, and reverts himself back to his primitive self, 
he just as much must keep his civilized self uppermost. He must 
give credit to the opponent who has made a wonderful play, he 
must decry the unsportsmanlike act, he must be generous in victory 
and brave in defeat. The crowd, then, as well as players share in 
the emotional training that results from the athletic spectacle, and 
there is brought home to each of the members that make it up, the 
meaning of courage, loyalty, perseverance, poise, and self control. 
The ideals they hold in their hearts are demonstrated. 
It is the effect of the football game, or of baseball, or basket 
ball, upon the sympathies of the crowd that gives it what is perhaps 
its most important function of all in college life. The game breathes 
a personality into the institution of the school. It is the one thing 
in common that all students may share, no matter how diversified
-P-A-G-E-178
170 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
their interests otherwise. For this reason it affords the biggest ex- 
pression of college spirit—a thing that is not confined to the students 
alone. The old grads cling to and treasure this spirit, which for 
them furnishes many occasions for reunions, homecomings, and 
memories to linger over. Even during the war, the university men 
in the trenches, when writing home, never neglected to ask for news 
of the team, whose success meant to them the success of their 
school—their Alma Mater. 
The competition between two rival institutions, each bringing 
thousands of followers to the support of its respective team in the 
game, helps to break down sectional differences and bring about a 
friendly contact that results in more cosmopolitan and liberal 
mindedness on the part of those involved. 
Many schools have attempted the experiment of doing away 
with interschool athletics, but in almost every instance have found 
it necessary to restore them. It was found that the school spirit 
dwindled away until it became a nonentity. It was found that the 
students, lacking the chance for interest in week-end games of out- 
door and wholesome nature, found attractions of a vicious nature. 
Interschool athletics do serve as an outlet—a safety valve—for the 
enthusiasm and vigor of college boys. It replaces the old gang 
lawlessness which formerly manifested itself in town brawls, and in 
week-end trips to large cities. 
The things that have been mentioned are all expressions of in- 
direct and ideal results. There is the one practical thing that has 
been mentioned before; the use of the large sums of money which the 
public so willingly spends to see the varsities perform, to the building 
of athletic plants and gymnasiums and maintaining them, at practi- 
cally no cost whatsoever to the university. This does mean that 
money otherwise needed to keep facilities for physical exercise in 
running order, can be diverted to use in the upkeep of some other 
phase of the university’s work. 
The Factors in Athletics 
If one makes a close study of alll: athletics, he will find that it 
is made up of six factors, as follows: 
1. The players—anxious to win, but quite willing to adopt the examples 
of sportsmanship taught them. Unless professional influence has made itself 
felt, they are fine young men with high ideals of play, but of an age, however,
-P-A-G-E-179
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 171 
to be easily influenced by suggestion. The coach’s influence may be just as 
much for the bad as for the good. Too easily can the players be made to 
think that “to get” an opposing star player, is a part of the game. 
2. The coach—rabidly anxious to win, because his job depends on it. More 
often than not he is a peaceful, sociable being, who is forced by the existing 
situation to hunt up athletes, to tolerate professional ethics, and to give instruc- 
tions against the spirit of the rules. With him it is a case of “get the other 
fellow first, or he will get you.” He is the unfortunate victim of circum- 
stances, tossed about on the fickle current of success and defeat; one moment 
lauded to the skies, the next made to feel an outcast. 
3. The school-president—aware of the evils in athletics, yet willing to 
tolerate them if success can be obtained. He is anxious to build up the school, 
keep up a strong school spirit, and keep the alumni contented. Athletics to 
him is an advertising medium, therefore the school must win. 
4. The faculty—to blame for many of the evils that have come to be as- 
sociated with intercollegiate athletics ;—have been neglectful and have watched 
things develop wrongly with indifference or without interference ;—are the 
fairest minded of all people in their relation to the actual game for itself. 
They want to see a good game, regardless of which team wins. They want 
clean sport. They are interested in the athlete, except when the latter acts 
as a professional rather than as a “school boy.” ‘They are resentful of the 
coaching staff being given a higher salary basis. 
5. The student body—want to beat their rival and are apt to be dis- 
satisfied otherwise ;—easily susceptible to influence, and if the policy of the 
school authorities and athletic people is to consider “sport for sport’s sake,” 
they will quickly fall in line. When a professional influence prevails, they 
back the team only if a winning one; if the true representation of the school is 
made, they will back their players for doing their level best. They can be 
taught the meaning of sportsmanship. The influence of the students is small, 
as they have no authority, and are a transient group—some graduating, others 
coming in. 
6. The alumni and sporting public—the worst influence in college athletics 
to-day ;—the forces that are demanding a winning team regardless of the 
methods used in obtaining it. They see the notoriety and the professional 
aspect only. ‘They are the most potent forces in directing our collegiate 
athletics; they are the political forces that carry influence, that will organize 
to recruit athletes when the athletic fortunes are low. They have permanency 
and influence, but act too much on impulse to make this influence felt in the 
right way. 
The Dominant Factor in Control 
The evils of intercollegiate athletics are difficult to cure. This is 
for the reason that a new emphasis is laid in the basis of control. 
The public school represents faculty, students, and parents; with the 
parent influence joined with that of the faculty to curb excessive 
interschool athletic rivalry. In the case of the college, however, the 
parent influence is very small, and a new factor, the alumni, appears
-P-A-G-E-180
172 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
and places emphasis on an undesirable phase of athletics. Parents 
are in close touch with the public schools; they want welfare instead 
of advertisement and notoriety; college alumni, distant, and in im- 
personal relation, cannot help but be more interested in the things 
that bring their school’s name before the public. Success of the 
team, nationally known, advertises the institution, and advertises the 
alumni in turn. The alumnus is most loyal when the team is over- 
whelming all rivals. 
Alumni influence upon an institution is very important. The 
public schools are largely supported by public taxes, but the colleges 
are endowed wholly or in part, even the state ones depending largely 
upon subscriptions and donations to go ahead with buildings and 
other enterprises. The good will of the alumni is an imperative 
necessity. While the fair name of the school in question remains 
prominent in the public eye, the alumni remain contented, and are 
easy subjects for financial bequests. When things go wrong 
athletically, for that is the line of closest connection between the 
school and its graduates, the alumni hold indignation meetings; 
blame the coach as being out of date, the trainer as being a fizzle, 
the faculty as flunking the best athletes out of grudge, and the 
president as failing to keep an aggressive spirit alive. 
The crisis may end only with the lopping off of a few official 
heads to appease the alumni wrath; or may linger until a football 
victory or two causes it to turn the way of convalescence. But dur- 
ing the interim one thing has happened on an extraordinary scale: 
the alumni have pledged themselves to do something positive 
towards securing the most noted high school stars to attend their 
university and restore its fallen prestige. In this extreme mood they 
will entertain these prep school stars, take them on sight-seeing tours 
to their particular university, banquet them, and even bribe them to 
attend. The intense desire to win has in its course led to this one 
greatest evil of intercollegiate athletics—proselyting. 
The Solution 
The majority of readers will no doubt feel that athletic compe-' 
tition in itself is all right; that it is the commercializing of it that is 
wrong. Even then, the commercializing may not be wrong, if the 
athletic affairs are so conducted as to make them a medium for good, 
to spectators and players alike, as they may be. 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 173 
Commercialized athletics, to relieve itself of the harmful tend- 
encies that cling to it, must first of all give up its claim to being 
justified on educational grounds entirely. Educational athletics must 
include the student body as well, or the claim is unfounded. 
Varsity athletics. must accept a commercial status until such a 
time as it is brought into such close cooperation with the universal 
participation on the part of the student body, that each cannot exist 
and carry out its fullest aims without the help of the other. This 
cannot be brought about as long as winning is made the primary 
purpose. As long as winning is made an end in itself, the claim that 
athletics desires to make, that it is educational, can never hold. To 
be educational, athletics must place the lessons of all the ideals we 
hold for strong manhood and womanhood first of all. Defeat after 
a fair fight is educational; but victory by unfairness is not. True, it 
is ridiculous to think that winning is not an important part of every, 
game. A game would not be worth playing if it were not worth 
winning, but it is the qualities brought out in the winning or losing 
that mean the most in the long run. Reform must come through 
the players themselves, through the coaches, through the general 
public, and through district conferences, faculty controlled, to make 
rules that can be enforced. 
The players can be directed rightfully by barring all professional 
influence. Then, too, just as the playground and elementary school 
influence is reacting for the good on secondary school athletics, so 
improvements in the secondary school player will react on the 
college. These things will all mean a better source of material as 
far as ideals are concerned. The importance of the players is shown 
by President Ogilby, of Trinity College, when he states, “Un- 
doubtedly good fellowship between worthy antagonists is the 
strongest factor in the purification of athletics.” 
The coaches should be college graduates; they will be better 
imbued with the spirit and ideals of college athletics than any pro- 
fessional player possibly can be. We insist on college training for 
those who are to instruct the students in their academic work—the 
intellectual coaches. Why not an even broader training for those 
who are to instruct on the athletic field, where moral lessons are 
learned or lost? The coach should be given a respected standing 
on the faculty, with his worth judged by his success in influencing 
large numbers of students rather than on the single basis of a win- 
ning team. 
So soon as it finds out that its criticisms of the coach, team, and
-P-A-G-E-182
  174 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
administration will have no effect if based on the grounds ofa win- 
ning team alone, the general public will better understand the pur- 
poses of the game. As knowledge of the technique of the different 
sports becomes more broadcast, the people will have greater interest 
in that aspect of the game. 
Rules must be made, but by conferences in Gwhich all the schools 
are joined. Reform cannot be brought about by one individual 
alone. A coach or athletic director may be the most high-minded 
of men, and strive for clean athletics; but just the moment the team 
loses, the public attacks him as a theorist and idealist, and demands 
a practical man who can give results—results meaning, “a win at 
any price policy.” On the other hand, a conference of ten schools may 
pass laws for all of the different members, and even though the law 
is unpopular, there is no way of taking out spite on any particular 
individual. If one school alone adopted the rule that a man cannot 
play on the varsity while he is a freshman, and it began to lose 
games, the policy of that school would be attacked. But when all 
schools bind themselves to abide by it, a step forward is made. 
This is one rule in particular that has done a great deal towards 
abolishing the tramp athlete, the professional in college ranks, and 
proselyting. It not only makes a year’s wait, but it acts as a 
probation period in scholastic work. 
The present athletic system has largely gotten out of the hands 
of the faculty and into the hands of the sporting public. To-day, 
faculties are endeavoring to get it back, and their first means is the 
formation of a district conference. Everywhere to-day, a move- 
ment is developing for the grouping of colleges into conferences, 
with rules the same for all the members. The one-year rule is one 
good move. So is the rule making the season the same length for 
all members. The Western Conference has made another step for- 
ward by passing the rule that no member of any association may 
write an athlete with the idea of inducing him to come to the one 
particular school. 
The judicial branch of our athletics is weak. Faculty boards 
of protest such as are now in existence are not sufficient. No school 
wants to make a protest against another school’s players, knowing it 
will be taken as a personal affront, and bring about hard feeling and 
maybe retaliation. An Eligibility Committee for the conference is a 
necessary thing but it should be an investigating committee and not a 
hearing committee as at present. The impersonal element must be 
brought in. Each college athletic conference needs an impartial judge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  ATHLETICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 175 
To such a disinterested party each school should submit the names 
and addresses of its varsity players. This central office should 
investigate into the matter of the athlete’s standing as an amateur, 
and the influence which brought him to the certain school. Then we 
shall be having referees in the same capacity we use them in games. 
Can one imagine the outcome of a football game, if the officials did 
not look for infractions of the rules, but sat apart waiting for pro- 
tests to be made? Yet that is the way our present faculty system 
works. 
Collegiate athletics is in a state of transition. The suggestions 
in the way of improvement that have just been mentioned seem 
practical ones and are being experimented with to-day. Upon their 
success largely depends an institution of competitive athletics which 
will have the united support of all groups. 
INTRAMURAL ATHLETICS 
The word Intramural is the name that has been coined to apply 
to all athletics of a non-varsity nature. The scope of its work takes 
it everywhere within the university, the goal in view being to reach 
every student who is interested in any form of sport. The rapid 
growth of intramural activities has largely offset the “athletics by 
proxy” criticism that has identified itself with the varsity exhibitions. 
Scope of Intramural Athletics 
This type of athletics received a big boost during the war, when 
programmes of mass athletics were a part of the training at all the 
army camps. Since then, the colleges throughout the country have 
been promoting the idea more vigorously than ever before and even 
many high schools have already adopted many of the main features 
of intramural athletics. 
In order to reach all the students a great variety of activities 
must be offered. The student who has a liking for hockey must have 
his chance the same as the one who likes baseball. As a result the 
programme includes as many sports from the following list as the par- 
ticular institution finds it possible to offer: football, baseball, basket 
ball, track, tennis, soccer, hockey, swimming, wrestling, golf, skating, 
skiing, tobogganing, horseshoes, and there may be others not so 
universally known. For every one of the popular competitive sports 
on the programme the Intramural Department organizes teams, 
schedules, and leagues. In addition, there is a field for promoting
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
exercise along another line; i.e., that of furnishing the facilities, so 
that the students will avail themselves of their own accord. For 
instance, a skating rink or swimming pool gives an opportunity for 
a good deal of impromptu unorganized exercise. Tennis courts and 
bowling alleys do the same. 
The Methods of Organization 
In the organized competition, the students are reached by means 
of leagues which use the class, department, fraternity, society, sec- 
tional club, church, and military company as the units for rivalry; and 
in case of some of the sports like cross country, golf, or tennis, open 
campus tournaments or meets are held whereby the individual can 
compete for himself. Incentives other than the fun of playing are 
offered in the way of prizes which include “numeral” jerseys to the 
class winners, cups to the fraternities, and individual medals to the 
members of teams not having a permanent affiliation in the manner 
the fraternities possess. Of all the leagues, the class league should 
be favored because there is no barrier of caste and it expresses the 
highest democratic meaning of the school. 
What Types of Activities are Favored 
While practically every form of athletic activity is offered, still 
some sports are favored more than others by the student 
participants. In general it may be said that the average player 
prefers the team game to the activity which emphasizes individual 
ability ; and in the case of team game, prefers the type which he can 
enjoy playing without holding long preliminary drills, or buying 
extensive equipment. Basket ball and playground ball are ideal 
intramural games because they answer these requirements. The 
teamwork can be impromptu and the players can form teams on 
the spur of the moment. Because there is no great amount of 
technique involved, the type corresponds largely to the English idea 
of afternoon sport. 
The Aims of Intramural Athletics 
In choosing the games to favor in the intramural programme, 
student interest must be considered partly, also the aims which are to 
be accomplished. There is a wide difference of opinion among people 
as to the aim of intramural work. The common notion is that the

help the varsity; not only by uncovering men who have lacked the 
time or the confidence to try out for the big teams, but by getting 
more men out as candidates through increasing the following in 
each sport; also by keeping varsity men in shape during their off 
seasons; and in the case of a new sport, it is of material aid in nursing 
the team through the informal or building-up process. The class 
programme also helps the varsity in another way; in such events as 
cross country runs or tennis tournaments, the men likely to win 
varsity consideration are brought to the notice of the coach, and this 
saves him much time in sorting out his material. The aid to the 
varsity is not a primary aim of the intramural work, however. 
Intramural athletics has an end in itself. What is this end? It can 
be one or all of these things: the promotion of sociability, of whole- 
some recreation, or of an all-around physical development which will 
prepare men to become capable and successful in their chosen field 
of work in life. — 
A social purpose is evident, dliisinghs it is not the big one. The 
men of each class are brought together, and later the men of different 
classes. Friendships are formed and a spirit for one’s class is stimu- 
lated. Fraternities are brought into closer relations with each other. 
This spirit makes of each class a small college, each with its 
“Varsity” and followers. That congenial fellowship is brought 
about cannot be doubted. 
It is the second end, namely, that of recreation, that the In- 
tramural Department fosters the most at present. Games which— 
give spontaneous fun, refresh the mind, and which leave the player 
moderately invigoratéd, rather than over-tired, are the ones that 
seem to fit the needs. The following of this idea accounts for the | 
addition of sports such as bowling, quoits, and volley ball to the 
range of activities. This trend has been opposed by the followers 
of the old school who advocate “rugged youth by adherence to 
rugged sports.” These people overlook the fact that rugged sports 
should require careful training and that this is not possible under any 
system of voluntary participation. Regardless of the chance for 
debate, it is undeniable that the mildly recreative sports are popular, 
and economize time, space, and money. 
A third possible end has been mentioned before, that_of physical 
development. The idealist in athletics confuses intramural athletics 
with physical education. But there is a big distinction. It is true 
that class activities are physical education, but only in part. Physical 
education is a broad term. It stands for a definitely outlined x 
\
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
programme of exercise that is continuous and aims at definite results. 
In addition, it is compulsory ; the school grants a specified time for 
its furtherance. This is not true of intramural activities. The class 
athlete comes out for the team—maybe attends a few practices—and 
plays on the day of the game. The whole idea is voluntary. There- 
fore, although he gets some healthy exercise, it is not regulated 
enough for the greatest physical benefit; nor for the accompanying 
mental and moral effects. 
Intramural Athletics Should Be Made Compulsory 
But the hope of intramural athletics is that it will gradually 
assume the proportion of physical education. In spite of the great 
amount of good that can be accomplished by voluntary means the 
programme can only reach its ultimate goal when it has compulsory 
attendance behind it. But it will not be sufficient merely to get all 
the students out upon the athletic field. A programme must be drawn 
up to take care of them. The programme that seems most likely is 
one that will be made up of both required and elective courses or 
exercises. The required exercise should comprise a certain amount 
of mass drill, also individualistic exercises testing speed, strength, 
endurance, and coordination. These would serve the double purpose 
of giving an exact chart of each student’s ability and of arousing the 
incentive within the student himself to compete against his own 
record, and to better it. The elective exercises should comprise the 
well-known sports—they furnish the youth with the thrill of being 
part of a cause and of contesting for it, and in so doing teach him the 
lessons of courage, resourcefulness, loyalty, and sociability. Each 
season there are six or more sports that the college or university 
could offer, the student to select one. As there are three seasons in 
the regular school year, each student would become acquainted with 
three different sports, and would receive all-around exercise instead 
of the one-sidedness that is apt to result from the following of one 
sport as a specialty. The programme could be offered all through 
the school day. Such a scheme would give a nicely balanced physical 
fitness, as the tests would give muscular development, while the 
games, bringing in the running element, would give increased 
organic efficiency. If so desired, the intramural leagues, tourna- 
ments, and meets could be kept on a voluntary basis as at present, 
and they would be benefited by having the participants much better 
trained in all ways.

Conclusion 
Intramural athletics has already become a fixture as regards 
demand and popularity. While not so spectacular as the varsity 
type, still it finds itself in favor with all people alike for it carries 
with it the hope of placing athletics in its true place in the educational 
curriculum. With intercollegiate athletics rightfully conducted, and 
with intramural athletics extended to a compulsory basis, the athletics 
of the school will have approached the ideal. The two systems 
should work in harmony for common ends; for each has an im- 
portant place in the life of the school; and each should be indis- 
pensable to the other. 
A general idea has been given of the nature, aims, and problems 
confronting the newly developed movement for “‘athletics for all.” 
It is not necessary to go more into detail at this time, as the success 
of intramural work is largely based upon effective methods of organi- 
zation, a topic which is given separate treatment.

CHAPTER IX 
THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 
In former chapters we have surveyed the rise and progress of 
the play movement, observed the remarkable rapidity of its growth, 
analyzed the phases of its promotion, and studied in detail a few 
of the most important types of organization, such as the playground, 
the social center, and the summer camp. It seems best at this time 
to inquire into the origin and fundamental nature of play. ,How 
does play arise? )What is it?) Why do all children like to play? 
Why do we take so many pains to organize and promote it? Has 
it any value, and if so, what is it good for? 
It is well to consider such questions seriously and not to take too 
much for granted about the play movement just because it is pop- 
ular and successful at the present time. Popularity and temporary 
success are no sure evidence of permanence or real value. Fads 
come and go overnight and fashions appear and vanish with the 
seasons. 
According to the old notion, the word play was associated with 
fun only. People did not think of the boy’s play as being a prepara- 
tion for his work as a man. They had a vague notion that play is 
helpful; accordingly, the saying ‘All work and no play makes Jack 
a dull boy.””} But to-day this phrase has been extended so that people 
interpret it as ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull man.’; The 
school, except in the case of the kindergarten, has been slow to take 
up the play movement; such agencies as the Boy Scout movement, 
the Junior Y. M. C. A., and the supervised playground, earlier 
anticipated the importance of play, and used it to direct the natural 
enthusiasms of youth into the proper channels, so that a foundation 
for good citizenship could be laid. To-day the school is no longer 
hostile; instead, it recognizes the natural tendency to play and uses 
it as a means of individual development and to promote the social 
spirit of the school and classroom. Many opinions have been ad- 
vanced from time to time as to the origin and nature of play, and it 
is of interest here to take a look at some of these theories. 
181
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
THE THEORY OF SUPERFLUOUS ENERGY 
This is one of the oldest, simplest, and most wide-spread theories 
of play. According to this theory, play is “blowing off steam”; 
children play because they are so full of animal spirits, so over- 
charged with muscular energy, that they cannot keep still. Schiller, 
German poet and philosopher (1759-1805), expressed the idea 
“clearly when he defined play as “The aimless expenditure of 
exuberant energy.” Schiller illustrates his meaning by reference to 
the lion, who roars when he is well fed and at his ease, by the singing 
of birds, and by the insects that swarm in the sunshine. 
The original author of this theory is not definitely known. One 
writer says that it dates from the Stoic philosophers of ancient 
Greece, but this has not been vérified. Many modern writers call it 
the “Schiller-Spencer” theory, but this is not a good name for it. 
It was mentioned in educational literature long before the day of » 
Schiller and Spencer; moreover, Spencer explains play in an entirely 
different manner. Schiller evidently accepted the theory and possibly 
expressed it more fully and plainly than anyone before him. 
Whatever may have been its origin, the idea that play is simply 
an outburst of surplus energy is so generally held and has been held 
‘so long that one may call it a tradition, handed down to us from our 
forefathers. The average citizen, who wants more things than he 
can ever buy with his earnings, and whose working hours crowd his 
time for eating and sleeping, is apt to look forward anxiously to the 
time when his children will be able to work, and has but little patience 
with any expenditure of energy that does not bring results in wages 
or work done. This simple and plausible excess-energy theory of 
play is quite within the mental grasp of the uneducated workingman 
and fits well into his frame of mind and his philosophy of life. Ifa 
boy has strength to waste in playing tag, why not get his running 
while going on errands? If he wants to bat a ball, why not just as 
well beat a carpet? Why should not the girl take care of a baby 
instead of playing with a doll? These things, it is reasoned, involve 
the same identical activities as play and at the same time accomplish 
something worth while. Those who think of play as ‘‘the aimless 
expenditure of exuberant energy” very naturally look upon child 
labor as something to be much preferred. Most of the active 
opposition to the plans of the play movement is based on the super- 
fluous-energy idea. Very likely, instead of being the contribution of 
some philosopher, it is merely the common opinion of adults among
-P-A-G-E-191
THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 183 
the industrial class, who think of work as the main thing in life and 
have little use for play. 
The prevalence of this view of the play problem was shown when 
college students first asked for time and equipment for athletic 
sports. Parents, managing boards, and faculty members agreed 
at first that the students might better spend all their energy on 
their college work. After a time the argument was made that it 
would be wise to allow the students to engage in the sports, for if 
they got rid of their superfluous energy in such a harmless way it was 
less likely to burst out in more objectionable forms, such as drinking 
and gambling, hazing, and destroying property. Even to-day, 
speakers who are not well informed are often heard to advocate 
athletic sports for this one reason. 
The superfluous-energy theory has little in its favor, when it is 
given careful thought. Children who have a fair opportunity to 
. play usually play all day long every day of the week, and are not 
willing to stop when night or Sunday come. The starved children of 
the slums stand in line every day at the playground gate, waiting for 
it to open. They become so engrossed in their play that they forget 
fatigue and hunger and are entirely oblivious to the passage of time. 
As they grow tired of one game they enter into another with just 
as much vim. This does not look like a mere escape of surplus 
energy. ; 
It is absurd to characterize all play as aimless. The roaring of 
lions and the singing of birds may be aimless, and so probably are 
the laughing and kicking of the baby in his bed, the shouting and 
the tossing of hats when school lets out, and the screaming of the 
spectators when their hero makes a home run; but these are the rare 
exceptions rather than typical examples of play. There is just as 
much definite aim in tag games, ball games, races, dances, and field 
sports, as there is in plowing a field or cooking a meal. Aimless play 
is the lowest type of play; it is not the kind that the play movement 
is promoting. 
The superfluous-energy theory has been criticized because it 
offers no explanation of the fact that the young of a species play like 
one another but in a way different from those of all other species. 
If surplus energy is the only reason for play, all play ought to be 
aimless and all very much alike. The point seems to be well taken, 
showing again that the theory has been advanced without much re- 
gard for facts. Any theory that claims to explain the origin and 
nature of play must account for its main features, and play has no 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
characteristics more pronounced than these resemblances and 
differences—all kittens playing alike, all lambs playing alike, all 
children playing alike, but the play of each species absolutely unlike 
that of the others. 
THE RECREATION THEORY 
Play has been defined as “‘An occupation engaged in for recrea- 
tion, rather than for business or from necessity.” ‘This idea of play 
is an old one. It was expressed 200 years ago by Lord Kames, 
English nobleman and philosopher, when he said, “Play is necessary 
for man in order to refresh himself after labor.” A century ago 
_ Guts Muths, a German teacher who is sometimes called “the father 
of physical training,” published a book entitled ‘““Games for the 
Exercise and Recreation of Body and Mind.” Guts Muths, whose 
work was with children, emphasized the recreative value of play 
and also its value for development and training. Partly because 
of his. influence, the recreation theory of play has always been 
popular in Germany. One of its strongest supporters in recent years 
was Professor Lazarus of the University of Berlin, who urged 
people to “Flee from empty idleness to active recreation in play.” 
_The_ recreation theory is based on a sound principle of 
physiology. A certain amount of rest and sleep are necessary, but 
_ beyond that-a-change to an active and interesting occupation is more 
restful than complete-idleness. Professor G. T. W. Patrick, of the 
University of Iowa, in his “Psychology of Relaxation,” sustains the 
recreation theory and goes farther to explain it than any previous 
writer. The common occupations of civilized life, he says, especially 
among the intellectual classes, call for abstract reasoning, concen- 
tration of attention, and the use of the smallest muscles, such as those” 
of the eyes and the fingers, in highly skilled activity—in writing, 
needle-work, and the manipulation of complex tools and machinery. 
Such. activities, he goes on to say, have been acquired by the human 
‘race in comparatively.recent times, and are for that reason more 
fatiguing and more likely to provoke nervous disorders than 
activities that are racially older. This is why professional men re- 
quire shorter hours than laborers; it also explains why people get 
the most complete rest by going to the lakes, the forests, and the 
mountains, where they engage in hunting, fishng;-canocing, hiking, 
camping, and swimming—activities that our remote ancestors pur- 
sued for an unknown number of generations. These activities are 
restful largely because they are racially old, giving us a natural
-P-A-G-E-193
  
THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 185 
ability for them. This is why active outdoor recreations are, much 
more wholesome than quiet amusements, and tend better than 
anything else to renew the strength and restore lost powers. 
In one way the recreation theory is the opposite of the super- 
fluous-energy theory; the latter looks upon play as a kind of activity 
by which those who have an excess of energy can get rid of it, while 
the former considers it a way in which those who have exhausted 
their energy can recuperate. Each seems to be the view of a special 
class, the experiences and manner of life giving each a one-sided 
view. The recreation theory gives the view of adults who play for 
recuperation after a day of work and, hence, consider it as a di- 
verting relief. The wealthier classes, who have much leisure, speak 
of their own play as sport or pastime. It is a theory of the play 
of adults, however, and is of little value in solving the problems of 
the play of children.. Adults as a class are inclined to think of their 
own amusements and diversions as something vastly superior to 
those of children. They, therefore, prefer the word ‘‘recreation” 
because it seems more dignified. We shall see later many reasons 
for believing that play has the same basis at all ages and that there 
- is little foundation for any such division into play for children and 
recreation for adults. 
THE INSTINCT THEORY 
Every child breathes, winks, swallows, laughs, cries, etc. 
without trying to do*so and at first without being aware 
of it; in a similar manner he later tries to stand, strike, 
run, throw, talk, etc. Such activities are said to be instinctive, each 
one being called an instinct. ( All living things have an instinctive ten- 
dency to be active—that is, to exercise all their powers and faculties. 
As the child’s powers develop, one by one, there arises along with 
each budding ability an instinctive desire to use that ability and a 
satisfaction in exercising it. For example, the ability to grasp with 
the hand develops very ‘early in the child, and as soon as the ability 
appears he begins instinctively to practice opening and closing his 
fingers, over and over again for hundreds of times. The same is 
true of walking, talking, climbing, and scores of other abilities. 
The practice helps in developing the ability—in fact, it is necessary 
to it. As soon as he has acquired certain simple abilities he begins 
to combine them into more complex performances, all the time being 
urged on by an instinctive desire to do things and a satisfaction in   
 
-P-A-G-E-194
186 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
doing them. According to the instinct theory, this is the origin and 
beginning of play. 
The universal tendency of the young to be active has been ob-— 
served from the earliest times and probably from prehistoric times, 
with various interpretations, according to the preconceived ideas 
of the observers. 
The View of the Early Churchmen 
‘The churchmen of the Middle, Ages looked upon play as an 
example and evidence of the “original sin” of mankind, children 
being considered as ‘‘totally depraved” and incited to natural activity 
by Satan. All nature was believed to be under the domination of 
evil spirits, from whose control each one must be redeemed. Educa- 
tion, arising as it did in this mental atmosphere, was planned with a 
view to suppress all natural instincts and tendencies. A famous 
teacher of the medieval period is quoted as saying, in answer to an 
inquiring letter written by a mother who was looking for a school 
for her daughter: “A young girl should never play; she should 
weep much and meditate on her sins.” 
The View of Rousseau 
With the revival of learning in the 16th and 17th centuries, there 
was a growing revolt against the old and mistaken view and the 
accompanying policy of repression, and many leading writers on 
. education protested against it. Locke and Rousseau were especially 
insistent upon making use of the natural instincts of children. Writ- 
ing in 1762, Rousseau said: ‘“To strengthen the body and make it 
grow, nature has her ways and means which ought not to be opposed. 
You should not compel a child to abide in a place when he wants to 
be gone, nor to be gone when he is desirous to stay. They ought to 
be suffered to leap, run and hollo when they have a mind. All their 
motions are so many wants in their constitutions, which are endeavor- 
ing to gain strength.” Here we have the instinct theory of play ex- 
pressed long before anyone tried to formulate a theory of play. 
The View of Froebel 
Froebel (1782-1852), famous German educator and originator 
of the Kindergarten, gave a stimulus and a trend to the instinct 
theory of play that is worthy of notice here. He fought strenuously 
against the medizval doctrine that the child’s nature should be sup- 
pressed, and preached that the mind grows by self-expression.
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 187 
Froebel explains the existence of play by the universal craving for 
activity, and gave as the key-note of his plan that the spiritual nature 
of the child should be drawn out and developed through play. He 
tried to organize play so as to lead it gradually and naturally into 
work, to secure for the work the same freedom and enthusiasm that 
characterizes play. Froebel aroused so much enthusiasm for his 
theories and plans of education that he succeeded in gaining for the 
kindergarten a permanent place in all standard educational systems. 
He was the first to use such activities as building with blocks, model- 
ing in sand and clay, and cutting and folding paper in regular school 
hours; he also devised a series of stories, songs, and pantomimes 
that he called “Mother Play.’”’ He made much of imitation, and 
naturally so, since his work was wholly with young children, with 
whom imitation is a dominant instinct. The followers of Froebel 
have developed the imitative and rhythmic activities of children of 
the lower primary grades very fully. Unfortunately, they have 
stopped there, paying little or no attention to the play of later child- 
hood, adolescence, and maturity. In fact, the literature of the 
kindergarten, which is very extensive, scarcely recognizes the exis- 
tence of play beyond the simple imitative and rhythmic plays of early 
childhood. 
The View of Spencer 
In an article on physical education, published in an English 
magazine in 1860, Herbert Spencer stated his view of the origin of 
play as follows: ‘For girls as well as for boys, the sportive activities 
to which the instincts impel are essential to bodily welfare. Who- 
ever forbids them, forbids the divinely appointed means to physical 
development.” A few years before, in his “Principles of Psy- 
chology,” he said along the same line: “The sports of boys, chasing 
one another, wrestling, making prisoners, obviously gratify in a par- 
tial way the predatory instincts. And if we consider even their games 
of skill, as well as the games of skill practiced by adults, we find that 
the essential element running through them has the same origin. For 
no matter what the game, the satisfaction is in achieving victory—in 
getting the better of an antagonist. This love of conquest, so ~ 
dominant in all creatures because it is the correlative of success in the 
struggle for existence gets gratification in a victory at chess in the 
absence of ruder victories.” It seems plain here that Spencer is fully 
in accord with the instinct theory of play; but many writers, who 
apparently did not read this, represent him as one of the authors of
-P-A-G-E-196
188" THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the superfluous-energy theory, with special emphasis on imitation. 
It may be possible that Groos misunderstood Spencer’s meaning, 
through the use of an imperfect German translation of Spencer’s 
works, and that others have simply repeated Groos’ view without 
carefully examining the original. 
The place where Spencer seems to have been misunderstood is 
where he explains the origin of the universal tendency to activity. 
In the course of a chapter on the development of the nervous system 
he says that as fast as living nerve-cells are torn down by their 
activity they continually rebuild themselves and thus become again 
ready for action. With the renewed readiness to act comes also in- 
creased sensitiveness to stimulation, which is partially lost during 
fatigue. These nerve-cells are constantly receiving stimuli from the 
sense organs, so that stimuli to action are never lacking. The result 
is an almost uncontrollable desire to act whenever the nerve-centers 
are rested. “But now mark,” says he, “that this which holds true 
of the bodily powers, the destructive instincts, and those emotions 
related to them that dominate in life because they are so directly 
concerned in the struggle by which life is maintained, holds true of 
all other faculties. The higher but less essential powers, as well as 
the lower and more essential powers, come to have activities that are 
carried on for the immediate gratification derived, without regard 
to ulterior benefits.” Thus play arises. 
Spencer repeats this explanation several times with the use of 
_ slightly different words. His statement, that ‘‘cells and centers that 
are rested and rebuilt are unusually sensitive to stimuli from the 
sense organs,” is interpreted to mean that play arises from super- 
fluous energy. This interpretation seems to be absolutely un- 
warranted. Nowhere in his discussion is the term ‘superfluous 
energy” used. He repeatedly refers to instinct and to rivalry and 
the love of victory. His emphasis on the “struggle for existence” 
seems at times to give him the point of view of the industrial worker, 
but to make him a joint author with Schiller of the superfluous 
energy theory is plainly an injustice to Spencer. 
The common impression that Spencer stressed imitation as the 
main source of play is equally unwarranted and unfortunate. What 
Spencer says is that “‘forms of play tend to take the forms of the 
adult activities of the same species.” He speaks of kittens ‘‘simu- 
lating” the catching of mice, and the play of girls with dolls ‘“re- 
sembling” the work of women, but he neither states nor infers that 
it is in conscious imitation of what they have seen their elders do;

he intimates rather an instinctive than an imitative copying of these 
activities by the young. 
To understand Spencer’s view of play one must bear in mind 
that he did not write a book on play, as many of his critics have done, 
but briefly discussed its origin, in a few paragraphs, in a long argu- 
ment for organic evolution.. He plainly accounts for the existence 
and the forms of play by instinct, points out the well-known fact that 
the plays of the young resemble the adult activities of the species, 
and explains that the innate tendency to be active is due to the special 
sensitiveness to stimuli of nerve cells and centers that are rested. 
He argues strongly for the superiority of play over more formal 
types of physical education. 
The Contribution of Groos 
Karl Groos, Swiss psychologist, published in 1895 a book entitled 
“The Play of Amimals,’”’ followed in a few years by another entitled 
“The Play of Man.” These two volumes form the largest con- 
tribution to the theory of play yet made by any individual. Groos 
did an enormous amount of work on the subject, both by study of 
all previous works on play and by study of literature on the plays 
of savage tribes and of the children of civilized man. This has given 
educators confidence in his views, so that he has been able to exert an 
important influence in modifying the attitude of the schools toward 
play. 
Groos gives a very complete and elaborate classification of all 
the varieties of play of animals and men. His classification is the 
most scientific one attempted, and is exceedingly valuable and sug- 
gestive. His systematic account of all these types of play has pro- 
duced a profound effect on the minds of educators by showing to 
what an enormously wide range play extends; that, in fact, it can 
train any power or faculty. : 
On the theoretical side, Groos argues at great length in favor of 
the instinct idea of play, and in connection with it he advances two 
quite revolutionary doctrines: 
(1) Play is so important an element in the training of the higher 
animals and man that nature provides a long period of immaturity 
to give an opportunity for it. To quote his own words, “Animals 
“cannot be said to play because they are young and frolicsome, but 
rather they have a period of youth in order to play.”’ No one else, 
with the possible exception of a few of the most enthusiastic 
disciples of Froebel, has ever attributed to play such an important

190 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
part in education. It is a view which, although not openly approved 
by the leaders of our educational systems, is exerting a remarkable 
influence, both in stimulating interest in the play movement and in 
making methods of instruction in all school subjects less and jess 
formal. 
(2) Play arises in each young individual from the appearance 
of certain very important instincts before he has serious need of 
them. This is the main difference in development between man 
and the higher animals on the one hand. and the insects on the other, 
and is the reason why man makes progress in his manner of living 
from one generation to another while the ants and wasps do not. 
Each insect is endowed with instincts that appear fully developed 
and ready for use just when they are needed, and as a consequence 
the insect never plays and is not capable of education. The kitten, 
on the other hand, plays at catching mice with a bit of wood or paper 
for a long time before it has to do the real act, and by so doing not 
only develops this particular element of skill, but a higher degree of 
intelligence as well. Play is necessary for the development of higher 
intelligence; for if we were provided with perfected instincts, as in- 
sects are, life would be automatic and there would be no such thing 
as education and no increase of ability or intelligence, either in the 
individual or the species. If there were no such thing as play, the 
higher animals, such as the cat and the tiger, reaching maturity 
without the perfected instincts of the lower forms of life and with- 
out the practice and training that play. gives, would be unable to 
obtain food or protect themselves and would perish. The higher 
possibilities of the child and even the kitten over those of the ant, 
fly, and minnow are therefore due to the existence of youth and 
play. 
In all his discussions of these matters Groos shows a very wide 
acquaintance with the facts of natural science and the doctrines of 
evolution, and his reasbning is usually very clear. His theory of 
play, while it gives play a much more ambitious place in the order 
of things than most scientists and educators are willing to accord it, 
seems to be well supported as far as it applies to the development of 
general intelligence. His idea that play is a preparation for adult 
activities has some foundation in the case of young tigers and other 
wild animals, but it applies only partially to the case of domesticated 
animals and falls down completely in the case of the child. The play 
instincts lead the child to practice running, jumping, throwing, and 
striking, and the youth to practice hunting, fishing, swimming, etc.;
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 191 
but these are activities of primitive life that were abandoned, except 
for play purposes, centuries ago. It would be a crude mistake on 
the part of nature to provide mankind with a period of immaturity 
in order to provide each child with practice in adult activities that 
were discarded by the race at the dawn of civilization. Injurious 
play, such as gambling and use of drugs, could not exist if nature 
was providing play as a preparation for certain future activities. 
The fault of Groos’ theory in these respects is made clear and his 
main idea supported in a way by the next theory to be explained. 
THE INHERITANCE THEORY 
This latest theory explains play as an inheritance of abilities and 
instinctive desires and pleasures. In an address before the American 
Physical Education Association in 1901, Luther Gulick said: “The 
great interest that centers about plays and games is at least partially 
because they are racially familiar; they have old coordinations. 
Muscular coordinations that have been of great racial utility are 
acquired by the individual with great ease and joy.” Dr. G. Stanley 
Hall, for a long time president of Clark University and leader of 
the child-study movement, has been one of the strongest. supporters 
of the inheritance idea. Dr. Hall says: 
“The view of Groos that play is practice for future adult acti- 
vities is very partial, superficial and perverse. It ignores the past, 
where lie the keys to all play activities. ‘True play never practices 
anything racially new. I regard play as the motor habits and spirit 
of the past persisting in the present, as rudimentary functions akin 
to rudimentary organs. In play every mood and movement is in- 
stinct with heredity. We rehearse the activities of our ancestors, 
back we know not how far, and repeat their life work, stage by 
stage. This is why the heart of youth goes out into play as into 
nothing else, as if in it man remembered a lost paradise.” 
The inheritance theory is more in accord with the instinct theory 
than Dr. Hall’s statement, just quoted, would indicate. The later 
theory, like the earlier, accounts for play by instinct; it differs from 
the view of Groos in accounting for those instincts by inheritance. 
It may be said in justice to Groos that he considered this view, and 
rejected it because, at the time he was writing his books on play, 
the scientific world was under the influence of a theory, advanced by 
Weismann, that abilities and characteristics acquired by one genera- 
tion cannot be transmitted to later generations. General scientific
-P-A-G-E-200
192 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
opinion has since shifted somewhat on this point, so that the in- 
heritance theory of play does not conflict with it. 
The inheritance theory explains clearly why the activities-most 
commonly seen in the play of children are occupations of primitive 
life (running, throwing, striking, and climbing), rather than some of 
the quieter and more cultured occupations of civilized life (writing, 
painting, needlework, and studying). It is simply because we inherit 
from our ancestors, not from our descendants. The idea that in- 
stincts are prophetic—looking forward to the occupations the child 
must be ready to carry on when he reaches maturity—is the main 
fault of the instinct theory of play as stated by Groos. When we 
recognize the fact that instincts are inheritances from the past, we 
escape the difficulties involved in Groos’ view. The inheritance 
theory also supports and explains the idea advanced by Patrick, that 
activities that are racially older are more restful and recreative for 
those who lack strength; the activities by which the human neuro- 
muscular system was developed to its present form are surely the 
ones it can carry on most easily and economically. 
Some extreme forms of the inheritance theory that have been 
advanced by Dr. Hall and others can scarcely be justified. One of 
these is that “Play never practices anything racially new.” We 
have reason to believe that enthusiasm for a new idea led Dr. Hall 
to a mistake here. Typewriting, playing the piano, curving a base- 
ball, and shooting fire-crackers are activities that have been dis- 
covered since the days of our primitive ancestors, yet at times we see 
people doing these things in a way and for a purpose that justifies 
our calling it play. The instincts to imitate, to experiment, to create 
and to excel often lead us to play at things that are racially new. 
Sometimes one by persistent practice makes a difficult performance, 
like playing a violin, for example, so easy and pleasant that it be- 
comes play. While we play most often at things for which we have 
an inherited ability, it is not true that we never play at any activity 
that is new to the race, for one can develop an ability he did not 
inherit. 
Another extreme view advanced in the same connection is that 
play in the child recapitulates all the activities of the race in the 
order in which the race learned them. A prominent group of edu- 
cators, following the teachings of Herbart (1776-1841), have 
advocated planning all education to agree with the ‘Culture Epochs” 
through which the race has passed in its progress to civilization. 
Here we have a principle with much of truth in it; yet, while  
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 193 
recapitulation of primitive occupations occurs in the play of the child 
in a very genéral way, there are many occupations of primitive life 
that are skipped and many reversions occur in the order in which they 
come. It is natural for children to engage in primitive occupations 
first, yet one sees them playing with toy railroads and cars before 
they have shown any marked interest or ability in using a bow and 
arrow, and exhibiting other violations of the recapitulation idea 
equally in conflict with the theory. 
The inheritance theory is the most attractive and gives most 
evidence of being correct of any of the theories yet devised to ex- 
plain the origin of play. One likes to do the things he can do best, 
and so it seems reasonable to believe that we like to do certain things 
because of a natural ability to do them. The muscles of the human 
body and the nerves that control them are naturally fitted to perform 
running, jumping, throwing, climbing, etc., better than any other 
forms of movement, and therefore these are the most common 
activities seen in play. One cannot imagine a better reason for our 
having this natural ability to run and climb than the one the inheri- 
tance theory gives: the natural ability we have in these lines has 
been developed by the practice of these activities through countless 
generations of racial history. How else can we account satisfactorily 
for the tireless interest of children in chasing, hiding, and climbing, 
of older persons in hunting and fishing, and the pleasure all find in 
looking into the glow of the camp-fire and in sleeping out under the 
stars? Where else arises the never-ending lure of rivalry and com- 
petition? 
SUMMARY 
A survey of the theories by which people have tried to explain 
the origin of play throws into clear view the gradual progress that has 
taken place toward a more complete understanding of the subject. 
The older traditional views are seen to have less value, in com- 
parison with the later and more complete theories based on extensive 
studies of play in animals and man. Inherited instincts have a large 
part in play; an instinctive tendency to be active is the beginning of 
play and accounts for its persistence through life. A plentiful 
supply of energy influences play just as it influences all kinds of 
activity, for one uses more force when he has more to use, but 
surplus energy does not explain the origin of play nor any other 
activity. The theories of play based on instinct and inheritance

give it an importance in education vastly greater than was formerly 
attached to it; and the experience of recent years in school and play- 
ground experiments, proves its educational significance. 
WHAT IS PLAY? 
The study we have just made of the origin and nature of play 
puts us in a position to discuss this question with some thoroughness. 
The reader may be inclined to think at first that such a discussion 
can be nothing more than an uninteresting debate on the use of 
words and a complete-waste of time, but it is a problem that must 
be solved, for we can arrive at no settled conclusion as to the value 
of play in education until we agree as to what play really is and what 
activities it includes. There has been a marked advance in the 
attitude of educators along this line, and yet we have no generally 
accepted definition of play. Kilpatrick remarks that ‘In all educa- 
tional discussion there is scarcely a word upon whose meaning there 
is so little general agreement”; Thorndike says: ‘Most of the dis- 
putes about the service of play in education hark back to a vagueness 
in defining what play is to be taken to mean.”” The following defi- 
nitions will illustrate the extent of this disagreement: 
Definition of Play 
ScHILLER: The aimless expenditure of exuberant energy. 
Guts Mutus: The natural exercise and recreation of body and mind. 
Froese: The natural unfolding of the germinal leaves of childhood. 
RusKIN: Exertion of body or mind, made to please ourselves, without a 
determined end. 
SPENCER: Superfluous actions taking place instinctively in the absence of 
real actions. 
Activity performed for the immediate gratification derived, without 
regard to ulterior benefits. 
Groos: Instinctive practice, without serious intent, of activities that will 
later be essential to life. 
STRAYER AND NorswortHy: The manifestation of instincts and ten- 
dencies not immediately useful. 
SeasHoreE: Free self-expression for the pleasure of expression. 
Hatt: The motor habits and spirit of the past persisting in the present. 
Lee: Instinctive activity, looking toward an ideal. 
Dewey: Activities not consciously performed for the sake of any result 
beyond themselves. 
Gu.ick: What we do because we want to do it. 
CoLvin AND BacLey: An act performed spontaneously and for no con- 
scious purpose beyond the activity itself.  
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 195 
Wesster’s DicTIONARY: Any exercise or series of actions intended for 
amusement or diversion. 
STAaNDarD Dictionary: Action without special aim, or for amusement. 
One who studies the definitions observes the same radical differ- 
ences of opinion as are apparent in the theories of play, and the same 
gradual progress with the growing knowledge of the subject. The 
differences are in the main clearly due to differences in viewpoint. 
The oldest definitions merely state the traditional ideas, and those 
given in the dictionaries are similar, and naturally so, for they aim to 
give the meanings that are in general use. Guts Muths and Froebel 
express a belief in the great value of play in education, but they 
do not give a real definition. Spencer and Groos see everything 
from the viewpoint of evolution, with the main emphasis on the 
struggle for existence. Hall and other advocates of the “Culture 
Epoch” principle in education look upon play as a rehearsal of many 
successive stages of racial history. 
Points of Agreement 
While leading educators are not yet in full accord as to the 
meaning of play and what should be included in the term, and are 
therefore not agreed as to its value in education, they are coming 
more and more to agree on a few fundamental points: 
(1) Play is activity; it is not idleness, but is in contrast with it. 
Loafing and dawdling are not play, but.a slumping of activity be- 
cause of lack of interest in it, indicating a loss of the play spirit. 
(2) Play is not limited to any particular form of activity; it may 
be neuro-muscular, sensory, mental, or a combination of all three. 
(3) The value of play in education is due to its power to in- 
terest the player, absorb his attention, and arouse him to enthusi- 
astic and persistent activity. Education must be active rather than 
passive; “‘it is what the child does for himself and not what someone 
does for him that educates him.” 
(4) Whether an activity is play or not depends on the attitude 
of mind of the doer toward the thing he is doing—or, to state the 
same thing in other words, upon the motive that impels him to action. 
It follows that there is no particular activity, be it baseball, fishing, 
or playing with dolls that is always necessarily play; neither can an 
activity be mentioned that may not under some conditions be play. 
If one runs a foot race, drives a car, rows a boat, or reads a book, 
it may be play or not, depending on the way he thinks and feels about
-P-A-G-E-204
196 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
it. Some activities, such as games and sports, are usually play, but 
we can never be sure that a certain activity is play for a certain 
person unless we know his mental attitude towards it while he is 
actually engaged in it. What is play one day may be drudgery 
another day, for mental attitudes change with conditions. 
(5) There is general accord as regards point (4), viz., that 
the play spirit is an attitude of mind, but there is not so full an agree- 
ment as to the nature of this attitude. It is, however, coming to be 
agreed more and more that the essential characteristic of play is a 
satisfaction in the activity itself. To quote again from Kilpatrick, 
“When the satisfaction inherent in a specific activity suffices to keep 
_it going, it is commonly called play. If, however, some external 
compulsion or consideration is necessary to the continuance of the 
activity, some one of the other terms is considered more appro- 
priate.” This agrees with the definitions given by Spencer, Gulick, 
and Dewey. 
Points at Issue 
(1) Do adults play, or should the term be limited to the activi- 
ties of children? 
(2) Can play have an aim, or is it limited, as Schiller, Groos, 
and Ruskin say, to activities with no serious purpose? 
(3) Can play accomplish something worth while in a material 
sense, or is it limited, as Spencer and Dewey say, to aims within the 
activity itself? ; 
(4) Can play function as work, in a serious occupation, such as 
learning to add columns of figures, acquiring an erect posture, or 
running a farm; or must the term be limited to the activities of one’s 
leisure time? 
These questions have been discussed again and again, but the 
body of public opinion is still so fully saturated with the old tradi- 
tions that even intelligent educators hesitate to accept what the logic 
and the facts plainly indicate; play leaders need, therefore, to dis- 
cuss the mooted points at considerable length and gain an assured 
footing. The average parent has an idea of play that has been 
emphasized by some such experience as this: he wants John to 
mow the lawn and Jane to wash the windows, and these are useful 
occupations he is accustomed to call work; they want to go canoeing, 
_and this is an unproductive activity as far as father is concerned, so 
he has called it play. Repeated experiences of this kind impress
-P-A-G-E-205
    
     THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 197 
upon his mind that work is the name of activity that is worth while 
and play is an aimless and useless waste of valuable working power. 
If he ever saw work performed with the spirit and enthusiasm of 
play, he did not notice it, because he was concerned solely with get- 
ting the work done, and assumed that everybody should have the 
same interest in it that he had. He often makes the mistake of sup- 
posing that certain parts of his work, which are in reality play for 
him, are done from his excellent sense of duty, and that his children 
should possess this just as he does. He has a wrong idea of the 
psychology of such situations. 
Do Adults Play? 
No matter how much he may hate to admit it, there can be no 
basis for the belief that the adult does not play, whichever of the 
definitions of play we may select as the right one. He at times ex- 
pends surplus energy aimlessly (Schiller) ; he exerts body and mind 
to please himself (Ruskin) ; he performs superfluous movements. in 
the absence of necessary movements (Spencer); he engages with 
joy in racially old activities (Gulick); he €arries on actions for 
amusement or diversion (Webster); he engages in activity with 
enthusiasm for no other reason than that it is pleasurable. The play 
of the adult differs from that of the child because he has greater 
abilities than the child in some directions and smaller abilities in 
others; he has lost some of the instincts of childhood and gained 
others in their places; his aims are more complex and more remote; 
he has an aversion to vigorous physical exertion for its own sake 
ween child does not know. 
e play of the adult sometimes takes the form of a hobby, 
such as fine cabinet making or raising fancy stock or poultry, or en- 
gaging in dramatics or literary work. When a person takes a hobby 
so seriously that he is not content with practicing it as a mere recrea- 
tion, but consciously strives to attain a high grade of proficiency and 
takes pride in exhibiting his talent, then he is reaching play of as 
high a level as that of the child. When he plays merely for recrea- 
tion or amusement his play lacks purpose and drops to a lower level; 
it is for the moment only. 
Has Play An Aim? 
There is a stage in the early life of every child when most or all 
his activity is aimless, but he soon passes this stage. The dawn of 
‘consciousness is soon followed by a desire to accomplish something.
-P-A-G-E-206
198 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
He imitates and experiments. Preyer tells of watching a young child 
who took the cover off a box and put it on again 79 times in succes- 
sion without stopping. This was first experiment and then imitation, 
and all or nearly all was done with a purpose. Children spend most 
of their waking hours in such experimental and imitative actions and 
in collecting and constructing things and playing games—all with an 
aim in view. Play requires the choice of an aim and then the per- 
sistent following of that aim, often in spite of difficult odds, in order 
to be successful and satisfactory. 
The chief aim in play is satisfaction or pleasure, but in much 
the same way this is true of life-as well. In play as in life there are 
a lot of minor or partial aims that are important and serious because 
their accomplishment is necessary to success and therefore essential 
to the satisfaction that is being sought. For example, the child builds 
up a pile of blocks for the pleasure of doing it, but in order to ex- 
perience this pleasure to the highest degree he must succeed in 
arranging them in a form to represent something he has seen and 
make them stay in place until the building is complete. Thus he 
gratifies his instincts for imitation and construction. In much the 
same way an adult builds a house. The aims of the adult are more 
complex and more remote, but not necessarily more serious to him 
than those of the child. As the child grows and his mind develops, 
the aims of his play become more and more complex and remote, 
year by year, up to maturity. 
It is in the activities used by adults to pass away their leisure time 
that the most aimless and languid types of play are seen. Lacking 
some of the enthusiasm and vigor of youth and having to work 
several hours every day, the grown-up looks upon his spare time as 
an opportunity to rest and recuperate. With this in view he is apt 
to prefer diversions that involve little aim or vigor, such as motor- 
ing, or attending the theater, movie, or ball game; although if he 
were to indulge in activities having more purpose and action they 
would usually serve as a more effective recreation. 
Children often loaf and dawdle at their tasks but seldom at their 
play. They take the purposes of their play seriously, and that is why 
they put the best of their ability into it. The enthusiasm of play, 
\ aroused as these aims are sought and accomplished, gives to it the 
superior educational value it possesses. 
We must conclude, then, that the best play has an aim in it; in 
fact, it is being questioned to-day whether the aimless activities often 
mentioned as illustrations of play, such as the spontaneous move-
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 199 
ments of the young baby, the buzzing of insects in the sunshine and 
the roaring of the lion, are really play at all. They are said by some 
to be rather simple responses to stimuli, mechanical in nature, with- 
out any conscious direction., 
What Can Play Do? 
Groos claims that while play may have an aim, it is a fictitious 
one, like that of a kitten that plays with a leaf as if it were a mouse, 
ora girl who flirts with her male acquaintances; as soon as it becomes 
real, as when the kitten chases a mouse, or the girl falls in love, the 
activity ceases to be play and becomes real life. Spencer, Dewey, 
and others make a similar but slightly different distinction, saying 
that play may have an aim within itself, as when a boy aims to hit 
the ball or tag another boy, but if the aim extends beyond the game 
and looks toward a material result, as when a boy sticks to football 
practice to earn a sweater or two boys race to see who can pick more 
cherries, it is no longer play. Several students of the play problem, 
especially George E. Johnson, strongly object to this view, claiming 
that the play of children is real life, and that play can achieve results 
beyond the play itself. 
Spencer and Groos draw a sharp line between two kinds of acti- 
vities of animals; (1) activities performed to gain food and shelter 
and to protect themselves, which constitute the real life of the 
animal, and (2) instinctive exercise of young animals to prepare 
them for the activities of real life. The distinction seems to be a 
reasonable one to make in case of wild animals, but in the case of the 
children of to-day in civilized countries, with an organized system of 
education planned for them by their elders, it is doubtful if such a 
distinction should be made. The later life of civilized man differs 
greatly from the struggle for existence among wild animals of the 
jungle, and contains much that is educative and at the same time 
useful in securing the means of living. 
If we turn from the evolutionary to the educational point of 
view, how much difference takes place in the nature of the activity 
when the boy on the squad decides to try for a sweater? Just a 
little added stimulus to intensify the interest he had before! Take 
the case of a child playing with a make-believe fishing pole and line; 
what essential change takes place, educationally, when he baits a real 
hook and catches a minnow? Or when, instead of a minnow he pulls 
in a fish big enough to be worth cooking? Is the educational effect 
lost or completely changed, just because of the size of the fish?
-P-A-G-E-208
200 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Does it change the mental attitude of the boy toward the activity, 
so it is no longer play? Are the activities of school gardening not 
play, just because the children raise real flowers and vegetables and 
cultivate them with real hoes? 
People generally come to agree, when they think it through, 
that when an activity is of itself attractive enough to make one want 
to do it, it is play. Defined in this way, play includes plainly all 
such activities as cooking, canning, and gardening by school children; 
but in applying the name to the various cases, people often fall back 
to the illogical ideas they gained from tradition and say that these 
things cannot be play because they are work. “Work while you 
work, and play while you play” is a maximum accepted as gospel 
truth from time immemorial, but the newer maxim, ‘The value of 
work depends on how much play there is in it, and the value of play 
depends on how much work there is in it,” is much nearer the truth. 
Work is exertion performed to get something done; it is defined in 
mechanics as “overcoming resistance through space.” The only 
foundation for the popular idea that play and work cannot over- 
lap is the adult misconception that play is useless, and work, useful 
activity. All real activity involves work; whether it is play or 
drudgery depends on the mental attitude of the one doing it. Play 
stands at the top of the scale and drudgery at the bottom; no one 
engages in drudgery except from compulsion. or necessity, while play 
rewards the one engaged in it while he is doing it. 
A second objection to our suggestion, that work may at the same 
time be play, is that this cannot be because there is freedom in play, 
while work is rigidly restricted to certain lines determined by the 
result to be accomplished; the reason why John does not like. to 
mow the lawn and why Jane does not like to wash windows is that 
there is not enough freedom in the activity. The answer is that it is 
only in the play of the youngest children that we see the enjoyment 
of perfect freedom of action. As soon as the child progresses to a 
stage slightly higher, he begins to enjoy the pursuit of an object, and 
willingly sacrifices freedom of action to attain it. This is shown in 
all games and contests.. The rules of the game curtail freedom of 
action, but the boy and girl prefer games to aimless activity never- 
theless. Is the game therefore not play? As they become older 
they come to prefer games and amusements in which freedom of 
action is still more restricted. How much freedom of action is there 
in sitting and watching a movie show, or in social dancing? In 
similar ways people gladly restrict their own freedom of action to gain
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 201 
an end that is of material value, as in knitting a glove or raising 
poultry. Are these activities for that reason not to be called play, 
even when the activity is so satisfactory in itself that one does it for 
the fun of doing it? 
Mowing the lawn and washing windows are drudgery for John 
and Jane, because they have not yet, as father has, developed a lik- 
ing for fine lawns and clean windows that is sufficient to permeate the 
activity itself and thus make it so desirable that it is willingly and 
even gladly done. Everyone comes sooner or later to associate some 
desired results so closely with the activity that brings them, that the 
one means the other, and work is thus transformed by the play spirit. 
Here lies the secret of the youth’s enjoyment of games, in which he 
surrenders personal freedom of action to attain an end that is much 
desired; here is the explanation of the fascination some women find 
in embroidery, and of the passion of some men for stock raising or 
salesmanship. Is there any educational difference in the activity, 
because in one case the result desired is material and permanent and 
in the other case a passing pleasure? Is there anything beyond mere 
tradition to show both may not be play? 
Can Play Function As Work? 
Drudgery is not generally favored for its educational value, but 
it is usually considered necessary, in order to get things done. Most 
people look upon play as lacking in persistent effort and fall back 
upon drudgery as more likely to get results. People fear that play 
will yield to the immediate end of pleasure and never attain the 
further end toward which it may be directed. Believing a life of 
drudgery to be unavoidable for all-butthe-few lucky ones, they hate 
to see children become fascinated with play for fear it will make the 
drudgery all the more intolerable by contrast, and thus tend either 
to unhappiness, or failure, or both. The work must be done, and 
the simplest and most direct way to get it done is to compel the 
child to do it. The more docile and ready he is to yield to authority, 
the better chance for success in life he is supposed to have. 
This is one of the most deadly ‘delusions of the human mind. 
To get free from its soul-destroying influence people must come to 
see that play and drudgery are the two ways of performing work, 
and the difference between them is nothing more than the attitude of 
the person toward. the occupation in which he is engaged. The 
work of the world, so commonly believed to be degrading drudgery, 
to be escaped if possible by fair means or foul, consists in reality of
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
a variety of fascinating occupations, involving the same identical 
activities as those which people engage in for fun, with infinite oppor- 
tunity for push, enterprise, artistic expression, and friendly competi- 
tion. The best preparation for a successful life is not a childhood 
and youth spent in drudgery, but instead a healthy body, reserve 
force, willingness for and even enjoyment of a severe tussle against 
odds, a friendly and sportsmanlike spirit towards other people, and 
the mastery of certain lines of knowledge. 
Some teachers make the learning of the addition tables and the 
acquiring of an erect posture drudgery; others make them play. 
Which gets the work done the quicker and better? Work that has 
to be done by compulsion is a sure sign of wrong management some- 
where, more often by teacher than by pupil. The key to the situa- 
tion is an absorbing interest. When this interest becomes so absorb- 
ing that it pervades the activity and makes the worker forget the 
exertion in the joy of successful accomplishment, it is play. All the 
work must be done, but it should be enlivened by the play spirit in- 
stead of being deadened by the slave spirit. 
Artists, poets, and musicians play at their life occupations, and 
‘in so doing rise to the highest level of accomplishment; why not 
students, teachers, farmers, engineers, house-keepers? If these oc- 
cupations are drudgery, it is because the people engaged in them 
have not enough interest in their work to lift them from the level 
of drudgery and infuse them with the play spirit. Ill health, over- 
work, or laziness may stand in the way of such attainment; but 
normal and intelligent persons can achieve it. 
It is again objected that play is lacking in the spirit of responsi- 
bility; but here we have again the old idea that all play is aimless 
and child-like. Of course children lack responsibility; of course play 
engaged in simply to pass away time will not show much responsi- 
bility: on the other hand, who accepts and fulfills more complete 
responsibility than the catcher or the baseman of the ball team? 
You can drive a child to a sense of responsibility based on fear, 
but to furnish him with a serious and attractive play motive is the 
real key to the problem. This is what John Locke meant when he 
said more than 200 years ago: ‘‘The chief art is to make every- 
thing that children have to do, sport and play.” 
A few educators still insist that play must be kept out of the 
realm of work and employed only to occupy leisure time. They 
object to the “sugar-coating” of work, so as to make it pleasant, as 
urged by Locke, Froebel, and by many educators of our day. The
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 203 
mistake is in failing to see that the true spirit of play may fully per- 
meate an activity instead of merely sugar-coating it; the latter is 
apt to be all that is possible when educational tasks are assigned 
years before the pupils are ready for them. Children can be forced 
to learn some things by a process of drudgery long before the natural 
time for appreciating them; and in such a case, of course, the play 
spirit fails to help. The spirit of work never reaches its highest 
point until it becomes identical with the spirit of play. 
Conclusion 
Play was once looked upgn as a curious and unimportant feature 
of child life. Now it is considered a factor in education, and a very 
important one. With this change of viewpoint has come a change 
in the definition of play, including in the term a wider range of 
activities. At first only aimless activities were classed as play; then 
activities with a fictitious or make-believe purpose were added; later 
a real and serious aim was conceded as a possibility in play, but 
always with the provision that the object to be accomplished lies 
within the activity and is a part of it, rather than a remote object of 
value. It became evident at this stage that adults play, as well as 
children. To-day, stressing still more the educational significance 
of play, we are inclined to widen the definition further and include 
im it occupations that seek and accomplish useful and permanent 
results. 
From the educational standpoint, play has as its essential char- 
acteristic for the player an absorbing interest in the occupation in 
which he is engaged. The spirit of play is the joyous and self-forget- 
ting enthusiasm in the pursuit of an occupation, in the accomplish- 
ment of a purpose, or in the attainment of an ideal. It is this spirit 
that gives play its unequaled driving power and its superior value in 
education. Play is not to be contrasted with work but with drudgery. 
Play and drudgery are the two ways of getting work done; the for- 
mer by inspiration and the latter by compulsion. 
The best definition of play is probably that given by Gulick when 
he said, “Play is what we do because we want to do it.” We have 
here in a few words all that is essential in defining play, without the 
fault of most definitions, which say too much. The ultimate goal of 
play is always pleasure or satisfaction, but it is not the single aim 
constantly in the mind of the player; he is impelled to action by a 
multitude of minor aims, one after another, not all equally pleasing 
but willingly done because each is in turn a necessary step toward the
-P-A-G-E-212
204 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
final aim. If we think of any typical example of play, such as 
building with blocks, a game of baseball, or the pursuit of a hobby 
(bee-keeping), we cannot fail to recall that the mind of the player 
is absorbed most of the time by the details of the occupation, only 
occasionally reverting to the goal to be finally reached. Interest in 
the final result, however, gives a borrowed interest to details that are 
not of themselves especially attractive. 
We are chiefly concerned in this volume with the choice and use 
of play activities in school periods and in the employment of leisure 
time. It is well to keep in mind, while choosing and conducting such 
activities, two points brought out in our study of the philosophy of 
play: first, that the play spirit may inspire one for his regular occu- 
pation and thus contribute to his success as well as keep him out of 
the low level of drudgery; second, that activities of the playground 
are not necessarily play because the director has that end in view. 
It is not play unless the player wants to do it; the play leader must 
control conditions and morale so as to maintain a high level of 
interest, otherwise the games lose their value. 
Play, however, can be subjected to direction without loss of the 
play spirit; and play has been institutionalized. The play spirit is 
creeping into our pursuit of health, and is being directed toward that 
end; it is finding place in our educational systems; it has always been 
a religious function; and it is ever the impulse of the highest type 
of art. The one danger always present in institutionalized play is 
that the remote end will sometimes obliterate the immediate aim of 
the play impulse; and then the play spirit is gone. 
Society’s Duty to Foster the Play Spirit 
Society can work toward the ideal of infusing the play spirit into 
work, and of combating the condition of drudgery, in three ways. 
First, there is the offering of opportunities to the worker, 
especially to the worker in the lowest menial tasks where the scope 
of responsibility is limited, and where there is no chance for ex- 
periment with individual initiative. This can be done by regula- 
tion of hours of labor, by aid which will hasten the foreigner’s prog- 
ress in Americanization, and by provisions for play or recreation in 
leisure time. The city should provide parks, playgrounds, com- 
munity centers, music, libraries, public art galleries, museums, and 
all other things possessing an influence that is elevating. Then, even
-P-A-G-E-213
THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY 205 
though there is an element of drudgery still left in work, the 
drudgery will be endured willingly for the sake of future compensa- 
tion in the way of personal growth. For there is drudgery in every- 
thing. There is drudgery along with play, such as the tedious prac- 
tice which the player undertakes in order to make himself more pro- 
ficient. But the idea is to have an end or goal in view, so that the 
drudgery will be willingly undergone. This first method is positive 
and direct, inasmuch as it aims at improving present conditions. 
The other two ways are in the nature of educational and pre- 
ventive foresight. ~Ecication should aid the child—the future work- 
man—in his quest to discover his ‘natural bent and capabilities. If 
this is discovered, the individual has his best chance of finding en- 
joyment as well as material gain. The rewards will be immediate 
as well as remote. Johnson says, ‘‘It is doubtful if a great man ever 
accomplished his life work without having reached a play interest 
in it.” People like Roosevelt, Edison, Burbank, Ford, Carnegie, 
and Jane Addams played at their work. Each of us can think of 
people among our acquaintances of whom the same is true. This 
second method would help each one to find the work in which, for 
him, there is the largest proportion of play. z    
‘that he can make the most of his leisure time, so that he may re- 
create himself through play and_recreation.. This is society’s third 
duty. But this play spirit must be developed in youth or it will be 
forever dwarfed. The psychologist James says, “Instincts are 
transient. They are implanted for the sake of giving rise to habits, 
and this purpose once accomplished, the instincts consequently fade 
away. Pedagogy should strike while the iron is hot. If a boy grows 
up alone at the age of games and sports and learns neither to play 
ball, nor shoot, nor row, nor sail, nor ride, nor fish, probably he 
will be sedentary to the end of his days, and though the best oppor- 
tunities be afforded him for learning these things later, it is one 
hundred to one that he will pass them by and shrink from the effort 
of taking those necessary first steps the prospect of which, at an 
earlier age, would have filled him with eager delight.” Therefore, 
in order that the future worker may enjoy play and recreation to the 
utmost in his adult life, it is necessary that society should encourage 
the teaching of play in the schools and on the playgrounds, should 
make play a bigger part of the child’s education.

CHAPTER X 
CLASSIFICATION: MOVEMENTS 
The whole field of play includes innumerable games, dances, 
and other activities. We now take up the classification-of- these 
activities, discussing resemblances and. differences, and-in this way, 
trying to discover the fundamental-nature-of-each-group. The 
names that have been given to these forms of play by the children 
are of little help; the groupings made by teachers, who have classi- 
fied them arbitrarily according to the way they wish to use them, 
into games for the playground, the camp, the gymnasium, etc., are 
not much better. It is no easy task to learn how to use Black Tom, 
Black and White, Black Man, Chinese Wall, and 22 other games 
similarly named, if they are to be remembered as individual un- 
related plays, but when it is recognized that the whole 26 are tag 
games and slight variations of the familiar ‘‘Pom Pom Pullaway,” 
the task is an easy one. 
Play activities need to be classified in two ways: according to the 
outward form, or the movements involved, which is-done—in—this 
chapter; and according to the interests of the players, a-method 
taken up in the next.chapter. 
Many a play leader has been chosen because he was a star athlete 
in one or two sports in high school or college. Such an experience is 
a good one and such an athlete is apt to have the play spirit and a 
lot of enthusiasm, and both these things are needed for success. To 
be a successful play leader the athlete must go further: he must not 
only know well the few games he has liked but also those that other 
people like; he must know the games that are popular in other towns 
as well as those played in his own town; he must not, like the average 
citizen, make a hobby of a few games, but must take an interest in all 
of them. ' Besides the familiarity gained by playing all kinds of 
games, the prospective play leader should make a study of them, as 
a scientist studies plants and animals, comparing them, noting where 
they are alike and how they differ; in fact, he must become.a practical 
expert on the subject of play. 
207
-P-A-G-E-216
208 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The reason for the completeness of this preparation is the size 
of the job he is undertaking—enormously bigger than the average 
student has any conception of. The most glaring defect of school and 
community play programmes in operation to-day is the vast amount 
of idleness that exists, just because the directors in charge know so 
little that they cannot see anything else to do, when there are a 
hundred things that ought to be done. -Some-eitiesof-20,000 in 
Michigan are satisfied with their play programmes and proud of them 
when one high school team is all there is of it. A live play director 
in such a town should have several hundred school children and half 
as-many older people in organized-play, under-his supervision. 
; No play director can organize a big programme and make it go 
\/ without accurate knowledge of a great number of play activities. 
“ He will have to choose, off-hand, suitable activities for individual 
/ players and for groups of all kinds and sizes:here a small-group 
of kindergarten age; there a whole Junior high school, including a 
hundred-or two, to-be suited with appropriate girls’ games and boys’ 
, games; yonder a mixed group of adults. Some want play that has 
\ great variety of activity, and others want to confine themselves to a 
few special things that they like to do; some want vigorous activity, 
and others will play only quiet games -or—occupythemselves-with 
handicraft. The director will have to provide for all changes of 
seasons and weather, and for this must be ready with indoor games 
and outdoor games, ice-and-snow-sports,-water-sports;play for the 
camp;-the-church; the shore, the woods; the gymnasium, or-the school 
room- He must have games ready to fit into circular spaces, play 
for a long and narrow room, games that can be played in rooms 
where there are posts and projecting corners, and play that will 
amuse a lot of people and keep them busy in a small space.» Krom 
the descriptions and-rules-of play given in detail in Vol. II. the 
student can learn many games he has not had a chance to play, and 
the classification will help-him to hold in mind all the old familiar 
games and to evaluate rightly and make use of the new ones, which 
are being devised and_published continually. 
The Three Types of Activity 
Play activities are naturally divided into three main groups: 
motor, sensory, and intellectual. Motor play may be illustrated by 
running, jumping, climbing, or throwing; sensory play by watching a 
gymnastic exhibition, a game, or a movie show; intellectual play by
-P-A-G-E-217
    CLASSIFICATION: MOVEMENTS 209 
listening to an interesting lecture, taking part in a debate, or playing 
cards. 
This three-fold division of play activities seems simple enough at 
first, but it is not so simple as it seems. Play does not exercise our 
powers and faculties singly and separately; it is not easy to name an 
example of purely motor, sensory, or intellectual play. Running, 
jumping, and climbing—typical motor plays—involve along with 
the motor activity much exercise of the senses: sight, hearing, touch, 
and pressure; much exercise of the intellect: attention, memory, 
imagination, reason, and judgment. To get full enjoyment of a ball 
game or a picture show—typical sensory plays—one must sit up, turn 
head and eyes here and there and focus the eyes, and all this is 
muscular rather than sensory. Even intellectual play involves a 
small amount of motor activity and a large amount of sensory 
activity. 
The Range of Activity 
Few people who have not made a study of play realize what a 
wide range of activity it covers. Any power or faculty we possess, 
any nerve center, sense organ, or muscle group, unless it has been in- jured in some way or stunted by persistent disuse, can be exercised 
and developed by play. The best of our grade teachers are using 
play to-day in teaching the common branches, such as reading, 
arithmetic, and even penmanship. An intelligent teacher can train 
any line of ability, using only play activities. A glance at the chart 
at the end of this chapter will show that this is true. 
Intellectual and sensory activities have been classified into several 
subdivisions, according to the particular sense or mental faculty in- 
volved, but for reasons that will soon be evident we are not much 
interested in such a classification. Motor play, on the other hand, 
includes several types of activity that should be pointed out. 
      
FORMS OF MOTOR PLAY 
All bodily movements are first divided into two groups: funda- 
mental and accessory. Fundamental movements are those that em- 
ploy the big muscles of the trunk and limbs; accessory movements 
are those involved in the use of the voice and in the specialized move- 
ments of the fingers and thumb. Running, swimming, and danc- 
ing are fundamental movements; singing, playing a violin, and
-P-A-G-E-218
210 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
operating a typewriter use accessory movements. The former are 
called fundamental because they are older in racial history, being 
found in animals as well as in man, and because they involve muscles 
whose mass. is so great that their activity controls the amount of 
food and of oxygen needed and of waste to be eliminated, and there- 
fore controls indirectly the activity and development of the heart, 
lungs, breathing muscles, digestive system, and other organs neces- 
sary to life, health, and vigor. The accessory muscles are of more 
recent origin, as shown by their absence in animals, even the highest 
forms, and by their appearing later in the life of each individual 
child—the big fundamental muscles coming into use first and the 
accessory muscles later. The accessory muscles are too small to 
have any influence on the heart action or other vital processes of 
the body as a whole. 
Kinds of Fundamental Movements 
From the standpoint of the player, the fundamental movements 
  involved in play, as first pointed out by Gulick, form two divisions: — 
moving the player’s own body, and moving other bodies; the first is” 
called locomotion and the second, handling objects. Locomotion is 
accomplished mainly by the lower™limbs;-with the arms and trunk 
used incidentally; handling objects is performed mainly by the hands 
and arms, with the trunk and lower limbs used incidentally. The 
muscles of the lower limbs are much the largest, next those of the 
trunk, and the muscles of the arms are weakest and smallest. 
FORMS OF LOCOMOTION 
Motor play includes seven distinct forms of locomotion: creep- 
ing walking, running, dancing, jumping, climbing=-and-swimming ; 
we should include also several variations of walking and running, 
such as skating, skiing, snowshoeing, and walking on stilts, that can 
be grouped together under the head of locomotion with an apparatus 
attached to the shoe; locomotion with the use of a vehicle also be- 
longs here if it involves considerable motor activity, which it does in 
the case of sleds, bicycles, row-boats, canoes, swings, and teeters, 
but not in the case of trains, steamboats, airplanes, trolley cars, and 
automobiles, for in these the activity is chiefly sensory. That makes 
nine forms in all, unless one wishes to list each of the minor forms 
in the last two groups separately, in which case there would be almost 
an indefinite number.
-P-A-G-E-219
  CLASSIFICATION: MOVEMENTS 211 
Creeping 
Creeping is a crude form of quadruped locomotion, usually done 
on hands and knees. It is an important stage in the neuro-muscular 
development of the young child but after that is of less importance 
than the other types, seldom used in later play activity. 
Walking 
Walking is the next form of locomotion, usually learned after 
creeping, and in civilized times is by far the most important, since 
civilized man scarcely uses the other forms except in his sports, 
Recently, locomotion with vehicles that do not require motor activity 
is taking the place of walking, so that this form is going out of 
general use as well as running, climbing, and swimming. Moreover, 
walking is not used to any large extent in our common plays and 
games, so that it is necessary to stimulate an interest in it in special 
ways. 
Strolling is the leisurely, languid type of walk, taken as if to pass 
the time rather than to go to any place; it is too mild to call the 
heart and lungs into vigorous action, but it is better than standing or 
sitting still and is useful for invalids and convalescents. Standing 
still for a long time, as barbers, bank-tellers, and motor-men have to. 
do, is very bad for the feet, the strain without movement blocking 
the circulation and frequently causing flat-foot. Even the slow, lan- 
guid walk usually seen on the streets causes a circulation of blood in 
the feet, and helps to prevent foot trouble, especially if the toes are 
pointed directly forward. 
Hiking is walking of the more vigorous, hustling type; the term 
is applied especially to long steady walks, several miles in extent. 
Hiking is moderate exercise, affording outdoor recreation for many 
who are not equal to the demands of the usual athletic sports; it is 
rather mild for men and boys of athletic habit but even for them 
it is good if they speed up and especially if they go up and down 
hill, for it develops an endurance that games of short duration fail 
to give. 
City sidewalks are not favorable for hiking; while the hard 
smooth surface saves shoes and makes walking less difficult, it is at 
the same time bad for the feet and it fails to provide the variety 
of exercise involved in walking over the uneven surfaces of fields and 
woods. The country has the further advantage of providing matters 
of interest in the observation of birds, trees, flowers, and other ma- 
terial for the study of nature. The Boy Scouts and the Camp Fire
-P-A-G-E-220
212 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Girls lay great stress on hiking and on lines of work and study that 
involve cross-country hiking. Lanes, fields, woods, and country 
roads are the best places to hike; the main highways are no place 
for it, for the hikers slow up and interefere with the regular trafhic, 
while the automobiles are a menace to the lives of the hikers. 
Walking was once included in athletic competition, but it was 
dropped out for several reasons; it is an awkward, ungraceful event, 
it is too slow to appeal to spectators, it is very difficult to detect the 
change from a true walk to a run, and it is not an attractive sport to’ 
take part in. 
Running 
Running differs from walking in that it leaves the body unsup- 
ported for a part of the time, each step being a spring into the air, 
while in walking the body is supported all the time by one limb 
or the other. Running is the most rapid form of locomotion in 
man, and as such was of daily use to primitive man. As long as 
man had to get close enough to the deer to strike it with a club 
before he could secure it for food, running was a prime necessity. 
Now, like climbing, it has practically passed out of use as an activity 
of civilized life except as it is preserved in play. Thirty years ago 
Drummond wrote, ‘‘Whereas once all men were athletes, now we 
have to pay to see one,” and if it were not for the hearty acceptance 
of the play programmes by our schools and colleges it would be true 
to-day. But running is the most universal of motor play activities, 
and, in spite of its critics, is probably the most valuable of them all, 
developing as it does not only the lower limbs but the trunk, arms, 
and vital organs. Since it is only in play activity that running sur- 
vives, we have here another argument for making play universal. 
A slow run is called a jog; but when a runner goes at top speed, 
without trying to reserve his strength or wind, it is called a dash or a 
sprint. Hurdling is running and jumping over obstacles called 
hurdles. The hurdles are of standard height and placed at stand- 
ard distances, so that an athlete can learn to space his steps. Foot- 
racing is now done on smooth cinder tracks outdoors and cork 
tracks indoors, so made as to favor the fastest pace; the ancient 
Greek athletes, on the other hand, ran their races in soft sand, to 
develop their muscles. The change has followed the invention of the 
stop watch, by which races can be timed accurately. So long as 
races were without any instrument for timing, the only incentive was 
to beat the opponent, and this can be done in sand as well as any-

where, but with the establishment of records of so many seconds for 
a race of such a length came an interest in faster time, and hence, 
better tracks.

Dancing consists of rhythmic bodily movements combined with 
a succession of steps and taken to accompany certain types or pieces 
of music. The separate steps are usually simple and easy to learn, 
such as touchsteps, glides, turns, and simple walking steps; they are 
combined into groups of which there are an indefinite number, such 
as the skip, polka, two-step, waltz, galop, schottische, mazurka, 
pirouette, and pas de basque. Certain lively and vivacious dances 
are known as clogs, jigs, or lilts, and include almost continuous hop- 
ping or jumping combined with other movements; the minuets are 
dignified and slow. 
The most popular and satisfactory dances for small children are 
the song plays, in which the steps are easy, usually skipping, and the 
children sing to accompany the movements. “Did You Ever See a 
Lassie,” ‘The Muffin Man,” and “The Farmer in the Dell” are 
familiar examples. Much valuable dancing material has been found 
in the tribal and folk dances of various tribes, races, and nationali- 
ties. Other kinds of dancing now in common use include natural 
dancing and aesthetic dancing. 
Jumping 
Jumping is springing into the air from one or both feet. Primi- 
tive man developed the coordination of the jump in his running 
through the forest, where he had to leap over logs, rocks, and 
streams. To jump is the same as to leap; it is a general term, in- 
cluding several varieties. If the jumper.springs from one foot and 
alights on the other, it is a step; if he alights on the foot from which 
he sprang, it is a hop: these are the most common of the special 
forms. A hurdle-jump is a form of step, so taken as to pass over 
the hurdle most easily without striking it. A high jump is taken to 
find how great a height can be passed; a broad jump to find how 
great a horizontal distance; a rope jump is a jump taken to allow a 
swinging rope to pass beneath the feet. 
A common modification of jumping is vaulting, in which the 
hands and arms are used to aid the lower limbs. The hands may 
(1) be placed on a stationary object, such as a bar, fence, or special
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
apparatus, (2) grasp a suspended rope or pole, (3) hold a pole 
which is used in vaulting at the end of a run. 
A number of stunts usually classed together under the name of 
tumbling or acrobatics may also be considered as modifications of 
jumping. The simplest is rolling, where, starting with a spring from 
the feet, the body is flexed to approach the form of a wheel and one 
or more revolutions are made across the floor; the backward roll is 
the reverse of the forward roll. When the roll is preceded by a 
spring into the air, head and arms first, going from that start into a 
roll, it is called a dive, which may be made for height or horizontal 
distance. When the same movement as a dive is quickly followed 
by a complete revolution of the body, as in a roll, but before the 
body reaches the floor, it is called a somersault or flip; this is taken 
forward or backward. Headsprings, handsprings, and snap-ups or 
kips are other acrobatic stunts of this class. This whole group calls 
for exceptional strength and coordination of muscles. 
Climbing 
Primitive man must have done much climbing to develop the 
climbing reflex in the nervous system as we find it to-day in every 
child. A babe two days old will grasp a rod with his hands and sup- 
port his weight in that way; the coordination develops rapidly as 
soon as the child tries to climb; the structure of the human foot 
has the appearance of a climbing quite as much as a walking appa- 
ratus. Because of these facts and others of similar nature, many 
scientists believe that mankind at one stage of racial history lived in 
trees. However that may be, civilized man has gradually done 
away with climbing by first inventing ladders, then stairs, and now 
finally the elevator, so that this form of locomotion, like running, 
promises soon to persist only in play. 
Climbing means mounting or descending slowly and laboriously, 
using hands and feet, although we use the term in case of stairs, 
where the hands are not used. It has been found that climbing 
vertically requires thirteen times as much energy as moving the 
same distance horizontally, which shows how strenuous an activity 
it is. The term is also used to refer to locomotion horizontally as 
well as vertically when the footing is scanty and the hands need to 
be used to prevent falling, as in crossing the frame of an unfinished 
building. 
Climbing is a very popular play activity except where the arms 
and hands have lost their natural strength by long disuse. Ladders  
-P-A-G-E-223
CLASSIFICATION: MOVEMENTS 215 
are climbed with both hands and feet and with each of these alone; 
ropes and poles with hands and feet and hands alone: such apparatus 
is needed on every playground. Climbing trees and climbing hills 
and mountains are the most natural forms and are the most popular 
where the opportunity exists. Where they do not, the outdoor gym- 
nasium is the best substitute. 
An important group of play activities that may be considered as 
a modified form of climbing consists of exercises on bars, rings, 
horses, bucks, and other so-called “heavy apparatus.” The body is 
supported by the arms in many of these exercises, swinging from 
one position to another and combining the swings with vaults and 
movements closely resembling those of tumbling. Wonderful feats 
of strength and skill are performed on the heavy apparatus, and 
many favor its more general use, on the ground that locomotion by 
the lower limbs only, leaves the upper part of the body with too little 
development for health and vigor. The bars, rings, and horse should 
be found in every fully equipped gymnasium and the exercises taught 
to all who like them. 
The forms of climbing most often used in athletic contests are 
rope climbing and chinning the bar; the latter consists of lifting the 
body repeatedly by the arms until the chin is above the bar, to see 
how many times it can be done in succession without touching the 
floor with the feet. 
Swimming 
This includes several forms of locomotion on or through the 
water. The breast stroke and the similar movement on the back are 
close imitations of the swimming of the frog; the scissors-kick is a 
modification of the frog kick used when the swimmer is on his side. 
Other forms of swimming use the four limbs in alternation, after the 
manner of quadrupeds as they walk, run, or swim. The dog paddle 
is the simplest, imitating closely the manner in which horses and 
dogs swim. The side stroke is made in the same manner while lying 
on the side, or the alternate leg movements may be replaced by the 
scissors-kick, which is more effective. The over-arm is like the side 
stroke except that the upper arm is lifted out of the water and 
carried forward beyond the head while it is in the air, then dipped 
and used to propel the body. The alternate over-arm is like the 
single over-arm but taken alternately right and left with a roll of 
the body from side to side; the trudgeon is very similar, the scissors- 
kick being narrowed or replaced by a single leg-thrash. The crawl
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
has the alternate arm stroke with much less rolling from side to 
side; the face is immersed most of the time, the breath being ex- 
pelled under water and inhaled at regular intervals as the head turns 
to one side. 
Diving 
Diving is entering the water head first by a spring from shore 
or from a supporting object. The simplest form is the plunge, which 
is made to gain distance without very much regard to form; in 
other dives the diver is expected to enter the water with little splash- 
ing. The main types are the front, back, side, and twist, with or 
without a run, and there are also several variations such as the jack- 
knife, somersault, and swan. 
Swimming and diving are always exceedingly popular forms of 
play activity. Modern methods of sanitation of swimming pools, in- 
cluding filtering, sterilizing, and testing the water, are making the 
swimming pool a safe place to play in and are extending the time 
for swimming through the entire year. Swimming needs careful 
supervision to make it safe. 
Interest in life-saving events has been stimulated by the Ameri- 
can Red Cross, which awards arm bands and other trophies for 
skill in a group of movements such as floating, treading water, tow- 
ing a person, breaking holds, removing the outer clothing while in 
deep water, and the Shaefer method of resuscitation. 
Using Apparatus or Vehicles 
Skating, skiing, snowshoeing, and walking on stilts are modifica- 
tions of walking that make very attractive substitutes for hiking 
under certain seasonal and weather changes. Roller skates are use- 
ful in the same way when the sidewalks are smooth enough. Play 
leaders can stimulate these activities just as they can stimulate hik- 
ing, by announcing times and places for groups to go, and possibly 
contests of one kind and another. The same is true of coasting and 
bicycling. The use of rowboats and canoes is one of the big attrac- 
tions of the summer camps and furnishes the very best kind of activ- 
ity. Swings, teeters, and giant-strides should be found on every 
playground. 
HANDLING OBJECTS 
The bodily movements involved here are throwing, catching, 
striking, swinging, pushing, pulling, lifting, carrying, and a few 
others. 
   
-P-A-G-E-225
  CLASSIFICATION: MOVEMENTS 217 
Throwing 
Throwing is moving an object so swiftly while it is held in the 
hand that it will travel through the air for some distance on releas- 
ing it. Here is another example of a complex movement developed 
to a high degree in primitive times and now persisting only in our 
play. It is an important exercise for bodily development, involving 
the grasping movement of the hand, a swing of the arm and 
shoulder, a twist of the trunk and hips, and a push from the rear 
foot. There is perhaps no single exercise more enjoyed by players. 
Strength is developed by throwing for distance, as in contests with a 
baseball or basket ball; skill by throwing at a mark, as in target 
throws and throwing for goal in basket ball. 
Tossing is a variety of throwing used by the pitcher in indoor 
baseball, also in bowling, and some other sports; the arm is swung 
far back in preparation and then swiftly downward and forward, 
releasing the object after the arm has gone well forward. Pitching 
quoits involves the same style of motion. In serving tennis one hand 
tosses the ball directly overhead, in preparation for striking it with 
the racket. 
Putting is a variation of throwing used in handling heavy objects, 
and especially in putting the shot in athletic competition. Here the 
shot is held close in front of the shoulder and then pushed directly 
forward and upward by an extension of the joints of the arm instead 
of using a swinging movement. Slinging is throwing by means of a 
sling, which is an implement made of an oblong piece of leather or 
fabric to hold the missile and two cords by which it is swung around 
the head to give it momentum. Casting is a form of throwing used 
in fishing for trout and bass, the bait with the line attached being 
thrown a considerable distance by a.swing of the fishing rod, which 
unwinds the line from a reel attached to the rod. 
Catching 
Catching is stopping a ball or other missile and grasping it with 
’ the hand. It may be done with one or both hands; in baseball one 
hand is protected by a glove or mitt, which also.aids the player to 
hold the ball. In lacrosse the ball is thrown and caught with the 
crosse, which is a loosely strung racket with a long handle. Bean 
bags are used with young children to help in perfecting the coordina- 
tion. The most difficult part seems to be to train the eye to make 
accurate judgments as to the path an object is following and where it 
will go. College girls who have not had such training of the eye will
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
frequently reach for a ball that is not coming within ten feet of them; 
and again, will let a ball hit them in the face when a boy would un- 
consciously raise his hand for protection. 
Striking 
Striking 1s used in boxing and in military combat, where a sword 
or bayonet is used; more often still in games of ball. In handball the 
ball is hit with the hand, often protected by a glove; in football it is 
struck with the foot, with the tip of the shoe in a drop-kick and a 
dribble, and with the instep in punting; in other games with some 
kind of a swinging implement: bat, racket, crosse, club, or mallet. 
The general form for the movement in all is a swing of the arms 
and shoulders and a twist of the trunk, quite like that made in throw- 
ing. Striking is another of the primitive but now nearly discarded 
movements of the body very popular with players of games. 
Pushing and Pulling; Lifting and Carrying 
Pushing and Pulling are seen in the tussling play of children, in 
wrestling and related combats, and in rowing and paddling. Push- 
ing is found also in football; pulling in handling a sled. These ac- 
tivities are often brought in incidentally in connection with all kinds 
of motor play rather than in particular games, and the same is true of 
lifting and carrying. All these forms of activity have a considerable 
place in all organized motor play but not in any regular way. 
Sensory Training in Motor Play 
It was pointed out in an early part of this chapter that motor 
play involves much sensory activity. Now that we have taken 
account of the details of the motor activity, it is well to recur to this 
point. When we notice the extent to which the eye is used in walking 
and running, especially in the cross-country variety, and the cultiva- 
tion of muscular sense involved, we begin to get an idea of how 
motor activity trains the senses. Consider the jumper, springing to 
full height or distance and watching the place to alight; how much 
training of eye in coordination with limb is necessary to complete the 
jump successfully ! 
Yet it is in throwing, catching, and striking that eye training and 
muscular sense training reach their maximum. Say what we may of 
the training of the eye in reading, music, and penmanship—none of 
these even remotely approach baseball, basket ball, and tennis as a 
means of training the eye, to say nothing of coordinating it with 
hand and other parts of the body. It is in reading and writing, too, 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  CLASSIFICATION: MOVEMENTS 219 
and not ball games, that the eye is weakened, so that glasses are 
necessary. Hearing has its training in play also, and touch. 
Intellectual Activity in Motor Play | ' 
It is, of course, nonsense to claim that motor play, such as we 
have been considering, does not train the mind. What could be better 
training in quick and accurate thinking than a baseball game? The 
good player gets the situation accurately in mind while there is a 
moment of pause and then when a ball is batted he' knows the facts 
on which a decision must be made instantly. If he fails to grasp the 
situation he bungles the play; if he is slow in thinking, opponents 
get the start of him. On the other hand, what can be better training 
in slow and careful thinking than the planning of the strategy of.a 
football game or the careful watching for the weak points of an 
opponent in tennis and planning how to take advantage of them? 
Right here is a popular misconception that is so crude that there 
is no excuse for it. Boxing, football, and all such games are 
commonly referred to in intellectual circles as competitions in mere 
brute strength, when everyone knows, as soon as he stops to think of 
it, that they require quite as intense activity of senses and intellect as 
of muscle—success depending even more on a quick’ eye and a clear 
head than on strength or endurance. All our active games and 
sports, always classified as motor types of play, are in fact well- 
balanced combinations of motor, sensory, and intellectual activity, 
with just enough emotional excitement to make them enjoyable and 
beneficial. 
COMPARATIVE VALUES 
All school children, college students, and others who, like them, 
are engaged in sedentary occupations, have plenty of sensory and 
intellectual activity, but suffer in comfort, health, and general de- 
velopment from lack of fundamental motor training. The play 
leader and physical educator would seem to be justified therefore, in 
trying to get for these individuals from two to four hours a day of 
fundamental motor play, in place of their spending so much time in 
movie shows and other popular kinds of sensory and intellectual 
diversion. This is all the more appropriate when we consider that 
the theater, card party, and pool room provide no better sensory or 
intellectual training than the motor plays and games, and are entirely 
lacking in the exercise of big muscles upon which depend in large 
measure, not only health and vigor, but aoe and development as 
well.

  CHAPTER XI 
CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 
The last chapter gave an account of the forms of play, classified 
according to the parts of the body and mind that are involved. 
Emphasis was laid on the wide range of play activities and the well 
balanced training given by the so-called motor plays. No notice 
was taken of the motives and interests of the players, but rather the 
attention of the reader was directed to the outward forms of play 
activity. The play leader, however, depends on interest to stimulate 
activity, and so he is concerned with play motives, quite as much as 
with its outward form. In fact, the motives of the players are so 
strong that they dominate the character of the play and form the 
basis for its division of play into very important types. 
MOTIVES IN PLAY 
The motives that impel people to play, as we have seen in our 
study of play’s origin and nature, arise from instincts that we inherit 
from our ancestors. Groos has pointed out the principal play mo- 
tives and the instincts from which they arise. The first four arise in 
the individual as an independent self, while the others are the result 
of relations he sustains to others.

The Instinct to be Active 
Earliest of all the play motives comes the instinct for activity. 
Long before the baby is able to stand or even to sit alone, and prob- 
221
-P-A-G-E-230
222 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
ably before he is at all conscious of what he is doing, he keeps up 
a continual round of fundamental movements of all the simpler 
forms whenever he is awake. This does a great deal to stimulate 
his rapid growth and development, which is proceeding faster than 
it ever will afterward. With the awakening of consciousness comes 
curiosity, leading him to experiment, to reach for things, and to try 
new movements. This instinct to be active gradually fades out but 
never wholly disappears. Even the aged have an impulse to move 
about after a time of inactivity. 
Self Improvement 
Very early in his life the child becomes aware of his own im- 
provement in motor ability. He notices that he can do things that 
were impossible before and that he improves in very many lines. 
This interests him in all kinds of stunts, new and old, and leads up to 
an interest later in athletic contests and tests of efficiency. 
Acquisitiveness 
The enjoyment of play with certain toys soon gives rise to a 
desire to have them ready at hand, and a sense of possession is in 
that way developed. This acquisitiveness soon spreads to other 
things in which the child has an interest, usually a play interest. 
Here we have the foundation for the desire to possess play imple- 
ments, such as skates, gloves, sleds, and balls. The same instinct is 
the basis also for the desire to make interesting collections of things, 
such as stones, leaves, flowers, insects, birds’ eggs and nests, stamps, 
and pictures. The collection of many of these things gives a liking 
for cross-country: hiking in some people who are lacking in the usual 
play interests. 
Constructive Instinct 
Closely related to the acquisitive instinct is the constructive in- 
stinct. It is this instinct that leads children universally to enjoy play- 
ing in sand, for the sand is easily moulded into a variety of forms. 
Children often find things that have been discarded by older people 
and which they can play with by making a little repair; this gives 
them an interest in mending them, and is often the beginning of 
interest in actual construction. The making of dolls’ clothes and 
playground apparatus are among the earliest examples of construc- 
tive play, leading up to more formal kinds of handicraft.
-P-A-G-E-231
    CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 223 
ASSOCIATIVE PLAY MOTIVES 
The Social Instinct 
First among the instincts depending on our relation to other 
people is the social or gregarious instinct. This is the instinct that 
leads people to live and work in densely populated cities and to take 
their vacations in crowded resorts, even when the opportunities for 
work and play and for healthful living can be had as well in quieter 
places. Most people crave companionship in work and play; many 
find satisfaction in the presence of big crowds and in finding new 
acquaintances, as well as in the company of friends; many suffer 
from vague fears when alone. This instinct for companionship is 
responsible largely for the interest most people have in pets; it 
accounts for the better success of hiking, skating, coasting, and other 
outdoor sports when there is a rather large group taking part. 
The Imitative Instinct 
This instinct leads people to copy the activities of others and to 
dress and behave as they do. We learn almost every activity by 
imitation, and it is therefore the source of most of our habits, good 
and bad. We copy from everybody but especially from our intimate 
companions and from famous people. A few years ago a profes- 
sional baseball pitcher invented a new movement of the arms and 
used it as a preliminary to every throw; he became a famous pitcher, 
and now this “wind-up” is used by every pitcher in the land. About 
the same time a tennis player formed the bad habit of making foot- 
faults; he became the national champion, and a whole generation of 
tennis players copied the defect in spite of the rules and penalties. 
Popular actresses color their cheeks so as to give an attractive ap- 
pearance under the glare of the stage lights, and in imitation, girls of 
all classes of society, although they do not appear on the stage and 
the artificial color therefore detracts from their appearance instead 
of improving it, also color their faces. An interesting illustration of 
imitation is the tendency spectators have when they watch an athlete 
perform a certain movement in a contest; they make a similar move- 
ment without being aware of it. 
The power of imitative impulse is seen at every ball game in 
the groups of small boys who stop watching the game they came 
to see in order to play an imitation of it. Because of this instinct, 
as Spencer pointed out, the child plays much in imitation of the 
activities of his elders. Sometimes it is a simple imitation, as when
-P-A-G-E-232
a 224 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
children imitate manners and customs, but more often it enters the 
realm of make-believe, as in playing house or playing Indian or 
soldier. Small children are apt to spend much time in self-imitation, 
repeating over and over again acts they have learned. 
The Competitive Instinct 
The competitive instinct finds expression in the romping and 
tussling in which children engage, in their racing, chasing, and hiding 
games, in the track sports and ball games of high school and college 
students, and in the business, political, and social rivalries of older 
people. In its lowest form it is a fighting instinct, with the desire to 
destroy or injure the opponents. Groos, who was interested particu- 
larly inthe play of animals and in lower forms of play, calls the whole 
group “fighting plays.”’ His choice of terms is justified because the com- 
petitive play of animals is mostly of the fighting type, but there are 
good reasons for our using the other term in this discussion. 
Civilization grows by eliminating the fighting instinct and developing 
in its place the higher forms of rivalry, with the desire to defeat the 
opponents by surpassing or excelling them rather than by injuring 
them. The desire to achieve and show superiority is one of the 
strongest and best motives to encourage in youth, for it stimulates 
everyone to do his best. It is so strong in youth that a very large 
part of the play in which school children and college students engage 
is of the competitive type. 
The Mating Instinct 
The mating instinct develops in every normal individual when the 
appropriate stage of development is reached. This is after puberty, 
as one comes to take on the size, form, and figure that characterize 
maturity. The mating impulse culminates in courtship, marriage, 
the bearing and rearing of children, and related activities of family 
life. It is as natural to adult life as imitation is to childhood. It 
gives rise to a group of play activities related to courtship, and which 
have as their distinguishing feature a pairing of the players into 
couples, along the line of sex. The so-called “social dancing” is a 
familiar example; here the rhythm, the bright costumes, and the 
social contact all help to make the dance attractive, and especially so 
to women.
-P-A-G-E-233
  CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 225 
KINDS OF SOCIAL PLAY 
The simplest type of social play has for its motive the desire 
for companionship and the pleasure involved in watching the actions 
of the others, hearing them talk, talking oneself, and exhibiting 
one’s own face, figure, clothes, and abilities. This kind of social play 
is seen in the casual meeting of children while going to and from 
school, at recess, at lunch, at games and picnics, and in visiting and 
going to parties. Older people get the same kind of play in making 
calls, attending parties, receptions, and banquets, and in meetings of 
church and social clubs. There is also a good deal of social play of 
this kind in outdoor sports, such as hiking, skating, coasting, canoe- 
ing, camping, and the like, and the social activity does much to make 
these sports pleasurable and popular. 
A higher form of social play is found where individuals join to- 
gether in an organized attempt to do something—a form of ‘“‘team- 
work” in which each one has a part, as in carrying on a social, a 
picnic, a series of literary programmes, or taking part in team games. 
Education for citizenship requires much practice in both of these 
forms of social play, the first to enable one to meet people and to 
appear to advantage and at ease with others, and the second to pre- 
pare one to take his part, and preferably a leading part, in the 
highly organized and difficult work of the complex society in which 
we live. The school and the college usually provide abundant oppor- 
tunity for the simpler kind of social play, but there should be more 
extensive provision for the higher form of social play in team games 
for boys and girls, especially after they have reached high school 
age. Football, baseball, hockey, tennis, and organized athletic 
meets furnish one of the very best opportunities for this kind of 
social activity along with the individual training in physique and 
intelligence they afford. 
While the activities just mentioned meet the social needs of the 
pupils, there are usually in every community many parents and other 
citizens who lack opportunity for social activity, and who never make 
many acquaintances nor get into the social life of the town. For- 
merly, it was not considered a duty of the school and playground to 
furnish recreation for people outside of school; but it is now found 
to be very desirable to do so and it often falls to the play director 
to plan and conduct such activities. By the organization of parties, 
picnics, special days for parents, and Parent-Teacher clubs, many
-P-A-G-E-234
226 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
people get acquainted with each other and with the teaching staff, 
come to learn more of the spirit and purpose of the school, and a 
big service to the community is thus accomplished. Unless some- 
thing of the kind is done, many people in the community fail to 
appreciate what the school is doing, especially its newer features, 
and its financial needs are therefore not met as they should be. 
KINDS OF IMITATIVE PLAY 
The organized play programme includes five kinds of imitative 
plays: free play, simple imitation, story plays, rhythmic plays, and 
mimetic exercises. 
Free Play 
Free play is provided for individual children and small groups 
who use the swings, teeters, sand piles, giant-stride, or small play 
implements such as jumping-ropes, bean bags, or balls. A certain 
amount of organization and supervision is always needed in free 
play, to provide for rotation in the use of the equipment. 
Simple Imitation 
In simple imitation the whole group acts in unison in imitation 
of the teacher or some leader. ‘Follow the leader’’ is the most 
familiar example. The interest that small children have in direct 
imitation of someone else is reinforced by the variety and novelty of 
the movements and by the chance to be leader some of the time. 
There are only a few variations of this type of play, for it does not 
make much appeal to older children, and dramatic imitation suits the 
younger ones better. There is a partial organization into groups 
that rotate in the use of different play forms and implements during 
the play period. 
Story Plays ; 
The story plays are examples of dramatic imitation in which the 
players make believe they are doing something they have seen, ex- 
perienced, or learned about, everything being omitted from the story 
but certain physical activities chosen by the leader. The leader sets 
the example by performing the movements to a certain extent, but his 
most important duty is to stimulate the imagination of the pupils by 
mentioning the things to be done in their turn, and by making com-
-P-A-G-E-235
  
CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 227 
ments about them that will arouse enthusiasm and at the same time 
dictate the form of movement without seeming to do so. To make 
corrections, as in a gymnastic lesson, at once spoils the play and 
brings it down to the level of a drill, for it destroys the make-believe, 
which is the soul of the play. Story plays are very popular with 
many teachers of young children since the method enables the teacher 
to give a gymnastic lesson including the best types of movement in 
the guise of play. 
To plan a story play the teacher should choose a story that the 
children know well or an occupation or play in which they are much 
interested, work out carefully the programme of exercises to be given, 
and study how to lead and tell the story to best advantage. Story 
plays are most apt to fail because too little study is given to their 
preparation, and because teachers take them from a book or out- 
line without regard to whether the pupils are familiar with the 
activity to be dramatized. 
Children of the grammar grades also enjoy free play because it 
gives them a chance to try the stunts they have seen others perform 
on the apparatus and to practice the elements of the games, such as 
throwing and catching a ball, batting it or throwing for goal. They 
enjoy team games to a small extent but not yet enough to want highly 
organized play all the time, like some older players do. 
Rhythmic Plays or Dances 
Rhythmic plays or dances were mentioned in the preceding 
chapter and the outward form and character of the movements de- 
scribed. A large part of these, especially the song plays and folk 
dances, are imitative to a considerable extent, and still the motive 
that makes them so popular with girls is a complex one. Most girls 
still claim that their enjoyment of music and rhythm is the main 
reason they like to dance; the dancing satisfies them more than 
marching to music because it involves more bodily movement. Yet 
this does not explain why they never dance alone; the social instinct 
is also satisfied in the dance, for there is freedom to talk and to carry 
on various social activities, just as there is in games and outdoor 
sports. Most of these dances used in school are just vigorous enough 
to stimulate the heart mildly and give the pleasant feeling of exhila- 
ration everyone enjoys in outdoor walks and similar exercises. Be- 
sides, the dramatic or make-believe element is a strong attraction. 
Practically all children and many older people forget themselves in 
the make-believe of dramatic play and enjoy what psychologists call
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the “illusion of self-deception’’—of pretending they are somebody or 
something else. Song plays and folk dances give special opportunity 
for just this type of play, sometimes dramatizing the habits and 
peculiarities of people, as in “Did you ever see a Lassie” ; the move- 
ments belonging in older forms of industry, as in “The Shoemaker” 
and ‘‘The Weaving Dance’”’; or the features of courtship, as in ‘“The 
Villagers,” “The Unique,” and in “Coming Through the Rye.” 
Aesthetic dances give girls an opportunity to imitate the movements 
of professional dancers they have seen and admired, and there is an 
additional attraction because all these imitative dances lend them- 
selves so readily to costuming, where the enjoyment of bright and 
novel color effects is an important feature. 
Mimetic Exercises 
Mimetic exercises were first used to teach large classes of boys 
the correct form to use in. practicing the standard track and field 
events, such as putting the shot and the crouching start in sprinting. 
The correct movement is shown and a trained leader stands before 
the class and leads in the movements, but the special feature of the 
exercise lies in having the pupils make believe they are in actual 
competition, with all the necessary equipment. Here the mistakes 
are criticized, as it can be done in such a way as not to destroy the 
make-believe. Success depends much on the personality and en- 
thusiasm of the teacher and his perfect familiarity with the exercise 
he is trying to teach in this way. 
COMPETITIVE PLAY: INTRODUCTORY 
IMPORTANCE 
Competition should have a very large place in the activities of 
youth for two important reasons. First, because the competitive in- 
stinct is so strong in youth that no other type of play will stimulate 
interest and effort to anything like the same degree. Just as the 
primitive impulse to be active is subsiding and imitative plays are 
losing their power to stimulate activity and enthusiasm, the competi- 
tive impulse develops and arouses in everyone a new and greater 
interest in vigorous activity. The desire to achieve superiority and 
then to exhibit that superiority is universal and powerful. The 
kindergarten child, tired of his imitative play, responds with vigor 
and joy when challenged to a foot race. Laboring men forget their
-P-A-G-E-237
  CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 229 
fatigue in the enthusiasm of a baseball game. School life suppresses 
habits of activity to such an extent that competition is absolutely 
necessary to counteract it. 
The second reason why competitive play should have so large a 
place in the activities of youth is because competition has so large 
a place in life. Competition used to be called the “‘life of trade,” 
but nowadays it is the “‘trade of life.’”’ No matter who you are or 
where you live, no matter whether you engage in social life, in in- 
dustry, in business, in a profession or in politics, you are sure to find 
yourself in strenuous competition—first against others of your own 
calling and then, in cooperation with them, in just as strenuous 
competition against other groups of people. This situation is the 
same everywhere and all young people will sooner or later become 
involved in it. All children should therefore practice competitive 
plays, and in that way learn the rules of the game and become 
trained for competition. 
MANAGEMENT 
Like everything else, competitive play must be well managed to 
give the best results. Some of the habits and qualities discussed in 
later chapters as needed for success in life are developed by competi- 
tive play, no matter how it is conducted. Physical benefits, such as 
strength, endurance, and alertness are also developed, even under 
poor management. If we want games to be popular with the players 
and to develop the qualities desired for citizenship, such as loyalty, 
self-control, and sportsmanship, care must be taken to provide 
suitable place and equipment and to secure fair play. The latter re- 
quires good rules and good officials. Games are never successful or 
popular unless all these needs are provided. The ancient Olympic 
festivals owed their unparalleled success for twelve centuries to good 
management and fair and rigid officiating. The standardizing and 
publishing of rules have done great things to improve competitive 
play; enforcement of these rules by strict and impartial officials is 
just as essential. 
COACHING 
Sportsmanship is the spirit that competitive play should develop, 
and it cannot be done by rules and officials alone. Coaches and play 
leaders must stimulate the spirit of sportsmanship in their players. 
Even if a coach has a craze to win, if he is experienced he will know
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
that itis more to his advantage to teach good plays that are within the 
rules than to try to get away with crookedness. One of the best 
ways to teach sportsmanship is to teach clearly the meaning of com- 
petitive play and what winning really means. To win is to show 
superiority. It is of no benefit to a player or team to steal the name 
of winning if not really the better player or team. To make an 
unfair play deliberately is an admission of inferiority—it is.simply 
“throwing a monkey-wrench into the machinery”—for then no one 
can tell who is the best. Roosevelt’s motto. ‘Play clean and play 
fair, but hit the line hard” cannot be improved upon. The elements 
of sportsmanship—honesty, courtesy, generosity, and friendliness— 
appeal to everyone who has not been wrongly taught, but they must 
be taught, for they are not primitive but civilized virtues. 
KINDS OF COMPETITIVE PLAY 
The varieties of competitive play are almost endless, but they 
all fall easily into two well-defined groups: contests and games. 
Contests may be exemplified by foot racing and competition in jump- 
ing; games by Pom Pom Pull Away and basket ball. The main dis- 
tinction is this: .contests are calculated to test a player’s separate 
abilities, one by one; while games test many abilities along with 
generalship in choosing the right thing to do to meet any emergency. 
Contests 
For the purpose of determining the separate abilities of the 
players, there are events to test all the main lines of physical ability: 
short runs to test speed, long runs to test endurance, high and broad 
jumps and vaulting to test different types of agility, shot and discus 
to test strength and skill. Any trial of ability may be called a test, 
but in order to have a contest there must be opponents. Contests 
can be held in any form of locomotion or handling of objects, but 
those found by long experience to be most satisfactory have become 
an accepted list for general use and are well standardized: that is, 
they are performed in the same way and by the same rules every- 
where. 
It is not considered fair in contests to allow any interference with 
a contestant, either by players or spectators. If a player’s friends 
help him or his opponents hinder him, his performance is not a real 
test of his ability in the event for which the contest was designed.
-P-A-G-E-239
  CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 231 
Strategy and deception are out of place in a contest for a similar 
reason: they substitute mental ability and mental alertness for the 
physical ability which the event should test. If, in a mile run, for 
example, the members of one group of runners pocket the best man 
of the opposing team so that their best man does not have to outrun 
him, it is not only poor sportsmanship. but it completely destroys the 
event as a means of testing ability in running, and changes it to a con- 
test in strategy, which belongs in games but not in contests. The 
Greek myth of Atalanta is a classical illustration of a contest dis- 
honestly won. Atalanta promised to marry the first man who could 
outrun her. She defeated several suitors: Milanion, however, re- 
ceived from the goddess Aphrodite three beautiful golden apples; 
starting with a burst of speed greater than he could maintain, he 
dropped the golden apples, one by one, in the path; Atalanta paused 
to pick them up and was defeated in the race. . 
Games 
Games are competitions that are full of unexpected situations, 
strategy, and deception. It is a part of the game to outwit the oppo- 
nents and to give them a wrong idea of what one intends to do; also 
to interfere with their plans and plays as much as possible, unless the 
rules forbid. In order to make the game the best and most satis- 
factory to all concerned there must of course be some rules placing 
a limit on kinds of interference and kinds of offensive play, and 
players should be made to understand that the rules are made by 
experienced people for the benefit of the game. Rules of baseball, 
for example, forbid some kinds of deception a pitcher might use, be- 
cause it makes a poorer game to permit it; there are similar rules 
in basket ball, football, and all games. The reader will see from 
the above discussion that contests are intended to cultivate separate 
physical abilities, such as running, jumping, and throwing; while 
games cultivate general physical ability along with strategy, quick 
thinking, and ability to adapt one’s play to all kinds of situations. 
Summary : 
Competitive play is play in which the main incentive is rivalry, 
or comparison of abilities: contests are simple competitive plays in 
which the players, without interference or strategy, do the same 
thing to see which excels in it; games are competitive plays in which 
players use many kinds of ability along with strategy, deception, and 
interference.

  “232 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Applying the above principles to the classification of competitive 
play, we see that contests include all the track, field, and aquatic 
sports, the badge tests, archery, target shooting, relay races, and a 
few activities such as golf and bowling that are usually called games. 
On the other hand, the list of games will include not only tag and 
ball games but wrestling, fencing, boxing, and similar exercises of the 
type of combats, which are more often spoken of as contests. 
There are a few forms of play that are like the contests excepting 
that they permit a slight amount of interference; such are croquet, 
curling, quoits, bowling on the green, and one or two others. These 
really form an intermediate group, between contests and games. 
The clear distinction that has just been drawn between contests 
and games is not usually made in our dictionaries and in books on 
the subject of play.‘ They use the two terms interchangeably, as is 
illustrated by the name “‘Olympic Games,” which refers to a group of 
contests that in present days would be called a “Track and Field 
Meet.” The word ‘‘game” has gone out of common use to refer 
simply to competition of that kind; players speak of a ‘“‘game of 
tag” or a “game of football” but not a ‘‘game of jumping” or a 
“game of diving.” Golf, bowling, and relay races are a little more 
complex than the simplest contests and for this reason are often mis- 
taken for games. The distinction between these two types is so per- 
fectly in accord with the rules that govern them that a clear recogni- 
tion of it by play leaders and coaches will help to clear up some 
points in sportsmanship that are often hazy in the minds of players, 
especially as to where strategy and deception are legitimate and 
where they are taboo. The word “game” has several meanings that 
are old and established and that never give rise to any confusion, but 
when the word is used in referring to a form of play it can best be 
used only to indicate those forms of competitive play in which 
strategy, deception, and interference are permitted along with the 
competition in physical ability—such as tag, baseball, tennis, and 
hockey. 
The only example in our current literature of any extensive use 
of the word “game”’ to designate any other than competitive plays is 
found in the books of plays for small children, written in the main 
by people connected with the kindergarten movement. These 
teachers have done a great work in developing the rhythmic and 
dramatic plays suited to the period of early childhood, calling them 
“Singing Games” and “Dramatic Games.’ Apparently the writers 
of these books have not been much interested in competitive sport  
-P-A-G-E-241
    CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 233 
and have not observed the marked tendency in recent years to drop 
the use of the term “‘Game”’ for such activities as song plays and 
folk dances, and to use it only where there is a struggle for 
supremacy. It will avoid confusion if the more general term 
“Plays” is used for simple activities of children that are non-competi- 
tive. 
We have taken pains to define plays, contests, and games, but 
have not stated what is meant by the term “‘sport,”’ which is so 
commonly used ina similar way. Like play, sport is a rather general 
term, including hunting, fishing, skating, and swimming, which are 
not necessarily competitive. It is also used to refer to horse-racing 
and bull-fighting as well as to track and field, baseball, football, and 
other activities, which have been classed under contests and games. 
The term “athletic sports’ or ‘‘athletics” means nearly the same, but 
suggests the vigorous competitive nature of the sport. 
Kinds of Contests 
Between Individuals 
The fundamental idea of a contest is a comparison of ability be- 
tween individuals. This is the simplest form of contest and the one 
that has been most used. This was the earliest form of competitive’ 
play, described in the oldest myths and legends of prehistoric times, 
long before there were any games. The Greeks were the first to be- 
come interested in contests as a means of stimulating physical 
practice and improving national physique, and they depended en- 
tirely on individual contests to stimulate interest. There has been 
an important growth of plans to encourage competitive play of this 
kind, beginning with the ancient Greeks. 
Championships: The athletic competition of the early Greeks 
was on a purely championship basis. Each city had local contests to 
find who was champion of the city in the various events, and as early 
as 776 B. C. national contests were held at Olympia. The winner re- 
ceived a prize, but no others were recognized. Starting with run- 
ning only, the list of events was gradually lengthened to at least 
thirteen. National contests were held at three other places also, but 
none of them equaled the Olympic festivals in athletic features. In 
modern times the championship plan of conducting contests in 
physical sports was revived by the British, brought to America about 
1850, when the city clubs forming the Amateur Athletic Union began 
active promotion of track and field sports, and finally has culminated
-P-A-G-E-242
234 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
in the revival of the international Olympic Festivals. The first of 
these was held in Athens in 1896, and one has been held every four 
years since then, excepting 1916. Another series of festivals is held 
in the Far East, known as the ‘Far East Olympic,” and includes 
Japan, China, and the Philippines. In these modern festivals‘a much 
wider range of events is run off than in the ancient ones, and several 
games are included. Local championships also are held everywhere 
in schools, colleges, athletic clubs, and on playgrounds. 
The principal faults of the championship plan of conducting con- 
tests are its tendency to encourage extreme specialization and its 
failure to stimulate any but the few best athletes to practice or com- 
pete. The Greeks recognized the first of these defects and devised 
the pentathlon, a combination of five events, to counteract it. They 
chose five events which together gave an all-around training and 
awarded to the winner of this event the highest honor of all. 
: In modern championships the same idea is carried out in several 
ways. The reorganized Olympic Festival holds a pentathlon and 
a decathlon, the latter consisting of ten events; the Y. M. C. A. holds 
a hexathlon (six events). The hexathlon is applied to three types 
of activity: indoor, outdoor, and aquatic. 
To encourage more persons to practice and to compete, more 
than one prize or honor is awarded in each event, in place of recog- 
nizing only the final winner, which was the earlier custom. It is usual 
to-day to give prizes to the three best contestants, and some associa- 
tions, like the I. C. A. A. A. A. give awards to the first four. An- 
other application of this same idea is dividing players into groups by 
weight, and holding a championship for each weight. This has been 
used most extensively in boxing and wrestling but is now being ap- 
plied to other sports as well, especially on playgrounds and in 
Y. M. C. A. classes. 
A third plan to encourage participation is to handicap those who 
are known to be the best by requiring them to do a better grade of 
performance than the others in order to win. Champion runners are 
set back and must start behind the line; jumpers and weight men 
must make a record better by a certain amount than ha often a 
special set of events is given for novices. 
The extent of competition is increased in some cases by having 
what is called a “qualifying round” to select the contestants for the 
meet froma larger number, and sometimes there is a “‘consolation 
series” of contests for those who lose out in the first round. 
Among the students of a school or college who do not succeed in 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 235 
“making the team,” individuals representing classes, fraternities, and 
other groups compete for an “intramural championship.” 
To further greater interest among the- better athletes, an 
“athletic fraternity” has been formed. Membership in this fra- 
ternity is an honor that can be awarded only to those who can pass 
certain athletic tests requiring a high grade of ability. 
Badge Tests: Several plans have been devised called badge 
tests, the one handled by the Playground and Recreation Association 
of America being the best known. The aim was to devise a set of 
contests to stimulate physical exercise and play among city children, 
where numbers are great, space and equipment scarce, and very little 
instruction to be had. In order to avoid the faults of the champion- 
ship plan the following features were included: each player must 
pass a certain standard in four events in order to secure a badge, and 
if he does so he receives the award, no matter how many others are 
as good as or better than he. Three grades of badges are awarded. 
Boys and girls have different events and standards to pass. The 
success of the plan has been remarkable, raising the standards of 
physique in many American cities. 
Point System: A plan that aims to interest every boy and girl in 
suitable physical events is called the ‘‘point system.” For each event 
there is made a scoring table, giving points from 0 to 1000 for the 
various degrees of excellence, o standing for a low grade, that any 
normal pupil may attain, and 1ooo for an ideal, something near 
the world’s record for that event. By reference to the table any 
boy or girl can see the rating for present accomplishment and is 
encouraged to make better and better records. State, national, and 
international meets are conducted by telegraph by the use of the 
scoring tables, the various schools, colleges, or Y. M. C. A. groups 
having their scores taken in their own gymnasiums and wiring to 
headquarters the highest scores. In this way interest is stimulated 
and the expense of travel is avoided. 
The point system, as a method of scoring, is to be used in 
preference to the plan of the badge tests, because the latter can test 
only a few grades of ability, while an ideal test will test all. 
Such problems as this arise: In scoring points for an event” 
should they be graded evenly from 0 to 1,000? That is, is it best 
that ten additional points, for example, shall be given for the same 
improvement in the lower and upper halves of the scale, or should 
a player get more as the difficulty becomes greater? Some teachers 
give most points for a certain amount of improvement in the middle
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
of the scale and less toward the top, as well as toward the bottom. 
They argue that even if it is harder as you pass up the scale it is 
less worth while, and it is better to encourage practice of one’s 
poorer events. 
Efficiency Tests: The simpler badge tests were the first to be 
used, but their limitations were soon noted. ‘Then, various point 
systems were devised. With a multiplicity of point systems in use 
the question next arose: What is the best set of events to test all- 
around physical efficiency? Is a large number of tests necessary, or 
can the same results be obtained by a few? Many of the runs and 
jumps used in the usual track and field sports are so nearly dupli- 
cates that they test practically the same ability and need not all be 
used. The problem is, how many are essential and which are the 
best? At present there is a nation-wide attempt to answer these 
questions. The work is being conducted along two lines. 
(1) The authors of various tests are using them repeatedly 
with large numbers of individuals, so that the point systems can be 
based on actual facts, rather than on opinions. 
(2) A comparison is being made among similar or related tests, 
to find out if possible which signify the most. 
At the time this book is being published, the studies in this line 
have given little ground for a definite conclusion. The statement of 
Gulick, many years ago, that the main lines of physical ability are 
running, jumping, throwing, climbing, swimming, and possibly danc- 
ing, is still very generally accepted and most efficiency tests are based 
on these events. Whether one or more of these may be omitted 
from a complete efficiency test under modern conditions, is at least 
doubtful. The evidence seems rather to be in favor of more than 
six tests, for tests of condition, such as the pulse and blood pressure 
tests, are considered important, as well as the tests of strength and 
skill that have been used almost exclusively up to this time. A simple 
way to test physical efficiency is yet to be found. 
Between Groups 
Another modern device to encourage wider participation in com- 
petitive play is the group contest, in which we test groups, teams, 
schools, colleges, cities, and nations instead of individuals. The 
comparison has been made in three different ways. 
Mass Competition: The first and theoretically the simplest way 
is to have the two groups come together and compete directly, as
-P-A-G-E-245
  
CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 237 
in the familiar ““Tug-of-War.” Unfortunately, there are very few 
of the abilities we wish to compare that can be tested between groups 
in the simple way in which the ability to pull is tested in Tug-of-War 
and so this method is practically of little value. 
Adding Individual Scores: The next way to compare the abilities 
of groups is to have individual contests and combine the results to 
give group scores. The oldest and simplest way to do this is to 
give points to those who win first, second, and third places, usually 
5 for first, 3 for second, 1 for third, then to add the points made 
by the group. When events are used in which there is a scoring 
table—contests in which there are weight classes—a fairer way is 
to add the points made by every contestant in the group. By agree- 
ing beforehand how many contestants each group may use, the score 
of each to count, the full number is stimulated to practice and 
compete. 
Relay Races: This is the third form of group competition. 
Here we have a form of contest especially adapted to running and 
swimming. The runners of a group take part in turn, each starting 
just as the preceding runner finishes, with the object of seeing which 
group can finish first. Of course, there must be the same number of 
runners in all the competing groups and each must run the same dis- 
tance. The best form of track for relay races is the round or oval 
track, but in less formal races with large groups it can be done more 
conveniently sometimes in a shuttle form, the first, third, fifth, and 
other odd runners taking a straight course in one direction and the 
second, fourth, and other even runners going in the reverse direc- 
tion. A third way of conducting a relay, invented by Gullick, is called 
the “wave” method; all the runners go in the same direction on the 
same track, like a series of waves across the water, a judge standing 
at the finish signaling each one when to start by waving a handker- 
chief at the instant the preceding runner finishes. 
The first form of relay is least liable to unfair gains by runners 
starting too soon; the last one requires a separate starter for each 
group. 
Relay races used for more-formal competition are being more 
and more standardized, just like other contests, but there is at the 
same time a great tendency to vary them greatly in informal activity, 
for the reason that they develop great enthusiasm among the runners 
and are therefore very popular for practice and class exercise. To 
make them still more interesting, novelties are introduced at intervals 
of the run, consisting of all kinds of simple exercises that the runner  
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
must stop and perform before he finishes, also various types of loco- 
motion. 
Broad jumping and distance throws can be conducted in relays, 
but they are too slow to arouse interest like the relays in running. 
Contests Resembling Games 
There is a small group of competitive sports that have some of 
the qualities of games along with those of contests, and thus they form 
a separate group. Croquet may be taken as a familiar example. In 
croquet each player follows the course and overcomes the same 
difficulties as the others; to this extent it is like a contest. One player 
may, however, if he chooses, hit another player’s ball instead of mak- 
ing an arch or a stake, and then he can drive the ball of the other 
player in some way to improve his own chances of winning. This 
interference with the play of an opponent is contrary to the funda- 
mental idea of a contest; it makes the play more like a game. Pitch- 
ing horseshoes and quoits, curling, and lawn bowling are also in the 
main like contests, but in each there is an opportunity permitted to 
interfere with the play of the opponents, and so they belong in this 
special group. 
From this standpoint, golf and bowling, although popularly 
called games, should be classed along with archery and track athletics 
as contests, because on examination it is seen that they lack the 
elements of surprise, interference, and strategy that are characteristic 
of games. 
Kinds of Games 
Games are best divided, according to the general age period to 
which they are naturally adapted, into elementary games, combats, 
and team games. 
Elementary Games 
In elementary games the competition is largely individualistic, 
and the organization comparatively simple. Some of them are modi- 
fied forms of the more complex team games, changed to suit chil- 
dren, such as Newcomb, One Old Cat, and End Ball; but most of 
them are running, dodging, and chasing games, played without balls 
or other equipment. There are two main groups: one where the 
play centers in getting possession of a home, base, or goal; and the 
other having chasing and tagging as the chief point of interest. 
Dozens of these games, named and described independently in books 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 239 
of play, are found on careful examination to be no more than slight 
variations from a few well-marked types. 
Goal Games: There are two kinds of goal games, quite different 
in idea and manner of play. In the first kind each goal is held by 
one player and there are almost goals enough for all, but there is 
always at least one player without a goal; all effort and interest cen- 
ters in avoiding being the one left out. The games differ only in the 
dramatic setting and in the way provided that one may get possession 
of a goal. In the simplest form only two players are active at once. 
The one who is “It”? chooses someone else who has to do something 
that takes him away from his goal, and then it is a game of wits and 
speed to see which of the two will reach the vacant place first. - 
“Come with Me” and “Good Morning” are games of this kind; 
another popular one, slightly different, is the old “Beater Goes 
Round,” since the war better known as “Swat the Kaiser.” In 
“Pussy Wants a Corner” the players slyly trade goals while the one 
who is “It” is a safe distance away, and he gets a goal as they become 
more careless; in “Squirrels in Trees,” ‘The First of May,” 
“Changing Seats,” Stage and Coach,” and several others there is a 
signal of some kind when all must exchange goals, giving the player 
who has no goal a fine chance to seize one. Inone type, like “Hunts- 
man,” “Going to Jerusalem,” and ‘Merry Go Round” all the 
players have to leave their goals to take part in some required activ- 
ity, and then at a signal all rush for goals. With some variations in 
the dramatic setting in which the game is slightly hidden, these are 
practically the only different types in over forty games of this class. 
Although very simple they are clearly games, having in all cases 
competition and freedom of action, strategy, and surprise to dis- 
tinguish them from contests. 
The second type of goal games is made up of a few games of 
“Hide and Seek.” There is a single goal used in common by all the 
players. The interest of the game centers in the hiding and hunting 
to find the hidden players, and in the race to touch the goal when one 
is seen or tries to get in free. The choosing of the one to be “It” 
by the use of “Counting Out” rhymes adds to the interest. 
Tag Games: Most tag games are dramatizations of hunting or 
warfare. Tag signifies capture. It is usually done by touching a 
player, in a few instances by hitting him with a thrown ball or bean 
bag, and in a few instances by, seizing and holding him until he is 
tagged or slapped three times. In some tag games there are goals, 
which here are places of safety. There are four varieties of tag
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
games that are entirely individualistic, and two types of cooperative 
games, making about one hundred separate games in all. 
Tag games vary greatly in the amount of activity involved, some 
of them being popular as quiet parlor amusements while others 
keep everyone in vigorous activity every moment. In general, the 
simpler ones are least active and the vigor increases with the com- 
plexity of the play. A few have features that permit players to be 
just as active or as inactive as they choose, and this fits them for 
mixed groups where there is wide variety in the strength, skill, and 
endurance of the players, as at picnics and in the rural and un- 
graded schools. The best way to classify tag games is to begin with 
the simplest and take up in order the added features that make them 
more complex and more vigorous. 
1. The very simplest tag games such as “Hunt the Fox” and 
“Squirrel and Nut” have only two players active at once, the others 
merely standing or sitting and looking on. One of the two is the 
Chaser, and the other is the Runner who tries to escape being tagged. 
When the Chaser tags the Runner, or if he does not succeed in doing 
so and the leader thinks the play has gone far enough, another 
Chaser and Runner are chosen and the game begins again. In some 
games of this kind, features are introduced that let the other players 
have some part in the activity, as in “Cat and Mouse,” “Bull in the 
Ring,” and “Fox and Chickens’; or there may be more than one 
runner, as in “Cat and Mice.” 
2. The next group of games is made slightly more complex, the 
play being continuous without the interference of the leader, by hav- 
ing the winner or loser in the chase choose a player to take the 
place of the one who retires. Most of these are played in ring 
formation; the list is rather long, with “Drop the Handkerchief,” 
“Exchange Tag,” and “Have You Seen My Sheep” as the most 
familiar ones. They are not much if any more active than the first 
group, especially ‘“Have You Seen My Sheep,” which has a feature 
that delays the active elements of the play. 
3. The third group, including ‘‘Fox and Squirrel” and ‘Three 
Deep,” usually has only one Chaser and one Runner, but the instant 
the Runner is tagged he becomes Chaser, and the player he is to 
chase can become free and make another player take his place at 
any time, the way of doing this being varied in the different games. 
This feature keeps everyone on the alert, as any player is likely to 
be tagged at once if he fails to pay attention. 
4. Games of the fourth class differ from those of the third in
-P-A-G-E-249
  CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 241 
that any player may be tagged, instead of one pArticular player. 
There is usually some way to avoid capture, differing in each game: 
sometimes it consists in staying in a safety zone, as in “King’s Land” 
and “Duck on the Rock”; sometimes in assuming some posture or 
position, as in “Statue Tag,” or “Hang Tag’’; or touching some kind 
of substance or object, as in ‘Wood Tag” and “‘Tree Tag.”” As in 
preceding groups, there is a wide difference in the amount of 
dramatic imitation. 
5. Thus far the games have been strictly individual games, but 
now we come to the beginning of team play, with the players who 
have been tagged joining the Chaser and helping to tag all the others. 
This group includes about twenty games the most familiar being 
“Pom Pom Pull Away,” “Hill Dill,” and “Black Tom.” Many 
differ from these only in the dramatic features; a few like ‘“‘Fisher- 
man,” ‘London Loo,” and “Trades” have a little more of team 
play. 
6. The final group has ‘‘Prison Base” as its type, and is made 
up of tag games of the strictly team kind, the players no longer being 
satisfied to join the opponents as soon as they are tagged but in- 
stead being prisoners of their captors until their teammates are able 
to release them. These games are very complex and very vigorous. 
They are not so popular as they once were, younger players liking 
the simpler games better and the older ones preferring the modern 
ball games. 
Personal Combats 
Combats are games rather than contests, as before explained, 
although they take place between individual players rather than be- 
tween groups. They include Boxing, Wrestling, Fencing, and minor 
varieties of each such as “Hand Wrestle,” ‘Indian Wrestle,” 
“Badger Pull,” “Wand Pull,” “Chicken Fight,” and several others. 
They are very popular with boys of adolescent age and make very 
good vigorous exercise. 
Team Games 
The team games that have won most popularity among players 
in recent years are all ball games. The use of the ball, in addition to 
all such interesting activities as running, jumping, dodging, etc., 
involves throwing, catching, and striking, and the most intense 
sensory and intellectual activity; and this no doubt accounts for the 
popularity of ball games of all kinds. There are three fundamental 
types of ball games, quite distinct in their nature and origin: base-
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
ball, tennis, and: football. Basket ball and hockey are plainly of the 
football type; for they are played on a rectangular field with a goal 
at each end, and the play is centered upon the securing of a goal. 
Because they are so important, and since they differ considerably in 
detail from football, they are often considered as distinct types of 
games. 
Baseball games combine running, throwing, catching, and strik- 
ing, with the goal and tag elements of the elementary games. They 
are of English and American origin and the English and American 
forms differ considerably. Baseball is distinctly modern, its most 
rapid development having occurred since the Civil War. 
After a great many attempts to devise or, find a baseball game 
of a form simpler than the regular professional game and suitable 
for girls and children, Indoor Baseball, played mostly out-of-doors 
with the 12 to 17 inch soft ball, has come into popular use and sup- 
plies the need very well. The ball that is used has acquired the name 
of ‘Playground Ball.” Long Ball, German Bat Ball, and One Old 
Cat, long used as introductory games, are going out of favor and the 
Indoor or Playground game is taking their place. 
Tennis games can be traced back to the tenth century, when they 
were played by members of the nobility in the castles of Central 
Europe. They were indoor games, played in a court with walls on 
all sides. Lawn Tennis was invented by an English army officer in 
1875. It was standardized within a few years and has since be- 
come popular the world over. The fact that the most prominent 
players in the international matches represent England, America, 
France, Italy, Japan, and Australia shows how widely the game is 
played. Badminton is a form of tennis played extensively in Eng- 
land; Racquets and Squash are popular among wealthy social clubs 
in many countries. Handball and its English variety “Fives” are 
good games played in many places; the Spanish play a form called 
Pelota and the Italians another variety named Pallone. 
The most popular game of the tennis type that has been devised 
in recent years is Volley Ball. It is the only one of the group 
adapted to use with large numbers and is very popular with players 
of both sexes. It probably will be still more widely played for it 
permits more players to the acre in congested places than any other 
popular game. 
Football games are characterized by a rectangular field with a 
goal at each end, usually consisting of two upright posts and a cross- 
bar. They were once played in Western Europe by teams represent-
-P-A-G-E-251
  
CLASSIFICATION: INTERESTS 243 
ing walled towns, the goals being the gates of the towns or fortresses, 
and the field the country between, often miles in extent. The game 
had no rules and there was no limit to the number of players nor 
the manner of their selection. This crude game, played in quite 
different ways in different places, was taken up by the English schools 
of the last century, standardized, and sets of rules agreed upon. In 
this way the two types of football—Rugby and Association—were 
developed, and in a similar way Field Hockey, Ice Hockey, Lacrosse, 
and Polo grew up in certain schools and athletic clubs. American 
College Football and Basket Ball are of more recent origin, the 
former being developed around 1880 and the latter in the “‘go’s.” 
Hockey and basket ball have assumed such importance of late as to 
require separate chapters in the practical part of the course. 
KINDS OF MATING PLAY 
The most common mating plays among the western nations are 
social dancing and similar plays in which the main feature of interest 
is a sex division of the group into couples, so as to give the intimate 
companionship with one of the other sex that the mating instinct de- 
mands. Kissing games, once prominent features at parties, are no 
longer approved by the best society, but social dances are more 
popular than ever, although the style of dancing now in vogue is less 
refined and dignified than that used in former years. Young women 
are especially fond of the simple social dances, so much so that 
many of them, if free to choose, would never engage in another kind 
of amusement when it is possible to dance. They have more 
pleasure in rhythm than men and boys, and yet the fact that they 
always dance in couples shows the prominence of the mating instinct. 
There would seem to be no good reason for introducing mating 
plays before the mating instinct naturally develops; the surest way to 
have it develop normally is to develop a strong and healthy physique 
through exercises appropriate to the age of the child. In spite of 
this fact some parents make the mistake of sending young children 
to dancing school when Nature intended them to be climbing trees 
and playing tag. These parents believe that their young children 
will grow up to be more graceful dancers and have better success in 
courtship and marriage if they are made to imitate the manners of 
ladies and gentlemen in polite society. All such training of children 
in adult activities is of doubtful value; it is substituting work for 
play. ;

  CHAPTER XII 
HOW AGE AND SEX INFLUENCE PLAY 
The scientific study of children in recent years has awakened 
people, as nothing ever did before, to a realization of the importance 
of child life and the necessity of giving every child an opportunity 
for the best of training. As a consequence, more money is being 
spent for schools, more children are being sent to school, and an 
almost complete revolution has taken place in the theory and prac- 
tice of education. 
Child study has accomplished this by bringing to light a great 
number of interesting and significant facts. ‘To give a few examples: 
children are not only smaller than adults, but the body has alto- 
gether different proportions in the child; children have less ability 
than adults in some lines and more in others; they have different in- 
stincts, different likes and dislikes, and many unlike mental traits; 
their interests are not at all the same as the interests of adults, and 
they have a wholly different outlook upon life. Of special interest 
to us at this time is the fact that every normal life consists of several 
rather well-marked stages, of which adulthood is only one, and that 
the things that appeal most to a person in one stage of life may mean 
nothing at all to the same person when he arrives at another stage. 
Each age and sex has its special play interests. The boy of three 
plays horse; at six he plays tag and Indian; at twelve he takes up ball 
games of the individual or scrub variety; at sixteen he plays team 
games; at various times, individual feats of strength and skill absorb 
his interest. In like manner the girl takes up dolls, Hide and Seek, 
ball games, dancing, swimming, and basket ball, putting her whole 
soul into each in its turn. The play leader must make a study of 
these play interests of boys and girls at various ages; with as com- 
plete knowledge as can be had in this line he will be able to choose 
the best activities for each group and thus stimulate their best effort; 
at the same time he will avoid the main problems of discipline by 
keeping all so fully absorbed in their occupations that mischief has 
no chance to creep in. Without such knowledge the teacher will 
246
-P-A-G-E-255
  
HOW AGE AND SEX INFLUENCE PLAY 247 
have to learn the same things slowly by experiment, with much loss 
of time and of confidence of pupils and employers. 
Difficulties in Dividing Age Periods 
The transition of each individual from one period of life to an- 
other is gradual and partial, various instincts and traits and parts of 
the body undergoing the change one after another. There are also 
exceptions and variations in the order of development when we com- 
pare various individuals; for example, most children walk before 
they talk, but in some cases this order is reversed. Because of these 
many exceptions and irregularities, scholars have not been in full 
agreement as to the number of distinct periods of growth and the 
time of their appearance. 
Another reason why there is not full agreement upon the stages 
of life is that they have been studied from different points of view. 
Some have studied the growth in height and weight; some have 
studied intellectual growth and others the development of the emo- 
tions. Gulick, Johnson, and Lee have made studies of the periods 
in the development of play interests, and have been influenced to a 
large extent by the culture-epoch theory, which assumes that there is 
a period in the child to correspond to each period of racial history: 
animal, savage, pastoral, agricultural, etc. Most scholars divide 
human life into five or six periods, but some go so far as to describe 
ten; on the other hand, a few writers recognize but two. 
The time of transition about which there is most complete agree- 
ment is puberty, which occurs in girls of the civilized races at about 
the age of twelve (11-13) and in boys about two years later. 
Puberty is the dividing line between childhood and adolescence. It 
has been recognized from early times and has been known to savage 
races, who make it a time of rites and ceremonies admitting the youth 
to certain formal privileges, such as hunting and accompanying war- 
riors to battle. Marked changes in mental and physical traits and 
play interests occur at this time. 
Playground Basis. For practical reasons, directors of summer 
playgrounds make three divisions by dividing the twelve years of 
childhood into two periods of six years each. The first of these 
periods is called babyhood or early childhood; the second is called 
later childhood. The dividing line comes at the age when most 
children begin school, so that the plan is in agreement with the school 
programme. The main reason for this division is a marked change 
of play interests that takes place at about the age of six. Many
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
writers divide the period of babyhood again into two or more stages, 
and there are good reasons for doing so; yet, since it lies outside of 
the age when the child comes to the playground, we need not con- 
sider it here. Medical studies have shown that the period from 
seven to nine is often a time of slackening in growth, with a tendency 
to fatigue and weakness of the heart. Later studies indicate that 
such a condition is unusual rather than general; yet it is well to bear 
in mind that it sometimes occurs, so that some children need to be 
guarded against over exertion at this time. 
School Basis. Playgrounds connected with schools are neces- 
sarily influenced, in their methods of arranging play groups, by the 
divisions found in the school. It has been the general custom for a 
long time to divide the twelve grades of school life into three periods 
of four years each: the primary school, the grammar school, and 
the high school. This is a rather artificial division because it is 
based on the nature of the subjects to be taught, rather than upon 
the nature of the child. Puberty occurs in the middle of the 
grammar grades, instead of at a division point. A later plan groups 
the first six grades together to form an elementary school and divides 
the next six grades into two equal periods, known as the Junior and 
Senior high schools. Here the time of puberty corresponds to the 
change from elementary to high school, and the period of adoles- 
cence is divided at its middle, forming the two high school divisions. 
Some people complete the stages of growth and development 
that belong in the period of adolescence by the time they finish high 
school; some others, especially boys, are still immature during the 
greater part of college age. There is a wide range of difference in 
the time of attaining maturity in different races; some boys among 
savage tribes reach maturity at the age of ten, and some factory 
workers almost as early. A general tendency is seen in the educated 
classes in Europe and America to lengthen out the stages of growth 
and postpone mature life, adolescence persisting until the age of 
twenty and sometimes until twenty-four. 
THE PLAY PERIODS 
Making a combination, therefore, of the plans of grouping used 
in the summer playgrounds and in our educational system, we find 
five play periods of life which play leaders need to study: 
(1) from birth to six years, babyhood or early childhood; 
(2) from six to twelve, later childhood;
-P-A-G-E-257
HOW AGE AND SEX INFLUENCE PLAY 249 
(3) from twelve to fifteen, early adolescence; 
(4) from fifteen to eighteen, later adolescence; 
(5) from eighteen to thirty or longer, maturity. 
Babyhood (0-6) 
This period is also called ‘early childhood” and the ‘‘pre-school 
age.” Babies enjoy rolling, kicking, running, jumping, and the like, 
and keep up an almost ceaseless round of physical activity during 
their waking hours. The natural tendency to be active is the main 
incentive and the chief source of pleasure is in the variety of move- 
ments rather than in results. Fatigue comes on quickly, but by con- 
stantly varying his activity the baby is able to keep going con- 
tinually. Building with blocks, digging in the sand, wading in 
shallow water, and playing with swings, teeters, slides, and other 
simple playground apparatus later begin to have an appeal. 
By the time children of this age come to the playground they 
have an irresistible impulse to imitate, from which the period is 
often called the imitative, dramatic, or monkey stage. They prance 
like horses, fly like birds, howl like the wind, and sway like the trees, 
just for the joy of activity and make-believe. They like to dramatize 
all the familiar activities of the life in which they live, and act out 
in play all the details of house-keeping, farming, keeping a store, 
carrying the mail, directing the traffic at a street crossing, etc., with 
special interest in certain cases of unusual activity, such as trains, 
buildings on fire, soldiers on the march, the circus, and celebrations 
and parades. The activities of the kindergarten are planned to 
accord with the two leading characteristics of children of this age: 
the tendency to constant and varied activity, and the dramatic im- 
pulse. 
Later Childhood (6-12)—Elementary School 
During this stage, which extends from the time of entering 
school until puberty, children still imitate activities that they see, 
but it is no longer their main interest. It is an age of individualism 
and self-assertion, named by Lee the “Big Injun” period. Chil- 
dren now turn from imitation of what they see others do to doing 
real things on their own initiative, with great pride in what they can 
do. Ability and interest lie not so much in the direction of doing 
small and exact things, like writing or sewing, as in the feats of 
strength and skill involving the whole body, like running, dodging, 
throwing, climbing, and swimming. These are activities for which
-P-A-G-E-258
  
250 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
there is inherited ability, and children enjoy developing skill in them 
by practice, rather than by imitation of others; for this reason coach- 
ing is of little value at this time. Self-assertion is so prominent a 
trait that a group of children, if left to themselves, will often spend 
their whole play period disputing over what they shall play. 
Closely related to the fondness the child of the ‘‘Big Injun” 
period has in self-assertion is a passion for displaying his superior 
talents, and this gives rise to an interest in individual competition. 
Games of tag, based on the activities of hunting and warfare, are 
very popular; also individual contests in running, jumping, swim- 
ming, and other feats of strength and skill. The badge tests were 
devised by play leaders to give city children a simple programme of 
individual contests that can be practiced with little or no equipment. 
The period of later childhood is important as a time for acquir- 
ing muscular control. As we have stated elsewhere, great perfec- 
tion of coordination is not yet possible, but this is the time when 
practice must begin if special and unusual skill is ever to be attained. 
The inherited ability for bodily control develops slowly, but if the 
beginning of this ability, coming to the front at this time, is not 
stimulated by practice, valuable instincts and inherited possibilities 
are forever lost. 
The characteristic play of the period is vigorous and varied, with 
very little tendency to cooperation and team play. Ball games are 
more or less popular, but they are of the individual or scrub variety, 
like One Old Cat, Fungo, and Newcomb. 
Early Adolescence (12-15)—Junior High School 
Adolescence is the period of life when sex characteristics are 
developing and when the body in its growth gradually takes on the 
size and form that belong to men and women. Puberty is the name 
given to the time when adolescence begins. It is frequently, but not 
always, accompanied by rather sudden and radical changes in moods, 
interests, and habits of thought and conduct. 
During the three years from 12 to 15, the age of Junior high 
school, youth is still strongly individualistic, but the gang spirit is 
also developing, giving an interest in team games. The dominant 
interest in self that still prevails makes track and field sports and 
other activities in which the individual stands out prominently retain 
much of their former popularity. The beginnings of sex develop- 
ment and sex interests tend to separate the sexes, and as a conse- 
quence the play interests of boys and girls are wider apart at this
-P-A-G-E-259
  HOW AGE AND SEX INFLUENCE PLAY 251 
time than at any other age. Ideals of self-sacrifice and heroism ap- 
peal strongly, and there is unusual interest in Scouting, Camp Fire, 
and similar club activities. 
Later Adolescence (15-18)—Senior High School 
This is the period of the development of loyalty. Cooperation 
and team play become the dominant play motives; although interest 
in track and field sports, with interest in individual superiority is 
still a prominent factor, it is still further stimulated now by group 
competition, in which players win scores for their team as well as 
for themselves. The combined stimuli of team and self interest 
are so strong that there is danger of players overdoing under stress 
of championships contested before a crowd of partisan “‘rooters,” 
especially if directed by a coach who uses driving tactics. The 
danger here is in the direction of too long continued effort rather 
than too severe exertion; for example, football, with its supreme 
efforts of strength alternated with periods of rest, is not found to be 
nearly so productive of harm as long distance running and such 
games as basket ball, where the practice is apt to be both strenuous 
and long continued. High school boys are more liable to such acci- 
dental injuries as broken bones than more mature men, because the 
bones are not yet completely hardened, and yet accidents of this kind 
are not common unless young boys play football against those who 
are older and heavier. To avoid injury to the heart and nervous 
system from overdoing, games of the basket ball type should be 
played in quarters instead of halves and long distance running 
omitted from high school meets; football accidents should be pre- 
vented by providing players with suitable protective clothing and 
scheduling games only against teams of similar weight and maturity. 
High school girls have about the same tendency to strive for in- 
dividual superiority and to develop a spirit of loyalty and coopera- 
tion as high school boys. The charge that girls are slow to enjoy 
team play and to show sportsmanship has been greatly exaggerated. 
Girls are subject to the same dangers of injury as the boys, and they 
are even more liable to overdo and suffer injury under stress of 
competition before crowds. 
Maturity (18-40) 
These years, which include the time of college life, are the years 
of greatest physical efficiency and hardihood. Practically all the 
championships and athletic records are won here. The possibilities
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
of bodily development in strength, speed, skill, and endurance are 
so far beyond the attainments of the average man and woman that 
the exhibitions given by ball teams, acrobats, etc., attract the largest 
numbers of spectators that can be drawn together. The interest of 
communities in their own teams and champions adds to the popu- 
larity of athletic spectacles; while this cannot take the place of active 
play, it has its advantages because it stimulates the interest of the 
public in such forms of play, helps to finance play programmes, and 
aids in the long run to secure popular support for the right kind 
of play and the actual participation of the whole community in it. 
There is a marked tendency at this time of life, although the 
possibilities of development are so great, to forego all active recrea- 
tion and engage only in amusements of passive character. During 
college life and in business and professional life later, interest in 
study and in the various problems of the individual and the com- 
munity tend to keep people from engaging in any active recreation; 
weakness and loss of health and efficiency follow. The promotion of 
wholesome play, which should be required of college as well as of 
high school students, is the most promising preventive; those who 
become heartily absorbed in active sports in high school and college 
form a habit that will help to dispel the laziness that comes on with 
later life and to cause the individual to continue wholesome recrea- 
tions rather than to slump into those of the passive type. 
SEX DIFFERENCES 
There are sex differences in the play interests and habits of chil- 
dren, as everyone knows. Even at the time of birth there are differ- 
ences in the respective bodily developments; boys on the average 
being taller, heavier, and larger about the chest. Boys continue to 
be larger until the age period from twelve to fourteen when girls are 
the taller and heavier. Instincts too show certain divergencies. 
Girls give expression to the mother instincts and enjoy playing with 
dolls, and are also more apt to imitate the household activities. The 
instincts of boys on the other hand, lead them early to a more active 
type of expression, usually found in running, jumping, dodging, 
throwing, striking, wrestling, and fighting. Custom has also stepped 
in to accentuate the differences. Girls are curbed in vigorous parti- 
cipation by being required to help in the home, to wear clothes which 
handicap freedom of action, and to conduct themselves with a
-P-A-G-E-261
  HOW AGE AND SEX INFLUENCE PLAY 258) 
certain restraint and decorum. The same custom encourages the boy 
to find his play out-of-doors and to develop aggressive qualities. 
From the teaching standpoint these differences do not need to be 
taken into account up to the time of entering school. Until then, 
boys and girls are so nearly alike in ability and interest that they can 
easily be led to play and enjoy the same activities. 
Elementary School 
The exact time when the separation of boys and girls in their 
play should take place varies in different cases; some groups grow 
apart in their abilities and interests as much as two years earlier than 
others. The influence of the teacher has something to do with this. 
Some women teachers, who are experts in teaching rhythmic plays, 
are able to maintain the interests of the boys in folk dances and clog 
dances through the elementary grades and into Junior high school, 
while some men teachers are more successful than others in enlist- 
ing the interest of girls in track and field sports and ball play. It is 
wiser, however, to pay attention to the instinctive tendencies of the 
players than to expend too much effort in leading children away from 
their natural bent in these matters. 
Just before the end of the elementary school, at the age of eleven 
or twelve, some girls reach the age of puberty, at which time they 
begin to grow more rapidly than before. Since they reach this stage 
sooner than the boys, they for a time grow faster and excel the boys 
in height and weight and sometimes in strength and skill. In general, 
however, the girls are not so strong nor so skillful as the boys, but 
how much of this lack is natural and necessary and how much of it 
is due to the effect of social life and custom in making girls slacken 
in their practice of physical feats, is not yet known. As a matter 
of fact, in the fifth and sixth grades the boys usually excel the girls 
in strength and skill just enough to make competition between them 
on the same plane unsatisfactory. At about the same time the boys 
usually lose their interest in rhythmic play, while the girls have a 
growing liking for it. At some point, therefore, between the end of 
the third grade and the end of the sixth, separation of the sexes in 
their play seems advisable. 
Junior High School . 
At this time it seems best to separate the boys and girls in practi- 
cally all of their play. Their play interests are wider apart here 
than at any other age. The girls enjoy dancing especially, but also
-P-A-G-E-262
  254 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
retain an interest in the chasing games of the former period and like 
athletic contests and ball games; the boys play faster and rougher 
games and enjoy learning the athletic sports of the older boys and 
men. Scouting and Camp Fire troops are popular, but appeal in a 
somewhat different way to the two sexes. Boys like to play baseball 
with the regular hard ball; girls prefer the larger soft ball. Basket 
ball for girls must be modified, since they are not capable of so much 
continuous running as boys; volley ball also needs to be modified, for 
the ball was made to suit the needs of men and is too heavy for the 
slender hands of girls. Serious attention should be given to these 
matters, for between the ages of twelve and fifteen is the time when 
society is attracting the girl away from active play into passive and 
idle amusements. Girls who stop active play at this time show de- 
cided inferiority in strength, skill, and endurance in college, and if 
they ever resume active recreations they meet with a great deal of 
difficulty and must undergo persistent practice of light exercises be- 
fore vigorous work or play can be undertaken. 
Senior High School 
From the time of puberty onward, girls excel in dancing, while 
boys keep gaining in general athletic ability. It follows that with 
the exception of a few milder forms of activity, such as tennis, golf, 
and social dancing, the plays of the two sexes must be separate. 
Girls play basket ball, field hockey, tennis, and playground ball and 
engage in swimming, hiking, canoeing, and especially dancing; boys 
have a growing interest in athletic team games, such as soccer, foot- 
ball, baseball, basket ball, and volley ball. Even in golf and tennis 
there is rarely any direct competition between the boys and the girls, 
although they may play together for companionship. 
The tendency in some places to-day to have high school girls play 
basket ball by boys’ rules should be discouraged. This has usually 
come about by the employment of men coaches who, being familiar 
with the boys’ rules, naturally like them better; and not knowing the 
physical limitations of girls, attempt to train them as they do boys. 
This makes a faster game and pleases the spectators and players, 
but the latter often suffer bad after-effects. The greatest danger 
arises in the fact that girls trained in this way are often the ones 
who have never had a physical examination to discover whether 
they have defects that should keep them out of all vigorous play. 
All schools should conduct physical examinations for health pur- 
poses; if this is neglected it is particularly necessary that all boys and
-P-A-G-E-263
  
HOW AGE AND SEX INFLUENCE PLAY 255 
girls who are going into the strenuous athletic competition now com- 
mon in high school and college should have such an examination as 
a safeguard to keep them from playing when they are physically 
unfit. 
College and Maturity 
The play interests developed in the later high school period 
are usually carried over into college and maturity. After high 
school, however, men are more prone to keep up their active play 
than women, and the result is that men develop their strength cor- 
respondingly greater than women. Tests made at the Boston 
Normal School of Gymnastics and later at the Battle Creek Sani- 
tarium show that women on the average have about half the strength 
of men. Colleges usually afford the opportunity for vigorous 
physical training for girls, but this is rarely made attractive enough 
to secure their attendance and active participation. The average 
college girl is able to practice outdoor recreative sports with profit, 
but she usually neglects this chance for exercise and takes 
too little to give her the physical ability she needs for 
later life. Only the ‘occasional college woman is physically 
fit for vigorous competitive games, such as class games be- 
tween girls, to say nothing of intercollegiate competition before 
crowds. The time may come when women may safely engage in 
exercises of this nature, but it can only come about as the result of 
regular systematic practice of such vigorous games from the age of 
puberty on. 
The play activities of the two sexes are more similar in interest 
during maturity than at any time except early childhood. While it 
is true that both neglect their exercise too much, still the kind that 
they prefer is the outdoor recreation rather. than the strenuous 
competitive sport. For this reason, more emphasis should be placed 
on this type of sport during the school days, so that likings may be 
developed for it. Busy men and women, who must snatch their 
exercise when they may, and who are not in the physical condition 
necessary to take part in rugged competition with safety. and com- 
fort, must look to the milder recreations as their proper field of 
play. This does not mean that they must lose their interest and en- 
joyment in the more strenuous sports of their younger days, but they 
should be willing to enjoy them vicariously by watching the per- 
formances of younger players.
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Conclusion 
The interest of women in athletics is so recent that a great deal 
of their athletic programme is in the transitional and experimental 
stage. There is no doubt that they are developing an interest and 
delight in active plays akin to that of men. Careful study is needed 
to choose those games that appeal to women’s interests and best 
assist their structural development, instead of simply allowing them 
to ape men’s activities. The lessons learned from the history of 
boys’ competitive athletics should be applied; above all, the spec- 
tacular side should never be allowed to reach the point of exploita- 
tion it has with boys and men. 
The entrance of women into civic life calls for more training in 
cooperative team work than women have ever experienced. Team 
games are as good elementary training in this line as we are able to 
find to-day. The college should keep this goal in view in choosing 
the physical activities of girls. Neither formal gymnastics nor 
dancing can be compared with team games for developing ability 
to work with others. The games give continuous opportunity to use 
initiative, to meet an emergency in the best way, and to persist in 
effort after repeated failures. 
The girls start with a handicap in acquiring the team spirit. 
Throughout history, the loyalty of womankind has been bound up 
with the home, rather than of the group organization, such as the 
tribe or state. Girls are lacking in the sense of cooperation and 
loyalty which are prerequisities to strong team play. Girls as yet like 
the individualistic games of low organization, the efficiency tests, 
relay events, dancing, and outdoor recreational sports. None of 
these require either intense individual or team competition. The 
relays illustrate this point, the team element being present, but in 
only a slight degree. It will be noticed too, that their sports do not 
require physical contact as do the boxing, wrestling, and football 
plays of boys. The present-day tendency is for young women to 
enter with enthusiasm into the recreational type of outdoor sports, 
such as tennis, golf, swimming, canoeing, hiking, archery, skating, 
etc. This new athletic interest of women has produced a change, 
not only in a physical, but in a mental way; and the languid, de- 
pendent, Mid-Victorian type has been susperseded by the healthy, 
vigorous-spirited, and self-reliant woman of to-day.

  CHAPTER XIII 
ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 
To conduct play activities with large numbers and especially 
when time and space are limited, as they usually are, some form of 
organization is necessary to achieve the best results. The first step 
in such an organization is to decide upon what classes of activities 
are to be used; then a division of time must be given to each group 
of players and the activities assigned to each; following this, special 
methods of organizing competitive play must be outlined, taking into 
consideration the age of participants, the activities to be engaged in, 
and the numbers involved; and, in addition, special programmes 
must also be prepared for special occasions. 
Kinds of Activity 
The play activities of primary children are mainly imitative; as 
we pass up the grades they become more and more interested in the 
competitive element; at the age of Senior high school and college 
the play is largely competitive, especially with boys. An organized 
play programme should include the following activities : 
1. Simple imitation. ._This is a group of imitative plays per- 
formed in direct imitation of a leader, such as Follow the Leader, 
Ducks Fly, etc. 
2. Dramatic imitation, including story plays and mimetic 
exercises. 
3. Stories, Nature study, and Handicraft. 
4. Rhythmic plays, including song plays and the various kinds 
of dances. 5 
5. Gymnastic exercises, either in imitation of a leader or by 
command. A limited amount of this kind of exercise is a legitimate 
part of a play programme, but interest must be maintained at a high 
level. 
6. Free Play. Use of sand pile, swings, and other playground 
apparatus; individual play with balls and bats; climbing on ropes and 
ladders; tumbling on mats; various stunts. This does not mean un- 
258

directed play, for free play needs supervision to secure economic use 
of space and equipment and to prevent injury. Activities that have 
been learned in 1 and 5 are practiced here.

12. Team games. (Football, baseball, tennis, etc.) 
The lines on the chart, terminating in arrow heads, indicate the 
age periods when the different activities are most popular. When 
boys and girls play together, there is one line in the middle of the - 
floor; when they are separated in their play there are two lines. The 
chart shows incidentally that boys and girls are best separated above 
the elementary grades in gymnastics, free play,.and elementary 
games; above the primary grades for tests, contests, and team 
games. Boys above elementary grade do not as a rule care for 
rhythmic play nor girls for personal combat. Outdoor sports are 
more popular later in life than any other form of physical recreation, 
and for this reason the school and playground should promote this 
kind of play and make children familiar with the forms that are 
best suited to the climate and surroundings. 
The Play Programme for a School 
A director of play, in cooperation with the superintendent, 
principals, and teachers, should make a programme outlining the 
play activities of the school or system for the year. To provide for 
space without conflict and for regularity of exercise, the programme 
should specify the time for each grade; below the Senior high school 
the activities should be of different kinds on different days, making 
a weekly programme desirable: it should also provide for changes 
made necessary because of change of season and weather. The fol- 
lowing sample programmes illustrate the general plan to be followed:

The activities used with students in high school and college are 
more varied in themselves, the team games giving endless variety of 
problems and movements. This makes it less necessary to provide 
so definite a programme for each day, and a general programme for 
the year is usually made. The following will illustrate:

Programmes for Simmer Playgrounds 
Programmes are necessary to make the playground work inter- 
esting and efficient. The problem for schools is different than that 
of the summer playground system for the reason that attendance is 
compulsory in the first case and a certain group can be expected to 
be at the playground at a certain hour. The activities for the one 
hour can then be planned and can be duplicated with other classes 
from the same grade. The schools must plan schedules and special 
exhibitions also. This makes programmes of three types: general 
or seasonal, daily, and special. There is not so much difference be- 
tween the school organization and that of the summer playgrounds 
as far as the planning of the seasonal and special programmes is con- 
cerned; but the daily programme is entirely different, as the same 
children may spend their whole day on the playground during the 
summer months. A brief description will be given of the different 
kinds of programmes in so far as they relate to the summer play- 
grounds. 
General Programme. This outlines the work for the season as 
a whole; i.e., the activities that are to be included, the schedules for 
the home playgrounds, the later schedules between the different play- 
grounds, the beginning and end of the season, etc. In a sense it in- 
cludes the daily and special programmes. The general programme 
is equivalent to the school curriculum, except that it outlines a play 
curriculum instead. Like the school course of study it also is definite 
and on a set time schedule. It also takes into account the visits of 
the specializing teachers. For instance, story-telling at Playground 
A on Monday and Wednesday at 1:30 o’clock, and handicraft on 
Tuesday and Thursday at 4 o’clock would be a part of the general 
programme. 
In planning the seasonal programme certain things should be 
considered. For example, it would be unwise to start out the first 
week with a schedule of inter-playground games, before the teams 
are organized and have had time to practice. The first two weeks 
should be spent in organizing teams, and in building up attendance. 
A good idea is to run off some of the individualistic tournaments of 
minor importance; first on the home playgrounds, the winners com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 265 
peting later for the all-city championship. Suitable events for this 
purpose would be horseshoe pitching, croquet, beanbag target 
throw, handball, first trial for efficiency tests, etc. As soon as the 
teams have organized, the director should start the interplayground 
schedules, playing on a league basis, or, where the number of play- 
grounds is too large, on the combined league and elimination plan. 
He should carry the tournaments in the real popular sports, such as 
baseball and volley ball for boys, and newcomb ball for girls, along 
until the latter end of the season, providing a “home and home” 
series between the teams that are matched against each other. The 
schedules should all be finished in time so that the last week or so 
can be devoted to arranging for a final festival day to close the 
activities. 
It adds considerably to the interest to have something new 
planned for each week in addition to the continuous schedules. For 
instance, the third week a tennis tournament could be held; the fourth 
week, a track meet; the fifth week, a swimming meet; the sixth week, 
an elimination tournament in captain ball, dodge ball, long ball, and 
other minor games; the seventh week, an elimination basket ball 
tournament and hikes; the eighth week, an elimination soccer tourna- 
ment; etc. The combination of the tournaments lasting throughout 
the season and the special meets and shorter tournaments makes for 
a very successful plan of keeping up the interest. There is some- 
thing new all the time, which has the double effect of keeping the con- 
tinued tournaments from getting monotonous, and also of giving 
added incentives to the teams that do not have a chance to win out 
in the longer tournaments. If a trial in the efficiency tests precedes 
the track and field meet, the boys and girls will all be in good training 
to take part, and if the entries from each playground are limited, 
these can be determined by the records of the tests. A second trial 
at the efficiency tests should be allowed near the end of the season 
so that children who have failed may have a chance to practice and 
improve their ability in the things in which they are weak. The 
final festival day should not be held off until the last day of the 
season (a mistake often made) as there is no chance then for hold- 
ing it in case rain should halt the doings; besides, the last day is 
needed by the different directors to take inventory of the equipment, 
have it stored away, and make out records to be turned in to the 
general office. 
The Daily Programme. This is the most elastic programme of 
all. It is usually made out by the director of the particular play-
-P-A-G-E-274
    266 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
ground, since the particular needs may vary in different sections of 
the city. The daily programme is useful in letting the child who likes 
certain events know approximately at what time to come to partici- 
pate in them; it places the various activities at the most convenient 
hours for the players; and it provides story-telling, handicraft, and 
other play that is not vigorous for the heated hours of the day. 
Example: 1:30-2:00 Free for all play 
3:00-4:30 Team games. 
It can be seen that the events as scheduled in the daily programme 
do not need the leadership of the director or specialist as in the more 
rigid general events that have been explained. After making out the 
daily programme the director must be careful not to rob the play of 
its spontaneity. For instance, if an interesting recreative game is 
continuing past the hour assigned for this type of activity, it should 
not be abruptly broken off. : 
The planning of the daily programme should consider that early 
in the morning or afternoon, or likewise late, is a good time for 
individualistic play or scrub games, as the maximum attendance is not 
present. The more cooperative team games should be put at the 
time when all the players are most apt to be present, usually the 
middle of the morning or afternoon. The quiet activities should 
come at the hot part of the day. In the morning many younger 
children will be present; the older boys and girls may be attending 
summer school or assisting about the home. In the afternoon the 
older children will predominate and the director should give them 
the most personal attention; likewise in the evening, he should re- 
member that working boys and girls and adults should receive the 
first consideration. The director can get the activities of the one 
group under way and then leave to go to other groups to see that 
they are finding ways to’keep busy.

  268 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Special Programme. Besides the daily programme the play 
leader must make special programmes for picnics, celebrations, holi- 
day gatherings, etc. The picnic programme should contain some 
events in which all the people attending the picnic can participate, and 
these must not be too many nor too difficult nor vigorous; there 
should also be games or contests arranged that visitors may wit- 
ness. Play leaders should promote picnics and help the people in 
charge by furnishing amusements, lending equipment, etc. 
Play leaders should also provide suitable programmes for holi- 
day occasions, such as Fourth of July, Decoration Day, etc. Play 
festivals, pageants, and athletic meets may be devised that fit well 
into these occasions. By drawing on the talent in the neighborhood 
the play leader is able not only to make a success of such programmes 
but at the same time to make the acquaintance of influential citizens 
and get them interested in public recreation. Historical pageants 
may be given that call for the participation of hundreds and even 
thousands of people; and if properly organized, such spectacles 
attract large crowds of interested spectators and promote civic spirit. 
For such a pageant or a large play festival such as usually con- 
cludes the season’s play, a ground should be chosen that permits 
large numbers to see the activities. Care must be taken to provide 
places for the groups of participants, so that they may look on 
without obstructing the view of visitors. 
The events. coming under this description must be made out 
well ahead, and featured on the bulletin board, and in the news- 
papers. This allows the director to plan with definiteness, and also 
lets parents and children look forward with expectancy to a variety 
of interests. When the children know in advance about these 
occasions they can practice and be aroused to a climax of enthusiasm. 
A sample programme of exhibition nature follows, continued by 
practical instructions for planning and conducting such an occasion 
where large numbers of people of all ages will be present both as par- 
ticipants and spectators.

Suggestions for Running off a Mammoth Festival Day Programme 
1. Put the slow events of individualistic nature first, while the crowd is 
assembling. 
2. Put exhibition games and drills on next and run off together at same 
time to give an idea of extent and scope of play activities. Have all ages repre- 
sented. 
3. Put races at time of afternoon when crowd is fully assembled. The 
spectators always like races, which are exciting and can be run off one after 
the other without delay. 
4. Put the novelty events, which leave the crowd in good humor, at the 
end. These are not affected by the leaving of a part of the crowd and con- 
testants. 
5. End up with award of prizes won during the season. Such a ceremony 
adds to the importance with which the prize is considered. 
6. Advertise the occasion well. Use newspapers, bulletin boards, posters, 
and handbills. 
4. Let each playground be responsible for certain of the exhibitions, choos- 
ing the best teams and performers in all lines.
-P-A-G-E-279
  ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 271 
8. Have the fields marked off and roped to keep the spectators at a proper 
distance. Have a monitor to watch each of these. 
g. Have the distances for the races all marked out; the one course can 
be used with the shorter distances indicated. Use the same starting line and 
vary the finishing points. Also have the throwing circles marked, the jump 
pits spaded, and the take-off boards properly set. : 
10. Portion off the administration of events. Have a capable person re- 
sponsible for the running off of each event. 
11. Divide the field into different assembly places, so each playground will 
have a common meeting place to receive directions. 
12. Have two or more information bureaus. 
13. Have competent officials; especially the clerk of the course, starter, 
judges of finish, scorer, announcer, custodian of prizes, and sideline officials. 
14. Have all the equipment in readiness; whistles, starting guns, measuring 
tape, stop watches, megaphone, shot, basket balls, volley balls, playground balls 
and bats, yarn for finish line, rake, crossbars for jumps, officials’ badges, etc. 
‘15. Before starting an event, announce the one to follow. Repeat instruc- 
tions in different directions. 
16. Have the entries all known before hand. Limit the number of entries 
from each playground. Have the score sheets thumbtacked to stiff backboards. 
17. Have a time schedule. Run each event off as scheduled whether certain 
children are missing or not. Count promptness on points for award of cham- 
pionship playground trophy. 
18. Have a policeman on hand. 
19. Have photographers and press representatives on hand. 
20. Have some of the events elastic so that they can be skipped if falling 
behind time. 
21. Do not have long waits and hesitations as a crowd loses interest quickly. 
22. Have a physician on hand; also a first-aid outfit. 
23. Adapt your programme to the occasion; if a holiday, introduce appro- 
priate ceremonies; if a picnic, introduce many novelties; if for educational 
demonstration for parents, limit the novelty events, and give a wide scope of 
games and folk plays. 
24. If swimming pools are handy a few water events can be inserted into 
the programme. 
25. Have a meeting place of all the directors and officials. 
26. Rehearse each one’s part in putting through the programme. 
27. Do not leave anything to chance. 
Classification 
In order to divide boys and girls so that the competition is on a 
fair basis, also to give a chance for more participants to take part, 
some form of classification is necessary. 
Boys. There are many forms of grouping players. The 
method chosen will often depend on the particular situation; it may 
be by the grade in school, or by age, height, weight, or by a combina- 
tion such as age and height, age and weight, or weight and height.
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
For most purposes the weight classification is the most practical, as 
doubtful cases of eligibility need only to be taken to the scales. It is 
the most fair single standard, too, as boys who are tall for their age 
are usually slender, and so their weight will not be more than the 
shorter boy who has filled out and become more developed. Height 
alone is the least satisfactory of all methods. The biggest objection 
to the age method is the difficulty of proving doubtful cases quickly, 
unless there are records such as at the school. Where the age can 
be determined correctly, a very satisfactory arrangement is the age 
and weight combination, probably the most practical of the schemes 
yet devised. 
The age classification usually makes the dividing point between 
Juniors and Seniors at 16 years. Some cities use 14 years. Others 
make a larger number of divisions, such as 12, 14, and 16 years. 
The height method most often uses 5 feet to divide the Juniors 
and Seniors. Another method adds another dividing mark at 4 feet 
6 inches. If many older boys are competing a higher division should 
be added, such as 5 feet 4 inches. 
An example of an age and height method is as follows: 
Age Height 
Midgets. ... under 12 Less than 4 feet 6 inches 
qauors +s... : Se Less than 5 feet 
Intermediates “ 16 Less than 5 feet 4 inches 
Seniors..... over 16 Any height 
A very good weight classification follows. As explained pre- 
viously this is the most practical and fair method where large 
numbers of children are concerned. Some of the following divisions 
can be omitted in case the group is a small one; for instance, 
two groups, Juniors and Seniors, could be used with the dividing 
point at 115 lbs.

Lightweight Seniors............+..++. - 135; 
Heavyweight Seniors. ..c.. 2.244. «ode Unlimited. s 
The previous weight groups can be combined with age very 
easily. Use 16 years as the dividing point as regards age. One 
to be classed as a Junior would have to be under 115 lbs. and under 
16 years of age as well. 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
    
ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 273 
In 1920 the American Physical Education Association appointed 
several committees to make a«study of efficiency tests. ‘The com- 
mittee for Elementary Schools approved the Age, Grade, Height, 
and Weight Classification, as devised by Frederick J. Reilly. Their 
reason for this choice and the explanation of the classifications fol- 
low: 
Age presumes a certain degree of physical development. 
Grade should be considered because a higher grade presupposes longer train- 
ing and should be handicapped accordingly. On the other hand, a young boy 
in a high grade should not be unduly handicapped because he has brains. His 
youth should discount the handicap of grade. 
Height and Weight should be taken together as the best available index 
of physical development.

Sum of Exponents 24 “Class B” (see Class) 
N. B. Since the sum of the four exponents equals 24, the boy is placed in Class 
B, which includes all individuals whose exponents total 22 to 25. There are 
five divisions into which a boy may be placed. 
Girls. Asa rule fewer groupings are needed in the case of girls, 
because their interest in competitive games is less marked and there 
are not as many to handle. One method is to group by age, Junior 
and Senior, with the dividing mark at 12 years. Again, the weight 
plan is used with the dividing point at 95 pounds 
The most scientific plan for girls is the Age, Grade, Height, 
and Weight classification explained in the preceding section. It will 
be noticed that this classification system applies to girls, as well as  
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
boys. The committee explains this by stating that girls, at the 
period of development occurring between the fifth and eighth years of 
school, mature earlier than boys, and therefore average practically 
the same as the boys in height and weight. 
Prizes 
Prizes are very necessary to keep up the interest. It should be 
noted, however, that inexpensive awards should be given. Many 
prizes are made so costly that the true spirit of amateur play is lost 
in the competition for them. The playgrounds cannot justify their 
use of public money when it is spent in expensive trophies. Generally, 
ribbons are very useful for the tournaments and meets held on the 
home playground. It is well to have the name of the park and of 
the event printed on the ribbon. Gold colored lettering can be used 
and first, second, and third places can be distinguished by using red, 
white, and blue ribbons. In the championship games between the 
different playgrounds and in intraplayground meets, the winners 
may be given celluloid lapel buttons with the design of the sport upon 
them. Special medals may be given at the end of the season to the 
boys and girls who have shown the best all-around athletic efficiency, 
sportsmanship, and reliability. Prizes have a very worthy place on 
the playground, and it is in keeping with every other activity of life 
that ability and service should receive recognition, but it is absolutely 
necessary that the prize stand as a symbol of some accomplishment, 
rather than as a thing desired for its monetary worth or anything 
else apart from its intended significance. The Boy Scout insignia 
and merit badge emblems represent the type of prize which is 
honored and yet which has its intrinsic value in an inner appreciation 
rather than in any other value apart from this. 
Whenever it is possible to find a permanent place to put a prize 
where it can be appreciated by the team members in common, it is 
well to award a cup or pennant, or other form of team trophy; and 
this is less objectionable than when the individuals are given separate 
awards. The team award is possible where the cup can be displayed 
in a schoolroom, field house, or the assembly hall of a boys’ or girls’ 
club. The separate awards may also be given if they are of inex- 
pensive nature. 
Younger boys and girls like the ribbons very much and strive 
to make a collection of them representing as many sports as possible. 
This liking is gradually supplanted by a preference for a lapel button,
-P-A-G-E-283
  
ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 275 
then in turn a medal or charm. Girls first like the ribbons; and, as 
they get older, prefer a pin that can be worn. 
Group Athletics ’ 
This is a new method of testing the group as a whole, on its 
average ability, rather than on a championship system determined 
by the best individuals. The records of the boys of one class are 
added together and divided by the number of boys. In jumping and 
throwing events, the highest average would win; but in the case of 
running events, the lowest average wins. The general provision is 
made that 80 per cent (can be made less) of the whole class must 
participate in order that its record may count. An example of this 
scheme is shown by the following illustration when three 7th grades 
have their total records or averages matched against each other. 
Name of Event School 1 School 2 School 3 Winner 
Not of “Boys. .00 5. 30 25 20

Standing Broad Jump 174 feet 150 feet 110 feet 
5.8 av. 6 av. 5.5 av. School 2 
Likewise, the average of all the 7th grades of the city can be 
matched against the 7th grades of other cities. 
This work can be carried on during recess or after school. The 
tests are taken by each teacher or playground director and reports 
made to the supervisor. The school or playground showing the best 
record is later tested officially. A banner or permanent trophy is 
given for supremacy in each event and a large banner for the best 
average in all events combined. 
Any of the events found in the efficiency tests can be used. In 
large cities, the grades can be subdivided into 7-1'and 7-2 if so de- 
sired. On the playgrounds good groupings can be made by the 
weight plan; for instance, have the juniors compete against the 
juniors of other playgrounds, etc. Count the standings on the final 
efficiency award made at the end of the season. i
-P-A-G-E-284
  
276 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Organizing Competition 
With older players there is less need of leading and teaching and 
more need of organizing the play, so as to utilize all the time and 
space, avoid conflicts, and in many ways promote interest and satis- 
faction in the competition. There are four main kinds of organiza- 
tion used here: (1) the Olympic festival plan, devised by the ancient 
Greeks for awarding championships in the simple track, field, and 
aquatic events; (2) the tournament or elimination method, which 
was worked out first for lawn tennis and now used extensively also 
for basket ball and volley ball; (3) the percentage plan or “round 
- robin,” first used in baseball; and finally (4) the point systems. 
The Olympic Festival Plan 
This plan is commonly spoken of as a ‘‘meet,” and occupies from 
one to five hours. The first thing to arrange is the programme of 
events, which must be announced to the contestants in time to allow 
them practice. 
Track and Field: In this kind of meet the events should be run 
off in two parallel lists, and the most usual order is as follows: 
Sample Programme of Track and Field Meet 
Track Events P.M. P.M. 
  1. 120-yd. high hurdles, trials 2:00 11. 2-mile run.............. 4:2

  As soon as it is known how many entries there are, the time 
required for each event should be considered and extra places for 
some of the slow events, like the jump and the pole vault, provided 
if found necessary. All the places needed for the events should be 
carefully prepared and all the distances on the track marked in a
-P-A-G-E-285
  
ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 277 
fairly permanent way, including places for the hurdles for both 
races. 
The regular staff of officials for a track and field meet is as 
follows: 
1 referee 3 judges for field events 
1 starter 1 official scorer 
1 clerk of the course I announcer 
3 judges of track events 1 marshal. 
3 timers 
The national collegiate rules recommend for large meets, in 
addition to the above, 4 inspectors to assist the referee, 5 assistant 
clerks, assistants for the announcer and marshal, a surveyor and a 
physician; in any case where a duplication of places is found neces- 
sary in any events, a similar duplication of judges is also necessary. 
Details of this kind are very important in a very large meet, such as 
the Detroit school meet, where there are several thousand 
contestants. Fs 
To run off a meet promptly much depends on having capable and 
aggressive men for clerk of the course and announcer. The clerk of 
the course must have a complete list of all the contestants and must 
be responsible for notifying all of them in time for them to appear 
when their events come off. The announcer must inform the players 
and spectators promptly what event is to be next, and also the results 
of the one just finished. The referee decides all disputed points as 
to the conduct of the meet and may disqualify a contestant for viola- 
tion of rules or for ungentlemanly conduct. The marshal must be 
strict in seeing that players or groups of spectators do not crowd the 
contestants nor hide the contests from the people in the stands. The 
duties of other officials are indicated in a general way by their titles. 
Arrangement should be made beforehand for a group of men 
who will put the hurdles in place and remove them again promptly; 
otherwise the whole meet is needlessly delayed. 
When there are more runners to compete than can be handled 
at once on the track, they are divided into groups; the groups run 
and the best from these run in the final event. These preliminary 
trials are called heats or qualifying rounds; except in the shortest 
dashes, the finals should not come immediately after the qualifying 
contests. ® 
Swimming and Diving. Aquatic events are more easily handled, 
because the list of events is shorter; moreover the meet, which is
-P-A-G-E-286
    278 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
limited to one pool, necessitates conducting but one event at a time 
with fewer contestants in each. 
The swimming Guide of the National Collegiate Athletic Asso- 
ciation recommends the following programme for swimming meets: 
1. Relay, 4 men, each to go 2 lengths 5. 220-yard Swim 
of pool 6. Plunge for Distance 
2. Fancy Diving 7. Back Stroke 
3. Short Dash, free style 8. 100 Yards. 
4. Breast Stroke 
In awarding honors in fancy diving the rules provide that there 
shall be three judges who shall mark each diver independently, and 
the ratings of the three shall be combined to give the final decision. 
The manner of marking and combining the results has been worked 
out very carefully and is given below in full, partly because it is a 
method that may well be employed in awarding honors in all events 
where the quality and difficulty of the work must be judged, as in 
club swinging, heavy apparatus work, dancing, and all kinds of 
stunts. 
Dives are classified as required and. voluntary. The required 
dives are 1 
(1) running front, plain or swallow 
(2) back dive 
(3) running forward jack-knife 
(4) back jack-knife 
The rule book lists 23 optional dives, all of which are very 
difficult, and the list gives the value of each in points; for example, 
the backward 1%4 somersault is valued at 2.2 and the handstand 
dive at 1.2. A similar rating of exercises on heavy apparatus has 
also been worked out. (See Mind and Body for Dec., 1921.) 
The committee in charge of the meet should provide each judge 
of diving with score sheets, with the names of the contestants at the 
top and the required dives indicated, similar to the following:

The Tournament or Elimination Method 
In tennis, basket ball, volley ball, and similar games, where a 
quick elimination is desired, a tournament is conducted. The teams 
or men draw places by selecting one from a group of cards having 
the letters of the alphabet on the reverse side. The letter drawn 
determines the order of play, as shown by the following: 
pad SCHEDULE OF TOURNAMENT

Game 4, Court 4 Won by H

June 11,10 A.M. = 
As soon as the teams have drawn, their names are written in the 
schedule before the letters, and as fast as the games are finished the 
names of winners and the scores are inserted. The total number of 
games is always one less than the total number of contesting teams. 
Such a tournament is simple to arrange when there are four, eight, 
or sixteen contestants or any perfect power of two; and the number 
of rounds is always the number of times two appears as a factor in 
that number: as, 3 rounds for 8 players, 4 rounds for 16, 5 rounds 
for 32, etc. 
When the number of entries is not a perfect power of two, a 
plan is used that reduces the number to a perfect power of two for 
the second round. It is called the ‘‘system of byes,” and is given in 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 281 
detail in the tennis guides. To find the number of byes, subtract the 
number of teams that enter from the next perfect power of two 
above; for example, if there are 39 teams to play,.the next perfect 
power of 2 is 64, and 64-39 leaves 25. his is the number of byes, 
which means the number of players not playing in the first round. 
The byes are as equally apportioned as possible at the top and bottom 
of the list, so that in this case the teams drawing the first 12 and the 
last letters or numbers will be said to draw byes, and will not play 
in the first round. These 25. players, together with the 7 winners 
of the first round, make 32, a perfect power of 2 for the second 
round. There will be 6 rounds and 38 games in all. This plan will 
determine the number of byes for any number of players and makes 
the tournament method easy to apply in any case.

  282 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The main objection to the tournament plan is that it eliminates 
half the players or teams in the first game or match. This results 
in a certain degree of unfairness, for the second best team may be 
defeated in the first round by the best team and as a consequence has 
but the one chance to play when justly entitled to second place. The 
answer to this objection is that if we are to determine a champion- 
ship by so short a series of games we must expect to sacrifice fairness 
to a certain extent; the main object is after all to promote interest 
and competition rather than to pick champions. As a partial remedy 
the losers in the first round are frequently scheduled for a so-called 
‘consolation series.” All who lose in their first games are bracketed 
together just as the winners are. In the first schedule given above 
Teams A, D, E, and G would be listed for the consolation series in 
the order already fixed by the drawing, A playing D, and E playing 
G. A consolation series for the tournament with 39 teams would in- 
clude the losers in the first 19 games and also the loser of game 23 if 
A is the one to lose. 
A more complete plan for a consolation series for 8 teams would 
be as follows: the two winners in the consolation round just men- 
tioned are bracketed with C and H, losers of the second round of 
the regular series, and the winner of this consolation plays the loser 
of the regular final round for second place. Such a plan might be 
worked out for 16 teams, but where the number of teams is not a 
perfect power of two the problem is more complicated and the solu- 
tion less satisfactory. 
To stimulate competition between the members of a tennis club 
or between basket ball teams in the same city, a plan known as a 
“perpetual tournament” can be used. First, a list of the players or 
teams is made in order of ability, the best one first, and this is posted 
in a central place; it is provided that any player may challenge either 
of the three listed next above him, and must accept a challenge from 
either of the three next below him. The plan is an especially good 
one for picking a representative team for outside competition. 
The Percentage Plan 
The Olympic festival plan is best where a championship is to 
be settled in an afternoon or within two days; where it will take from 
three days to a week, as in tennis and basket ball championships, the 
tournament plan is best; to keep up the interest in competition for 
a longer period, such as a whole season, the percentage plan or ‘‘round 
robin” is better. Here each team plays every other team to complete
-P-A-G-E-291
  ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 283 
one round; it is most satisfactory to play at least two rounds, which 
makes it possible to play each opponent once on the home grounds 
and once on the opponent’s. The round robin is fairer than the 
other plans, giving all an equal chance to win. The percentage of 
each team is found by dividing the number of games won by the 
total number played, expressing the result decimally to three places 
of figures. 
The total number of games in one round robin is m (n-1)--2, n 
representing the total number of teams. This is easily seen, for any 
one team must play each of the others, of whom there are n-1; we 
multiply this by the total number, for each team must do the same; 
we divide by 2 because in figuring as we have done we would count 
each team twice. 
The most difficult problem in arranging a round robin is to 
schedule the games so as to have each team play regularly and not 
require any team to play two games or more in one day, especially 
against different opponents, some of which play only once. A “‘cut- 
and-try” method can be used with a small number of teams, but with 
seven or more in the league this is not easy. One of the best ways to 
do it is to arrange the letters or numbers representing the teams on 
the two sides of a square, as in the following diagram. 
Each small square of the diagram, excepting the diagonal row 
(crossed out), represents a game between two teams. One-half of 
the large square holds just enough small squares to form one round 
of play, and the numbers in the squares are the days of play in their 
order. The actual dates may be put in place of these numbers.

The two plans above use just as many days as there are teams, 
seven days for seven teams and eight days for eight teams. To 
make out such a plan for any number of teams, first make the two 
lines of letters to represent the teams and draw the lines forming 
the small squares. Then starting in the top row, indicate the days in
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
regular order for A to play all the other teams: 1, 2, 3, etc. There 
will, of course, be n-1 of these games, one game each day. Since A 
plays C on the second day, B cannot play C until the third day, so the 
line of days for B begins with 3 and goes on up to the end of the 
line. To continue, begin each row with the number next larger than 
the one just above it in the chart, run up the series of numbers until 
reaching the number of teams, and then begin at 1 and go on to the 
end of the row. 
This rule will work to make a schedule for any number of 
teams. There is one objection to it: with an even number of teams 
it takes one too many days, for one can see in the plan for eight 
teams that while there may be four games each day, and must be 
four to keep all the teams busy, there are only three games on the 
fourth, sixth, and eighth days. With an odd number of teams one 
team must be idle each day, but with an even number all may as 
’ well play, and only n-1 days are needed. 
To shorten the schedule for an even number of teams by one 
day and thus keep every team playing every day, a slight modifica- 
tion of the rule must be made. Start as before; the row for A will 
be the same as above, but at the end of the row for B, in place of 
the last number, which is the unnecessary day, write 2. Now notice 
that 2 is the number just above the first number in row B, and use 
this rule for all the rows below the first: follow the same plan 
exactly that we have used for odd numbers of teams, but in the last 
column always place the number just above the first number in the 
row. The two schedules following will show how to do this: 
Eight teams in seven days Ten teams in nine days

    ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES 285 
Combined Plans 
When there are too many teams to make a round robin feasible, 
it is often possible to devise a combination of the tournament and 
round robin plans that will be much better. For example, the Detroit 
schools on one occasion had 83 soccer teams, for which a plan of 
competition had to be worked out. A tournament would eliminate 
half of them in the first round, and that is not desirable. A round 
robin would require each team to play 82 games in the first round, 
which of course is out of the question. Dividing the 83 teams into 
14 leagues of about 6 teams each or 12 leagues of 7 teams each, each 
league has time to play one round robin and the leaders can then 
play a tournament. The leagues can be formed of teams within con- 
venient distances. Such an organization into leagues, with games 
scheduled regularly and the schedules posted in each school, helps 
maintain the interest, even if some teams drop out; the director will 
of course try to keep them all in to the end. 
Scoring Plan for All Year Round Group Athletic Efficiency 
The all year round group scoring plan has become very popular 
with Intramural systems of colleges and universities. The idea, how- 
ever, is very adaptable and can be used just as easily in the Public 
School Athletic Leagues. The purpose is to stimulate competition 
where attendance is voluntary. Organizations are given a certain 
number of points for organizing a team in each sport. Additional 
points are then given to a team according to its respective showing in 
each sport. These points are totaled, and the organization standing 
highest at the end of the year is given a large trophy for “All-Around 
Efficiency in Athletic Sports.’” No change whatsoever is needed from 
the regular programme, as each sport can be carried on as usual with 
a smaller cup awarded to the winner. 
The first advantage of such a scheme is that the different organi- 
zations will make entries for each sport, regardless of ability in it, 
in order to get the points that are given for organizing a team. If 
they are to contend for the final cup they must take advantage of 
every point it is possible to acquire. Even if there is no chance to 
win the big cup, there is interest in having a high standing on the 
athletic chart. Another advantage is the added interest in minor 
sports, which helps keep all the athletic facilities in use instead of 
just the more popular ones. Then, again, such a rating scheme offers 
a chance to include other factors than the winning of games. These 
are for organizing teams (already mentioned), scholarship, sports-
-P-A-G-E-294
286 © THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
manship (both players and spectators living up to spirit of rules 
and showing courtesy to opponents), and reliability (being on time, 
playing the schedule without forfeiting games, following instructions 
for classifying and certifying players, etc.). The last two factors 
have been emphasized in the Playground leagues of Chicago and the 
Public School Athletic Leagues of Detroit, but in a different way; 
they are used to count in the final result of each game that is played. 
On the whole, the scoring of these things is more or less in the ex- 
perimental stage, owing to the fact that there is conflicting opinion 
concerning the proposition. Some authorities think that the rules 
of the game provide sufficient penalties for infractions. There is 
much less opposition, however, to including an item like sportsman- 
ship in an all year round plan than to let it decide the winning of an 
individual game. 
In the working out of the all year plan, the sports must be 
classified according to the relative amount of interest in them, and 
also on the basis of the amount of effort required to organize, train, 
and perfect a team in strategy. A division of major and minor can 
be made; and if desired, an intermediate division can be included. 
Such sports as soccer, basket ball, baseball, and track would be in- 
cluded in the major divisions; swimming, tennis, hockey, bowling, 
wrestling, and volley ball, in the intermediate; and handball, horse- 
shoe pitching, and others, inthe minor. Then the points can be 
adjusted for each division; for instance, 150 (50 for entrance plus 
100 for winning) for major, 100 (35 + 65) for intermediate, and 
75 (25 +50) for minor. 
The simplest way to determine the respective order of the differ- 
ent teams is to separate all by the same number of points. Thus in 
baseball, a major sport, with five teams competing, the order would 
be 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150; with six teams, it would be 50, 70, 
g0, 110, 130, and 150. Another method is frequently used. This 
is to give a certain number of points for each game that is won. 
Then the relative value of each game would be the number of points 
given for winning (in baseball 100) divided by the number of 
games that the champion team won. If the champion team won 5 
games, then the value of each game would be 20 points, and the 
other teams could be rated accordingly. In the case of a track or 
swimming meet, the number of points accumulated by the champion 
team can serve as the standard instead of the number of games won 
by the baseball champion and the value of each point won in the meet 
can then be judged in the same manner.
-P-A-G-E-295
  ORGANIZATION OF PLAY ACTIVITIES ~ 287 
Scoring Plan for All Year Round Individual Athletic Efficiency 
The plan suggested for group scoring can be followed. As a 
member of a team the individual would receive points for participa- 
tion; also, additional points corresponding to the final standing of 
his team. Men competing in meets, where individual scoring can 
be determined, would be credited by comparison with the individual 
making the highest individual score. Sportsmanship and reliability 
are factors that can easily be included. 
Another plan considerably different than the one just described, 
and which has very interesting features, is the one charted below. 
It is used on the Ann Arbor, Michigan, playgrounds. Boys and 
girls are given ribbons if they win in any particular sport, but they 
are also given points for all-around efficiency. At the end of the 
season a special honor is given to each of the highest point gatherers. 
The points are awarded as follows: A member of the champion- 
ship baseball team gets ro points; of second team, 6 points; of third 
team, 4 points; and thereafter 2 points for participation. In the 
case of interplayground meets like swimming or track, a boy winning 
a first place would be awarded 10 points; and similarly on down to 
the 2 points given for taking part. The minor sports, except for 
giving only one half as many points, are graded in the same manner.

II. Factors in Efficient “School Athletics’ 
A high type of coach. 
An energetic faculty manager. 
An enclosed athletic ground, conveniently located. 
A modern gymnasium with good seating capacity. 
A team which includes good material, well coached and winning its 
proper share of games. 
. A proper schedule. 
a. Do not meet important rivals at first. Try to grade the earlier games 
in increasing difficulty. 
b. Do not have too many hard games in succession. 
c. Do not schedule inferior teams that are situated in towns at too great 
a distance. 
d. Have a climax. If possible save the game with your most important 
rival as a close to the season. 
e. Avoid an anti-climax. If the big game comes late in the season, do 
not follow it with a game of inferior importance. 
Organize a strong Athletic Association in the School. 
a. Draw up a constitution. 
b. Elect student officers: a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treas- 
urer, and two representatives for the Board of Control. Have 
pictures of the officers in the School Annual. 
c. Collect dues. 
d. Make membership of annual tenure. 
e. Give the members privileges; ie, a membership button, free admis- 
sion to the first game of the year, first choice on reserved seat games, 
mention in an athletic honor list in the school annual, a chance to 
vote on the election of officers, a chance to attend the athletic ban- 
quet and dance following the close of the season. 
. Have a Board of Control composed of three faculty members and two 
students. The faculty should always have final control over school 
athletics. The faculty manager should be a member, and whenever 
possible the principal. The student members should be seniors repre- 
senting the Athletic Association. 
Sell season tickets at special rates to the students, residents, and business 
men. 
Do not try to enforce an athletic blanket tax in public schools. 
Give every student a special rate for each game separately if bought 
within a restricted time limit.

Stimulate interest in selling, and allow poorer students a chance to 
obtain season tickets, by granting a free ticket to anyone selling a certain 
number. Likewise free admission to separate games might be given 
for selling tickets for the respective games. 
Buy and handle equipment economically and businesslike. 
a. Buy good grade material. 
b. Have cards bearing printed list of equipment, check the articles given 
out, and have each individual sign his card. 
c. Have a competent custodian of property. 
Build for the future. Have a second team equipped, coached, and given 
a schedule of games. Give the second team men free admission to all 
games in their respective sport. Organize intramural teams among the 
classes and any other possible units for rivalry. 
Belong to a league of schools if there is one in your district. Such an 
association makes for stronger rivalry, and in the long run, for cleaner 
sport. 
Arrange numeral awards by size, according to the importance of the 
sport. Eight inches is a good maximum size; five inches, a minimum. 
Give the second team an R (Reserves). Some schools give class 
numerals instead. Award all numerals at a public occasion such as a 
mass meeting or Letter Day. 
Get the confidence of the parents. Have them realize that the welfare 
of the boys taking part is being considered first of all. Have all candi- 
dates take a physical examination. 
a. Do not make the practice periods too long—a common fault which 
results in overtraining for high school boys. 
b. Insist on the boys returning with the coach when away on trips. 
Only permit individual stay-overs when parents have given written 
permission. 
c. If possible get a physician to volunteer his services for the season. 
Often a young graduate will help in order to extend his acquaintance- 
ship and get a start towards building up a practice. 
Keep the sympathy of the teachers. Do not ask special favors for the 
athletes. Do not let athletics get magnified out of its proper place in 
school life. Build the teams up from the bona fide students instead of 
wasting efforts on transients who come to school for athletics only. 
Have a student manager for each sport. Make the managers serve an 
apprenticeship before awarding them the job. Do not let the manager 
be elected by popular vote as politics will determine the appointment in 
that case. Let the appointment be made by a body consisting of the 
present manager, captain, the captain-elect, the coach, and the faculty 
manager. Give the manager the school letter, reversing the color scheme 
whenever possible, as red on white in case the players receive white on 
red. Some schools simply give a different style letter. Let the manager 
get as much prominence as possible along policies planned by the Board 
of Control. Let him meet visiting teams and arrange for their stay. 
Arrange pleasant quarters for the team when on trips. Have pre- 
arranged meals whenever possible, but in other cases set a maximum 
price that will be allowed. Pay the expenses for the team as a whole;  
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
do not start the bad practice of giving each boy money to pay his own 
expenses. Some of the boys will try to avoid paying carfare or to 
economize on their meals to gain some spending money. 
21. Have a cheer-leader elected by the Athletic Association and given a 
distinctive uniform in the school colors. - He should appoint assistants 
from which the next leader will be chosen. 
22. Have a mass meeting at the beginning of the season and before the 
most important games. ‘The principal must arrange the time. Get 
alumni and enthusiastic business men to attend. 
23. Raise money through association dues, season tickets, receipts for games, 
and entertainments and bazaars, 
24. A reel ticket at the grounds saves much time, and is an aid in checking. 
25. Have the faculty managers and coach control the newspaper publicity. 
Students always give biased and exaggerated, views. 
26. Try to get as much faculty support as possible. Get faculty members to 
take tickets at the games and assist in other ways.

A CHAPTER XIV 
THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 
The kind of physical condition that men have always desired 
and prayed for may best be described as joyous abounding health. 
There is included in this idea completeness and soundness of body, 
which means the absence of disease and infection, and the normal 
functioning of every organ, power, and faculty. 
As long as such a condition exists, life is apt to be successful and 
enjoyable, and well worth living. The individual with an abundance 
of vigorous health has a decided advantage in everyday life. ( With 
organic power that is a barrier against disease, he can also meet the 
emergencies of life. No person may hope to escape being called 
upon to go beyond the limits of endurance. The army physicians 
and nurses who in the midst of war time found themselves con- 
fronted with an awful epidemic of influenza serve as an example, for 
the extra burden was one that only those with reserve power could 
carry. 
Health is one of the problems that has forced itself upon the 
attention of the nation and each separate community and family in 
recent years. ‘The health of the community depends on the health 
of the individuals, and for this reason great educational campaigns 
have been undertaken to instruct every one in personal and public 
hygiene. Stress ‘has been laid on the preventive side, that is, to build 
up the body to increase its vital resistance, and to establish whole- 
some conditions of environment. We have seen the schools increas- 
ing the time for physical training, introducing new types of activities, 
examining the pupils to discover defects that might lead to serious 
results later, and prescribing remedial measures in cases where im- 
provement is possible. The schools and communities are on the 
watch for epidemics, and any case of contagious disease is promptly 
isolated as soon as discovered, and the source of the trouble is 
located and stamped out. This source may be in the water, milk, or 
food supply; it may be from impure air; or it may be from crowded 
housing conditions. To-day, each of these angles is being studied so 
292
-P-A-G-E-301
  THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 293 
successfully by experts that in many ways the city is a healthier place 
to live in than the country. The health of the community is looked 
upon as an economic problem, as industry is interested financially in 
the working power of each individual citizen. ' 
PLAY ESSENTIAL TO HEALTH 
Play is one of the most i. for the development 
f each individual to perfect health) Heredity must do its part 
as a foundation; food, air, and sunlight are necessary; preventive 
hygiene must be practiced to keep off disease and remove defects: 
yet, after all this is said and done, it is always activity that stimulates 
and guides growth and development. ‘the one who can do things 
is always the one who has done things») One of the most serious 
results of a broken leg or a prolonged illness is the weakness and lack 
of ability that results from the enforced idleness, which compels the 
patient to build up his lost strength, skill, and endurance very slowly © 
and painfully and to learn over again most of the physical’acts that 
were so well known before, even to balancing himself on his feet, 
walking, running, and throwing. Nothing but practice can ‘perfect 
one’s proficiency i in any art; and when this skill has been acquired, 
nothing but continuous and endless practice can maintain it and keep a 
person in the physical condition that underlies it and makes it ossibleh, 
Measles and mumps and the other diseases of childhood must be 
avoided if possible, not only because they endanger life and may 
cause permanent injury to some vital organ, but because they bring 
about days and perhaps weeks of complete inactivity, and thus post- 
pone and seriously interfere with normal growth and development. 
To a smaller extent, school, with its hours of enforced quiet, has the 
same disadvantage; and this explains why children usually grow in 
height and weight more rapidly in summer, when they are free to 
play out of doors during most of their waking hours. Child labor 
is prohibited in many states because the work is of the confining type 
and does not allow normal activity. 
Play is Natural Activity 
One of the chief reasons why the spontaneous plays of child- 
hood and the games and sports of youth are the best possible 
activities for developing an ideal physical condition is that they in- 
volve chiefly those fundamental movements of the body that are 
natural to the race and are therefore performed easily and joyfully, 
while demanding little of the player in the way of sustained attention.
-P-A-G-E-302

  ' 
294 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
They are progressive, using the instinctive movements in their in- 
herited order, and building them up into complex acts, such as walk- 
ing, running, jumping, throwing, and climbing, just as fast as the 
growth of the nervous system prepares the way. It is one of the 
main faults of child labor and the so-called scientific gymnastics that 
they violate this natural order of progress, compelling the learning 
of elements of skill before nature has properly prepared the way and 
enforcing a monotonous repetition when nature demands a variety 
of activities. 
Pleasure is Healthful 
The fact that play is enjoyed is one of the main reasons why it is 
conducive to health. This applies to all kinds of activity and to all 
ages; a man’s regular occupation, a hobby that he takes seriously and 
employs all his leisure time upon, or an hour of frivolous amusement, 
will, if sufficiently enjoyed, aid in promoting health just as well. as 
the spontaneous play of childhood or the sports and games of youth. 
We see the effect of enjoyment at a banquet or a Christmas dinner, 
when, surrounded by fun and jollity, one is able to eat and digest 
without harm an amount and kind of food that would upset him for 
days if eaten while his mind were concerned with the usual cares of 
lifge 
‘Pleasurable activity has a buoyant and stimulating effect upon 
fr nervous system, and this reacts in a beneficial way on the whole 
dy. ) The influence is especially noticeable in case of the digestive 
glands. Certain feelings, in particular those related to the enjoy- 
ment of food, make the ‘‘mouth water’ and stimulate the secretion 
of the juices of the stomach, and thus aid in digestion. Since the 
nervous system controls the chemical activity of the tissues, the reason 
for the profound effect of pleasurable emotion on the whole body is 
readily seen, and the close interrelation between health and happi- 
ness is accounted for. 
PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS 
We hear a lot nowadays about national preparedness in the way 
of large fleets and armies, large reserves of gold to safeguard our 
currency, and of conservation measures whenever there appears to 
be a possibility of future shortage in the food or fuel supply of the 
nation. On a smaller scale, but in just the same way, it is equally 
important that every individual be personally prepared for the best 
service in his choser-vocation and in his avocation; and also for 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 295 
duties that he may be called upon unexpectedly to perform. Gis 
calls for physical ability along the lines of strength, speed, skill, and 
endiirance,_)These were the traits necessary for ‘the survival of 
primitive man; they determined his ability to. secure food and shelter 
and to cope with his enemies. Even two or three generations ago 
these qualities of physical fortitude were necessary to enable our 
forefathers to cope with the wilderness and subdue it, and in the 
meantime to make a living. The physical qualities needed in primi- 
tive and pioneer life are not in such constant use among us to-day, 
yet the need frequently arises and there is no telling when it will 
come. A person may want the strength to take a fellow workman 
from beneath a heavy machine and carry him to safety; le fre- 
quently needs the speed to make a train or a street car; he needs 
every day the skill to dodge a vehicle or to jump over an obstacle; 
he may want the endurance to work overtime if his factory is rushed 
with work and short of men. He is sure to need these things if his 
recreation takes the form of sport, travel, or outdoor life. In the 
business world, too, the man or woman wins out who can do the 
regular routine of work and havc energy to spare. 2 
Strength 
Strength means muscular force. This force is dependent on 
three factors: the size of the muscles, their readiness to act in ree 
sponse to the will, and the amount of nerve force that can be em- 
ployed to stimulate them. The importance of the last factor is 
shown in the immense muscular power often exhibited by weak 
persons in a hysterical or hypnotic state or by sick people when in a 
state of delirium. For the same reason anyone who is in an excited 
condition can exert more than usual strength; this is illustrated by 
athletes playing before a crowd and by workmen under stress of 
competition. The nervous system can acquire reserve force for such 
use only by continued practice at efforts of strength, such as play con- 
stantly affords. Nerve cells worn down during exertion are built up 
during rest to a better condition than before, but their force slowly 
wanes when there is no activity at all. 
One of the most interesting facts brought to light by recent study 
in this line is that in ordinary muscular action the main bulk of the 
muscle lies idle while a comparatively few fibers do all the work. 
These idle muscle fibers have the power of contraction but are less 
responsive to stimuli than the others. When we compare two 
persons who have muscles of the same size, one may have twice the
-P-A-G-E-304
  . 296 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
working power of the other because he is, as we say, “in training” 
he has been giving his muscles frequent stimuli to action and as a 
consequence more fibers are awake and ready to act; his nerve cells 
also send stronger stimuli to incite them to action. This is why those 
accustomed to muscular exertion have more strength than those who 
are not used to exercise; it is the principal reason for the greater 
strength of men as compared with women. Muscular efficiency 
therefore involves not only muscles of fair size, but, what is more 
important, muscles and nerves that can put forth powerful efforts 
because they are in constant practice. 
Plays and games are conducive to firm, balanced, and supple mus- 
cles, rather than the massive, bulging type seen in professional gym- 
nasts and strong men. It is important in this connection that play 
leaders encourage varied activity, such as that seen in ball games, 
where the movements of handling the ball develop the arms and 
trunk while the running involved also trains the lower limbs and the 
heart and lungs. Unless there is extreme specialization in play, the 
size of the muscles, the power of response in the muscles, and the 
reserve force of the nervous system will be built up simultaneously. 
Speed 
Speed means rapidity of motion. It was almost as essential as 
strength to primitive man. To him speed was imperative in fighting 
his enemies—whether fleeing or pursuing—and jin the frequent hunt- 
ing of wild animals for food. Speed is just as essential in the indus- 
trial and social life of to-day. In the play of children it is most often 
speed that brings success, and the same is true in athletic competition. 
His teammates may be fully as strong in swinging the bat, but it is 
Ty Cobb’s speed that gives him a three-base hit when others get but 
one or two. The speedy typist draws the big pay; likewise, the 
speedy mechanic doing piece-work. Speedsaves time, and thus some 
industrial concerns are able to win over others because of better 
time-saving devices. 
peed requires quick thinking, quick nerve action, and quick re- 
sponse of muscle to stimuli.) Heredity goes far in making speed 
possible, but there is also much ‘in practice. There is nothing like 
competitive play to develop speed in a boy or girl; the constant try- 
ing to do things more quickly makes for a more rapid action. The 
player, anxious to make better speed, learns the quickest way to his 
goal, how to avoid wasting time, and he quickens the reaction time 
of his muscles by persistent practice. Play in childhood makes in this
-P-A-G-E-305
  
THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 297 
way a valuable contribution to the working efficiency of the man and 
woman. Those who have lacked this training in youth can never 
hasten without extreme fatigue. 
Besides saving time, speed may serve as a substitute for strength. 
In the olden days it was a popular form of combat to pit an opponent 
whose best asset was swiftness against one who was much larger and 
more powerful; and the former often won. To-day we see the same 
type of contest when a light football team whose play is lightning 
fast is matched against a heavier and slower team. It is noteworthy 
also that races of slight stature, like the Japanese, prize quickness 
and dexterity of action as an athletic trait more highly than strength. 
Agility or Skill 
Skill is defined as the harmonious adjustment of muscles to their 
actions it is team-work among muscle groups. It is as fundamental 
to human activity as strength or speed. Skill is the most complete 
fitting of means to an end, and requires years to reach its highest per- 
fection. For example, the first time the young child throws a ball, 
he does little more than to extend one joint, his elbow, forcibly; by 
the time he becomes a regular ball player he has learned how to 
bring into action—to aid this simple movement—his pectoral muscle, 
the rotators of the arm and those that move the shoulder forward, 
the rotators of the trunk, the rotators of the hip joints, the extensors 
of the hips, knees, and ankles, and even the muscles of the opposite 
arm. In all such movements, and also in walking and running— 
which we are apt to consider the simplest of acts—each of many 
muscles must come into action and sink into relaxation again in per- 
fect order and regularity or the performer will exhibit a ridiculous 
failure. It is in his play that the child builds up these wonderful co- 
ordinations, little by little, to the most complex stages, with very 
little of voluntary effort or even of attention to his movements. 
Later, in games and contests of a more highly specialized and 
more intensely competitive sort, there is need of a more studied, 
conscious, and careful practice; when the boy pitcher first practices 
a curve, for example, he has to think of the directions given by the 
coach and carefully place the ball in his hand. Systematic training 
finally develops skill and cleverness, and in time the feat that took 
so much effort and pains is performed automatically, with little con- 
scious attention given to the details. 
Scientists and famous coaches agree that the best time to teach 
boys to become star athletes is between the ages of twelve and eigh-
-P-A-G-E-306
  298 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
teen. If the process of learning a new movement is delayed beyond 
these years, the highest degree of skill is almost impossible to attain. 
Much improvement can be made later; in fact, it is never too late 
to learn; but once the golden age of youth is past, there are heights 
that the novice must not expect to reach. 
Endurance 
Endurance means the ability to maintain a muscular contraction 
for a long time, or to repeat an action many times in succession, 
without stopping to rest. It requires muscles of fair strength, easily 
stimulated to action, and a large amount of reserve power in the 
nervous system; and, in case the activity uses many large muscles 
vigorously, it also requires an efficient condition of the heart, lungs, 
breathing muscles, blood vessels, and sweat glands. This efficiency 
of all the vital organs helps bring about the necessary oxidation of 
the waste products of the muscle tissue. There is still another factor 
concerned in endurance, and that is interest. Interest in the activity 
means that the mental attention is small and in this way there is a 
saving of nervous force. A child absorbed in his play can exercise 
all afternoon and be but normally tired; whereas if he were to spend 
the same time in running errands, the irksomeness of the tasks would 
bring about a tired mental state that would make him ready to quit 
ina short time. The hunter forgets that he is tired; but the ordinary 
pedestrian does not. 
A man may have great strength without having great endurance; 
he may be able to lift a great weight, but he may not be able to do it 
again without stopping to rest. The explanation is that although 
his muscles have great power, it takes a great amount of nerve force 
to stimulate them to full action, and unless he has practiced lifting 
weights repeatedly, his nervous system will not have reserve power 
enough to bring his muscles to complete action many times. A 
skilled pianist, on the contrary, cannot lift so great a weight, but he 
can repeat a. stroke upon the keys hundreds of times in rapid succes- 
sion. The strength of the weight-lifter is in sharp contrast with the 
endurance of the pianist. 
The runner, however, illustrates endurance in a more typical 
manner than the pianist. He tosses the entire weight of his body 
into the air at every step—a weight that may be compared very 
favorably with that used by the weight-lifter; but he has such large 
muscles with which to do it, and his nervous system is so well ac- 
customed to setting these muscles in action, that but little nerve force 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  
THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 299 
is used in each step. As far as the nerve and muscle power is con- 
cerned, a runner can easily train himself to run many miles. The 
greater task is to train the heart, lungs, and blood vessels to do their 
part without undue fatigue. The play of children paves the way for 
a high degree of endurance, because it involves so much continuous 
running. 
As an exercise of endurance, running (and games such as soccer 
and basket ball which involve much running) differs from exercises 
such as piano playing, factory work of various kinds, driving nails, 
or swinging dumbbells. . In addition to requiring endurance of cer- 
tain muscle groups and the nervous system that controls them, the 
first type uses such an enormous amount of energy that the endurance 
of the vital organs is taxed to the same extent as the muscles; they 
draw heavily on the food reserves, and therefore stimulate the action 
of the liver and all the organs of digestion, and increase the appetite. 
For this reason games and play involving much running should be 
considered exercise for the whole body: swimming, climbing, hiking, 
and skating are of about the same nature; while playing musical 
instruments, drawing and painting, clerking, and most forms of 
manual labor use a few muscle groups over and over again but have 
little influence on the development of other parts of the body. 
Running or playing running games to excess may, for the reason 
just given, injure the player by overworking the heart or some other 
vital organ, and such injury is far more serious than the slight bruises 
and sprains the players often receive and of which mothers and 
grandmothers stand in such fear. Study and experience show that 
heart injuries are apt to occur in only two situations: (1) when the 
heart is being weakened by the presence of the toxin of some in- 
fection, such as diphtheria of rheumatism; and (2) when the player 
engages in very severe exertion when he is not prepared for it by 
previous practice. The chance of injury in the second case is con- 
sidered small unless there is an infection present. The way to safety 
lies not in avoiding exertion but in keeping constantly fit by regular 
practice. 
To call attention to the value of play in developing endurance, 
it is only necessary to point to the readiness with which the play- 
trained volunteers of Great Britain and America withstood the 
rigors of warfare. In but a few weeks they were able to endure 
hardship and exertion as well as the war-trained veterans of France 
and Germany. The reader will recall the old saying that the battle 
of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton and Rugby. The
-P-A-G-E-308

running and swift succession of plays, the long hours of persistent 
practice, the stone-wall defense when pressed back to the goal line— 
these made an unequaled preparation.

PLAY AND BEAUTY OF FORM 
Play is natural, free, and balanced exercise. The consequence is 
that it develops the body as nature intended: symmetrical in form, 
with poise and spirit. This end can be lost; and the American 
coach may often be criticized for misdirecting play, so that its frée- 
dom and balance are lost in an excessive desire to win and the conse- 
quent specialization in too narrow a line. The ancient Greeks, who 
stressed the aesthetic side of bodily development, gave all-around 
training and paid special honor to the winner of the pentathlon—a 
group of events of different kinds. This idea is coming into vogue 
to-day as play is being supervised from a broader point of view, and
-P-A-G-E-309
  
THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 301 
the modern “efficiency test’’ compares favorably with the Greek 
pentathlon. 
The artificial life of the school, with its long hours of forced 
physical inactivity while sitting in badly fitted seats and desks, leads 
to a slouching posture and a listless air that, when left until the child 
‘attains his growth, can be corrected only with great difficulty. The 
child finds in play an invigorating tonic that expands his chest, de- 
velops his heart and lungs, straightens him up, and gives animation 
and zest to his whole being. Well-directed play should give erect 
carriage, both by harmonious development of the muscles and by in- 
fusing poise and a spirit of self confidence. 
PLAY AND GRACE OF MOVEMENT 
Grace is skill and ease of movement, considered from the 
aesthetic standpoint. It does not necessarily depend on perfection of 
bodily form and proportions, for a person lacking in these respects 
may nevertheless win our admiration and applause by executing cer- 
tain movements with perfect grace and ease.of action. The master 
musician makes himself a part of a great melody, just as the great 
actor holds us spell-bound with his impersonation of a character. 
In the same way the slouching cowboy may make us wonder at his 
horsemanship or the shambling negro delight us with the dancing of 
a jig. 
Grace is art, wherever found. The ball player, awkward in the 
reception room, still exemplifies high art when he catches and throws 
a ball, every movement expressing grace and conservation of effort. 
The possession of grace is essentially dependent on mastery of an art 
to the point where details do not demand attention and on absolute 
confidence in one’s ability; qualities equally seen when the acrobat 
balances on a wire, when the lady receives her guests, and when the 
author exhibits a graceful literary style. 
Since grace can be acquired, we have another reason why every 
child should play. The timid child, looking on while others dance 
and sing, may be awkward when persuaded to join in the play, but 
with mastery over the elements of the dance the self-consciousness 
fades away and he is soon absorbed in the spontaneous fun of the 
group. Every successful coach can tell of an awkward boy he has 
trained to become a brilliant athlete. It is in accord with our theory 
that unless children play, instances of awkwardness increase as years 
go by, for all play is instinctive with racially old movements that 
must be practiced early or a graceful command of them is lost.
-P-A-G-E-310
  302 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Play Compared with Other Types of Exercise 
Play Versus Labor 
In pioneer days children were taught to do useful things about 
the home and to help in caring for the domestic animals that were 
always kept. Labor of this kind occupied much of their time and 
gave them a certain amount of physical exercise—some people believe 
that children would be better off if they could get their physical de- 
velopment in the same way now. As has been pointed out in a 
former chapter, there is no opportunity in modern life, and especially 
in town and city life, for any such occupations for children; besides, it 
is doubtful if any kind of labor that a child might have, supposing it to 
be possible, can do nearly as much for him as his spontaneous play. 
Labor is simple and monotonous, instead of being varied and pro- 
gressive; it demands that the worker sacrifice himself for the work, 
not the work for his good. The work required of the child in school 
puts a strain on his powers of attention and other activities of his 
nervous system; a strain so great that it must be offset by play after 
school hours, rather than to give him still more work to do. If 
labor under a task master is the best exercise for physical develop- 
ment, slaves and convicts ought to be the best physical specimens in’ 
the world, but we go instead to competitive sports to see the finest 
physiques. 
Play Versus Military Drill 
During every war, and immediately following, there is a wave 
of enthusiasm over military training as the best means of improving 
the physique of boys and young men. This form of exercise has 
several points in its favor. The work is done out of doors; it tends 
to induce erect posture; it is not so severe as some competitive 
sports; groups can be taught evolutions that make a fine appearance 
on certain public occasions: and the result is that men who spend 
a few weeks in training in the army camps show a wonderful im- 
provement in physical condition. The improvement is due largely 
to a complete change in the manner of living. The men have plenty 
of good food, several hours of vigorous exercise in the open air every 
day, outdoor sleep and plenty of it, little time or opportunity for 
dissipation, the best of medical service, and good opportunity for 
competitive sports. 
The trouble is that when military training is given in school or
-P-A-G-E-311
  
THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF PLAY 303 
college, most of these advantages are lacking. The former question- 
able habits of living are not changed; the physical exercise is reduced 
to a few hours a week, and limited mainly to the technical details of 
infantry drill and dress parade; the chances for dissipation are not 
removed; there is no medical service. Away from the stimulating 
atmosphere of camp life, the drill lacks spontaneity and pleasure; 
while discipline, precision, and prolonged attention to minute particu- 
lars cause nervous strain. Moreover, the musket is too heavy for 
boys of high school age and causes spinal curvature in manv cases. 
Play Versus Gymnastics 
By gymnastics we mean exercise in which every move is per- 
formed by direction of the instructor. This kind of training is the 
most persistent rival of play as a means of promoting health and 
physique. It is claimed for gymnastics that the pupils get exactly the 
training they need, for the reason that the work is planned and con- 
ducted with an eye single to the best interests of the class; also, that 
the training is scientific and exact, while play is apt to be one-sided, 
subject to individual whim, and wasteful of time. Having planned 
the lesson with great care, commanded the exercises with vigor, and 
corrected the careless and laggard pupils, the instructor feels that he 
has given the best training that is possible. 
Unfortunately, there is some doubt as to the instructor’s supreme 
wisdom in choosing the right kind and amount of exercise. No two 
will agree exactly as to what a pupil needs, and all pupils have their 
individual differences and special needs. One system favors wide 
variety of exercises, while its chief rival advocates choosing only the 
few best. All will agree that a large part of gymnastic lessons are 
carelessly prepared and indifferently taught. 
Even on the supposition that all the pupils in a class need identi- 
cal training and that we know exactly what that need is, and how 
to satisfy it, our problem is not solved; for it is not a problem of the 
moment only. The greatest need of all is an interest in physical 
exercise and a desire for it; any plan that loses sight of this goal is 
fatally weak. Here is another place where the gymnastic drill falls 
down. Few people like gymnastics as a steady diet; no one practices 
such exercise for the fun of doing it. The man who has been ill and 
_ is desperately anxious to get back into condition goes willingly 
through a few lessons, and the man who has no opportunity for 
vigorous play will sometimes persist through a winter term, but this 
is no argument for giving gymnastics to pupils as a steady diet. Lil.e

the old fashioned gruel, it may contain nourishment the body needs, 
but it spoils the appetite for food of any kind. 
If the instructor is wise enough to direct the exercise of every 
child as precisely as a gymnastic lesson aims to do, he should be wise 
enough to put it in a play form, so that the training will be enjoyed, 
instead of being done from compulsion or a sense of duty. Swedish 
lessons in gymnastics have been transformed into play in the so-called 
“story plays,” while posture training is exceedingly popular when it 
is made competitive. ‘Two of our most popular games, basket ball 
and volley ball, have been devised in recent years with a distinct view 
to give well-balanced exercise and erect posture. 
The practice of dictating movements by word of command is the 
simplest and most direct way to get the work done; it is not the best 
way, because the human body was not developed to its present form 
in that way. It is not mere chance, as the advocate of gymnastics 
say, that decides what movements a child at play will make; it is his 
inherited instincts, handed down from generation to generation, that 
guides him; and who shall say that such guidance is not wiser than 
any instructor? 
While gymnastic lessons have a useful place in physical develop- 
ment, play and games better secure the social aims of our type of 
civilization, and should therefore be given preference. Gymnastics, 
being artificial, are best used in artificial circumstances, as when cor- 
rective measures are needed for the individual, or when a large 
number of persons has to use a small space or limited equipment, or 
must be handled by one teacher. The exercises should always be 
given in a variety of forms, with music when possible, and taught in 
an enthusiastic and stimulating manner. 
Conclusion 
After all, the matter of what form the exercise takes is not so 
essential as the fact that the individual is actually exercising. In this 
day and age, anyone is apt to get too little exercise rather than too 
much—almost any form done in moderation will be beneficial. 
There should be no argument over the point that nothing can quite 
take the place of play during the growing period; nor over the point 
that a healthy type of labor and gymnastic activity, if used to supple- 
ment the play programme rather than supplant it, will also furnish 
values of their own. Play has this advantage: if, during the grow- 
ing period, play opportunity is furnished along natural lines, the child 
will instinctively take part, and health will take care of itself. The

child has little or no thought for health. It is given to him out of 
his fun. At a later time, however, when nearing the end of his 
school days, his freedom is curbed as he prepares for and gradually 
assumes the responsibilities of mature life. Then the health question 
is a different one. Health has got to be brought to this individual’s 
attention. He has not the free hours of the child; the chances are 
* that in the few minutes he has to spare he will seek quiet recreation. 
Unless a particularly fortunate individual, he cannot get his health 
through games and sports that demand long periods of time. He 
must seriously plan for his health; and he must take his exercise in 
whatever form is best obtainable. One takes his “Daily Dozen,” 
another exercises in a garden or has a walking schedule, still another 
joins a class at the “Y.”” The physical benefits of play and exercise 
are unquestionable; the problem is simply to provide natural means 
for children to satisfy their play instincts, and to inspire grown folk 
to seek health and to supply for themselves the exercise that is denied 
through lack of time, space, or unwholesome employment.

CHAPTER XV 
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 
‘People have ever held to the idea that the body is the servant of ~ 
the mind. This thought was expressed by Plato, centuries ago: 
‘‘gymnastics for the body and music for the soul . . . but the teachers 
of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul.” Bridg- 
ing the gap to early modern times, we find Rousseau expressing a 
similar opinion:“‘If you wish to cultivate intelligence, cultivate the 
powers itshouldrule. . . . Exercisethe body continually. . . . Let 
the pupil be a man in vigor and soon he will become one in reason.2 ~~ 
The English gentry of to-day wish their sons to gain the physical 
benefits of the many sports that their schools are famous for; but, 
first and foremost, they consider the accompanying growth in 
breadth of mind, and in will, pluck, sportsmanship, and like qualities 
of manliness. In America this idea of the relation of mind and 
body also prevails. The national honorary athletic fraternity, Sigma 
Delta Psi, has for its motto “The Body the Servant of the Mind.’* 
This notion of the body as an inferior is true but very incomplete. » 
Man has risen to his high plane of superiority over the animal world, 
and over many of the forces of nature, through his intellect. To- 
day’s struggle between men is mental rather than physical. Because 
of these things, man has come to place most importance on his 
mental development, but forgets at the same time that mind and 
body are interrelated and indispensable to-each other in a normal 
existence. 
Relation of Infancy and Play to Higher Intelligence 
It has been discovered that there is a relation between the intelli- 
gence of an animal and the length of its period of infancy. With 
the lower forms of animals all the bodily powers spring at once into 
full maturity, without practice or training. Their activities change 
but little from one generation to another, and their hereditary tenden- 
cies are practically fixed and rigid. Man, being the highest expres- 
sion of animal intelligence, needs the longest period of infancy. He 
307
-P-A-G-E-316
308 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
has the most to learn. At birth, his hereditary impulses are vague, 
for the life activities of man have changed from simple to com- 
plex. While the chicken is born with a definite instinct to get food 
by picking up small round things in its mouth, and the cat by pouncing 
on small moving objects, the infant of the human species cannot de- 
pend on his instincts alone for survival, but has to be trained in a 
multitude of functions which are a part of adult life. He is born, 
not with a complete set of powers, but with a plastic nature that has 
an immense capacity for teachability. Nature has provided for the 
child’s first education by endowing him with an instinct to be active, 
an instinct second only to hunger in its demands. Upon activity de- 
pends the growth of the body, and upon the normal growth of the 
body depends the normal growth of the mind. This self-activity of 
the infant is his play, an outlet in which he expresses himself as 
earnestly and fully as the master workman does in any of the higher 
arts. Educators have come to agree that the first steps in the child’s 
education should be in the direction of his natural impulses and 
interests. ‘Then play reinforces the inherited abilities that are the 
basis of a mental life. Play changes concurrently as the child grows 
older and his mental outlook takes on a different aspect; in the words 
of Froebel ‘“‘The plays of children are the germinal leaves of all the 
later life.’ Froebel called attention to the mental significance of 
play, describing it as the ‘‘outward expression of an inner life.” The 
“instinct” theory of Groos is based on the supposition that the child 
plays in order to get preparatory practice for the functions of adult 
life. The scheme of education to-day aims to direct the play so that 
it gradually blends itself into work as the child’s mental powers grow 
stronger. 
The Mind Develops Through Motor Activity 
*There is no other way for mind to develop than through activity; 
and therefore the child’s first mental growth must come through a 
physical means. At birth the fundamental motor areas of the brain 
are the only ones that are ready to respond to sensory stimuli. As 
with animals, the first instincts are active ones. Without this motor 
power, the infant would have no way to express himself. 
The child is engaged in self-education when he clutches objects, 
and when he creeps and walks. Consciousness arises when the infant 
finds that his first reflex movements give a definite reaction for pleas- 
ure or otherwise. At this moment—with this perception—the child 
ceases to be a physical animal alone; for, through his movements he
-P-A-G-E-317
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH . 309 
has found his mind. From then on he can will action. But the mind 
is just in its beginning. Later, the child finds that the sensation he 
experiences in the action that he wills is similar to one he has experi- 
enced before; thus memory is reached. The child is still, however, 
no farther than many animals; for the dog and horse have memory. 
But man is creative: the child links his present thought or experience 
with a past one to conjure up a new one. He links the toy with the 
street car he has seen; and, when he pushes the toy around the floor, 
he is expressing the creative instinct as found in imagination. He 
has then passed beyond the animal stage. 
No longer is the child dependent upon the physical experiences of 
the moment, but can call upon his mind to help him make new ex- 
periences out of an imaginary grouping of his old ones. Out of a 
gradually increasing complexity of experiences he draws conclusions 
and makes associations. In these ways he progresses from lower 
animal reflexes and instincts through the mental awakening of his 
higher thought processes of perception, memory, imagination, and 
reason. These processes do not develop in abrupt stages; nor are 
they isolated from one another. They have an overlapping develop- 
ment, but some are more pronounced than others at certain periods 
of the child’s development. With the attainment of reason, man is 
complete in all his functions and becomes the normal human being. 
Reason has‘infinite powérs: man, through reason, can make new dis- 
coveries, find new pracesses, make searches into the abstract realms 
of philosophy, science, art, and religion. As Cooley so aptly puts 
it, ‘Reason is teamwork among the hereditary instincts.” 
Parallel Development of Body and Mind 
The mind grows hand in hand with the body. Not until the latter 
stops developing does it cease to play a direct part in education: 
therefore, just so long as the body is growing, physical exercise in the 
form of play should be afforded, for the mental in man is built upon 
a physical foundation, and the more solid this foundation, the more 
durable the mind. After maturity, play is still needed, not so much 
to educate as to recreate. : 
Educators have made a study of the relationship between mental ay 
and physical growth, and have found out that children_retarded in _/\ 
their physical development are backward mentally; or, vice versa, 
that large and healthy children are precocious in their school work. 
A report published by the U. S. Bureau of Education in 1914 en- 
titled “‘Physical Growth and School Progress” finds this to be true.
-P-A-G-E-318
  
310 _ THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
A statistical study of the New York school system showed that even 
slight physical defects brought about slower progress (approxi- 
mately ro per cent) than that of children enjoying normal activity. 
Courtis, after an extensive study of the Detroit schools remarks: 
“On the average children progress in school in proportion to their 
physical development. The greater the increase above average 
weight in grade and age, the greater the degree of acceleration: the 
physically developed children are those promoted most rapidly.” 
Studies of Dr. Ferdinand Schmidt of Germany, and Dr. Paul Godin, 
of Switzerland, are very emphatic in the same conclusions. Such 
findings as these, based on the average of large groups, should be 
practical proof that bodily development is an important factor in 
contributing to increased mental efficiency. 
With adults the relation between mind and body is also very 
definite. Disorders of the body produce mental ill health; and 
mental hygiene, one of the newest of medical fields, is using physical 
activities in its treatment. The normal individual, when mentally 
fatigued from long concentrated study, depends upon his body to 
furnish pleasurable exercise that will freshen his whole system again 
and restore his mental vigor. Man, when his mental tower has 
crumbled, must repair with physical masonry. 
Play’s Part in the Development of the Nervous System 
The nervous system, consisting in general of the two great clusters 
of nerve centers, the brain and the spinal cord, is the seat of con- 
sciousness. Through it the mind controls the body and receives its 
knowledge of the outside world; and through it the individual is 
made aware of the various states existing within his own being, physi- 
cal exhaustion for instance. The nervous system is the most com- 
plex structure of man, and of all organs, the least is known about it. 
Part of its control over the body is an unconscious one, such as over 
the various vital organs; but the acquisition of intelligence and will 
in man has given him a power over the voluntary actions of the 
body. 
At birth, the nervous system of the infant is undeveloped and 
consequently consciousness is vague. His first muscular activity is 
reflex action, which later changes to conscious action as the child 
becomes aware of sensations of pleasantness attending certain of his 
movements. He repeats these movements, and this repetition has 
important significance to the growth of the nervous system by giving
-P-A-G-E-319
  
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 311 
control over the body and by producing experiences which go to 
form the content of his mental world. 
Play Gives Control Over the Body 
The mind must gain control over the body before it can spare 
time for thoughts apart from movement. The more actions that 
can be made automatic and involuntary, the more time the mind has 
free to meet the complex problems of adult life. The human mind 
is such a busy machine that time and effort must be saved if a person 
is to have opportunity to carry out his higher aspirations. There 
must be economy, and play is the means of securing it. It is the 
function of play to practice and rehearse adult activities. The child 
has to practice the different movements of walking over and over 
again, with his mind concentrated on the accomplishment. Only 
after considerable effort are they learned. Later, however, his mind 
is rewarded; for attention, which is a time-taking and fatiguing 
process, no longer has to be given to the bringing of all these move- 
ments into action. Mental energy is thus conserved for other use. 
Think how a person’s time would be occupied if he had to stop 
for reflection every time he wanted to take a step or raise an arm! 
How many people lack time for keeping up to date mentally because 
they never learned as children to move quickly and perform the 
common acts of everyday life skillfully! 
Play Builds Up Mental Endurance 
There is a certain order in which the nervous system is developed, 
this, in general, proceeding from the lower levels upward. The 
lower fundamental levels, as well as the muscles they direct, are 
stronger and of greater endurance; while the higher nervous centers, 
controlling the accessory muscles, are more delicate and more quickly 
exhausted. Tyler describes their relation as follows: ‘The old fun- 
damental centers are the fortress-foundations of the brain, the seats 
of endurance and resistance. If they are neglected or incompletely 
developed, the whole brain structure totters or collapses. They, far 
more than the higher centers, claim and require our attention 
throughout childhood. . . . If we would fortify the nervous system 
of the child so that it will not collapse in nervous prostration under 
the strain of modern life, we must encourage him to use the heavy 
muscles of trunk, legs, and shoulders. . . . Mental exercise of a 
logical sort has added only the finishing touches to the development 
of the brain.”
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
While the fundamental enduring part of the nervous system is de- 
veloped through the instinctive craving for exercise, which should 
not be curbed too much by schoolroom requirements, the higher 
levels have but little instinctive prompting, and to reach their highest 
possibilities, must be assisted by formal methods of education. But 
education must not make the mistake of trying to hurry this develop- 
ment along. The immature mind cannot assume the mental tasks 
of the adult any more than the immature body can cope with the 
adult in strength. Straining the child’s delicate nervous system will 
produce harmful results just as do the forced attempts to teach the 
child to walk. Nature’s order cannot be inverted. Statistics have al- 
ready been quoted to show that, on the whole, school children of 
best physique stand highest in their classes. The best thing for the 
child’s intellectual growth is to make his body a help to him, rather 
than a hindrance. A healthfully developed body means that the 
mind has a good machine to carry it along on its mental journey, a 
machine that will need the least possible attention, and one that is 
able to meet the emergencies without breaking down and needing 
repair. On the other hand, if the body is illy developed or is 
fatigued, the fundamental nerve centers are called upon to do work 
that otherwise would be “‘reflex.” This proves a distracting annoy- 
ance to the higher thought processes. The person who is so fatigued 
that he has to make his limbs move only by compulsion of the will 
cannot think clearly on any other matter that happens to be at hand. 
Muscular exercise builds up the brain areas that are later used 
for thought, particularly those parts that deal with the everyday 
life of action. To-day, it is the man of action who is successful. The 
idea itself is worthless without a proper response. 
The Order of Development 
The Reflex Level.—During the first few years the infant 
practices the mechanics of the ordinary movements of life (those 
needed everyday), such as kicking, reaching, holding, sitting, crawl- 
ing, standing, and walking. Included also are the vocal coordina- 
tions needed to produce speech. No one of these accomplishments is 
an easy one. The same movement has to be repeated over and 
over again with the attention fixed closely on the process of doing it. 
These actions after many repetitions become automatic—performed 
without the mind giving conscious attention to the process. In early 
childhood the more difficult bodily movements of running, jumping,  
-P-A-G-E-321
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 313 
throwing, climbing, and handwork, in turn are practiced, and the proc- 
ess of making them reflexis begun. The plays of the child are instinc- 
tive lessons in learning to control these fundamental bodily coordina- 
tions. The child in his play freely copies actions he sees, and in this way 
his motor development proceeds economically along the lines that 
tradition and custom mark out as being the most useful and valuable. 
These efforts of the child in mastering everyday movements de- 
mand practically all the nervous energy that he has to spare. They 
compose his serious business in life. Although not yet entered in 
school, and with little or none of formal education, he has developed 
the spinal cord and lower brain areas into almost complete activity. 
This means that the conscious effort of the will is becoming freed 
from directing the body and progressively able to turn itself to other 
things. 
The Sensori-Motor Level.—The period of later childhood is one 
of great motor activity. Rejoicing in his new found control over the 
body, the child responds in action to the many sensations that come 
from this mysterious world about him. The preceding reflex activi- 
ties are not only perfected, but tried out in combination with each 
other. The newer complex acts involve concerted actions of many 
muscles throughout the various parts of the body, and therefore 
bring different parts of the nervous system into concerted action 
also. Considerable coordination of mind and muscle is necessary 
to perform these acts with ease. All the while, too, experiments are 
being made with the finer, more specialized muscles of the body; and 
the corresponding nerve centers are going through their process of 
development. The stunts of the playground (somersaults, chinning, 
balancing, etc.), the throwing, catching, and batting of a ball (in- 
volving reactions of time and distance), along with wrestling and 
boxing, swimming, dancing, shooting with bow and with the sling, 
marbles, kite-flying, whittling, miniature house-keeping, collecting, 
and handicrafts, all testify to the child’s perfecting of his motor 
possibilities. 
In this new type of physical skill the advantage of having de- 
veloped reflex movements in the preceding years is present, for the 
child now has time and energy to spare in planning results apart 
from the activity itself; his mind is free to exercise itself apart from 
the actual directions of movements. ‘This is seen in the entrance of 
competition and strategy into his plays, which now have rules to be 
observed and tend to be classed as games; also in the new enjoyment 
in intellectual types of play like checkers and dominoes. The child’s
-P-A-G-E-322
314 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
mental freedom from his body is also evidenced in his ability to 
spend half his day in school studies. 
The more complicated muscular movements of later childhood 
have their corresponding development in the second level (the 
sensori-motor level) of the brain as distinguished from the lower 
reflex level. These movements while largely made automatic, are 
not reflex to the extent that the more fundamental everyday move- 
ments are. However, people to-day are agile and graceful accord- 
ingly to the extent they have practiced these movements in youth, 
and similarly depends their ability to move with lightning quickness 
in emergencies. It is the rare case where the athlete gets hurt in the 
midst of crowded traffic. This period of later childhood is the time 
to develop the finer motor and sensory adjustments. 
The “Association” Level—tIt must be remembered that while 
the second level of the brain is being developed, the lower level is 
being exercised and kept in normal vigor at the same time. Now 
if normal play activity is continued into the period of adolescence, 
both these levels are kept in full vigor while most of the conscious 
effort is being directed to ends that are bringing about the develop- 
ment of a still higher level—the ‘‘association areas of the brain.” 
It is generally believed that these areas control the higher intellectual 
and moral processes of man, and possibly some of the most difficult 
and unusual physical feats. It is evident that play has little more 
to build up in the way of physical direction of the body. The every- 
day movements of adult life have been made reflex and the occa- 
sional ones needed for emergency or to enjoy certain types of recrea- 
tion have been made readily adjustable. The play activities of this 
period clearly show the liberation of the mind from the body, for 
the movements have no end in themselves, being made in behalf of 
larger ends in the way of individual and team success in situations 
that approximate adult life, for athletics do contain the elements of 
competition and specialization that are such prominent factors in our 
business and professional life of to-day. 
How fully the individual has mastered his body at this time, and 
permitted his mind freedom, is demonstrated in the fact that two 
hours or so are now sufficient for his daily play life, and that the 
remainder of his time can be devoted to his books and to the de- 
velopment of delicate physical skills needed in control of speech and 
hand. Except for perfecting the previous physical coordinations and 
relating them to more complex mental situations, there is little 
need for the ordinary individual to develop athletic skill. This is  
-P-A-G-E-323
  PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 315 
the province of the athlete. Even he reaches the peak of his 
eficiency in early maturity. The high school and college athletes 
who place their sport as their main interest in life—more important 
than their intellectual advancement—are harming themselves in 
every way except bodily health. 
When the stage of maturity is finally reached, the individual 
finds his play has gradually changed from being his most serious 
business of life, to his least serious from the standpoint of his 
mental growth. One half an hour to one hour a day now suffices in 
the way of active exercise. This does not mean that this exercise— 
now a recreation—is unimportant to the nervous system. Modern 
civilization, wth its many demands in the way of finer and specialized 
muscular and nerve coordinations, has thrown the burden of work 
on the higher association areas of the brain, the ones that can only 
be exercised with considerable direction and expenditure of nervous 
energy. Such work involves tiring effort in the way of sustained 
attention, analysis, reason, will, and inhibition. A certain amount of 
relaxation is necessary. 
Play Affords Mental Relaxation. Play recreates mental energy 
after the brain tissues have become fatigued through long continued 
effort or worry. Fatigue comes when the tissues cannot throw off 
the waste products of combustion as fast as they are accumulated. 
An important thing in relieving fatigue is change. The best place to 
turn for relaxation is to the activities that can be performed with- 
out a great deal of conscious direction—the exercises that belong 
to the reflex and middle levels. Patrick’s Recreation Theory of 
play is based on this idea which states that the play activities of both 
child and adult “tend to take the forms of old racial activities, involv- 
ing brain tracts that are old, well worn, and pervious.” The school 
boy, tired from his study, goes out to the playground during the 
recess and comes back invigorated; the tired factory hand, instead of 
sitting down for complete rest during his noon hour, joins in games 
like indoor baseball and quoits, and starts in fresh when the after- 
noon whistle blows. The change of attention gives rest to the tired 
parts of the mind. The child, if unrestrained, will change to a dif- 
ferent activity when the one at hand has become monotonous. He 
finds his attention diverted by the variety of games in which he in- 
dulges. The adult must take his attention away from his ordinary 
routine duties and center it on the interesting occupation of hunting, 
fishing, or beating some one in a game. The change is all the more 
valuable when it brings big muscles into use. Big muscles coordinate
-P-A-G-E-324
316 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
without much effort of the will, and leave the higher brain tracts 
almost entirely at rest. Then, too, big muscle exercise quickens the 
heart action, and the increased blood supply brings nourishing food 
to the run-down nervous tissues and helps to carry away the waste 
products. 
The people who have enjoyed play in their childhood and youth 
are the more fortunate ones as regards the capacity for self-enter- 
tainment. Their play spirit remains with them, and proves the best 
doctor for worry and despondency. But this play spirit grows up 
with us. We cannot ignore it until adulthood and then suddenty find 
it. We are told of the English ’bus driver, who had. driven without 
a holiday for fourteen years, and who could think of nothing better 
to do on his long-expected holiday, when it came, than to go for 
a ride on a ’bus.” 
Play Gives Wide Range of Experiences 
While the child is exercising his instincts in active pursuits of 
spontaneous nature, it is not only his muscles and their motor centers 
of control that are being developed: he is acquiring ‘intellectual 
interests, he is forming moral habits, and he is becoming more and 
more a social being. This intellectual life will now be studied, first 
from the aspect of his direct experiences and sensations, and later 
from the relation that these bear to his more abstract processes of 
thinking. 
The child’s activity is Nature’s way of having him receive in- 
numerable sensations. These impressions or mental pictures reach 
the mind through the senses. Sensations form the incentive for new 
activity, and in this way new sensations are continually being re- 
ceived. The nervous system has been likened to a ‘“‘great and very 
complex switchboard” for the reason that it “switches off” the sen- 
sory stimuli onto motor nerves. It is found that the normal child 
has alert and active senses, to which he responds in play activity, 
while the dull child always has feeble sensory development and is 
also physically sluggish. 
Sense training and the motor reaction to it constitutes the first 
training in human education. This has been recognized by child 
educators such as Froebel, Pestalozzi, and Montessori. Their 
curriculums for the earliest years are based on the proposition “Alt 
knowledge is received through the senses.”
-P-A-G-E-325
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 317 
Knowledge of Environment 
The powerful instincts of self-activity, of curiosity, and later 
of imitation, lead the infant on in his quest of investigation. He 
soon learns to manipulate the objects within reach, to test their possi- 
bilities of taste, and to drop them to the floor to hear their rattle. 
Brightly-colored objects and moving objects prove fascinating. 
Later, when he masters the arts of creeping and walking in turn, he 
widens his range of experiences. His world keeps growing up with 
him. He sees animals, birds, trees, and other wonders of nature, and 
man-made creations such as street cars and automobiles. He hears 
strange noises and learns to associate them with their respective 
sources. This is his proper education. His first perceptions must 
deal with concrete things, because he can think of something abstract 
only by forced attention and with difficulty. Later, the playground 
and school furnish him with new materials for investigation. If he 
is fortunate, he will be able to hike and to travel and still further 
widen the boundaries of his environment. 
During the period of infancy the child’s pleasure is found directly 
in sensations that he is receiving. He has no remote interests in 
mind when he plays. But these impressions are necessary to the 
development of memory, imagination, and reason, and these ele- 
ments gradually become factors in his play, and introduce enjoyment 
of ends remote from the enjoyment of sensations in themselves. 
The child should be encouraged in this quest of experimentation, 
for out of it can grow a well-trained sense of observation as regards 
the practical interests of life, and a clearness of perception that will 
serve to stimulate the workings of his higher mental powers. 
Play is to the child what travel is to the adult. Of play in this 
connection, and its importance to the child, Froebel wrote, “It is 
through play that he comes to know the physical qualities of the ob- 
jects that surround him, their motion, action and reaction upon each 
other, and the relation of these phenomena to himself.” Preyer is 
quoted as having said that the child learns as much in its first three 
or four years as later in life he does in a university career. More 
recently, another lover of children, Luther Burbank, in his “Training 
of the Human Plant” thus pleads that they be allowed their natural 
heritage: ‘Every child should have mud pies, grass-hoppers, water- 
bugs, tadpoles, frogs, mud-turtles, elderberries, wild strawberries, 
acorns, chestnuts, trees to climb, brooks to wade in, water-lilies, 
woodchucks, bats, bees, butterflies, various animals to pet, hay-fields, 
pine-cones, rocks to roll, sand, snakes, huckleberries, and hornets,  
-P-A-G-E-326
  318 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
and any child who has been deprived of these has been deprived of 
the best part of his education.”” These things, which prove of delight 
to growing boys and girls, are largely disappearing from their life, 
except in so far as organized play provides them. 
Ideas Gained From Association With Others 
Knowledge of one’s physical environment, including one’s rela- 
tion to it, is not the only type of information to be amassed during 
the years of infancy, childhood, and youth. Impressions can be 
gained from the experiences and thoughts of other people with whom 
one comes in contact. In a sense, every playmate is a teacher. 
‘The big step in this direction is made at the close of infancy when 
the child learns to vocalize—speech brings in more rapid and certain 
communication than the cries and signs by which he formerly 
attempted to convey meanings. Now, he can get ideals from his 
parents and other children, and add to his own store of information 
by finding out about their experiences. This is a quicker way of 
learning things than trying everything out himself, and the child’s 
education now grows by leaps and bounds. 
~Contact with people in all walks of life makes for a_ versatile 
mind; and the lack of it-for thé narrow mind. The games of youth 
“prevent the individual from growing one-sided and narrow-minded. 
He learns from the other fellow and the other fellow’s point.of view. 
His own thoughts, will, and emotional habits are modified to make 
him a normal social person. His mind is sharpened and stimulated 
in the matches with other intellects and kept constantly on the alert. 
In rural communities it is most important that children should meet 
together in play in order to get this training that comes from mixing 
with people of all temperaments. Not only in the life of childhood 
is this exchange of ideas considered of value; even.men in specialized 
fields of knowledge find it profitable to hold conventions where they 
can converse with other men of the same interests. An example of 
the importance of exchanging ideas is shown by the experience of 
Japan. Japan was one of the most backward nations of the world 
until its ports were opened for the first time to the American fleet 
under Commodore Perry. Since then it has tried to borrow from 
all nations.   
Insights into Human Nature 
~ When children meet in spontaneous play, they throw off self-con- 
sciousness, artificiality, and restraint, and are shown in their true 
»  
-P-A-G-E-327
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 319 
personalities. Their associates can then judge them for their real 
worth.Such insights into human nature are of great importance to 
every one, especially to him who aspires to lead. In no way can a 
person better learn about human nature than actually to come in con- 
tact with it. Play is social and furnishes this opportunity; and as 
the games grow in complexity and demand more rules, the better is 
the chance to observe whether a person is honest, whether he is loyal, 
whether he acts coolly in the emergencies, and whether he remains 
brave under reverses. 
The failure to mix sociably with one’s fellow beings is the reason 
so many brilliant students in our schools fail in the actual working out 
of their profession. Many Phi Beta Kappa students cannot teach 
successfully, and many other honor students cannot fill executive posi- 
tions, because they do not understand how to handle other minds 
than their own. They have acquired coveted intellectual honors, but 
at the same time they have neglected to cultivate their fellows. It is 
certain that a person, if he is to be successful in the everyday business 
life, must have more than an encyclopedic accumulation of facts. 
He must know how to meet and deal with men. He must be able to 
apply in a practical way the knowledge he has gained. 
Adjustments to Practical Situations of Life 
The everyday life is much different than that of the schoolroom. 
Different types of judgment and reaction are required in each case. 
The scholar in his research can think calmly and deliberately and 
defer his action; but when he attempts to become a man of practical 
affairs he finds himself in a world which is complex, changing, and 
confusing, and which demands close attention and quick adjustment 
on his part. That our modern education has come to recognize this 
double need in training, is demonstrated by the increased emphasis 
being given to extra-curricular activities, such as play, athletics, 
club work, dramatics, music, debating, and many others, in which 
the participant must be a doer as well as a thinker. The mere 
scholar is apt to be a bungler in practice, and the man of business to 
lack in intellect and culture. 
/ Play gives a progressive education in adjustments that approxi- 
‘mate the practical life of adults. The child gradually becomes able 
to master increasingly difficult situations: first, to control his bodily 
\ movement of itself; then with this bodily control to imitate persons 
\and things, and later to imitate imaginary creations of his mind; 
then to use his new physical skill to some desired end that involves 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  320 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
rivalry with other playmates (such as pursuit and dare), or that 
involves the manipulation of objects or of bodies other than his own 
(such as in catching and batting a ball, constructing with tools, and 
wrestling) ; finally, to make the most difficult adjustment of all, that 
found in the team game, in which he must not only have sure con- 
trol of his body and of the objects to be manipulated, but must make 
instantaneous choice between several courses of action made even 
more complex because of restrictions of rules and unexpected moves 
on the part of opponents. The player must keep his mind concen- 
trated on the progress of the game, be alert for opportunities, and 
follow the rules—just the opposite of scholarly contemplation and 
abstraction. The emergencies come and the decision must be quickly 
made and acted upon. To hesitate, to make a mistake in judgment, 
so that one acts ahead of or behind time, are errors that lose the 
game. Too many errors denote inefficiency and will lose him his 
position. No other situation of youth can more closely resemble 
adult life unless it is premature entrance into adult life. 
Competitive life is a succession of games. One who is trained in 
games is therefore a quicker thinker and interpreter in the midst of 
a kaleidoscopic life of moving persons and things. The more auto- 
matic the mind can react to the shifting situations, the better the 
chance for success. The person trained mentally in such judgments 
and reactions will not have identical situations facing him throughout 
life; but his mind will be the more adaptable for this type of exper- 
ience; just as the person who has continually played at games can 
learn a new one easier than one who has not, and the person who has 
played on musical instruments can learn a new one more readily 
than one who has never tried such an accomplishment. This train- 
ing for life need not necessarily be in athletics; the student finds much 
the same type of experience in serving on the school newspaper, in 
holding student office, and in acting as manager for athletic teams 
or other organizations. Students who are prominent in school activ- 
ities are usually prominent afterwards in their community life. 
The earlier training is invaluable, teaching the dangers of overcon- 
fidence and the necessity of team play, and giving an intimate knowl- 
edge of human nature. 
(eicale play prepares the way for athletic play, which in turn 
prepares | the way for the competitive type of life. Such a mental 
preparation, however, is not without its accompanying dangers, for 
in the active life, the moral element is closely linked with the mental. 
The training in athletic sports, if it be of a type that disregards the 
   
-P-A-G-E-329
  PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 321 
rules of the game and the ethics of fair play, may make the future 
man of action, it is true, and yet at the same time it may make him 
unscrupulous in his attitude towards the laws of society. Another 
danger arises when too much emphasis is placed on athletic work, 
and it becomes the major aim of school attendance rather than a 
secondary one. Such an attitude tends to loose scholarly habits. Too 
much practice on something that is already easy for the players de- 
stroys their ability for hard application along other lines. If, on the 
one hand, over-indulgence in abstract study produces the impractical 
dreamer, on the other hand, over-indulgence in a life of action pro- 
duces a mind that is incapable of fully enjoying the things apart from 
the practical life, the things that involve aesthetic appreciation and 
which bring culture, refinement, and repose to the owner. 
Play Experience as the Basis of the Higher Mental Processes 
The previous paragraphs have shown us the most concrete type 
of education that can be imagined. This consists of the first-hand 
information that a person gathers through his own experiences and 
those in connection with other people of his acquaintance. Play 
proves to be the child’s first teacher in this respect. It absorbs the 
child’s whole interest and allies doing and feeling along with learn- 
ing; and therefore it cannot be differentiated from real life. How- 
ever, a person’s education would be very incomplete if he depended 
only on this direct “trial and error’? method of gaining knowledge. 
This is a slow process and therefore society uses formal means to 
hurry it along as fast as possible. The formal education is one of 
books, formulas, and symbols, as opposed to real persons, things, 
and happenings. The child’s mind has much difficulty in grasping 
the more abstract meanings of life—but as this is overcome it can 
be readily seen that he has added a wonderful asset to his mental 
gifts. Through the help of teachers and books he can transport him- 
self beyond the realms of his immediate environment and live in a 
world of fancy with people and customs that belong to other lands 
and to other ages—he can know of things that neither he nor his 
playmates could otherwise experience and discuss with one another. 
Valuable as the abstract knowledge is, and increasingly valuable 
as it becomes in the child’s life as he matures, it would be largely 
meaningless unless accompanied by concrete knowledge as well. Just 
as the progress of civilization to-day is built up out of the cumulative 
experiences of the many peoples who have lived in ages before us, 
so the higher mental advancement of the individual grows out of his  
-P-A-G-E-330
  322 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
previous store of experience. The many experiences are the raw 
products from which the finer thoughts and emotions are later 
fashioned. 
A child who has stocked up his mind with many clear and vivid 
impressions is prepared to visualize his more abstract lessons of the 
schoolroom—when he reads a book there will be pictures presented 
to him as he goes along. After he has seen a thing, he can the better 
understand references to it, just-as the person who has traveled has 
always an intimate interest in the places he has seen. Abstract teach- 
ing material can always be enlivened by reference to actual happen- 
ings within the bounds of ordinary understanding. 
The actual experience is the basis of all abstract thought. Obser- 
vations such as the falling of the apple and the movement of steam 
in the tea kettle led to the discovery of the law of gravitation and of 
the steam engine. Many new inventions have been built up on these 
discoveries, but the fundamental basis was one borrowed from an- 
other man’s experience; it was about this experience that the abstract 
theory was added. 
Every new experience that the child can gain has an influence on 
his later life. The psychologists tell us that every experience records 
an indelible mark upon our sensitive minds, and that our present 
thoughts and actions are largely the outcome of antecedent acts or 
impressions. Many of these occurrences, apparently repressed from 
memory, are apt to resurrect themselves at any time. The impor- 
tance of environment upon our early lives is bound up in this truth. 
The play life, which is the natural life in the tender years of child- 
hood, is the way to acquire plentiful experiences; and play should be 
organized in order to give a proper and wholesome training to chil- 
dren from all walks of life. The wider the range of concrete ex- 
periences in the developing manhood or womanhood, the greater 
the power for clear image making, for judgment making, and for 
building up an individual philosophy; and, in consequence, the richer 
the intellect in maturity. 
The leading educators all tell us that this is the proper order of 
education: from the concrete to the abstract; from the spontaneous, 
motor, and emotional lifé, to the reflective and symbolized life in 
which instinct plays but little part and in which action and feeling are 
almost entirely absent. Action and feeling should precede thought 
in the earlier emphasis of education. Motor play and sensory play 
should therefore ‘precede intellectual play, and intellectual play 
should precede intellectual work.  
-P-A-G-E-331
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 323 
A study of this order will go to show that next to actual experi- 
ence in working out a thing for himself, a person can become most 
interested in—and find most meaning in—information that comes 
through the medium of story-telling, moving pictures, and picture 
books, where the mind is helped to form a picture almost as clear 
as though the things were actually present before him. Reading, 
too, can be made so entertaining as to be play; and many people, 
whose lives are barren in many ways, enrich their outlook by this 
artificial means. Reading is a prominent source of information in 
the child’s life, for books are so readily accessible to-day. To prove 
most valuable and interesting, it should be gradually introduced, the 
type of story depending on the child’s stage of development. During 
the age of imagination there are the stories of animals with fictitious 
personalities, Mother Goose rhymes, and fairy tales; during the 
individualistic stage, there are the stories of action—those of legend- 
ary heroes, of Indians, and of travel and adventure; during the 
loyalty age, stories of athletics and of college life, followed by the 
historical novel, the biographies of great men, and general fiction; 
and with maturity, there comes interest and pleasure, not only in 
fiction, but in topics of the day, in topics of a philosophical nature, 
and in technical contributions to the field of one’s chosen life work. 
In general, the information gathered from formal education has 
play interest accordingly or not as it is made to resemble things close 
to actual life. Arithmetic can be taught by counting out actual 
apples instead of using a textbook. It is not a mistake, as some 
educators insist, to try to make things easy for the children. To 
be sure, the children must learn to apply themselves to hard tasks 
as well as to easy ones, but they should not be made to do this pre- 
maturely. Children’s minds are far from being adults’ minds, and 
interest in abstract things will come in time when the child has ac- 
cumulated sufficient facts with which to generalize. Education can- 
not approach the child from the same standpoint it does the adult. 
The child looks at the world from an entirely different outlook, and 
has to pass judgments in the light of an impoverished experience. 
The facts he possesses have meaning largely in their isolated selves. 
He does not have the power of restraining action that the adult 
possesses. 
It is important and should be realized that all the study and ap- 
plication given to real life, or to subjects having much in common 
with real life, therefore will be of gain in the everyday life through a 
larger understanding of it; whereas abstract and unenlivened school
-P-A-G-E-332
324 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
work will only be of use to those who happen to specialize along the 
particular line. From concrete general experience there can be 
gained some benefit to all lines of mental endeavor; but the abstract 
specialized study only exercises and develops a narrow and restricted 
ability. This is the reason why our schools and universities demand 
general cultural courses before allowing the chance to specialize. 
All individuals alike need the first type; only the few whose special 
aptitudes and talents are appealed to, will derive particular benefit 
from the second. 
The Higher Mental Processes 
The simplest way for the mind to receive impressions is through 
the senses. Exactly how the higher mental processes operate is not 
known, but the following description by Waddle shows the modern 
viewpoint: “Mind is a unit made of many differentiated sets of 
processes, mediating different functions. Sensing, perceiving, re- 
membering, associating, attending, imagining, reasoning are not 
separate ‘faculties,’ but designate various more or less complex func- 
tions of the mind at work.” As regards its growth in higher con- 
sciousness he continues ‘“‘We cannot say that there is first a con- 
sciousness of simple sensations, then of a unification of sensations 
into perceptions, later the rise of images of memory, concepts, ideas, 
etc., and finally an organization of all into reasoning processes. 
Rather we shall have to say that all these processes and contents exist 
in germ in every modification of reaction from the beginning . . . all 
the mental functions are integral parts of a complex; they do not 
exist alone.” 
Some of these functions of the mind are exercised sooner than 
others because sensations must be received before there can be 
memory, and memory is needed in the imagining or reasoning 
processes, both of which associate new experiences with old ones. 
Memory develops best when exercised in connection with the 
things that the child is most interested in. These are the things he 
will notice and get the clearest impressions of, as memory best func- 
tions when the mind aftends to the situation at hand, and observes 
it closely. Children are not apt to pay any attention whatsoever, to   
uninteresting things, and even those that are interesting may be ovei- 
looked unless catted-to—their-notice. This is the province of the 
teacher, and is the one particular thing that has made the Scouting 
type of education by far the most successful in nature teaching. 
Imagination produces mental images that are not entirely those
-P-A-G-E-333
  
PLAY AND MENTAL GROWTH 325 
of the past. In this sense it is creative. Much of the child’s fun 
in play is due to his imagination. Imaginative play means play with a purpose and_is_a_sure sign of mental growth in the way of origi- 
nality and inventiveness. Early in the child’s life, imagination is 
largely the driving power behind his actions. He is free to play and 
his imagination dlstermines.wbat-be-shalla. Play ie his art, wt which 
he engages in Tor art's sace-only-—Plis fist stret. tretches of imagination 
are connected with something he has actually seen or heard—he may 
make an engine out of his toy; build a house out of his blocks; chat 
with make-believe companions; take journeys; feed make-believe 
pets; and do other things in like manner. This play world is in- 
tensely real to him. He lacks wide-experience to formulate opinions 
or make decisions so does not attempt to do_so; instead_he tends 
to imitate the adult world about him as much _as possible. As his 
abstract thoughts s come to multiply in 1 number he transfers his origi- 
nality to situations that are more dramatic in nature—to things that 
are unreal in ‘the Tife | about ‘him, but which he tries to make real. 
For full growth, imaginatio and reason. 
Then it can_functi he limits of practicality, and stamp its 
owner as the f plentiful ideas, but of sound ones rather than 
visionary ones. 
Reason develops as the child’s stock of experience grows. At 
first it is very imperfect; the child when asked ‘‘Why?” will usually 
answer ‘“‘Because!’? But all the while this limited thinking power is 
becoming mature, accordingly z as he acquires f facts from his play life. 
His increasing power is demonstrated in the ability to to distinguish~ 
between the real-and unreal and to attach the proper value to im- 
aginary conceptions—Santa Claus is no longer a red-clothed, white- 
whiskered gentleman climbing down impossible chimneys, but is 
understood to be a symbol of Christmas cheer. Later his reason- 
ing is ie sousirnted taeda of human nature;-atso 
by the ability to grasp the meaning of concrete situations, to profit by 
previous mistakes, and to formulate standards of conduct. In his 
games it is directly demonstrated by the increasing scope of strategy,

being whose almost every move is dictated by higher thought, which 
shapes and refines his course of action with but slight consideration 
of his animal instincts or desires. Civilized man submerges his 
primitive and elemental self. His very feelings are intellectualized. 
His aesthetic appreciations have risen far beyond the crude savage 
likings for bright colored trinkets and loud noises of drums. In- 
stead, his emotions have been refined to be pleasures of thought as 
well as of action. If his education has been right, play will have 
been included-as-a-faetor. It will have started-him-out right, giving 
him source material from nature, andthis i is_essential-ifone is later

that are found in art and literature-as interpreted by master minds.

with living beauty.

  CHAPTER XVI 
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 
The previous chapters have discussed the physical and mental 
benefits arising from properly conducted play, and we now come to 
the third phase of man’s three-fold nature—the moral. Some people 
have a very narrow viewpoint of man’s moral development or 
character. They consider it in its relafion to vice only. However, a~ 
much broader interpretation is involved. It includes also such posi- 
tive qualities as courage and perseverance; and it includes still 
further such unselfish qualities as kindness, courtesy, obedience, co- 
operation, and loyalty. 
Character is hard to define; but in general it is found expressed in 
all the reactions which a person makes to the situations of his en- 
vironment; it implies personal self-mastery, and a rigid respect for 
the rights of others. Character is the power of formulating and 
Bes Without character, all our finer 
thoughts ‘and feelings would remain within us, without any transla- 
tion to a worthy deed. 
Importance of Character 
Character is the keystone of the three-fold man. A mental and 
physical composite that prophesies brilliant success in life may be 
entirely ruined if accompanied by moral laxity or weakness. A won- 
derful physique and brilliant intellect are a positive detriment to 
society if associated with an unstable or dissolute character. The 
master criminal is an example of brilliant genius gone astray through 
lack of character, and used to menace society instead of to better it. 
Because health and knowledge without moral stamina are of 
little use, and may even be detrimental, to society, many people place 
character as the highest objective to strive for in education. They 
point out that a strong character will overcome the obstacles 
presented by a weak or fatigued body or mind and will be even 
stronger after the victory, and cite the example of Theodore Roose- 
328
-P-A-G-E-337
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 329 
velt who overcame physical weakness through sheer strength of will. 
The reader, however, must not think that the placing of so high an 
estimate upon the value of character means that the importance of 
mental and physical development should be belittled.~ Character _is 
at its best when allied with a healthy body and mind. Physical fitness 
of optimism and good fellowship and of aggressiveness and self- 
confidence. 
| The value of play in the promotion of character development has | 
long been recognized by the foremost educators. In ancient times 
was and Quintilian expressed their convictions on this aspect of 
play; and in early modern times, Locke, Basedow, Guts Muths, and 
’ others, also credited plays and games with possessing moral poten- 
tiality. In 1840 Arnold, an English headmaster at Rugby, de- 
liberately introduced play and athletics, with special emphasis upon 
team games, into his school curriculum as subjects more important 
~ for their moral values than for health and recreation. His example 
has been followed by the other private schools of England. 
In America we find the advertisements of our best private schools 
for both sexes featuring the development of strong character through 
the ample opportunities offered for sports of all kinds. Their 
facilities are, on the whole, much more extensive than those available 
in our public schools, but the latter are gradually overcoming this 
handicap. In each type of school, the emphasis upon building 
character through play activities is increasing. This new. apprecia- 
tion of play is shown by a questionnaire sent to the superintendents 
and principals of afl the cities in Michigan. One of the questions 
was: “What subject in the curriculum has the most influence from 
the moral standpoint ?” ’—and the overwhelming answer was “Play 
and Athletics.” Certainly outside of the study of language, there is 
no subject so universal in value. This value, universal in extent and 
content both, accounts for the fact that play is becoming a required 
rather than an elective subject to-day. 
The Process of Character Development 
Character is primarily based upon the instincts and emotions. 
Man’s conduct is more dependent upon feeling than upon thought, 
and so it is his desires and emotions that most powerfully influence 
his acts. Since the most fundamental instincts and emotions require 
muscular activity for their expression, it follows that play, which pro-
-P-A-G-E-338
  330 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
* vides for this natural expression, must be one of the strongest factors 
\in the development of character. The worth of any activity in the 
promotion of the moral qualities is determined chiefly by the nature 
of the instincts and emotions exercised. 
When a given emotion is exercised repeatedly there gradually 
develops a tendency to give way to that emotion more readily, and 
we have habit developed. Just as this is true in the individual, it has 
also occurred in the race and we find the emotional exercises which 
have been frequently repeated by our ancestors inherited by us as 
instincts. Instincts and habits are then fundamentally the same, the 
first acquired by the race and passed on to posterity, the other ac- 
quired by each individual separately. 
The primary instincts and emotional tendencies of each indi- 
vidual are hereditary, but the effects upon them of environment and, 
later in life, of intellect, are very important. The characters of the 
persons with whom the child’s environment places him are certain to 
be reflected in him, for the child’s instinct of imitation is very strong. 
“The acts, precepts, suggestions, and chance conversations of his 
elders are all of major importance to him and practically none of 
these escape his notice. 
The fact that the inherited instincts and emotions can be 
moulded, forms the basis of procedure in charactér formation. The 
intelligent teacher or parent can so encourage and control the native 
tendencies of play, curiosity, sense-gratification, self-assertion, sug- 
gestibility, desire for approval, etc., that each will assume its proper 
importance. This regulation of the desires, thoughts, and acts of the 
child gradually forms the habits of conduct which determine his 
moral worth. 
The amount and character of the’ restraints imposed deserve 
careful consideration in each individual case. A lack of external 
restraint tends to produce the unsocial and selfish individual while 
too much restriction is likely so to break the will that all initiative is 
lost. Natural spontaneity and imagination should not be suppressed 
but rather directed along constructive channels. It is far easier and 
better to overcome a bad habit indirectly, by replacing it with a good 
one, than to try to suppress the habit directly and thereby focus the 
attention upon it. In the same way, on a large scale, the habits of a 
whole people are better established by furnishing wholesome activi- 
ties than by trying to prohibit the bad ones. 
The way in which moral training is best applied will vary accord- 
ing to the child’s age and corresponding play tendencies. William
-P-A-G-E-339
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 331 
McDougall in his ‘Social Psychology” distinguishes certain steps in 
character building. He states ‘‘We may roughly distinguish four 
levels of conduct, successive stages, each of which must be traversed 
by every individual before he can attain the next higher stage. These 
are (1) the stage of instinctive behavior modified only by the in- 
fluence of the pains and pleasures that aré incidentally experienced in 
the course of instinctive activities; (2) the stage in which the opera- 
tion of the instinctive impulses is modified by the influence of rewards 
and punishments administered more or lessesystematically by the 
social environment; (3) the stage in which conduct is controlled in 
the main by the anticipation of social praise and blame; (4) the high- 
est stage, in which conduct is regulated by an ideal of conduct that 
enables a man to act in the way that-seems to him right regardless 
of the praise or blame of his immediate social environment.” 
The gradual passage from the one level to the other is attended 
by the growth of self-consciousness, sentiment, and character. 
First Level 
In the lowest level there is no sense of right or wrong. Instinc- 
tive impulses are the sources of action. The child learns that certain 
acts have pleasant results while others produce pain or discomfort; 
and in this way his conduct becomes somewhat regulated. He bumps 
his head and learns to become more careful. As he gradually ad- 
justs himself to these fundamental laws of Nature, self-control and 
judgment begin to be exercised. 
Second Level 
The second stage shows the individual profiting by the experience 
gained while following his natural impulses. He has experimented 
with his environment and understands the consequences of bumps, 
burns, and falls, and has developed definite interests and impulses. 
However, as his scope of action extends itself, it brings in a new 
discipline—that of his parents and teachers. He finds that he must 
satisfy an adult world. He is too young to understand the adult 
standards and so he does not question them; rather he imitates them. 
His actions are still elemental but they please or displease others as 
well as himself. To his own immediate satisfaction or pain in the 
act, there is added now another satisfaction or pain in the praise or 
reproof of his elders, as the case may be. It is from this fact that 
praise and censure derive their importance in moral training. Un- 
desirable acts should be followed by an impressive evidence of dis-
-P-A-G-E-340
  332 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
approval, and what is fully as important, though more frequently 
neglected, worthy acts should be suitably commended. The agree- 
able result tends to make a process more firmly fixed and a habit 
formed; but on the other hand the effect of the unpleasant result is 
to create a tendency to inhibit the repetition of that act when a 
similar situation again arises, and the development of the habit is 
therefore prevented or weakened. 
It is this adult approval and disapproval that first shapes the 
child’s idea of himself. As this development of the self expands, the 
child tends to become consciously individualistic. Each child is his 
own leader, and strives unrelatedly to win. He goes through a proc- 
ess of trying himself out and the resultant failures and successes de- 
termine the amount of self-assertiveness that he develops. In this 
process of finding for himself self-confidence and initiative, proper 
encouragement and assistance by an older person is necessary. 
As the years of adolescence approach, and the reasoning powers 
of the child grow stronger, the discipline of mere restraint and 
coerced obedience must be gradually modified. Many of the pre- 
vious ‘“‘dont’s”” must be explained and the child’s cooperation must be 
enlisted in the adherence to a progressively developing moral code. 
If unexplained discipline is too long enforced, the strength of 
character will not be developed; either the child will rebel or his in- 
dependent spirit will be broken. 
Third Level 
Thus far, the results of instructive experiments and the deference 
to authority have largely regulated the developing habits of conduct, 
but now a new motive appears, and with it the third level is reached. 
To his own instinctive gratification, and to the satisfaction in adult 
approval, there is added now a satisfaction in social approval— 
that of his own circle of associates. The individual now wants a 
share in setting the standards of conduct by which he shall abide; and 
when they are set, he desires that he shall be praised for conforming 
to them. His life becomes intimately blended with that of the 
members of the ‘“‘gang,” and later the “‘team.’”’ This new social con- 
duct becomes regulated by the approval and disapproval of the 
. group and the teacher can best regulate the conduct of the individual 
through wise supervision of the group. During this period, that of 
adolescence, the emotions are at the height of their influence and it is 
at this time that character, which is most closely associated with the
-P-A-G-E-341
  
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 333 
emotions, is chiefly developed. The adult who has secured the ap- 
proval and confidence of a group of adolescent boys or girls has an 
opportunity for the development of morals that cannot be over- 
emphasized. The coach of a team will, by the standards of sports- 
manship which he emphasizes and exemplifies, play a large part in 
determining the conduct of the members of that team in their adult 
life. 
This third step has shown us conduct regulated by public opinion 
in the shape of the social group of which the individual is a member 
and an equal. It represents a higher stage of moral conduct than that 
which simply abides by laws through fear of punishment. But not 
yet has the highest type of character been shown. It is possible 
for the individual to go contrary to the will of his group without 
being found out. Therefore it is necessary that there be a will even 
higher than one’s fellows’ praise and blame. 
Fourth Level 
To the three satisfactions that have already been mentioned, 
there may now be added a fourth one: that of one’s own conscience, 
or own spiritual approval. The individual establishes a moral code 
for himself that is even higher than that found in his dealings with 
the group. His maturing reason in the light of actual experience 
reveals to him the fallibility of human conduct. The gang law is not 
sufficient; it may be broken and no one the wiser. Each member 
must have a law unto himself; one that can never escape judgment. 
This recognition of standards even higher than that of the group 
means that the individual may have to act contrary to the will of 
the group if he is to be true to himself. The teacher’s regulation of 
conduct has largely passed; and the individual has taken his 
character into his own hands. The inspiration now comes from the 
lives of great men and women—great in the sense that they have 
lived true to their ideals. Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest 
moral characters of history, gives perfect expression to this ideal of 
conduct in his words ‘“‘I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be 
true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to what 
light I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right; stand 
with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong.”

  334 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
PLAY’S INFLUENCE ON THE DIFFERENT TRAITS OF 
CHARACTER 
The different qualities of character appear in a fairly well de- 
fined sequence as the child develops. In general, they may be divided 
into three main types according to the order of their appearance and 
growth, as follows: 
(1) The individualistic qualities, or those pertaining to personal 
conduct independent of others. 
(2) The social qualities, or those which are concerned with the 
individual as a member of a group. 
(3) The civic qualities, or those involving the attitude of the 
individual toward organized society. 
Of course, the development of these three types of qualities will 
somewhat overkins, but their sequence should be remembered in 
attempting to adapt the instruction to the age and capacity of the 
child. The opportunity to promote each type will gradually present 
itself in any normal child and the teacher must realize what qualities 
can be emphasized. 
Under these types may be classified the many traits such as self- 
reliance, self-control, cooperation, and the like, that are referred to 
separately as being derived from play and athletics. The tendency 
has been to assume that the meaning of these qualities is understood 
by everyone and therefore to treat them in a superficial way. On the 
contrary, however, an abstract term of this type gives merely a vague 
impression unless associated with a concrete example. Therefore, 
for the benefit of the student, it seems advisable to discuss each trait 
as a specific objective. 
> Play Develops the Individualistic Qualities 
The individualistic group involves those qualities necessary for 
the success of the individual in competition and life—courage, de- 
termination, enthusiasm, etc. They aré most primitive in the race 
and likewise appear first in the child.’ No encouragement by parent 
or teacher is necessary to bring them out, but proper control and di- 
rection is needed if the desirable qualities of this type are to be 
fostered and the undesirable ones discouraged. Without direction 
the development of the individualistic qualities is apt to produce a 
narrow-minded selfish person who is cruelly unmindful of the wel- 
fare of others. Wise direction in home, school, and playground is 
needed to temper this extreme individualism,
-P-A-G-E-343
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 335 
Courage 
This is the one moral quality that a person prides himself on 
more than all others. The tradition of valor is one that has sur- 
vived as a result of the many centuries during which man had to 
fight for his life and that of his family. Early tribes, knowing that 
upon the bravery of its members depended self-preservation, reared 
their young in an atmosphere where visible bravery was a part of 
everyday bearing and demeanor. The brave have always been 
honored. During the days of chivalry the troubadours sang of 
deeds of valor. To-day it is the same: witness the homage paid 
to the wearer of the Croix De Guerre, the Distinguished Service 
Cross, or Congressional Medal; or to the person who has won the 
Carnegie medal for a brave act in time of peace. 
Environment and tradition play a large part in the ease with 
which a person’s courage is made apparent. The races that have 
had to struggle hard against enemies or that have found nature un- 
favorable to an easy existence—the Spartan and Highland Scot, for 
example—praise bravery and fortitude as the first virtues, while 
other peoples, living in the midst of plenty and ease, conceive of 
industry and thrift as qualities needed every day, while bravery is a 
hidden quality that is shown on special occasions. It should be clear 
that the games and contests of to-day furnish the substitute for war 
and other primitive hardihoods and offer the opportunity for the 
preservation of the fighting virtues. 
Bravery is most often associated in our minds with a fight against 
odds. One of the greatest heroes of history was the Trojan Hector 
who did not refuse the challenge of Achilles, even though he realized 
that he was meeting an invincible foe. The three hundred Spartans 
at Thermopylae, the fight of Horatius at the Bridge, the charge of 
the Light Brigade, ‘‘the immortal 600,” David Crockett at the 
Alamo—all these are examples of deeds of unflinching service to 
one’s ideals that have stirred mankind over and over. All courage 
is not physical, as the life of Christ goes to show. We admire 
Abraham Lincoln because of his fixed purpose in choosing the harder 
thing through knowing that he was in the right.’ 
The competitive types of play give plenty of opportunity to 
acquire the physical courage that is found when inferior size and _ 
physique is battéréd and punished, and yet does not flinch or 
whimper;-the-courage of spirit, which dares to stand by the right, 
and which redoubles its efforts, instead of abating them, when 
reverses come, The important thing is that just as the great deeds 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  336 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
of history have given inspiration to other men, so do the remem- 
brances of boyhood deeds, even though rendered in a losing cause, 
remain in the consciousness to inspire the battle for ideals or princi- 
ples in later life. 
Ingenuity 
Ingenuity is the ability to invent, contrive, or originate. This is 
another asset needed for winning, whether the activity be play, busi- 
ness competition, professional life, or war. 
Ingenuity in games is most often required for strategy, which 
is the ability to outwit the opponents and gain advantage to make up 
for the lack of size or numbers. The school boy is eager for such 
stories as that of the crafty Ulysses and his trick of the wooden 
horse; how he opened the gates of Troy to the besiegers after they 
had tried for ten years to capture the city. Masters of warfare like 
Hannibal, Napoleon, and Washington had to depend upon ingenious 
strategy to. get them out of tight places and achieve success against 
great odds. The trick plays of football players, the intricate schemes 
of offense and defense invented by paid coaches, and the shrewd 
moves of financial magnates are examples of strategy—a quality ad- 
mired by the American public. 
The ability to outwit the opponents is very praiseworthy as long 
as it is within the rules and the spirit of fair play. Too often players 
attempt to gain unfair advantage through trickery that is contrary to 
rules of the game, and the opponent then has no chance to anticipate 
the play. 
Ingenuity in outwitting an opponent is not the only kind of in- 
genuity that life demands nor the only kind developed in play. In- 
genuity in devising new ways of doing things is just as interesting and 
even more useful. The players who invented the crouching start for 
running, the way to curve a ball, the spiral pass and spiral punt with 
the Rugby football, and the better forms or styles of performing the 
different jumps, vaults, and throws, made a contribution which will be 
a help to players as long as play exists. Play leaders who know the 
games well can often improve them and make them fit into unusual 
places; three deep, for example, which is usually played in a circle, is 
sometimes played ina long line, so that it can be used in a narrow room 
or alley; baseball, which requires about two acres of ground, is modi- 
fied to make ‘‘playground ball,” played on a quarter of an acre. 
Entirely new games can be invented to secure certain types of train- 
ing and to fit into certain spaces. Basket ball and volley ball, now
-P-A-G-E-345
    PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 337 
used the world over, were invented only a few years ago as winter 
games to be played in a gymnasium. New exercises and games have 
been devised as a result of the invention of new types of apparatus 
and equipment. In the world of industry, inventions have altogether 
changed the manner in which civilized people live, and new inven- 
tions are continually making more changes. 
Self-Initiative 
One function of school athletics is to develop initiative and a 
capacity for leadership, and the possessor of these qualities will find 
them of permanent value in meeting the tests of manhood. 
Initiative is a positive virtue. It is the power of taking action on 
one’s own responsibility and therefore succeeding when thrown upon 
one’s own resources. It does not belong to the person who always 
awaits helplessly the trend of events and who drifts with the current. 
Responsibility is entrusted only to those who have initiative, for the 
business executive on a vacation wants to know that his subordinate : 
can go ahead alone and carry things on in his absence. 
Lack of freedom results in lack of initiative. This is noticeable 
in the lessons of the great war. -The German soldiers, used to being 
controlled by an iron discipline, proved efficient and well-nigh invinci- 
ble when being capably led and when winning; but when being beaten, 
or without a strong leader, their zest in the contest quickly gave out 
and they were not nearly so capable as the Canadian and American 
soldiers whose whole life training had been to act in the emergency, 
to assume self-leadership, and to keep on doing their own part in the 
game, with or without direction from superiors. Athletic teams in 
America that are composed largely of foreign elements from auto- 
cratic countries show this lack of initiative, also a dependence upon 
a rigid leadership. They play wonderfully as a unit when winning, 
but become disorganized easily if losing; they play better before 
home crowds than when away; and the players quarrel among them- 
selves to a ridiculous degree when the coach’s authority is not 
present with them. 
Decision 
Decision is a preparatory step to self-initiative—the one is the 
power of deciding and the other the power of putting decision into 
action. Both traits are forceful. Decision has a broader mean- 
ing than merely making up one’s mind or opinion. It means that 
the individual is confronted with a choice of courses to follow,
-P-A-G-E-346
338 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
and often this choice must be determined with quickness, vigor, 
and courage. 
The team game confronts the boy or girl with choice. Up 
to the age of competitive play the child’s actions have been largely 
motivated by suggestion, usually in the form of imitation. But 
the baseball game requires that the youth make a quick and firm 
choice in the midst of a rapidly shifting state of affairs. He can- 
not hesitate. He has the ball. Shall he throw it to first base to 
put out the batter, or shall he try to get the runner at home plate? 
This choice is made still more difficult because one never knows 
just what the opponent is going to do. The player who cannot 
decide quickly in such a situation fails in the eyes of his team- 
"mates, and probably loses his place on the team. If a boy makes 
the team, it is an indication that he is developing the decisiveness 
that is needed in the emergencies of later life. 
+ Perseverance 
Perseverance as a moral quality carries the same impression 
that endurance does as a physical quality—that of long continued 
effort with success depending upon its maintenance. 
History furnishes us with an abundance of material with re- 
spect to men of perseverance. Demosthenes stuttered and 
stammered, but he persisted in becoming an orator and his continued 
persistence made him one. Augustus Caesar was physically a weak- 
ling but a lifetime of continued effort made him a man of iron con- 
stitution by the time that he assumed the title of Emperor. It is 
not too such to say that the United States is an English speaking 
country only because the Pilgrims stayed in New England—in the 
face of certain death for many—when they could have taken the 
boat back to England after the first harsh and miserable winter. 
There are too many people who plan things with an excess of en- 
thusiasm and make a great impression for the moment; but their 
interest soon wanes and their plans disappear in thin air. The 
athletic team that makes ambitious plans and then disbands after the 
first setback is another too frequent occurrence. 
Many types of play not only furnish the boy with opportunity for 
developing perseverance but they teach him convincingly that con- 
tinued effort always brings a degree of success. One boy excels in 
the handspring; his playmates looking on and envying him, sense 
that they have not practiced as diligently. The runner who perse- 
veres when tired wins over the opponent of less stamina. The ac-
-P-A-G-E-347
    
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 339 
quiring of good athletic form also needs perseverance; the champion 
shot putter must be able to put all the muscles of the back, shoulders, 
and legs into the throw; the champion hurdler must be able to take a 
certain number of steps between the hurdles so that he will not lose 
his stride for the jump; the champion batter must hit many balls so 
as to train his eye and time his swing. In gymnastics the Germans 
master wonderful feats on the bars through patient persistence, and 
the quality that makes them successful in this instance, makes for 
precision and exactness in all other fields) The English develop 
form in their various games, but with this form they also acquire the 
tenacious spirit for which they are known the world over. 
Determination 
Determination is more than decision; it involves also the idea 
that one will persevere in carrying out a decision regardless of 
obstacles. The attitude of determination and will power is often 
seen when a team runs onto the playing field; and the “do or die” 
spirit of the players, their straining as though nothing can hold them 
back announces to all spectators, friend and foe alike, that here is a 
team that intends to win. 
No quality is more important in the battle of life than determi- 
nation. It is the essence of leadership, for one man’s will power 
will impart a psychological effect to the crowd. We expect things to 
be done by the individual who says, “I will” instead of ‘‘I wish.” 
The boy who wills to make the team, who wills to perfect his 
playing in every possible respect, who determines to out-race or out- 
play his opponent, and who denies himself certain pleasures in order 
that he may have a stronger body, more active brain, and clearer eye, 
will later have the same determination to outstrip others and be at 
the top in his business or professional life. 
Self-Reliance 
Self-reliance comes with one’s consciousness of, and confidence 
in, his own individual ability and worth. In games the individual 
learns by experience his own powers as against the powers of others. 
The inexperienced player has to go through this lesson, but after he 
has been pitted against others again and again, his nervousness wears 
away. He begins to respect his own prowess and finds that other 
players whom he thought invincible are nevertheless fallible. In 
baseball the small boy who shivered with anxiety and fear when 
playing on sandlots, will grow into the college player who will be
-P-A-G-E-348
  340 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
oblivious both to large crowds and to the fear that he may miss the 
ball and lose the game. 
Confidence in one’s self is a big asset in life. Many good ideas 
have been stifled because the possessor of them was afraid that he 
would meet with ridicule. In the same way, the golden opportunity 
of a big job has been lost because one was not sure of his ability to 
tackle it and make good in it. If one lacks confidence in himself, it 
is easy to see why other people cannot be expected to place confidence 
in him. 
Self-Control 
The player must learn to control his temper under trying situa- 
tions. His temperament must be trained in the self-discipline neces- 
sary to sustain the contact and violence that come in rugged sports. 
The player who fails to rule his own spirit will play into the hands 
of the opponents; his mind acts blindly in the emergency and he is 
thinking of revenge when his thoughts should be centered entirely on 
the strategy of the game as it progresses. A hasty act may lead to 
penalty, or possibly his own removal from the game; in cither event 
not only he, but the team as well, suffers. The boy who loses his 
temper and commits an unsportsmanlike act will later feel regret 
when he finds himself condemned by other players whose respect and 
approval he desires, and such a lesson will have a lasting effect in 
curbing any hasty act. 
Self-control also consists in the ability to keep cool in an 
emergency. The Boy Scout is trained to give help when an accident 
occurs—to give calmly and coolly of his strength and energy in assist- 
ing those who are inneed. Time is precious and self-possession con- 
serves it. Self-control is largely a matter of will-power, confidence, 
and habit. The habit is made by constant training in a process. 
This training is forcefully given in the games of youth where 
emergencies of every description are endlessly arising. The youth, 
meeting these over and over again, is developing a habit that will 
serve him in time of need throughout life. 
Self-Restraint 
Self-restraint differs from self-control and determination, two 
other terms with which it is often confused. The possession of self- 
restraint means that the person has the ability to fight back an im- 
pulse to do a certain thing, whereas the possession of self-control im-~ 
plies more: it means also that one has the ability to keep possession
-P-A-G-E-349
  
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 341 
of his normal faculties in time of great emotional stress—to keep 
level-headed and act in a rational manner. When compared with 
determination, it is seen that self-restraint requires inhibition and a 
defensive manner; whereas determination, though it may be of this 
type, also denotes a positive courage, such as the “will to make the 
team.” 
There is a certain amount of discipline in self-restraint. The 
army authorities at West Point favor soccer in the training of their 
cadets because of the rule that players may not use their hands in 
playing the ball. The American youth has the instinct to play a ball 
with his hands instead of his feet, and it takes a lot of holding back 
to “head the ball,” or let it hit the body, instead of catching it. The 
act of self-restraint is practiced over and over in play. It is also 
practiced in other ways; as, when’the child fights back the temptation 
to play unfair when an advantage could be gained by doing so; and 
again, when the player practices a life of self-restraint in the way of 
denying himself personal pleasures such as late dancing, smoking, 
and the eating of rich foods and pastries, which are detrimental to 
his athletic ability. =~ 
Thoroughness ) 
This is complete action without omission. Thoroughness means 
persistent effort applied to all details of the game, and all habits of 
life, and its meaning invokes the thought of drudgery as well. Being 
thorough means that the housewife sweeps the corners as well as the 
center of the room; that the little child picks up all of his toys and 
puts them away when he is through playing; that the girl at the 
piano practices the scales as well as the pretty melody. ‘Thorough- 
ness enters into the spirit of the playground. The aspiring player 
must practice at many of the routine things if he is to perfect himself 
in all ways; and the chances are that the things he must practice most 
are the things he likes to do the least. 
Aggressiveness 
Aggressiveness means vigorous action following upon decision. 
Like many of the other individualistic qualities this is valuable only 
as the right kinds of aims are sought. It is the opposite of passive- 
ness. The aggressor always forces the battle whether it be a sport- 
ing challenge, financial drive, or business deal. Because games de- 
mand action, they tend to cultivate this spirit; the timid child 
gradually becomes bolder as he learns his part in the game. Aggres-
-P-A-G-E-350
  342 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
siveness demands self-confidence. The aggressive spirit is most 
valuable to social progress because it is needed to awaken the public 
when a spirit of apathy prevails. It is all the more valuable when 
quick action is demanded. The aggressive individual, because he 
does produce action quickly, is apt to be inconsiderate of people who 
are in his way, and therefore tact is a quality that this type of person 
needs to cultivate in himself in so far as-it is possible. 
Ambition 
Ambition means the desire to advance oneself: to achieve 
superiority, power, and honor. For this reason it also means dis- 
satisfaction, for the ambitious person is not content with his present 
status. Personal ambition is to be encouraged in so far as it seeks 
worthy attainment. One person may be ambitious merely to satisfy 
a selfish love of domination; another may seek power altruistically 
and forgetful of self, sincerely hoping to make his talents useful to 
others. The influence of the playground must crush the type of 
ambition that seeks to be the bully; and instead, foster a merging 
of individual and team ambition, so that the desire for self-improve- 
ment as a player is also considerate of added chance for team success. 
Enthusiasm 
Enthusiasm is a quality of emotion which denotes eagerness for 
the success of a definite cause. It differs from optimism by focusing 
itself upon a certain undertaking and intensifying the ordinary 
interest one would have in it. Such an attitude is valuable in teacher 
and child alike for it means the opposite of sluggishness, and that 
interest and full attention are being given to the object at hand. En- 
thusiasm is also of a contagious nature, so that one individual may 
spread it among an entire group. One who aspires to leadership 
must possess it. 
Reliability 
Reliability is a broad term covering truthfulness, honesty, per- 
sistence, and thoroughness. It means that the person can be de- 
pended upon; that he is trustworthy—he will be present when he has 
promised; he will do what he has said he will do; he will perform his 
service well. In another sense the word implies an agreement, and 
a living up to the standard that one is capable of and which others 
expect of him. For this reason it is an all important quality in the 
business world; the trade mark of reliability is the very best that a 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 343 
firm can offer. Likewise in play the boy or girl may be known as 
reliable. Play gives a training that tends to form habits of reliability. 
The team can only be successful when its members can be counted 
on to attend the practices, observe training, learn the rules, follow 
instructions, register for eligibility, and be present when the game 
is played. Some playgrounds consider reliability so important a 
factor that they include it in the actual scoring of games. 
Play Develops the Social Qualities 
The social qualities are those which provide for propef relation- 
ships between the child and his associates, and which include the 
simple moral virtues of the home and other primary groups. They 
begin to develop as soon as the first playmate enters the child’s life. 
Usually the normal gregarious instinct of the child will lead it to 
form the proper associations to develop the qualities—kindness, 
honesty, generosity, etc.—which belong to this division; but occasion- 
ally it is necessary to encourage the timid to join the activities of 
others. Even the engaging in elementary games means that the child 
is subjecting himself to a social discipline. True, he may be playing 
for himself, but his conduct is modified. He must comply with the 
rules of the game (a social institution) and he must make himself 
agreeable if he is to be a popular playmate. 
We are all familiar with the concepts of kindness, honesty, jus- 
tice, friendliness, generosity, thoughtfulness, courtesy, service, and 
many others which the world of play has grown to consider as 
synonymous with the terms fair play and sportsmanship. In ordinary 
usage these terms are often used interchangeably, but this is a mis- 
taken notion. Sportsmanship is the larger term—it includes fair 
play, which is limited to a keeping within the letter and spirit of the 
rules. Fair play involves the two assets of honesty and justice, but 
sportsmanship goes further in bringing in all the refined expressions 
of social spirit: such as chivalrous consideration of a‘ worthy op- 
ponent during actual play, and also in winning or in losing; 
hospitality apart from the playing field; and many other things that 
may be made a part of the game even though not written into the - 
tules. Sportsmanship may be carried into the rules of business com- 
petition and even of war. 
_ These primary ideals that have been discussed are the same as 
those which underlie the teachings of Christianity: the religion of the 
“Golden Rule”—“Do unto others as you would have them do unto 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  
344 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
you”; the religion under which the world has progressed steadily 
even though there have been temporary setbacks into barbarism. 
Democracy is Christianity in government; it extends these human 
virtues of the family life to the life of the larger community in the 
attempt to humanize the structure of society. These two institutions 
of Christianity and Democracy have tended to break down the rule 
of force and of intolerance. They can be credited with the rise of 
women to an equal place with man, the abolition of slavery, and with 
the recognition thatall men are born equal. To-day there is the strug- 
gle going on to overthrow autocratic methods in industry. The result 
is that siners is being placed more and more on a cooperative basis. 
As a tribute to the importance of play and recreation in instilling the 
social ideas into employees, it is interesting to note the many in- 
dustrially-owned athletic fields, gymnasiums, rest rooms, etc. The 
field of industry is the one that needs most liberalizing now; for 
although many people are satisfied with their freedom of person and 
thought and kindred privileges, they are nevertheless dissatisfied with 
the inequalities of economic returns. 
The brotherly ideals grow as an evolution. We may ‘see many 
reasons to be pessimistic about the conditions of life as they exist 
to-day, but one should stop to think how far we have progressed 
from barbarism. The unsocial idea of the survival of the fittest has 
vanished, and instead of following the ancient custom of abandoning 
the weak infant to die, or of neglecting the sick, we have all the skill 
of modern science applied to make these beings well. Many of our 
hospitals are free. Many are the other philanthropies—the institu- 
tions for the feeble-minded, the delinquent, the poor; and the many 
driyes carried on to allay suffering. 
In play there is continual chance for expression of all the ideals 
of sportsmanship. The play teacher can bring the lesson home by 
“making use of the actual happenings in the game to illustrate the 
principle being advocated. Because these ideals are so well known 
there is no need of taking each of them singly and discussing it from 
the standpoint of its transfer from experience in play to use in the 
mature life. Instead, an example of the occurrence in play will be 
shown, leaving the reader to picture the application to other things. 
There may be some educators who disagree with the idea of transfer 
of power of a lesson learned from one activity over to a different 
one, in the way that they differ with the notion that algebra is a gaod 
subject because the mental discipline gained is transferred to use in 
other fields of knowledge. But all psychologists do agree that
-P-A-G-E-353
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 345 
transfer of power is possible from a like subject to a like subject; 
even though there may not be transfer from algebra to history. 
Certainly then, transfer from play is possible, for the play of the 
child is the work of the man, and this is identity rather than transfer. 
Kindness 
Kindness is sympathy in action. A skilled player helps a weaker 
child to become more efficient—this is kindness. Another example 
is that of the boy or girl who is willing to help do a comrade’s share 
when the latter is sick or has a good excuse for not being present. 
Such instances come up frequently on hiking or camping trips. Kind- 
ness to birds and animals should also be encouraged. 
Unselfishness 
Unselfishness is the giving up of one’s own individual desires or 
comfort in order that others may be benefited. The playground 
gives plenty of opportunity to develop this quality. Here the child 
cannot have his own way because there are others to be considered. 
An unselfish habit is being developed when the boy in scrub batting 
practice takes his place in the field and helps chase the ball for other 
batters. 
Friendliness 
If a friendly spirit pervades a group there can be play; and, vice 
versa, there can be no play if the spirit is a hostile one. Cooperation 
follows in the wake of a mutual, friendly impulse. The play leader 
should check the forward, obstinate, selfish children, help them to 
become good comrades, and at the same time try to encourage the 
backward and diffident children and draw them into the game. The 
strongest friendships of life are apt to be those that boys and girls 
have formed when playing together on the team. 
Truthfulness 
Truthfulness is outspoken regard for justice. It is a funda- 
mental quality. Truthful speech is the child’s first test of honesty. 
It is a preliminary step to loyalty. For this reason the gang and 
the game demand truthful dealings among the members, and their 
verdict is impressive when this requirement is broken. The Boy 
Scout is trusted upon his honor, and this is far more binding upon 
him than the fear of parental or school discipline would be. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
346 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
pledge of honor pledges his self-respect at the same time. The duty 
of the playground is to extend this sense of honor so that it will reach 
out beyond the gang and hold elsewhere. 
Justice 
Good examples of justice come up every day on the playground. 
It is through the influence of this ideal as taught by efficient directors 
that larger children will await their turns at the swing or other 
popular piece of apparatus, instead of roughly pushing the weaker 
ones aside, as is apt to be the case on the unsupervised playground. 
Justice means that everyone receives the reward or punishment that 
is his due. 
Honesty 
Honesty is the compliance with the rules and standards of fair 
play. A game that is won through cheating or falsifying will never 
give the satisfaction that a game won on its merits will do. That 
is one punishment. Playing a ‘‘ringer’”’ is dishonest. Some teams are 
taught to try to injure a star player of the other side. As our ethics 
of fair play now exist we are too apt to think as the ancient Spartans 
did when they sent out their boys to steal, that the evil does not exist 
in the act itself but rather in being caught in the act. ° If this is to be 
the spirit of play, why the inconsistency of having rules, wherein the 
side which lives up to them is the loser? 
Thoughtfulness 
This is illustrated at a game between two schools, when one 
group rises and stands in respect while the other is singing its school 
song. Among little children thoughtfulness is fostered by seeing that 
certain children are not favored too much, as is apt to happen in 
“choosing games,” where the favorite will get too many chances un- 
less consideration is exercised in the dropping of the handkerchief 
or other signal of choice. 
Generosity 
This quality implies the giving beyond that-which is required or 
expected. An example is as follows: there is on record the actual 
case of a Canadian soccer team that was much too strong for the 
American college team sent to play them. Instead of humiliating the 
weaker players by running up as large a score as possible, the home 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 347 
team pointed out the mistakes of the American boys, and, as the 
game went on, gave them many helpful suggestions. 
Courtesy 
There is plenty of opportunity to display the many courtesies of 
life when a visiting team comes on the playground. Often the 
visitors will want to ask questions, or have preliminary practice, or 
visit certain spots of interest in the neighborhood. The home chil- 
dren can help to send all strangers away with the feeling that they 
want to reciprocate the favors when the chance is offered. 
Service 
Service is the willing contribution of one’s best abilities at all 
times. Every child should have the innate pride to want to do his 
part without needing to be prompted. Service may be rendered not 
only in the cause of the game, but by keeping the playground 
orderly, and one’s own personal appearance neat as well. 
Tolerance 
Tolerance goes beyond the spirit of friendliness in bringing to- 
gether unlike elements. The spirit of tolerance is shown at its best 
at a social center when peoples of all races and creeds mingle to- 
gether, with the friendly purpose that all have in common strong 
enough to offset all other antipathies there may be. Foreign recrea- 
tion leaders say that play is breaking down the caste barriers in India. 
During the early part of the war, the authorities had to put a stop 
to the playing of games between the English and German soldiers be- 
tween the trenches, for it was found that the play broke down the 
spirit of enmity. 
Sociability 
Much of one’s success and pleasure in life is due to the ability to 
meet easily and enjoyably with other people, to be at home when 
thrown into-asso¢iation with people outside of one’s ordinary circle 
—_—of-acquaintances.-With this type of disposition as an asset, many 
persons make a success with only an indifferent knowledge of their 
profession; without this easy manner a person must have a know- 
ledge of the subject that is far above the average in order to offset the 
advantage that his rival’s personal magnetism has endowed him with. 
Play develops the friendly spirit. The social intercourse that is
-P-A-G-E-356
  348 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
brought about tends to blot out any self-consciousness that there may 
be, and to check the tendency which the solitary child has to become 
spoiled through introspection and liberty to satisfy any chance whim. 
The association with many other kinds of temperament is bound to 
make one more liberal and broadminded, just as the city man is less 
narrow in his views than the man from an isolated community, who is 
apt to be designated as “‘provincial.”” The chance that the English 
schools offer for comradeship and play does help in the producing 
of fine young men, who have a good understanding of other men, 
and who are endowed with a capacity for leadership and a sense of 
justice that makes them excellent administrators in the colonies and 
for Britain herself in times of crisis. In our own schools it is certain 
that book knowledge alone does not make for success. Many 
.students fail after leaving college for the reason that they have 
neglected the important education of meeting and dealing with other 
people. Play and participation in other social activities of the 
school gives a training in human nature and a good preparation for 
success in the practical affairs of life. 
Conclusion 
The social ideals are taught the average individual from child- 
hood. The teaching should be carried on unceasingly at home, in 
school, and at play. The supervised playground has assumed a good 
share of the responsibility. 
It is all important that the men and women in charge of the play- 
ground be altruistic in spirit, and of the type of leadership that com- 
mands respect and emulation on the part of the child. There is one 
big advantage to start with in the teaching of such ideals as we have 
been discussing. We know from a study of heredity that the senti- 
ments for good have survived and grown stronger in the history of 
the human race; that with each new generation the instincts for kind- 
ness, sympathy, etc., are stronger, and therefore more easily de- 
veloped. With the capacity for good found in the child as his in- 
heritance, the important thing is that the environment, which includes 
the teacher, be the proper one. The effectiveness of the proper 
. supervision of these instincts is well proven by the good sportsman- 
ship of the school athletic teams from the far East: from China, 
Japan, and the Philippines. These Oriental countries have had 
supervised play from the very beginning—the games have been 
learned under such close supervision that the behavior of both the 
teams and crowds is good; losing is not taken so hard, because the
-P-A-G-E-357
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 349 
element of winning has not been’so greatly emphasized. American 
teachers face a more difficult problem, because the play movement, 
when once started, got under such momentum as to pass beyond con- 
trol and many wrong ideals became the guiding ones. ‘To-day these 
must be changed. The teacher is the main instrument. Sportsman- 
ship should be considered more vital than winning. It should be 
considered in the grading of points for athletic ability. Certain it is 
that the sympathetic and social sides of the child should be de- 
veloped, as it can be foreseen that without them, the development of 
such qualities as initiative, courage, determination, etc., might be 
disastrous. 
In the inculcating of habits of sportsmanship a few practical 
things should be noted. In the first place, there is the importance of 
making the players acquainted with the rules of the game, for ignor- 
ance of the rules leads to unfair play by one side and the other side 
tries to retaliate. Secondly, the officials should be competent, for 
their mistakes arouse ill feeling and the defeated team will not be 
satisfied that it has been beaten by better play. 
Play Develops the Civic Qualities Ee 
The civic qualities are those which deal with organized society 
and its institutions. They overlap the social qualities very closely, 
but do not develop until later when the age of reason is well ad- 
vanced. It is not until after the child has been taught his social 
obligations to a group in which the members are immediately present 
with him, that he can be taught a correct attitude towards the more 
complex groups of society. An ability to think in the abstract is re- 
quired, for the youth (as he is now) must become loyal to ideals. 
The society of which he now realizes himself to be a part, is larger 
than his own immediate environment. Therefore, he must visualize 
it and account for his relations to it. The team games expand the 
qualities which were learned as applying to one’s conduct and 
attitude toward the ‘‘gang.” Team action is larger than individual 
action. Previously the individual mapped out his own actions in ac- 
cordance with the rules of the game; but now he must abide by a 
_larger will—that of the group. 
Loyalty 
Loyalty is a trait as old as human history. It demands the spirit 
of self-sacrifice, of unity in ideals, and of public spirit and pride. In
-P-A-G-E-358
350 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
primitive times it was considered the most important of all tribal 
virtues. Even an enemy despises the traitor. Loyalty makes the 
individual member of a team feel that the organization is bigger and 
greater than his own personal self. It includes good faith—decep- 
tion among team mates would disintegrate the whole; service— 
everyone must do his bit, and sacrifice any purely personal desires; 
and kindness—for there must be encouragement to the weaker mem- 
bers of the team, and there are mistakes to be:condoned. 
The more fully organized the team, the more powerful is the 
feeling of loyalty. This spirit is carried beyond the players them- 
selves. The competitive sports of school bring about a loyal feeling 
that is commonly called “‘school spirit,” and it is analogous to the 
patriotism of a nation at war. For this reason the courage and de- 
votion of the player for his school clothes him in the glamour and 
sentiment of the patriot at war; the student body follows the for- 
tunes of the team, whether playing at home or abroad, akin to the 
way a national spirit backs up the army engaged in strife. Too often 
loyalty ceases when the team is a losing one. When loyalty is of the 
sterner type that persists in spite of reverses the word “morale” is 
often used. 
Loyalty has played an important part in the progress of the 
human race. The earliest expression was that of the family to its 
own immediate relatives. Then the group was enlarged to that 
of the clan, which comprised all persons claiming blood relationship. 
Later, different clans found it better to combine for purposes of 
mutual protection and subsistence. In this way the nation developed, 
as strong tribes reached out through conquest or other means. To- 
day nations are combining into larger units, the purpose of these 
larger leagues being the prevention of war and the cause of humanity 
in general. 
Just as history shows loyalty developing from that of the family 
to that of the nation, so to-day we find the same progression in the de- 
velopment of loyalty to the team or gang, then to the school, and 
later to one’s ideals, one’s religion, one’s associates, and one’s 
country. Play paves the way. 
Cooperation 
Cooperation is a term often confused with loyalty, but the mean- 
ing is not so broad. Loyalty includes cooperation always; but co- 
operation may be separate from loyalty. For instance, disloyal indi-
-P-A-G-E-359
  
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 351 
viduals may be coerced into cooperation, as is found in the autocratic 
type of discipline. Here there is clearly no need for loyalty and the 
definition of cooperation becomes more explicit. Loyalty is of the 
type that demands something of the ideal; cooperation, however, 
may or may not aspire toward the ideal. Cooperation of the highest 
type is found in games. The team and each of its members are 
mutually dependent upon each other. The team is a cooperative liv- 
ing whole; it is possible to know each member separately without 
knowing the team; and conversely, it is possible to know the team 
without knowing a single individual within the body. The breaking 
down of one of the parts of a team injures the whole. It is this 
mutual interdependence that is called cooperation. Cooperation 
leads up to loyalty and morale. 
The more completely organized the team, the more powerful is 
the need of cooperation, and the greater the demand on the individ- 
ual player that he perform his part, even though it means personal 
sacrifice and the giving up of some coveted hope. The grandstand 
player is always discouraged on the play field. The popular team- 
mate harnesses his own individualism and self-assertion for the 
team’s own good. There is cooperation in the scrub game, but the 
need for self-inhibition is less intense. The good results that are 
forthcoming from a permanent organization, however, are shown 
when teams made up of mediocre players can meet and defeat a team 
of star players gathered together for the occasion. The scrub team 
shows more individual skill, but less cohesion. The play that leads toa 
sensational run in football calls for help in the way of a good pass of 
the ball by the center, good blocking by the line so that the play may 
get a good start, and good interference by the runners accompanying 
the player with the ball so that he may be shielded. 
It is important that every boy and girl should play, and in their 
games gradually work from simple to extensive cooperation, for it 
is a quality needed in every walk of life to-day. There is coopera- 
tion in buying and maintaining the common necessities of life: there 
are the many processes of making raw material into the finished 
article; marketing the article—wholesaler to retailer; the final pur: 
chase by the consumer; and the delivery by the teamster or the 
driver. Another type of example is the case of people cooperating 
in a municipality by paying taxes for a large library accessible to all 
instead of having many small personal libraries. Cooperation is 
indeed being applied more and more to business and professional life 
as activities become more and more specialized. |

352 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY. 
Freedom 
Freedom is the ideal that emphasizes individual worth and impor- 
tance. With freedom secured, mS gets a fair chance. The de- 
_ velopment of our own freedom and opportunity can be traced back 
‘to the primitive tribes settling in England. These had local 
assemblies for free discussion and a council of wise men and a chief 
of their own choice. The Magna Charta, Bill of Rights, and other 
guarantees of personal privileges were forced upon rulers who tried 
to suppress the ideal of liberty. Freedom of person and thought 
are two of the things that have made America a land of the free, 
the haven of the oppressed, and the refuge of all creeds. 
‘The ideal of freedom has not always had the same gradual ex- 
pansion that it found with the Anglo-Saxon peoples. The French 
Revolution and the Russian Revolution show the extremes to which 
people who have been oppressed will go for this end. The trouble 
with such violent rebellions, however, is that the gainers of the newly- 
found freedom do not realize that they must have law at the same 
time to preserve this freedom. ‘There must be preparation for 
freedom. Many college youths are spoiled because they have never 
had a chance before leaving home to be free and act on their own 
resources. Another parallel is found on the playground. It is the 
Hungarian, the Pole, or the Russian Jew who is the disturbing factor 
in the maintenance of discipline. These nationalities have never had 
any practice in self-discipline, not even any experience in team play, 
and when allowed free rein they become most unruly and disorderly. 
To make orderly citizens of this material is a hope that the play- 
ground is striving to realize—to teach them that there is a necessity 
for law along with freedom. 
The child has more freedom to-day than ever before. In olden 
days he was disciplined as a slave, and corporal punishment was the 
expected thing at home and at school. _ To-day this type of discipline 
is seldom found; instead, there is the discipline of persuasion, of 
example, of loyalty, of praise and blame, and of self-government. 
All these find application in the playground game. That self-govern- 
ment often wins when coercion from above will not, is proven by 
many cases of incorrigible youngsters who become law-abiding when 
they reach the team age and are given practice in team games. 
The freedom of democracy and of team play requires a free 
chance for all, lawfulness, and leadership. The best man wins the 
place on the team; for the group, naturally wishing to win, acts 
through its most capable members. Partiality would be ruinous, just
-P-A-G-E-361
  
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 353 
as bribes or illegal votes destroy the freedom of citizenship. The 
team elects its own leader, obeys orders, and expects its members to 
be assigned to various positions by him. In the real test they allow 
him temporary autocratic privileges, so that quick decision may be 
brought about. 
Obedience 
The necessity of obedience is forcefully brought out in play. In 
early childhood the obedience is apt to be influenced by external com- 
pulsion such as that coming from the teacher, but as the games 
develop into complicated team play, the spirit. of self-government 
grows among all those competing. Then it is that the player learns 
the advantage of law as he will use it when a citizen. In early his- 
tory the ordinary man had little to do with the making of the laws; 
‘he was forced to obey the laws of despots. Every time that rules 
were written down (like the laws of Moses, Draco, the Twelve 
Tables, and-our own Declaration of Independence) a concession 
was gained, as even tyrants hesitated at breaking rules that were 
definitely known. In democracy the rules have been made by the 
people and for the people. Freedom is allowed to the extent that 
it will not injure or transgress the same rights to others. A certain 
amount of law is necessary for the common good, otherwise there 
would be anarchy and no man’s life or property would be safe. But 
the restraint is a willing one, for the person remains under it of his 
own accord. The comparison can be extended in every sense to 
games: there is the same necessity for rules, otherwise the game 
would cease to be a game; and there is the same spirit of obedience, 
for when a boy plays in a game he tacitly agrees that the rules are 
satisfactory. If he wishes to belong to the gang, he must conform to 
the rules of the gang. 
The need of obedience to the game is seen in many ways. There 
must be obedience to the teacher or coach. Refusing to follow the 
coach’s instruction loses games—one can easily imagine what the 
result would be if every player disregarded the coach and followed 
his own personal inclinations. There would be no unified course of 
action at all. Again, there must be obedience to the rules. The rules 
have penalties for being broken. Any player who draws a penalty is 
injuring the cause of the team as a whole. Still again, there is the 
obedience to the training, which, if broken, breaks up the cooperative 
success once more. 
Obedience and discipline, therefore, are just as necessary as free- 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  354 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
dom and initiative. When a group is working in common it is neces- 
sary to have rules; not only rules but the means of enforcement, as 
the failure of the scrub game without an umpire goes to show. Boys 
or girls when camping out realize the need for rules so that each 
person will do a fair share of the work. Our games are wisely 
planned in that they make the penalties more severe for intentional 
infractions than in the case of the accidental misplays. 
Morality 
This is brought about in the immediate sense by giving healthful 
expression to motor restlessness. Varied and wholesome play 
interests will do this. It is not when children are at play that they 
plan mischief and vice; rather, it is during the moments when they 
are idle—their loafing times. Knowing the similarity of the play 
of the child to the work of the man, it is easy to account for the in- 
crease of crime in abnormal times when many people are out of em- 
ployment. With nothing to occupy the mind, men, filled with dis- 
contént, will gang together in destructive moods. It takes energy 
and daring to be the youthful gunman or the predatory gang; the 
play teacher, if respected, can direct these forces, admirable in them- 
selves, to worthy ends. 
Joseph Lee was thinking of the above truth when he said that 
“the boy without a playground is father to the man without a job.” 
One prominent judge quotes from his experiences the fact that 
95 per cent of the offenders that came before him had never had. 
the chance to play. One has only to study the reports of surveys put 
out by large cities to note the stress being put on this aspect of play; 
these reveal a proportionate decrease in the output of taxes 
for the punishment of crime as recreational facilities are increased. 
Experiences with backward races have shown that when uncivi- 
lized peoples become interested in play, their activities in gambling, 
head hunting, and other savage practices are gradually abandoned. 
‘Uncle Sam found this out when he took over the Philippines. He 
found out that organizing baseball and track competition between 
the different provinces increased the natives’ pride in their schools. 
While the giving of healthful, natural, and enjoyable play 
interests will be an immediate factor in the assisting of juvenile and 
adult morality, there is another essential of more remote nature, that 
must be taken into consideration. This is the character building to 
which play contributes. The psychologists tell us that instincts, if exer- 
cised, lead to habits. How important it should be that the instincts
-P-A-G-E-363
  
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 355 
concerned in moral living, i.c., self-restraint, decision, courage, self- 
control, determination, and will power should be exercised until they 
function involuntarily as habits. And again, a physical asset of play 
will help, for the muscles are the organs of the will. Strengthening 
the muscles means strengthening the will. Locke and Rousseau, 
17th century thinkers, aptly state this point. Locke says, ‘“‘Keep the 
body in strength and vigor, so that it may be able to obey and execute 
the orders of the mind.’ Rousseau says, ‘““The weaker the body is, 
the more it commands; the stronger it is, the better it obeys.” 
Optimism 
Happiness comes from a state of physical and mental well being. 
One needs good health to keep pace with his fellows. If he is unable 
to work with them or play with them, there is keen disappointment, 
because man is a social being. If he is troubled with a weak heart or 
lungs, he cannot share any physical quest with them—he must follow 
their play from the bleachers, and in time of war he must stay at 
home. If he is a dyspeptic, he is unable to share their festivities, and 
banqueting is one of the ways in which man has always been able to 
satisfy his gregarious instincts. If he has nervous trouble or 
insomnia, he is unrefreshed and worried; and these are two states 
of being that are enemies to a-full joy in life. It follows that the 
pleasure of social fellowship is stinted to the same degree that there 
is ill health. Play’s contribution to health has already been dis- 
cussed. 
Optimism consists of pleasurable emotional reactions bringing 
contentment in the present and hope for the future. If sound health 
is one necessity, the possession of the play spirit is the other. The 
play spirit can likewise be trained. The statement of James that 
play is a human instinct, which if trained, becomes a habit, and which 
if neglected, becomes disused and dies away, is backed up by many 
studies in the biological field. An example of this is found in the 
young duckling which, if kept from the water, later shows no 
desire to swim; and the young squirrel which is caged and, finding no 
place to bury nuts, loses the instinct to do so; and the young chick, 
which, if it does not have the chance to follow its mother the first 
week or so, will not do so later. 
The play spirit of youth carries over into the work of the adult. 
Play prepares for the work of later life by training the boy or girl 
to do willingly the many disagreeable things that come up in play, for 
the sake of the greater end to be attained. On the other hand, the

boy or girl who is denied the chance to play, who is sent to work in 
the factories or the mines at an early age, has a hopeless outlook 
for later life—the chances are that through being denied his child- 
hood, he has been deprived of the chance to find the work which for 
him has the most percentage of play contained init. A “blind alley” 
job makes the mal-content; for the only offset to this hopelessness, 
the spirit of play to carry over into his leisure hours, will not have 
been learned. Tired out from a type of labor which is drudgery, 
the individual often goes to the extreme of recklessness in his pas- 
times and indulges in the lower types. Amusements of the passive 
type such as the card game, the pool room, the vamp moving picture 
show, and formerly the saloon, give an after-effect which is de- 
pressing rather than exhilarating. The playground and social center 
are trying to create the play spirit and take it into the work 
and into the recreation of later life. Contrast the after-effect of 
children’s play, of outdoor play and recreation, with the passive 
types mentioned above. There is mental relaxation instead of 
nervous tension, a contact with the best traits of human nature in- 
stead of the worst, and a reaction that soothes and quiets, and tones 
up the whole nervous system. _/ Play certainly does help towards con- 
tentment, pleasure in human society, faith in human nature, and 
optimism in the daily life. _ 
Conclusion: The Ideal Play Situation 
It would be foolish to expect that all these qualities will be 
possessed in a noticeable degree by any one person. However, if 
no ideal is held up then there is no incentive for improvement. The 
point is, that unless the different qualities are recognized and under- 
stood, they cannot be striven for as objectives in our scheme of edu- 
cation, which includes the moral guidance of the child. The teacher 
of play has a great responsibility in shaping the characters of the 
children entrusted to his care; and he must know society’s estimate 
and standard of good character if he attempts to be a directing force. 
Play is by no means the only method by which character can be 
developed. It cannot be said that those whose childhood has been 
robbed of play will fail to become good citizens; they may receive 
their moral training in some other way. The French and Japanese, 
for instance, teach morality to their school children by text books, 
instead of through physical activity. It must be remembered, how- 
ever, that the lives of the little children in these countries are more
-P-A-G-E-365
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION B57 
restricted than in our own. The almost unlimited freedom that the 
average American youngster possesses means that a self-discipline 
must be developed along with it. Play teaches him to curb this 
freedom for the common good. The ideal situation to develop a 
proper understanding of right standards of conduct is the one where 
the play field supplements the schoolroom, acting as a laboratory or 
testing place where the child can experience the lessons of his books. 
The abstract then is demonstrated in the concrete; the moral truth is 
seen as an actuality. Play furnishes innumerable such object lessons. 
The love of play is so strongly instinctive in the child that he 
responds naturally and easily to the lessons that are continually aris- 
ing in his play. The fact that his whole interest is centered in this 
attractive activity, further helps to drive the lesson home. In spon- 
taneous action there is opportunity to develop traits that are sup- 
pressed while the child is under the discipline of the classroom. 
Wholesome play -furnishes a rich field for the development of 
character in the same manner that a certain soil will grow the 
healthiest plants; and similarly as the plant that is cultivated by an 
experienced gardener will thrive better than the uncultivated one, so 
the boy and girl will develop better if they can feel the proper in- 
fluences of leadership and direction. 
However, play of itself cannot be expected to develop the right 
type of moral qualities—it merely furnishes the opportunity for their 
development. If undirected or under improper leadership, the 
tendency may be in exactly the opposite direction. Play can just as 
easily teach dishonesty as it can teach honesty. Always the standard

  INJURIOUS PLAY (VICE) 
nn cet as 
Vice is the name given to amusements that injure the health and 
destroy the ambition of those who engage in them. The three forms 
that have done the most harm are drug “habits, sex vice, and 
gambling. They do not exist, as was once supposed, because people 
are ‘naturally vicious, nor because the vices are in themselves so very 
attractive; people engage in vice because they do not know any better 
forms of play to engage in and because these vices are made to 
appear pleasant and attractive by the promoters, who surround them 
with all kinds of luxurious allurements in order to make large profits 
from them. To get rid of vice and the havoc it plays in life, it is 
necessary to do three things: (1) teach everybody the simple facts x
-P-A-G-E-366
  358 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
as to the nature of vice and the harm it does; (2) stop the active 
promotion of vice by those who make money from it; (3) promote 
wholesome play activities extensively enough to take the place of it 
as a recreation. 
Drug Habits 
The use of tobacco, opium, cocaine, and alcohol are the most 
common drug habits, and of these drugs alcohol has easily been the 
worst in its total effects. For a very long time mankind looked upon 
alcohol as a wonderful and unmixed blessing, giving the drinker 
health, strength, a clear mind, and a protection against every ill. 
Now we know from more extended and careful observation that 
alcohol does nothing of the kind. A moderate dose makes the 
drinker weaker, slower, less accurate in moving and in thinking, and 
tends to break down his sense of honor and responsibility. The be- 
lief in its virtue arises from the temporary effect it has of making one 
feel stronger and more capable than he really is. Sailors exposed 
to cold have always believed that a swig of rum helps to keep them 
warm, when the fact is that it gives a feeling of warmth only by send- 
ing the blood to the skin, which makes them all the more liable to 
serious chilling of the body. Men have always believed that they 
could make a better after-dinner speech with the aid of a few glasses 
of wine, but they are led to think so because their critical judgment is 
dulled and they say things they would ordinarily consider foolish; 
the hearers applaud because they are under the same influence. In- 
stead of curing disease, alcohol is now known to be a predisposing 
factor leading to disease, especially to tuberculosis and pneumonia, 
the two greatest causes of death. Physicians have little hope for the 
recovery of a case of either of these or diabetes if the subject has 
been addicted to alcohol. 
Sex Vice 
By breaking down the sense of responsibility and making one 
care only for the pleasure of the moment, alcohol leads to sex vice 
and gambling. Through sex vice the gruesome venereal diseases— 
syphilis and gonorrhea—are perpetuated and transmitted, and it is 
therefore responsible for the existence of these diseases and the un- 
told suffering they produce. Every individual who is addicted to 
sexual vice assumes a big chance of acquiring venereal disease and 
blighting with it the lives of wife or husband and children, at the 
same time handing the contagion down to later generations. There
-P-A-G-E-367
  PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION — 359 
are so many in our population who are either feeble-minded or hope- 
lessly selfish, and these may so easily contaminate the innocent, that 
society stands little chance of getting rid of this plague without some 
measures like those that were taken in the United States Army. All 
men found on examination to have venereal disease were not only 
severely disciplined but were quarantined and treated in a hospital 
until no longer able to infect others.. The plan soon made the army 
more free from the disease than is the civil population, and the need 
of similar plans in every community was thus shown. 
Gambling 
Gambling is staking money on some game or event, the result of 
which is uncertain. Lotteries, race-track gambling, bucket shops, 
and several other forms have been prohibited, because they are so 
palpably hishonest. Betting on a fight or a football game appears 
like a fair bargain until you realize that each is trying and expecting 
to get the property of the other without giving anything in return. 
A debt of this kind cannot be collected by law, because the courts do 
not recognize a bet as a legitimate business transaction. The 
gambler, like the thief, is a parasite on society, producing nothing, 
creating nothing, yet managing to get the property that belongs to 
others by strategy, without incurring the danger that there is in steal- 
ing it. H. E. Reed in his textbook on Salesmanship, says: ‘“‘Gam- 
bling and speculation are wrong, not because they involve chance, but 
because they violate the first common principles of common honesty 
and good salesmanship, namely, that a fair bargain must benefit both 
parties.” 
\ The player who bets on his own game is the worst type of pro- 
fessional athlete, for it gives him a mercenary interest in winning far 
beyond anything the salaried player has. The growing habit of 
betting on games proves how little the college students understand it. 
The Michigan Daily (University of Michigan student publication) 
for November 18, 1921, points out that betting opens the doors to 
professional gamblers, who are quick to swarm to a college town 
where betting is widespread in the desire for easy money, and that it 
is apt to be the professional gambler who taunts the student that he is 
not showing proper support for his team unless he is willing to put up 
his money on the game. It says further that worst of all is-the 
effect of betting on the team, for nothing else so quickly disintegrates 
the sportsmanship of winners, losers, and spectators. 
Betting cannot be justified. Betting on a sure thing is plain steal-
-P-A-G-E-368
360 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
ing, and in any other case it is trying to take advantage of the op- 
ponent’s ignorance to get his property away from him. The evils 
of betting are far-reaching in their consequence, as the histories of 
so many case of defaulting and suicide go to por Society gains 
by discouraging all forms of gambling. 
PROHIBITION 
The first steps toward a reform of popular habits of amusement 
were taken many years ago in the enactment of prohibitory laws 
against the promotion of sex vice, gambling, and, later, against the 
saloon. Attacks are constantly being made on these prohibitory 
laws, on the ground that they are not fully enforced and therefore 
do more harm than good, encouraging lawlessness. If we are to 
see this situation clearly we must keep two things in mind: first, 
laws against murder and robbery are never fully enforced, yet no 
one clamors to have them repealed; second, the prohibitory laws 
against vices are fairly well directed and enforced. It must be re- 
membered that they do not aim to suppress vice directly and at once; 
what they prohibit is the public promotion of vice. Vice is too well 
fixed in the habits of many people to disappear at once; what we can, 
do is to stop the public exploitation of vice before the eyes of grow- 
ing youth. Only a few years ago the saloons on every main street 
held the temptation to drink before every city boy, but now those 
who are determined to have alcoholic liquor must get it secretly in 
places not open to the average youth. The complete suppression of 
vice cannot be seriously attempted, but the public promotion of vice 
can be prohibited, and except for occasional violations, be stamped 
out of the community life. 
PROMOTION OF PLAY 
It is right here, as an aid to the laws designed to check com- 
mercialized vice, that the play movement steps in and provides the 
part that was always lacking. Such laws alone cannot reform the 
play habits of a nation, being wholly negative and supplying nothing 
in the place of amusement that is forbidden. The active promotion 
of wholesome plays and games fills the place in an attractive way, 
and helps to do away, not only with the vice, but also with the other 
commercialized amusements that are worthless. The plays and 
games provided under public supervision furnish better fun, when 
once learned, than any vice can do. They are simply the kinds of 
recreation and play that have been found by experience to have a
-P-A-G-E-369
PLAY AND CHARACTER FORMATION 361 
wholesome and beneficial effect on the players, while vices are simply 
those found to be harmful and only existing that someone may make 
money from their promotion.

CHAPTER XVII 
PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 
x Play has become an integral part of our school system, the nation 
over. Certain plays and games are prescribed for the different 
grades with the same definiteness that courses in reading or mathe- 
matics are mapped out. Progressive states have outlined courses 
which they recommend for use in their schools. Some of the larger 
cities have done likewise. 
It is of practical import that the teacher who takes charge of 
the play programmes has a clear understanding of the intent and 
aims behind the planning of these courses; for it is a basic principle 
of pedagogy that whenever a transfer of power to mental or moral 
development is expected through any prescribed exercise, the teacher 
must keep before the pupil the desired accomplishment. For in- 
stance, if our schools hope to teach the child such qualities as honesty 
or loyalty, and use play as an agency in doing this, the play teacher 
must call attention to these points whenever object lessons are pre- 
sented in the games. A child will not learn such an asset as sports- 
manship from his play if the teacher does not stress this, and 
especially so, if no move is made in the way of condemning acts 
that are unsportsmanlike. 
Play Must Harmonize with School Aims 
‘If physical education resulted in development of the body only, 
then it could be separated from the rest of our school curriculum as 
a distinct department and allowed to work out its programme apart. 
But it so happens that the effects of physical exercise produce results 
mentally, morally, and socially as well, and care must be taken that 
the type of physical curriculum followed be in harmony with 
the ideals that the school curriculum is striving for. It is ridiculous 
to think that the development of the body is a separate thing from 
that of the mind. It is possible that a type of exercise could be so 
selected as to thwart entirely the educational aims of our schools* 
As said in the previous paragraph,“our sports as found in the schools 
362
-P-A-G-E-371
PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 363 
of to-day, unless taught and administered rightly, will develop un- 
desirable citizens rather than good ones. Happily, our type of 
physical leadership is improving, so that the gap between our ideals 
and their actual realization is steadily closing; but even yet the 
physical programme of our schools is too often considered without 
regard to the rest of the school programme. To get the most 
efficiency out of our educational system, the physical programme 
should be carried out in full harmony with the broader purposes of 
the school.x 
Play Has Always Adapted Itself to the National Ideal 
y There is plenty of proof to show that physical education will 
adapt itself to the purpose of our national ideal. Indeed, the type of 
civilization of any particular country can be found by investigating 
its mode of play. History affords convincing proof of this.¥ 
Ancient Greece wanted the well-balanced man, tending to neither 
extreme in the development of mind and body and in proportion 
between the two. The Greeks believed the body and mind to be co- 
workers, inseparable, and dependent on each other. Because their 
educational aim was aesthetic, the body was developed from the 
standpoint of beauty, grace, and symmetry. The result, intellectually, 
was to produce a beauty of mind never attained so universally by any 
other people. The perfection of their sculpture and architecture 
could not have been possible had they not worshiped beauty i in the 
lines of the human body. 
The Romans did not have such a lofty conception of physical 
training, and we find it used for utilitarian purposes, subservient to 
their aims of conquest. To make war, rugged soldiers were needed, 
so that the nature of the exercises taught their youth was necessarily 
martial. 
Following these we find a period in which the training of the 
human body had no place at all—the period of the Dark Ages. The 
ambition of man’s life was entirely a spiritual one—to be a recluse. 
The body was considered as absolutely independent of the mind, and 
in comparison was looked upon as so inferior as to be despised. 
That the body is not separate from the mind is shown conclusively by 
the barrenness of this age in the way of intellectual contribution to 
human progress. The world emerged from this medieval darkness 
only by going back to borrow from the ancients—to find there the 
foundation for building anew—and so bodily training was resur- 
rected to fashion itself to the new work.
-P-A-G-E-372
  364 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
In our own life of to-day, two great conflicting ideals regarding 
government developed to the point of conflict. ‘ The first, autocracy, 
exalted the state; the second, democracy, exalted the individual. 
Both utilized physical exercise to their needs; the former, con- 
sciously, because it saw in this the chance to build up its nation in 
physique, and at the same time make its subjects submissive, disci- 
plined, and machine-like; the latter, unconsciously, because in follow- 
ing the ideals of freedom, it allowed free choice in its subjects, which 
meant that the exercise followed was in keeping with the natural out- 
let of the youth. No nation has ever been more successful than 
autocratic Germany in making its educational system—of which 
physical training was a very important part—serve its national aims. 
At the same time that we wonder at the marvelous system of gym- 
nastics, the universal play interest worked up in it, and its efficiency 
in getting the desired results, we must necessarily feel disappointed 
that the splendidness of this accomplishment was used to ends that 
were perverted. 
DEMOCRACY OF GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATION: ITS MEANING 
Victorious democracy has remained as the path by which world 
civilization shall follow its destiny. Whereas autocracy demands un- 
questioned leaders and submissive followers, democracy calls for 
equals who bow only to the leadership of men of their own group 
who have merited their selection through superior capabilities. 
There is no impossible gap between leader and follower in de- 
mocracy. ‘Therefore, there need be no separate schools for the 
training of leader and follower. Instead, there must be one system 
of schools in which all start out with equal advantage, on the same 
mark, if one wishes to call it so, in preparation for life’s work. This 
does away with caste advantage of birth. By making the schools 
free, the caste of wealth is likewise discarded. America has the 
slogan “Equality of Opportunity” which would seem to indicate that 
all our youth in common go through a standardized curriculum, to 
be graduated as a standardized product. This is true only to that 
age where the children begin to show pronounced diversity in capa- 
bilities and interests. At this point in our educational programme 
there is need for a wide range of studies, with free election to a 
certain extent, so that the pupil can be given a chance to develop his 
aptitudes for growth along natural lines. This is true democracy of 
education: first, to give free and equal opportunity; and second, to 
consider the individual differences in pupils, so as to allow equal
-P-A-G-E-373
  
  PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 3365 
opportunity when the time for specialization comes. It would not be 
democratic to have one uniform curriculum all through our school 
system when we know that all children are not alike in their tastes 
and talents, and knows that at a certain age these talents are 
accentuated and call out for expression. That is why recent years 
have seen many new courses, mostly vocational in nature, added to 
the school subjects, whereas formerly the old classical programme 
stood supreme. At the same time it must be remembered that this 
freedom of election must be somewhat restricted, as there are many 
things which democratic citizens must possess in common, such as 
language, ideals, and social relationships. 
The Relation of Play To Democracy 
The first procedure in the way of adapting play to our existing 
educational system is to give all children the same advantages. This 
means that all start out with a uniform programme, and then at the 
age when the child is allowed some freedom of election in his studies, 
allow him the same choice in his physical exercise. The latter choice 
can only be possible by offering a rich and diversified programme; 
and yet, at the same time, there are certain exercises that should be 
taken by all. It cannot be said that the programme of play at 
present has been made as universal or as diversified as it should be. 
The Part Played by the Two Types of Athletic Sport 
Nothing has been said as yet about the type of play exercise that 
should predominate. Democracy and athletic games and sports 
have always gone hand in hand, but the type of democracy has de- 
termined the type of games. The earlier republics of Athens and 
Rome were so limited in size that all citizens could meet together in 
person at their assemblies. This explains the origin of such indi- 
vidualistic types of athletics as running, jumping, weight throwing, 
Marathon runs, javelin throws, riding, swimming, dancing, gym- 
nastic stunts, and the like. In all these there is found the specializa- 
tion that goes with democracy; but it is a development of the indi- 
vidual entirely alone—if he failed in his development, it would not 
directly affect the success of his fellows. But the modern democra- 
cies have become too large and cumbersome for all the citizens to 
meet together in common assembly, and the principle of representa- 
tion has been evolved. This brings in the necessity for selection and 
cooperation.
-P-A-G-E-374
366 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
It is interesting to note that as the type of democracy changed in 
England, there was a parallel change in the type of athletics— 
from the individualistic to the team sports. ‘Team games, which are 
the delight of democratic peoples to-day, demand not only that the 
individual play his own part well, but that he must relate his part 
to a larger whole, because the team is more than the individuals that 
compose it—it has a personality of its own; it is an organic unity or 
whole where the breaking down of one part breaks down the work 
of all the parts. Once more we have the striking evidence of the 
adaptability of physical education to the progress of society. 
American Sports Reflect Distinctive National Traits 
Modern democracy favors the team games; yet there is still a 
distinction in the spirit as well as the form of competition, because 
the great liberty-loving nations of to-day differ in their organizaticn, 
in their traditions, and in their ideals. Our nation is least of all 
affected by traditions and the spirit of the past. That is the reason 
why its opportunities are the greatest. Because of the richness of 
the opportunities afforded, the encouraging chances for future great- 
ness in any line of work, the average American youth is early taught 
the vision of success. So imbued is he with the spirit of ambition 
that it finds expression in his games. The end in his sports is to win 
—to be successful. This excessive zeal to win brings in many 
ruthless tactics found in the competition of big business. The games 
have an intensity not found in those of any other nation; and more 
than in the case of any other national sports, our games depend upon 
methods, training, and coaching—all of them elements of success. 
We can never take away from American athletic games the desire 
to win, but we can so control them through standards of sportsman- 
ship and fair play that they will teach a better spirit of mutual 
friendliness than has been the case in the past, and inculcate a more 
sympathetic spirit for later life. People who are apt to criticize our 
athletics too severely should realize that at present, American foot- 
ball, baseball, and basket ball give the kind of training that our 
present ideal of democratic citizenship calls for—they are an index 
of our national life. As athletics improve, improvement in our 
citizenship will naturally follow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 367 
What are the Qualities our Schools must Develop? 
It would seem, then, that if natural play and rugged games grew 
up along with modern democracy and education, that such a type of 
exercise should constitute the bulwark of our physical education 
programme. Democracy prizes a type of character in its citizens 
that is energetic, self-reliant, resourceful, and social. Play, espe- 
cially the competitive type, promotes these democratic ideals; it 
teaches the individual self-initiative, alertness, ingenuity, self- 
reliance, self-control, will power, courage, persistence, and conscious- 
ness of individual worth—all of which are the qualities needed for 
individual success under democratic opportunity; and, to serve the 
individual’s relation to society, it promotes loyalty, cooperation, re- 
spect for the rights of others, respectful submission to a chosen 
leadership, and the many qualities of sportsmanship—and all these 
are the civic and social virtues desired in a patriotic citizenship. 
And, in addition, play gives the kind of bodily vigor that is 
in keeping with the same aims. Our type of government, being 
peaceful, and lacking in the idea of aggrandisement through military 
means, desires health, vital power, and physical adaptability, rather 
than a strength which is promised future use only in a military way. 
The adaptability that play gives was shown by the quickness and 
effectiveness with which non-military nations like Great Britain and 
the United States fashioned their ordinary citizens into a soldiery 
possessing unconquerable bravery and morale. 
The School Divisions and Play 
Play and the Elementary School 
In order to turn out as a finished product the kind of citizen our 
democracy desires, our school system has found it best to sub-divide 
itself into three branches, the elementary, the secondary or high 
school, and the college. Recently there has been added a fourth— 
the Junior high school. It is evident that if play can adapt itself 
to our school system as a whole, it can likewise be adapted to each 
of these subdivisions. Let us take up each of these in turn, showing 
how play should be organized for best results. 
In turning to the elementary school, we find its purpose defined 
by leading educators as follows: The elementary school should deal 
with the tools by which knowledge is to be gained—in other words, 
the three R’s. A sound foundation in the fundamentals is the main
-P-A-G-E-376
  368 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
concern. The child learns the simple words of the home and the 
streets, and is taught to use them through his reading, writing, and 
spelling. His addition and subtraction are the first steps to problems 
of everyday commercial nature. Mastery of these rudiments allows 
him to progress in the field of knowledge. The mental, moral, and 
physical powers should all be considered. The moral training should 
be along the lines of the simple social virtues, such as truthfulness, 
kindness, honesty, and unselfishness. There should be no thought of 
specialization at this age, as everything is equally interesting and 
equally yields incentives to activity. 
Such a programme can have physical education adapted to it 
very easily, because all normal children need the same activities, 
which are the fundamental ones. When one examines the physical 
programme covering the elementary grades, he will be impressed by 
the likeness of the principles governing play to those above men- 
tioned when considering the larger aims. The child’s lack of power 
of consecutive attention causes a desire for a great variety of play 
activities. The play is entirely individualistic; not until the seventh 
and eighth grades do we find the cooperative element creeping in, 
and then only to a small degree. There is no thought of specializa- 
tion; instead, the child wants to flit from game to game, never being 
interested more than twenty minutes or so in one activity. Just as 
he has a lot of different classes in his schoolroom work, so he has 
desires for a lot of play activities, with short periods of interest de- 
voted to each. We might say that the child is going through the 
process of acquiring the tools by which he may attain physical de- 
velopment. He is covering the whole field of physical activity in its 
rudiments. All kinds of exercise are almost equally interesting, as 
the special aptitudes have not yet begun to develop. So we find free 
play, marching, light calisthenics, dancing, and singing all made use 
of in showing the child the world of physical activity in its bigness. 
From the fifth to the eighth grades, interest in track and field events 
and in efficiency tests is very strong; and in the seventh and eighth 
grades the relay sports, remotely requiring the team sense, and the 
games of soccer, volley ball, indoor baseball, all of which call for 
only a slight degree of specialization, appear. 
Play and the Junior High School 
Because the criticism has been voiced for some time that the 
eight year elementary school is longer than is necessary for the 
work to be accomplished, there has arisen the demand for the Junior 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 369 
high school. It is generally considered that six years are enough 
to devote to the tools of education; therefore, in most schools, the 
Junior high school begins with the seventh grade and continues 
through the ninth. The aim of the Junior high school is to occupy 
an intermediate stage, to make an easier transition between the 
elementary and high schools. It aims to take care of the special 
needs of the adolescent age—also a transitory period. During this 
period the pupil departs from the memory and drill work of the 
preceding years, and he desires to use the things he has learned, in 
an expression of his own personality. To meet this need, the school 
programme is therefore chosen with the purpose of drawing out 
and gradually developing the child’s latent power of organizing his 
ideas. The Junior high school best serves its purposes by offering 
general courses, such as general history or general science, with the 
idea of presenting introductory work to later, specialized courses. 
Other subjects that are introduced have the purpose of arousing a 
sense of social consciousness; such as, civics, hygiene, and elementary 
economics. 
Even before the schoolmen had made special provisions for this 
adolescent period, play had adjusted itself to it. The newly-born 
social consciousness is found in play in the desire for Boy Scout 
activities, in Y. M. C. A. Junior work, in relay races, and in simple 
team games where the cooperation needed is not complicated. The 
activities are all social, yet they are modified by the experiences of 
the extreme individualism in physical activities that preceded this 
stage. To keep in contact with the school aims, this period should 
be a transition period between the individualistic and the team activ- 
ity, and so it is. Just as the school periods are lengthened, so is the 
play interest in any one activity lengthened; just as the mental fatigue 
point is reached quickly, the physical fatigue point is reached quickly; 
and just as mental recuperation comes quickly, so does physical. 
These points must be considered in the arrangement of the play 
programmes; in soccer, for instance, there should be quarter periods 
instead of half, and the same applies to basket ball. The exercises 
should all have alternate periods of strenuous action, then rest. 
Another way in which the physical tastes are in keeping with the 
mental is that the children, instead of being treated in mass as 
possessing common interests, are divided up into smaller groups, 
whose work is differentiated: in the school, this results in depart- 
mental classes; and on the playground and in the gymnasium, the 
large class under one teacher is broken up into groups which will
-P-A-G-E-378
370 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
permit individual preferences, such as those resulting from sex, for 
example, which are now for the first time markedly appearing. It 
is certain that the Junior high school needs a gymnasium and an 
athletic field of its own, because it is this branch of our public schools 
that is introductory as far as the contests of our high schools and 
colleges are concerned. Here is where the child should receive a 
broad and general course covering all our team games (a smattering 
of each this may amount to), for certainly there should be no attempt 
yet at specialization in any one sport. 
Play and the Senior High School and College 
One branch of our public school system yet remains to be dis- 
cussed. That is the high school. Here we find the preferences of 
the pupils given more sway. The high school assumes that the child 
has been taught the common elements of life, and now he is allowed 
a chance to discover and develop his special aptitudes and powers. 
This is made possible through allowing a varied programme of 
studies, with some required work to be sure, but with a chance for 
the pupil to explore many fields and find where his talents lie. The 
wider the range of-courses, the more chance there is for the indi- 
vidual to find what he is cut out for. The value of subjects begins to 
correspond more to the relative degrees of interest aroused. Com- 
pulsory work in the high school does not give the same joy of 
achievement that experimentation does. It is found, however, that 
some studies in themselves uninteresting, will be concentrated upon 
if they offer stepping stones to the mastering of remoter aims. The 
high school devotes longer periods to each subject because it is found 
that the pupil, favoring certain subjects as he does, wishes to study 
these intensively. In short, the aim of the high school is to create 
in youth the power of making critical judgments, and relating these 
to the broader purposes of life. The aim is to prepare for social 
service without losing individual efficiency. With the social con- 
sciousness now fully matured, the school uses athletic games, 
dramatic clubs, musical organizations, and the like, as an integral 
part of its programme. 
Competitive athletics is so closely related to the aims of the 
high school education as to be obvious. The individualistic games of 
the grade school allowed but limited possibilities, and so the child’s 
interest could only be maintained by using a lot of them. But now 
come the team games, in which there is no end to the combination of
-P-A-G-E-379
  PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 371 
play, or to the possibilities of experiment; and so the student will 
want to pick favorite pursuits, and play these intensively. The high 
school age—15 to 19—should bring specialization, leaving it to the 
college, however, to carry the process of specialization to its fullest 
extent. There are four reasons why vigorous sports should compose 
the biggest part of the physical education programme at this time 
of the individual's life; first, because they coordinate the body at a 
time when the school work is striving to coordinate the mind; second, 
because the desire to win makes the player willing to obey the train- 
ing rules—a group of hygienic laws—an important matter in this 
habit-forming period of his life; third, because, as dwelt upon before, 
the effects of physical exercise are more far-reaching than the benefits 
pertaining to the body alone—there are mental and moral results 
as well—and it is the team game that best promotes the qualities 
needed; and fourth, because of the pedagogical principle that the 
value of subjects in the high school depends largely on the interest 
they create. Therefore the boy will gain the most from the type of 
exercise he likes, which, in the vast majority of cases, will be some 
branch of team sport. An interesting point to note is that just at this 
period, when the youth is being awakened to life purposes, and 
brought closer to the actual conditions of work-a-day life, there is a 
bigger consciousness of work in his play. In the days of childhood 
and early youth, the exercise as long as it was interesting, was play; 
and when it became otherwise, the child ceased to go on: but in late 
youth, we find that there is a willingness to persevere and keep on, 
even when the drudgery element in a game becomes stronger than 
the play. Such a case is found in the practices for football and base- 
ball, for the candidates will go through the monotonous routine of 
the fundamentals and conditioning exercises for the sake of the re- 
moter aim of reward in team victory. The teacher can profit from 
the above example, if, when selecting exercises that are almost sure 
to be distasteful, he will point out the future benefits to be derived. 
Although the public school system ends with the high school, the 
chance for more advanced leadership is offered by college. The 
increased specialization educationally is patalleled by the increased 
specialization in athletics. Here we find team play carried to its 
highest degree of technique. That athletics assists education in 
producing leaders was shown during the war by the fact that college 
athletes were favored as officers. College athletics, when actuated 
by high ideals, do help to turn out spirited men, socially inclined, and 
animated with positive vigor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  372 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Compulsory Attendance and Grading 
There are two trends in connection with the use of play in the 
school curriculum which should be noted. The first is compulsory 
attendance. This must come. If play is necessary in the all-around 
education of our children, then those who neglect it are cheating 
themselves, and the State as well, because they are not developing 
themselves to the fullest possibilities. Only by making play com- 
pulsory, can we bring home its seriousness, and point out that it is 
more than recreative. Besides, regularity of attendance is necessary 
to create sustained interest. Children are most interested in the 
things they can do well. Even when we have had compulsory physi- 
cal training in the past, there has been too often a laxity in excusing 
absences from classes, which was bound to detract from the serious- 
ness with which the student regarded the work. 
Second, there is the question of grading. Setting up standards 
and then marking a student in his work will assist in making the 
physical training hour more important to the student. Grading can , 
be accomplished. At present a start has been made in the marking 
of boys in the elementary school, especially in track events, where a 
definite mark can be given. The efficiency tests have developed out 
of this attempt to grade. Games can also be graded, but not so 
closely. We might take example from the school standings, which, 
in the definite tests of the elementary grades, are marked on the 
basis of 100, but which, later in the more indefinite tests of high 
school, where there develops individuality of expression, are marked 
on the less rigid basis of A, B, and C, and so forth. When grading 
is accomplished, we may look forward to a much greater interest in 
physical training on the part of those students who have been prone 
to neglect it, as it is-a common truth, that although a boy will pass 
over a scholastic deficiency jokingly, he is more sensitive about his 
physical prowess, and if this were graded, he would strive to bring 
his standard at least up to normal. 
Conclusion 
In concluding, it may be said that play’s importance in an indi- 
vidual’s life does not cease with his graduation from the public 
schools to enter into life both as a trained worker and as a social 
being. If the schools have done their part, they will have allowed 
him opportunity to find his true vocation—the one with the most 
enjoyable service in it. If this has been accomplished, the individual
-P-A-G-E-381
  
PLAY AND CITIZENSHIP 373 
is promised a work in which he can find a spiritual gain as well as 
material compensation. But not only that; the schools, through 
utilizing play, and making its advantages universal, will have de- 
veloped in each individual the play spirit so that he can make the 
most of his leisure time. The play spirit must be developed in youth 
or it will be forever lost. With a play spirit in his work—a thing 
which all successful men have—and a capacity for recreating himself 
when away from his work, the individual should be a contented 
citizen. He will be a citizen to whom there may be some drudgery in 
life, to be sure, but at the same time, this drudgery will be willingly 
undergone for the sake of the larger compensations that his work 
and his leisure time are holding forth to him.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE PLAY TEACHER 
The play teacher is really a creation of the present generation. 
Previously it was considered quite absurd to engage a teacher solely 
for the purpose of directing play. It was enough, from this point of 
view, to supply the room for play and a limited amount of apparatus 
and play materials—the children could then take care of themselves. 
Even the things in the way of equipment were considered more of a 
luxury than a necessity. But the playgrounds came, and the play 
teachers have followed. People came to change their minds on this 
question. 
At first many teachers and parents who were quite in sympathy 
with the idea of providing play spaces for the congested districts in 
the cities still maintained that “‘play cannot be taught.” Having seen 
and experienced only the forms of play used by the isolated country 
child, they could comprehend no other kind that would be of value 
and they stood out for the old fashioned “free play.’ Their thought 
was that the children should play together of their own accord and 
that older people should not interfere with them. 
Quite naturally, then, many critics were up in arms at the mere 
thought of paying teachers to go out and play with the children. 
“We're spending money for this girl to go out and exercise inthe 
hot sun until she is liable to sunstroke,” said one objecting alderman. 
“And she is spoiling the youngsters’ good time,” he added, “‘for they 
don’t want to be made to play.” Along the same line, one gentle- 
man holding a responsible legislative position’ said in all sincerity, 
“You might just as well teach fishes to swim as children to play.” 
Consequences of Unsupervised Play 
Because of this prevailing opinion that has just been expressed, 
many cities were led to put all available funds into land and equip- 
ment, and to open playgrounds without supervision. This kind of 
free play was a serious mistake, and the results were such as to de- 
feat entirely the purpose of the whole play project. 
374
-P-A-G-E-383
  THE PLAY TEACHER 375 
First and foremost, the wrong element of childhood and youth 
gained control, just as it does in the free play of the streets. Some 
one is sure to exert a. dominating influence over the play of the 
group; if it is not a teacher, it is sure to be a self-appointed leader 
from the more aggressive of the players. Unfortunately, an aggres- 
sive disposition is not always associated with broad judgment and 
good judgment. The result is that free play often includes unfair 
play mingled with quarreling, teasing, and hazing of certain pupils 
or nearby residents or passersby, breaking of windows, and other 
mischievous pranks of all kinds and degrees. 
From this standpoint, the playground simply affords a larger 
street and alley space. It becomes the congregating place of the 
rougher members of society where the rule of the “bully” holds 
sway; and out of this there is bound to result persecution, selfishness, 
lawlessness, destruction of property, and many other forms of de- 
generacy and vice. In other words, except play be directed, the 
space and apparatus offered for its use become elements contributory 
to the complete delinquency of the mentally deficient, of those with 
perverted instincts, of those without adequate home training and 
often those of good breeding; and to the partial delinquency of the 
normal child who is brought under such a harmful influence. 
: It is only too evident that the playgrounds, if undirected, will 
defeat their own purpose. They will not be used by the great body 
of well-bred children for whose use they are intended. No thinking 
parents will send their children to a place where they will learn 
obscene and profane language, petty thieving, habits of vice, unclean- 
liness, and discourtesy; or to a place where they will be bullied by 
the rough element, who will monopolize the swings, ladders, teeters, 
and slides most of the time, and whose pranks will make it positively 
dangerous for other children to use such apparatus when a chance is 
offered. 
It is only in keeping with these many undesirable things, that 
the apparatus is bound to suffer from the moment of its installation. 
Whatever can be removed is stolen in short order and that which is 
too large to carry off is usually put out of commission either from 
malicious intent or from improper use long before it has served its 
natural time. This in itself is enough to occasion concern, for the 
apparatus was supplied for a definite purpose and if that is not being 
fulfilled there is a decided economic waste. 
Conditions such as have been described became so bad that the 
whole play movement was temporarily placed in disrepute, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  376 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
residence owners objected strenuously to having playgrounds estab- 
lished in their midst. The Playground Association of America, 
recognizing the setback that was in store if things were allowed to 
continue, was obliged to issue through its field secretaries and 
institute workers the following warning: “Equip no more play- 
grounds until you have provided adequate supervision for all you 
now have.” 
Neither was the expedient, attempted by many municipalities, 
of hiring cheap help in the way of a caretaker or monitor who was 
to watch the apparatus and keep order on the grounds, much more 
successful. True, many of the vicious practices were discontinued; 
but the situation fell back almost to the same position it was in before 
the playgrounds were established. The unruly gangsters, finding 
their activities curbed, and nothing else offered in place of them, 
went back to their old haunts in the streets and alleys. The play- 
grounds simply became vacant lots, holding no invitation or attrac- 
tion, and unpatronized except for the smaller children who came to 
use the swings and teeters, and for an occasional group of larger 
children who came to play a scrub game of ball. 
The Successful Playground 
When we turn to the capably supervised playground we see a 
more pleasing picture. It is a busy spot. Teachers of strong cheer- 
ful personalities, lovable yet dominating, are organizing the play of 
the different groups of children; not only that, but they are teaching 
play, as we shall later see. Obscenity, profanity, and dishonesty are 
infrequent occurrences; apparatus is respected and preserved; justice 
prevails; children of all classes flock to take part in the doings. A 
new type of discipline is seen, the preventive = that comes 
from children happy and busy in their play. 
It can be seen that the duty of the person who is to fill the 
position of play teacher is not only to combat the negative influence 
of the playground. That is just the beginning. The playground 
teacher is more than a guardian. He must be an acting’force, an 
aggressive leader whose object is to give an uplifting personality to 
the playground. He must do all that is within his opportunity and 
power to cultivate habits and ideals that are in keeping with the 
highest needs of our society as a whole. 
Let us study the process by which the experienced play teacher 
gains his ends. He already knows that the best way to preserve 
discipline and order is to keep the child busily engaged, that it is the
-P-A-G-E-385
  THE PLAY TEACHER 377 
loafing group of children that is planning mischief. He knows that 
coercive measures, such as prohibiting the use of the playground to 
certain individuals or an appeal to the police, are only the occasional 
means that are to be used as a last resort, after all constructive 
attempts to reach such people have failed. When interest in play 
is aroused and maintained, the children’s minds are wholly occupied 
with the wholesome activities at hand. There is then no chance for 
thoughts and expressions brought up by curiosity with respect to sex 
matters, or for gang plans for the re-enacting of robbery or murder 
scenes that have been witnessed in the movies or read about in cheap 
novels. The mind is kept healthy at the same time that the body is 
being preserved and built up, and the result is a clean child in every 
way. 
It takes a wise, sympathetic, and trained teacher to maintain this 
interest. Children cannot create interest for themselves except in 
spasmodic efforts. Here is where the play organizer comes in. The 
teaching of play, so long condemned on theoretical grounds, has been 
found to succeed for the following reasons: 
Discipline: The teacher’s presence makes for discipline and 
order. These things are the first factors necessary to gain the ap- 
proval of the parents, which in turn, means a great increase in the 
attendance of the children. It is found, too, that children appreciate 
all the more the teacher who administers a firm but just control over 
them. The result is that they gain a new conception of leadership, 
with a corresponding respect for law and authority. : 
System: Time and place for various kinds of play can be 
arranged in a systematic way. This has several important advan- 
tages. Proper use is made. of the apparatus. Many more children 
can play at the same time in a given space without interfering with 
each other’s play, and thereby make the most possible use of the 
precious play spaces in our congested cities. (The inability of the 
children to plan systematically for themselves is one of the main 
reasons for the failure of free play.) Boys and girls of various ages 
can be sure of finding their favorite form of play going on at a 
regular hour. Children can join groups of their own age and ability. 
Plays of different kinds can be placed at the times of day best suited 
tothem. — 
Variety: A vastly greater variety of activities can be taught than 
the children could ever know if left to themselves. The play teacher,
-P-A-G-E-386
  378 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
who has made a specialty of studying the best plays of all places and 
races, can teach them a great variety of plays and games, so that they 
can change and find a new interest whenever the one at hand begins 
to tire. 
Technique: The desire to improve oneself can be incited in the 
different players by teaching them better ways to play old and familiar 
games. This kind of teaching, which has come to be called “‘coach- 
ing,” often succeeds in giving a life-long interest to a game which other- 
wise would be attractive only as long as it remained a novelty. Many 
of the best games, including tennis, hockey, and baseball, require a con- 
siderable degree of knowledge and skill before one is apt to enjoy them. 
A good teacher, knowing the results of the experience of all the best 
players since the game began, can help any player to a much more 
rapid advancement than he could ever acquire alone. This has great 
moral.as well as educational value, for the lack of ability to succeed 
by good playing is one of the chief reasons why players sometimes 
try to evade the rules. 
Organized Competition: The trained teacher will know how to 
classify boys and girls so that a large number of teams can be 
organized instead of just one representing the largest and strongest 
children. This conduces to more satisfactory results for all con- 
cerned because the competition is made fair, each boy being pitted 
against other boys of his own age and experience. Following the 
building up of permanent teams, the director can arrange tourna- 
ments and meets, not only for his own particular ground but with 
other grounds also. Unless play is organized, schedules of games 
are impossible, and there is no one other thing that so makes for inter- 
est in the playground and loyalty to it. The permanent team attracts 
an audience and the players take additional pride in the new prestige 
that comes their way. 
Competent Officials: Fair. play in the competitive team games 
can only be secured by having an umpire. Most of the umpiring can 
be done by the teachers; when not available they can appoint the 
more influential pupils, who, with a little direction and experience 
can do very well in all but the most important games. Better ideals 
of conduct can be developed. Fair play at all times is necessary to 
the success of all games and such plays as involve rivalry. This 
accounts for the reason why the game that is not competently
-P-A-G-E-387
    
THE PLAY TEACHER 379 
officiated and handled, will break up ina row. Too, unjust decisions 
are bound to result in suspicion, wrangling, loss of time, general dis- 
satisfaction with the play, and the development of bad habits, be- 
cause each side suspects the other of unfairness and justifies retalia- 
tion on that basis. If there is any one thing that should be em- 
phasized more than another as preparation for citizenship in a 
civilized community, it is the habit of dealing fairly with rivals. 
Community Spirit: The players are not the only ones affected 
by their organization into permanent teams with an attractive 
schedule of games. The fact that these teams are thrown into com- 
petition with teams representing other districts arouses a neighbor- 
hood spirit in the same way that the school team incites school spirit. 
The players find themselves backed and championed by many people 
of the particular locality that the team happens to stand for. This 
bringing together in an informal way so many children and older 
people from all nationalities and conditions of life makes a demo- 
cratic spirit among our many class and racial groups. 
Welfare: The trained play leader makes play serve its fullest 
educational value. In the way of health, his presence means a safe- 
guard against over-exertion and injury; more than that, it means 
athletic training for the children, who will ask for information in 
correct habits of living and exercising because of their new attach- 
ment to the team. Unless play is adapted to the age needs of the’ 
children, much of the mental training it affords is lost. Then, too, 
there are many qualities of good breeding and culture which, to be 
instilled, need wise direction. Such a direction is needed to point out 
the lessons of sportsmanship, such as how to be good losers and good 
winners, and how to treat visitors with courtesy. The teacher is 
needed not only to recognize the possibilities of leadership in the 
particular child but to see that this talent is steered into proper 
channels. 
N.B. There is only the one caution to be pointed out in the way 
of supervised play. There is such a thing as over-supervision. Such 
a fault is commonly seen, and it is one that robs the play of its free- 
dom and opportunity. The director should plan an elastic schedule 
for the day, with just a few events that are run off to the minute. 
When the children of their own accord have found a wholesome 
pursuit he should let them develop it along their own lines. His place
-P-A-G-E-388
  380 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
then is to offer suggestions when the chance affords, and to provide 
something else when the initiative and ingenuity of the children them- 
selves begin to fail. 
The Importance of Trained Teachers 
It has been shown that organized play is an agency for physical 
exercise, recreation, and education. It has also been shown that the 
value of play is in direct proportion to the amount and kind of direc- 
tion supplied. Play not only can be taught, but must be taught. 
Even animal parents play with their young. Along this line George 
E. Johnson writes, ‘‘A kingfisher teaches its young to fish, a fox gives 
its live prey to her young to worry, a cat plays with her kittens, and 
a dog teaches her puppies to wrestle. . . . Mothers have always 
supervised the play of their little ones, fashioned their toys, taught 
them their games. A boy no more inherits the game of baseball 
than he inherits the Lord’s Prayer.’ As far as moral precepts are 
concerned it would be just about as sensible to hold a Sunday School 
without a teacher as to conduct a playground without one. 
It is not too much to say that the play leader is more important 
than the playground itself. Indeed the very possibilities that stretch 
forth before the play teacher in the way of accomplishment are the 
reasons why this person should be a person especially fitted and 
trained for his particular job. He (or she) is the chosen leader and 
inspiration, and the standards he sets will be followed. The chil- 
dren will also find in him the kindly advisor of their leisure hours, 
just as the parents and school teacher are respectively the advisors 
of the time spent at home and in the schoolroom.: 
In this capacity the play teacher has even a greater opportunity 
than the schoolroom teacher, for the former catches the child off- 
guard in the great out-of-doors. Here there is no restraint save that 
of the rules of fair play and one’s own conscience of what is right 
and wrong. There is nothing then to keep the child’s inner self from 
being bared. Allowed such freedom and chance for expression he 
‘reveals himself in his true nature. The play teacher who partakes 
of the spirit of youth receives many confidences in trust. Here is the 
chance to reach the child. Think of such a responsibility! Surely 
we cannot stint in securing men and women for such places. 
If we stint by giving inadequate pay, someone is sure to be 
cheated. If a competent director overlooks a meager financial re- 
turn and gives his services to this field, then he is cheated; if a di. 
rector merely acts as a janitor or caretaker, then the children are
-P-A-G-E-389
THE PLAY TEACHER 381 
cheated; and if the person in charge is too immature or incompetent 
even to assert a caretaker’s authority, so that the children run riot 
and costly apparatus is destroyed, and the grounds become the 
habitat of the undesirable class only, then the citizens are cheated in 
their investment. 
A Higher Professional Standing 
The teachers of play must be given dignity in their calling, other- 
wise the profession will suffer from lack of desirable men and women 
to enter it. The conception that this is a field for brawn alone is 
fast being outgrown. The salary must be made equivalent in every 
respect to that of the regular teachers in the schools, and educational 
standards must be set. f Too many of the people in charge of our 
playground and school athletic teams lack a broad cultural 
training. Untrained workers are bound to hold back the whole pro- 
fession through the narrow viewpoint that they hold. It is to be 
deplored that there are some people of limited ideals who have be- 
come established in this field of work and who oppose its broadening 
because they see that such a turn would expose their own incapacity. 
But this is unfair to the great majority of workers who are whole- 
hearted in their devotion to a life of service in this career that they 
have chosen. 
In the past, two excuses have been given for using people without 
adequate preparation: first, that already given, that the children do 
not need to be taught play; and second, that there are not enough 
trained teachers to fill the need. There has been some truth to the 
second reason, but it is one that is fast disappearing; accordingly 
as the profession sets high educational standards for itself and in- 
sists on these standards being met, the type of teacher will improve. 
Then will disappear the transient play teacher: the high school or 
college athlete looking for a summer’s work or outing—for play- 
ground work can be an outing if a lazy director wishes to make it 
so; the regular teacher, who, because failing in health, wishes to be 
outdoors, or who, because of financial stringencies cannot afford to 
take a vacation; the person with a pleasing personality who thinks 
that this alone suffices. None of these circumstances should be the 
impelling motive to enter the playground profession, even though 
for the summer season only. Better trained supervisors and teachers 
during the school year, and interested teachers for the summer play 
sessions, should be the aim. The supervisor should train his extra 
helpers for the summer by means of reading, lecture, and game
-P-A-G-E-390
382 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
courses during the year. Then this problem of inexperienced helpers 
who are not capable of their best service until the season is practi- 
cally over will be disposed of. 
The success of Physical Education—the profession which in- 
cludes Play—in maintaining its present high state of popularity, will 
depend first ‘of all upon the physical educators themselves. They 
must be trained to be the intellectual equals and the physical 
superiors of the general educators. As to their relation to the 
general field of education perhaps this quotation from the catalogue 
of a Physical Education training course is as concise and clearly 
reasoned an explanation as could possibly be expressed: ‘“The physi- 
cal educator must have an academic and professional training that 
is equal in every respect to that of the general educator. He must be 
respected by the latter as being the intellectual equal of those en- 
gaged in teaching the other subjects in the schools or colleges 
curricula. There is no reason whatsoever why the ideal physical 
educator should not be regarded as among the most influential and 
intellectual members of the faculty. Furthermore, the ideally trained 
physical educator should be regarded as available material for the 
principalship or the superintendency of schools. In other words the 
physical educator must be by virtue of his training, his ideals, and the 
importance of his work, an integral part of the faculty. He must be 
a real schoolman.” i 
Not everyone is able to be a successful teacher of play any more 
than everyone can hope to be a successful lawyer, physician, writer, 
or engineer. It is a vocation calling for a varied and peculiar range 
of abilities. We must now go on to discuss the special qualities and 
training necessary to produce the type of play leader that has been 
idealized. 
What Is Leadership? 
What is Leadership? There is always the impulse to ask the 
question: “What gives one individual ascendency over others so that 
they take him as a model?” The answer is that the leader is a symbol 
—he stands for something that the follower needs and wants. In 
the play world the boys will look up to their athletic coach in hero- 
worship because at their age he expresses the kind of prowess which 
appeals to them the most. At a later age, when they have chosen 
their vocation and become entranced in it, they will be followers of 
the men who are outstanding successes in the same line of work. It 
may be then that the leader of finance will be admired, in case
-P-A-G-E-391
  THE PLAY TEACHER 383 
they have engaged in business; the explorer and scientist, in case they 
have entered the field of engineering; or the successful newspaper 
man in case they have entered the field of journalism. An example 
is furnished among women: many girls have the impulse toward 
social work and would follow Jane Addams because she symbolizes 
for most girls the ideal type of social worker. In time of war, when 
the need for self-preservation or sacrifice for principle is uppermost, 
the military geniuses become the men of the hour. In primitive 
times the men of physical prowess were leaders because physical 
wants were the only ones to be satisfied. 
Proceeding from this sociological basis it is evident that the 
leader stands out as having striking individuality when compared 
with the group. He is seen to be strong in self-reliance. No one 
can ever hope to be anything of a leader if he lacks this quality. The 
reason is that the “significant individuality” mentioned can only be 
developed through self-reliance, through conflict with environment 
or any other opposing element. When the leader expresses doubt, 
then he no longer is a leader, and the followers lose faith in him. 
The true leader is symbolical of the ideals of his followers, but he is 
in advance of them,—he supplies the torch—the light to make them 
see where their path directs. He is the apostle, and he supplies the 
courage that is necessary to action. He should be so strong that 
even when he occasionally makes an unfavorable suggestion, the con- 
fidence that others put in him will be strong enough to make them 
follow. 
The leader needs the power of human understanding. Pro- 
fessor Cooley makes this a paramount essential. Only as a leader 
understands, can he hope to serve as a symbol, for then the followers 
feel that he is in sympathy with them, and they are ready to tender 
him their trust. An example of this is well given in the personage 
of Lincoln. He seemed to understand people so well that the nation 
as a whole felt that it was understood, and felt certain that Lincoln 
would never go contrary to the national sympathies. 
Leadership is often involuntary. In this case the one essential 
thing is that the individual must be a worthy symbol of the ideals in 
his field. Such a person is elevated to the standing of a leader un- 
consciously, because of his accomplishments, which speak loudly for 
themselves. St. Francis, for instance, did not desire to be a leader in 
his new movement; nor, indeed, did Darwin in his. Both these men 
were natural leaders, without consciously striving for such a position. 
There are, however, persons who are very desirous of becoming 
   
-P-A-G-E-392
  384 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
leaders, and who try too hard and too directly to acquire and main- 
tain such a position. It would be better for them if they were will- 
ing to assume simply the réle of one of the group and try to produce 
something that would of itself give them leadership. The result of 
direct striving is that the person often condemns himself to second 
rate leadership—because in the excessive zeal to please, he hesitates 
to disturb any existing situation that is not urgently demanding a 
change, and for this reason. falls into conservatism. This type of 
leadership, although not the highest, is the one most found in our 
political field to-day. 
That which has been said of leadership in general is more true 
when applied to the playground. To be a leader of children one 
must in himself symbolize for them all that they desire and more 
than they can immediately grasp. The profession then demands 
certain special abilities, training, and experience peculiar to itself. 
Desirable Qualifications for Play Leadership 
Personal: First of all, the person who aspires to teach play must 
be a leader who can anticipate and meet the child’s desires for self- 
expression. This requires an innate love for children, and a sympa- 
thetic understanding of child nature. Someone has called the play 
teacher a ‘‘cheery dictator.” Certain it is, the teacher must com- 
mand respect, but the spirit of discipline must be a hidden reality, 
rather than one that is being put into effect all the while. A child 
is more in awe of the unknown than he is of a threat that “this or 
that will be done.”” The teacher who is calm and masterful, giving 
the impression that such a thing as insubordinacy is not even being 
thought of, will react in that way upon the children; whereas, the 
irritable, threatening type of disciplinarian is constantly throwing out 
a challenge to the more high-spirited youngsters. Most youngsters 
find a thrill in playing a prank when they know it is directed against 
an unreasonably strict discipline and will bring about an explosion of 
wrath; but would find no fun in doing the same thing to the teacher 
who has always treated them fairly. With the teacher they like they 
will play many harmless jokes, knowing that these will be received 
with good humor. Of course there are exceptional happenings which 
will stir the temperament of any director, and righteous resentment 
will follow. But no physical force is justified in any case unless it is 
in self-protection or in the protection of law-abiding visitors to the 
grounds. 
To enjoy the games the children play, and to join in them occa-
-P-A-G-E-393
  
THE PLAY TEACHER 385 
sionally, does not lessen the teacher’s influence. Rather, it helps it, 
always so with the smaller children, who will beg their popular 
teacher to sing with them and to be chased or to be “it.” Such a 
participation should be more carefully exercised, however, when it 
comes to the older boys and girls, whose activities are more difficult 
and require special skill. Accordingly as skill becomes admired by 
the children, the director should not enter any activity in which he 
will be called upon to demonstrate feats in which he is inferior to the 
others who are taking part. If he does possess special aptitude for 
athletic sports it is well for him occasionally to display it. At all 
times he should remain aloof from personal combat activities, such 
as boxing and wrestling, unless he is so markedly superior that he 
can toy good naturedly with his opponent, and make it appear that 
a lesson is being demonstrated. 
The person naturally adapted to be a play teacher will meet with 
but few problems of discipline. If he cannot maintain discipline, 
then he should understand that he is not fitted for this particular 
calling, for it is possible for many teachers to go into the most 
crowded tenement districts and into the midst of the toughest gangs, 
and meet with but little trouble. It is a knack—this ability to get 
hold of a lawless group; a knack which is shown by the experience 
of Judge Lindsay and “his gang” in Denver. 
Another personal element to success is good health. Without 
it, the teacher cannot maintain his or her vigor, especially so when it 
is often necessary to join in the games. Good health also is con- 
ducive to buoyancy of spirit, a thing which must be displayed in one’s 
relation to children, for they react quickly to the teacher’s mood. 
Children, for their own good, should react to enthusiasm and energy. 
The ideal play leader has an abundance of spontaneous enthusiasm, 
and that this will be contagious, is inevitable. Summing up, then, 
the favorite teacher’s character, we must use the adjectives cheerful, 
even-tempered, sociable, considerate, tactful, fair (justice is a very 
important consideration), strict, sincere (hypocrisy is especially dis- 
liked), enthusiastic, and inspiring. It does not take a youthful 
person to supply these attributes. Being young is not so much a 
matter of age as of mental attitude. A person is young enough for 
the playground just so long as he or she is energetic and full of life 
and can radiate the same contagious spirit. 
Expert Play Knowledge: Next to these personal qualities that 
have been discussed, there is need for an expert knowledge of play..
-P-A-G-E-394
  386 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
The director must be thoroughly acquainted with all the best forms 
of play, from those of the sandpile and kindergarten to the competi- 
tive and highly-organized games of college men and women, and he 
must know them all well enough to tell when they are correctly 
taught and coached and when they are correctly umpired. He must 
know which are best suited for boys and which for girls; which are 
best for this age and which for that. He must know the rules of 
conducting track meets. He must know the standards of the 
efficiency tests of different cities. More than that, he must be able 
to organize and manage these plays and games so easily that he can 
do it on a big scale and still have places, teams, equipment, and 
officials ready when it is time to play. There is still more: he must 
understand the social interests of older people, and be able to take 
charge of evening social center work, where groups of mixed ages 
and nationalities are present; he must be able to plan and conduct 
festivals, pageants, and appropriate holiday celebrations. Along 
these various lines, he must have a business sense for the raising of 
funds, the purchase and care of equipment, etc. A community play 
programme, to compete successfully against movie shows and pool 
rooms, must be as well planned and managed as the latter are; and 
right here is where the community play programme most often fails 
to function. 
Health Knowledge: The play teacher is often called upon to 
give advice in matters of personal, school, and civic hygiene. He is 
* often called upon to prescribe corrective exercises for children who 
have deformities that can be corrected. He should be equipped 
to give advice on matters concerning the location, equipment, 
hygiene, and upkeep of the playgrounds, gymnasiums, and swimming 
pools. These responsibilities are more and more being assumed by 
the play director, and are ones that should be welcomed as giving the 
opportunity for a broader service. To meet these duties capably, 
the director should have a good grasp of the principles of anatomy, 
physiology, hygiene, sanitation, and first aid. He should then be 
able to recognize such physical defects as may be remedied, and to 
detect faulty sanitation or the threat of contagious disease, so that 
through his warning the community may take action before it is too 
late. 
Culture: This is a great asset if the play teacher is to make the 
most of his unique opportunities to serve the public. The course of 
training for the prospective director should be so constructed that a
-P-A-G-E-395
    
THE PLAY TEACHER 387 
broad cultural education will be combined with the specialized train- 
ing that must necessarily be taken. For this reason, the subjects of 
Rhetoric, Literature, Public Speaking, History, Sociology, Psy- 
chology, Science, Government, Education, and Vocational Guidance 
should form an integral part of the play director’s education. They 
will enable him to do his part properly in influencing the character 
of the growing children—being a foster-parent to them—and in 
raising the moral tone of the school; in meeting the responsibility of 
vocational counseling with confiding youth; and in being an in- 
fluential leader in all ways in his respective community. The latter 
requisite means that he must consider play in its broader aspects, not 
only as a separate subject, but also in its relation to the other educa- 
tional subjects and to other community needs.   
A Mixer in Public Affairs: The successful play director must 
be a good mixer with children and adults in their play and recreation, 
but he must go outside of the immediate scope of his work, too, to 
meet with all classes of people. He must get people interested in his 
work; in this sense he must be a diplomatic promoter and advertiser. 
He must be able to gain the full cooperation of the whole school 
system—teachers, superintendent, and board. He must be able to 
discuss problems of play and recreation with individuals, groups, or 
assemblies. Often he will be called upon to lead a meeting or dis- 
cussion, in which case he will need to have a working knowledge of 
Parliamentary rules of procedure. He will not last long unless he can 
impress everybody, from the small children in his play festivals to 
the conservative old-timers who oppose his plans in the school meet- 
ing, with his absolute fairness and honesty of purpose. 
All this is in the way of promotion of the movement. No direc- 
tor, no matter how competent, can make a success of this work with- 
out the whole-hearted support of a large number of leading citizens. 
To get this, he must first know well the conditions of the neighbor- 
hood and city in which he is working. He must try to create a pub- 
lic sentiment that will give both moral and financial support to the 
movement, and his best way to insure permanent success is not 
through politics, but through the unqualified and continuous back- 
ing of such organizations as the School Board, the Church, the Park 
Commission, the Board of Commerce, the Rotary, Exchange, and 
Kiwanis Clubs, the Parent-Teacher Clubs, and the various Women’s 
Clubs. Their support will largely depend upon the impression his 
personality makes upon them.   
 
-P-A-G-E-396
  388 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
Then, to extend the scope of this work, and better it, he must 
impress people as being a good fellow, a moral leader, and a good 
Samaritan. If he is fostering Boy Scout and Camp Fire activities, 
it is essential that parents feel confidence in him; for their faith in 
new organizations, and their willingness to let their children go on 
picnics, hikes, and camping trips, is largely determined by their trust 
inthe person responsible for promoting them. If he desires to get the 
churches interested in recreation and to organize Sunday school 
leagues in athletics, he must carry the same inspiration. He must be 
a mixer if he desires to get factories, stores, fraternal orders, neigh- 
borhood groups, and men’s clubs to put a representative team in a 
baseball, basket ball, or volley ball league, or to organize a gym- 
nasium class for which he will provide a leader. 
It can be seen that the play director has many and varied de- 
mands upon his time. He should recognize that his position as a 
community employee and public figure makes it necessary to respond 
to as many as possible of the calls that come to him. He must not 
isolate himself from legitimate publicity. His work is to awaken 
the community to a larger play consciousness. Therefore he must 
be a promoter and press agent. He must advertise the work through 
the newspapers as well as through the enthusiasm that the children 
take with them to their homes. He must be able to impress inter- 
ested visitors who come to the grounds, and take the time to give 
them all the information they request; he should be glad to cooperate 
with people of benevolent nature and interest them in his work. His 
position of itself involves the responsibility of being present at many 
public functions, and of putting across the message of the Play 
Movement whenever called upon to speak. 
Specialization Within the Field 
It is only in rare instances that any one person will possess the 
versatility of character and of training that would be necessary to 
fulfill the qualifications that have just been given. But the field that 
the play movement includes is now so large that it calls for specializa- 
tion within itself. The student who is being trained for this work 
will soon find out that some of these qualifications are present in his 
makeup more so than others. He can then plan accordingly. For 
instance, the student specializing in supervisory work can take sub- 
jects more remotely connected with play, such as municipal govern- 
ment, sociology, business law, and school administration. On the 
other hand, the teacher who plans to carry on inspirational work in
-P-A-G-E-397
  
THE PLAY TEACHER 389 
close personal touch with children and older people will find such 
subjects as oratory, story-telling, pagentry, handicraft, music, and 
dancing, almost invaluable. The student desiring to coach will want 
a very specialized knowledge of the technique of the various competi- 
tive sports, including the fundamentals of the play and the team 
strategy of defense and offense, and he will also want to know the 
practical methods of training, such as bandaging and treatment of 
minor injuries and ailments. The gymnasium teacher will want to 
spend most of his practical training in acquiring the mastery of giv- 
ing commands and of feats on the apparatus. There is plenty of 
opportunity to-day to receive special training along one’s own par- 
ticular needs, for normal colleges and universities are rapidly intro- 
ducing physical education courses, and many cities and rural dis- 
tricts conduct special institutes. Once located on a job, however, 
the teacher should not cease to grow. He should keep up to date 
through wise reading in his subject—through the best books and 
current literature—through extension courses with higher institu- 
tions of learning, by attending the many district conferences that 
are now being held, and by attending a summer school occasionally. 
The Administration of the Play Staff 
The recreation system of a city is now coming to be a year-round 
affair. Sometimes the School Board has jurisdiction, sometimes a 
special City Recreation Commission, and sometimes the School 
Board and Park Commission cooperate to handle it, the Park Board 
in such a case handling the out-of-school and vacation time play. 
The system works best when one man is placed in charge of the 
whole programme. This Superintendent of Recreation has charge of 
the general administration. His duties are then analogous to those 
of the Superintendent of Schools. The play superintendent has 
charge of the construction and equipment of playgrounds, gymna- 
siums, and field houses; the planning of the various programmes, the 
choice of activities, and the promotion of them; also, the direction of 
the rest of the teaching force. The success of such an administra- 
tor will rest upon his ability to pick good subordinates, and to handle 
them without provoking friction. In picking his corp of directors 
to work under him, he should remember to get a well-balanced staff, 
so that the many qualifications of the ideal play leader will all be 
represented in his system. Then he can utilize the special abilities 
of each subordinate to the best advantage. The superintendent need- 
. not necessarily be able to do everything himself, but by calling upon  
-P-A-G-E-398
  390 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
the different teachers he can get work of any particular nature done 
well. The successful executive needs to possess a strong character, 
sound judgment, courage, an understanding of men, organizing 
ability, ability to cooperate, a wide technical grasp of play, and crea- 
tive imagination. He must have a time sense of his own value so 
that he will not busy himself with details that can be done by his 
assistants. He must.attend to the large questions requiring vision 
and the formulation of policies. The salary of such a position 
usually runs from $2500 to $6000 depending on the size of the 
city. i 
Next, the system should have a woman assistant superintendent, 
whose duties are primarily to look after the teachers of the younger 
children, both boys and girls in the primary and elementary grades, 
and to look after the teaching of the older girls in the Junior and 
Senior high schools; also to supervise much of the evening recrea- 
tional work, especially the story-telling, handicraft, and the recrea- 
tional games and dances. The salary of this position is likely to be 
from $1500 to $4000. 
Next in order comes the district superintendent, who has 
a special section of the city to look after, with duties the same 
as the city superintendent only limited to this particular area. Some 
of the smaller cities instead of having district superintendents, 
have supervisors for one special activity, folk dancing, for instance, 
and their duty is to see that this activity is carried out over the whole 
city. In the larger cities both the district superintendents and the 
special supervisors are apt to be found. These two types of officials 
usually rank the same and-get a salary of $1500 to $4000. 
The next official is the director, who is found in charge of one play- 
ground or one recreation building. He is an executive on a smaller 
scale. In the smaller systems he may have to act as teacher also, 
handling the activities of the older boys, such as their competitive 
games and their gymnasium work, if any, and leading the business 
men’s classes in the evening. His duties can be compared to those 
of the principal of an individual school. His salary is usually from 
$1200 to $3500. 
Lastly, but far from least in importance, there is the play leader 
who acts in immediate relation with the children and actually directs 
their play. A lovable personality counts most here. Special train- 
ing is needed in conducting and organizing the play. There are 
many details to be looked after, but little call for executive ability. 
In the case of younger children in the grades (whether boys or .
-P-A-G-E-399
  THE PLAY TEACHER 391 
girls) it is much better for them to have a woman teacher. After 
the boys and girls segregate, then a man teacher should coach the 
boys in their sports and handle their club work of Boy Scout nature, 
and a woman take care of the other girls’ games, dancing, and Camp 
Fire work. The salaries of these teachers run from $1000 to $2500. 
One mistake that is often made in the administration is to ex- 
pect a person to act in a broad executive capacity and also to coach 
the teams in such sports as football, basket ball, and baseball. The 
demand on him to win in the latter case is such that he will inevitably 
concentrate on the coaching, with the result that the welfare of the 
great majority of boys will be neglected. There is not time to do 
both things. Besides, the two jobs call for different types of men. 
The coach is interested in giving a team an intensive training in a 
narrow line, where the price of victory often means that the players 
must go beyond the limits of endurance and good health, while the 
play director spreads his interest over a wide field and seeks to im- 
prove the physique of a city rather than to win games. 
Conclusion: The Outlook for Service 
The teacher who takes up the field of Physical Education as a 
life work has the satisfaction of knowing that there is no other sub- 
ject in the academic field that is of so universal value, unless it is the 
subject of the language we speak. To-day this profession has come 
to occupy a position that stands half-way between the professions 
of General Education and of Medicine. It aims to build up the body 
to resist the onset of disease, and also to build up mental habits and 
ideals. It asks just as complete a specialized training as any of the 
professions; and more than many a profession, it demands a win- 
ning personality before success can be attained.*) The many-sidedness 
of the duties that the young man or woman taking up physical edu- 
cation as a life work may be called upon to perform have already 
been shown in the varied nature of the things that are included in the 
teacher’s qualifications. 
The profession is a new one; it is one that is not given full credit 
and recognition yet, with as assured a place in the school curriculum 
as studies of the classical order. But this should fire one’s zeal and 
not lessen it, for the teacher who understands the nature of the 
objectives of physical education, and who is worthy of being called 
a physical educator, cannot fail to have unlimited confidence in the 
work he can accomplish. The time will come when his worth is 
everywhere recognized. Itis a profession that does not promise the
-P-A-G-E-400
392 THE THEORY OF ORGANIZED PLAY 
most in the way of material compensations, but there is the far 
greater reward that comes from being high in the esteem of one’s 
fellow men, and in the inspiration that comes from fulfillment of. 
service. The ordinary academic teacher is too apt to get into a rut— 
he is largely living in the past; whereas the coming play teacher has 
a new and inviting field of promise stretching before him. The 
Physical Educator is a pioneer, and he must be animated by the 
spirit which makes all pioneers strong-hearted and venturesome, 
keen and alert to the fire of opposition, and ready to endure self- 
sacrifice.

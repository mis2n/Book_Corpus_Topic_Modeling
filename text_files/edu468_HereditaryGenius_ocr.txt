  PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION 
THE idea of investigating the subject of hereditary genius 
occurred to me during the course of a purely ethnological 
inquiry, into the mental peculiarities of different races; 
when the fact, that characteristics cling to families, was 
so frequently forced on my notice as to induce me to pay 
especial attention to that branch of the subject. I began 
by thinking over the dispositions and achievements of my 
contemporaries at school, at college, and in after life, 
and was surprised to find how oan ability. seemed 
to go by descent. Then I male a cursory examination 
into the kindred of about four hundred illustrious men of 
all periods of history, and thé results were such, in my 
own opinion, as completely to establish the theory that 
genius was hereditary, under limitations that required to 
be investigated. Thereupon I set to work to gather a 
large amount of carefully selected biographical data, and 
in the meantime wrote‘two articles on the subject, which 
appeared in Macmillan’s Magazine in June and in August, 
1865. I also attacked the subject from many different 
sides and sometimes with very minute inquiries, because 
it was long before the methods I finally adopted were 
matured, I mention all this, to show that the foundation

for my theories is broader than appears in the book, an 
as a partial justification if I have occasionally been be 
trayed into speaking somewhat more confidently than th 
evidence I have adduced would warrant. 
I trust the reader will pardon a small percentage o: 
error and inaccuracy, if it be so small as not to affect th 
general value of my results. No one can hate inaccurac: 
more than myself, or can have a higher idea of what a 
author owes to his readers, in respect to precision ; but, in 
a subject like this, it is exceedingly difficult to correc 
every mistake, and still more so to avoid omissions. I have} 
often had to run my eyes over many pages of large bio- 
graphical dictionaries and volumes of memoirs to arrive 
at data, destined to be packed into half a dozen lines, in 
an appendix to one of my many chapters. 
The theory of hereditary genius, though usually scouted, 
has been advocated by a few writers in past as well as in 
modern times. But I may claim to be the first to treat 
the subject in a statistical manner, to arrive at numerical 
results, and to introduce the “law of deviation from an 
average” into discussions on heredity. 
A great many subjects are discussed in the following 
pages, which go beyond the primary issue-—whether or 
no genius be hereditary. I could not refuse to consider 
them, because the bearings of the theory I advocate are 
too important to be passed over in silence.

    PREFATORY CHAPTER TO THE 
EDITION OF 1892 
Tus volume is a reprint of a work published twenty- 
three years ago, which has long been unpurchasable, 
except at second-hand and at fancy prices. It was a 
question whether to revise the whole and to bring the 
information up to date, or simply to reprint it after 
remedying a few staring errata. The latter course has 
been adopted, because even’ a few additional data would 
have made it necessary to recast all the tabulations, while 
a thorough reconstruction would be a work ‘of greater 
labour than I can now undertake. 
At the time when the book was written, the human 
mind was popularly thought to act independently of 
natural laws, and to be capable of almost any achieve- 
ment, if compelled to exert itself by a will that had a power 
of initiation. Even those who had more philosophical habits 
of thought were far from looking upon the mental faculties 
of each individual as being limited with as much strict- 
ness as those of his body, still less was the idea of the 
hereditary transmission of ability clearly apprehended. 
The earlier part of the book should be read in the light 
of the imperfect knowledge of the time when it was 
written, since what was true in the above respects 
‘<a
-P-A-G-E-6

for the year 1869 does not continue to be true for 
1892. 
Many of the lines of inquiry that are suggested or 
hinted at in this book have since been pursued by 
myself, and the results have been published in’ various 
memoirs. They are for the most part epitomised in three 
volumes—namely, Hnglish Men of Science (1874), Human 
Faculty (1883), Natural Inheritance (1889); also to some 
small extent in a fourth volume, now about to be pub- 
lished, on Finger Murks. 
The fault in the volume that I chiefly regret is the 
choice of its title of Hereditary Genius, but it cannot be 
remedied now. There was not the slightest intention on 
my part to use the word genius in any technical sense, 
but merely as expressing an ability that was exceptionally 
high, and at the same time inborn. It was intended to be 
used in the senses ascribed to the word in Johnson’s Dic- 
tionary, viz. “Mental power or faculties. Disposition of 
nature by which any one is qualified to some peculiar 
employment. Nature; disposition.” A person who is a 
genius is defined as—A man endowed with superior 
faculties. This exhausts all that Johnson has to say on 
the matter, except as regards the imaginary creature of 
classical authors called a Genius, which does not concern 
us, and which he describes as the protecting or ruling 
power of men, places, or things. There is nothing in the 
quotations from standard authors with which Johnson 
illustrates his definitions, that justifies a strained and 
technical sense being given to the word, nor is there 
anything of the kind in the Latin word ingeniwm. 
Hereditary Genius therefore seemed to be a more 
- expressive and just title than Hereditary Ability, for 
ability does not exclude the effects of education, which
-P-A-G-E-7
ix 
       
   TO THE EDITION OF 1892 
genius does. The reader will find a studious abstinence 
throughout the work from speaking of genius as a special 
quality. It is freely used as an equivalent for natural . 
ability, in the opening of the chapter on “Comparison of 
the Two Classifications.” In the only place, so far as I 
have noticed on reading the book again, where any dis- 
tinction is made between them, the uncertainty that still 
clings to the meaning of the word genius in its technical 
sense is emphatically dwelt upon (p. 320). There is no 
confusion of ideas in this respect in the book, but its title 
seems apt to mislead, and if it could be altered now, it 
should appear as Hereditary Ability. 
The relation between genius in its technical sense 
(whatever its precise definition may be) and insanity, 
has been much insisted upon by Lombroso and others, 
whose views of the closeness of the connection between 
the two are so pronounced, that it would hardly be 
surprising if one of their more enthusiastic followers 
were to remark that So-and-So cannot be a genius, 
becauise he has never been mad nor is there a single 
lunatic in his family. I cannot go nearly so far as they, 
nor accept a moiety of their data, on which the connection 
between ability of a very high order and insanity is 
supposed to be established. Still, there is a large 
residuum of evidence which points to a painfully close 
relation between the two, and I must add that my own 
later observations have tended in the same direction, for 
I have been surprised at finding how often insanity or: 
idiocy has appeared among the near relatives of excep- 
tionally able men. Those who are over eager and ex- 
tremely active in mind must often possess brains that 
are more excitable and peculiar than is consistent with 
soundness. They are likely to become crazy at times,
-P-A-G-E-8
x PREFATORY CHAPTER 
  and perhaps to break down altogether. Their inborn 
excitability and peculiarity may be expected to appear 
in some of their relatives also, but unaccompanied with 
an equal dose of preservative qualities, whatever they 
may be. Those relatives would be “crank,” if not 
insane. 
There is much that is indefinite in the application of 
the word genius. It is applied to many a youth by his 
contemporaries, but more rarely by biographers, who do 
not always agree among themselves. If genius means a 
sense of inspiration, or of rushes of ideas from apparently 
supernatural sources, or of an inordinate and burning 
desire to accomplish any particular end, it is perilously 
near to the voices heard by the insane, to their delirious 
tendencies, or to their monomanias. It cannot in such 
cases be a healthy faculty, nor can it be desirable to 
perpetuate it by inheritance. The natural ability of 
which this book mainly treats, is such as a modern 
European possesses in a much greater average share 
than men of the lower races. There is nothing either in 
the history of domestic animals or in that of evolution to 
make us doubt that a race of sane men may be formed, 
who shall be as much superior mentally and morally to 
the modern European, as the modern European is to the 
lowest of the Negro races. Individual departures from 
this high average level in an upward direction would 
afford an adequate supply of a degree of ability that is 
exceedingly rare now, and is much wanted. 
It may prove helpful to the reader of the volume to 
insert in this introductory chapter a brief summary of its 
data and course of arguments. The primary object was 
to investigate whether and in what degree natural ability 
was hereditarily transmitted. This could not be easily
-P-A-G-E-9
  TO THE EDITION OF 1892 xi 
accomplished without a preliminary classification of ability 
according to a standard scale, so the first part of the book 
is taken up with an attempt to provide one. 
The method employed is based on the law commonly 
known to mathematicians as that of “frequency of error,” 
because it was devised by them to discover the frequency 
with which various proportionate amounts of error might 
be expected to occur in astronomical and geodetical opera- 
tions, and thereby to estimate the value that was probably 
nearest the truth, from a mass of slightly discordant 
measures of the same fact. 
Its application had been extended by Quetelet to the 
proportions of the human body, on the grounds that the 
differences, say in stature, between men of the same race 
might theoretically be treated as if they were Errors made 
by Nature in her attempt to mould individual men of the 
same race according to the same ideal pattern. Fantastic 
as such a notion may appear to be when it is expressed in 
these bare terms, without the accompaniment of a full 
explanation, it can be shown to rest on a perfectly just 
basis. Moreover, the theoretical predictions were found 
by him to be correct, and their correctness in analogous 
cases under reasonable reservations has been confirmed by 
multitudes of subsequent observations, of which perhaps 
the most noteworthy are those of Professor Weldon, on 
that humble creature the common shrimp (Proc. Royal 
Society, p. 2, vol. 51, 1892). 
One effect of the law may be expressed under this 
form, though it is not that which was used by Quetelet. 
Suppose 100 adult Englishmen to be selected at random, 
and ranged in the order of their statures in a row; the 
statures of the 50th and the 51st men would be almost 
identical, and would represent the average of all the
-P-A-G-E-10
  xii PREFATORY CHAPTER 
statures. Then the difference, according to the law of 
frequency, between them and the 63rd man would be the 
same as that between the 68rd and the 75th, the 75th 
and the 84th, the 84th and the 90th. The intervening 
men between these divisions, whose numbers are 18, 12, 
9, and 6, form a succession of classes, diminishing as we 
see in numbers, but each separated from its neighbours by 
equal grades of stature. The diminution of the successive 
classes is thus far small, but it would be found to proceed 
at an enormously accelerated rate if a much longer row 
than that of 100 men were taken, and if the classification 
were pushed much further, as is fully shown in this book. 
After some provisional verification, I applied this same 
law to mental faculties, working it backwards in order to 
obtain a scale of ability, and to be enabled thereby to give 
precision to the epithets employed, Thus the rank of first 
in 4,000 or thereabouts is expressed by the word “ eminent.” 
. The application of the law of frequency of error to mental 
faculties has now become accepted by many persons, for it 
is found to accord well with observation. I know of exam- 
iners who habitually use it to verify the general accuracy of 
the marks given to many candidates in the same examina- 
tion. Also I am informed by one mathematician that before 
dividing his examinees into classes, some regard is paid to 
this law. There is nothing said in this book about the law of 
frequency that subsequent experience has not confirmed 
and even extended, except that more emphatic warning 
is needed against its unchecked application. 
The next step was to gain a general idea as to the 
transmission of ability, founded upon a large basis of 
homogeneous facts by which to test the results that might 
be afterwards obtained from more striking but less homo- 
geneous data. It was necessary, in seeking for these, to
-P-A-G-E-11
  TO THE EDITION OF 1892 xiii 
  
sedulously guard against any bias of my own; it was also 
essential that the group to be dealt with should be suffi- 
ciently numerous for statistical treatment, and again, that 
the family histories of the persons it contained should be 
accessible, and, if possible, already published. 
The list at length adopted for this prefatory purpose 
was that of the English Judges since the Reformation. 
Their kinships were analyzed, and the percentage of 
their “eminent” relations in the various near degrees 
were tabulated and the results discussed. These were 
very striking, and seemed amply sufficient of themselves 
to prove the main question. Various objections to the 
validity of the inferences drawn from them may, how- 
ever, arise; they are considered, and, it is believed, 
disposed of, in the book. 
After doing this, a series of lists were taken in suc- 
cession, of the most illustrious statesmen, commanders, 
literary men, men of science, poets, musicians, and painters, 
of whom history makes mention. To each of these lists 
were added many English eminent men of recent times, 
whose biographies are familiar, or, if not, are easily acces- 
sible. The lists were drawn up without any bias of my 
own, for I always relied mainly upon the judgment of 
others, exercised without any knowledge of the object of 
the present inquiry, such as the selections made by his- 
torians or critics. After the lists of the illustrious men 
had been disposed of, a large group of eminent Protestant 
divines were taken in hand—namely, those who were in- 
cluded in Middleton’s once well known and highly esteemed 
biographical dictionary of such persons. Afterwards the 
Senior Classics of Cambridge were discussed, then the north 
country oarsmen and wrestlers. In the principal lists all 
the selected names were inserted, in which those who
-P-A-G-E-12
  xiv | PREFATORY CHAPTER 
were known to have eminent kinsmen were printed in 
italics, so the proportion of failures can easily be compared 
with that of the successes. Each list was followed, as the 
list of the judges had been, with a brief dictionary of 
kinships, all being afterwards tabulated and discussed in 
the same way. Finally the various results were brought 
together and compared, showing a remarkable general 
agreement, with a few interesting exceptions. One of 
these exceptions lay in the preponderating influence of the 
maternal side in the case of the divines ;. this was discussed 
and apparently accounted for. 
The remainder of the volume is taken up with topics 
that are suggested by the results of the former portion, 
such as the comparative worth of different races, the 
influences that affect the natural ability of nations, and 
finally a chapter of general considerations. 
If the work were rewritten, the part of the last chapter 
which refers to Darwin’s provisional theory of pangenesis 
would require: revision, and ought to be largely extended, 
in order to deal with the evidence for and against the 
hereditary transmission of habits that were not inborn, 
but had been acquired through practice. Marvellous as is 
the power of the theory of pangenesis in bringing large 
classes of apparently different phenomena under a single 
law, serious objections have since arisen to its validity, and 
prevented its general acceptance. It would, for example, 
almost compel us to believe that the hereditary trans- 
mission of accidental mutilations and of acquired aptitudes 
would be the rule and not the exception. But leaving 
out of the question all theoretical reasons against this 
belief, such as those which I put forward myself many 
years ago, as well as the more cogent ones adduced by 
Weissman in late years,—putting these wholly aside, and
-P-A-G-E-13
  TO THE EDITION OF 1892 xv 
appealing to experimental evidence, it is now certain that 
the tendency of acquired habits to be hereditarily trans- 
mitted is at the most extremely small. There may be 
some few cases, like those of Brown-Séquard’s guinea- 
pigs, in which injury to the nervous substance of the 
parents affects their offspring; but as a general rule, with 
scarcely any exception that cannot be ascribed to other 
influences, such as bad nutrition or transmitted microbes, 
the injuries or habits of the parents are found to have 
no effect on the natural form or faculties of the child. 
Whether very small hereditary influences of the supposed 
kind, accumulating in the same direction for many genera- 
tions, may not ultimately affect the qualities of the species, 
- seems to be the only point now seriously in question. 
Many illustrations have been offered, by those few per- 
sons of high authority who still maintain that acquired 
habits, such as the use or disuse of particular organs in 
the parents, admit of being hereditarily transmitted in a 
sufficient degree to notably affect the whole breed after 
many generations. Among these illustrations much stress 
has been laid on the diminishing size of the human jaw, 
in highly civilized peoples. It is urged that their food is 
better cooked and more toothsome than that of their 
ancestors, consequently the masticating apparatus of the 
race has dwindled through disuse. The truth of the 
evidence on which this argument rests is questionable, 
because it is not at all certain that non-European races 
who have more powerful jaws than ourselves use them 
more than we do. A Chinaman lives, and has lived for 
centuries, on rice and spoon-meat, or such over-boiled diet 
as his chopsticks can deal with. Equatorial Africans live 
to a great extent on bananas, or else on cassava, which, 
being usually of the poisonous kind, must be well boiled 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
  xvi | PREFATORY CHAPTER 
ee en Pe ee 
before it is eaten, in order to destroy the poison. Many o 
the Eastern Archipelago islanders live on sago. Pastoral! 
tribes eat meat occasionally, but their usual diet is milk} 
or curds. It is only the hunting tribes who habitually live| 
upon tough meat. It follows that the diminishing size o: 
the human jaw in highly civilized people must be ascribed 
to other causes, such as those, whatever they may be, that 
reduce the weight of the whole skeleton in delicately 
nurtured animals. 
It seems feasible to subject the question to experiment, 
whether certain acquired habits, acting during at least ten, 
twenty, or more generations, have any sensible effects on 
the race. I will repeat some remarks on this subject which 
I made two years ago, first in a paper read at a Congress 
in Paris, and afterwards at the British Association at 
Neweastle. The position taken was that the experiments 
ought to be made ona large scale, and upon creatures that 
were artificially hatched, and therefore wholly isolated 
from maternal teachings. Fowls, moths, and fish were the 
particular creatures suggested. Fowls are reared in in- 
cubators at very many,places on a large scale, especially in 
France. It seemed not difficult to devise practices as- 
sociated with peculiar calls to food, with colours connected 
with food, or with food that was found to be really good 
though deterrent in appearance, and in certain of the 
breeding-places to regularly subject the chicks to these 
practices. Then, after many generations had passed by, to 
examine whether or no the chicks of the then generation 
had acquired any instinct for performing them, by compar- 
ing their behaviour with that of chicks reared in other 
places. As regards moths, the silkworm industry is so 
extensive and well understood that there would be abund- . 
ant opportunity for analogous experiments with moths,
-P-A-G-E-15
   
      TO THE EDITION OF 1892 xvii 
  
both in France and Italy. The establishments for piscictl- 
ture afford another field. It would not be worth while to 
initiate courses of such experiments unless the crucial 
value of what they could teach us when completed had first 
been fully assented to. To my own mind they would rank 
as crucial experiments so far as they went, and be worth 
undertaking, but they did not appear to strike others so 
strongly in the same light. Of course before any such 
experiments were set on foot, they would have to be con- 
sidered in detail by many competent minds, and be closely 
criticised. 
Another topic would have been treated at more length 
if this book were rewritten—namely, the distinction be- 
tween variations and sports. It would even require a 
remodelling of much of the existing matter. The views 
I have been brought to entertain, since it was written, are 
amplifications of those which are already put forward in 
pp. 354-5, but insufficiently pushed there to their logical 
conclusion. They are, that the word variation is used 
indiscriminately to express two fundamentally distinct 
conceptions : sports, and variations properly so called. It 
has been shown in Natwral Inheritance that the distribution 
of faculties in a population cannot possibly remain con- 
stant, if, on the average, the children resemble their parents. 
If they did so, the giants (in any mental or physical par- 
ticular) would become more gigantic, and the dwarfs more 
dwarfish, in each successive generation. The counteract- 
ing tendency is what I called “regression.” The filial 
centre is not the same as the parental centre, but it is nearer 
to mediocrity ; it regresses towards the racial centre. In    
     
   
                  other words, the filial centre (or the fraternal centre, if we 
change the point of view) is always nearer, on the average, 
to the racial centre than the parental centre was. There 
wie?    
-P-A-G-E-16
       
   
  PREFATORY CHAPTER    xviii 
  
   
    «“ must be an average “regression” in passing from the 
parental to the filial centre. 
It is impossible briefly to give a full idea, in this place, 
either of the necessity or of the proof of regression ; they 
have been thoroughly discussed in the work in question. 
Suffice it to say, that the result gives precision to the 
idea of a typical centre from which individual variations 
occur in accordance with the law of frequency, often to 
a small amount, more rarely to a larger one, very rarely 
indeed to one that is much larger, and practically never 
to one that is larger still. The filial centre falls back 
further towards mediocrity in a constant proportion to the 
distance to which the parental centre has deviated from it, 
whether the direction of the deviation be in excess or in 
deficiency. All true variations are (as I maintain) of 
this kind, and it is in consequence impossible that the 
          
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
        
                              
   
   
   natural qualities of a race may be permanently changed 
through the action of selection upon mere variations. The 
selection of the most serviceable variations cannot even 
produce any great degree of artificial and temporary im- 
provement, because an equilibrium between deviation and 
regression will soon be reached, whereby the best of the 
offspring will cease to be better than their own sires and 
dams. 
The case is quite different in respect to what are tech- 
nically known as “sports.” In these, a new character 
suddenly makes its appearance in a particular individual, 
causing him to differ distinctly from his parents and from 
others of his race. Such new characters are also found to 
be transmitted 1o descendants. Here there has been a 
change of typical centre,a new point of departure has 
somehow come into existence, towards which regression 
has henceforth to be measured, and consequently a real
-P-A-G-E-17
    TO THE EDITION OF 1892 xix 
tep forward has been made in the course of evolution. 
When natural selection favours a particular sport, it works 
ffectively towards the formation of a new species, but the 
favour that it simultaneously shows to mere variations 
seems to be thrown away, so far as that end is concerned. 
There may be entanglement between a sport and a 
variation which leads to a hybrid and unstable result, well 
exemplified in the imperfect character of the fusion of dif- 
ferent human races. Here numerous pure specimens of their 
several ancestral types are apt to crop out, notwithstanding 
the intermixture by marriage that had been going on for 
many previous generations. 
It has occurred to others as well as myself, as to Mr. 
Wallace and to Professor Romanes, that the time may 
have arrived when an institute for experiments on here- 
dity might be established with advantage. A farm and 
garden of a very few acres, with varied exposure, and well 
supplied with water, placed under the charge of intelligent 
caretakers, supervised by a biologist, would afford the 
necessary basis for a great variety of research upon in- 
expensive animals and plants. The difficulty lies in the 
smallness of the number of competent persons who are 
actively engaged in hereditary inquiry, who could be de- 
pended upon to use it properly. 
The direct result of this inquiry is to make manifest the 
great and measurable differences between the mental and 
bodily faculties of individuals, and to prove that the laws 
of heredity are as applicable to the former as to the latter. 
Its indirect result is to show that a vast but unused power 
is vested in each generation over the very natures of their 
successors—that is, over their inborn faculties and disposi- 
tions. The brute power of doing this by means of appro- 
priate marriages or abstention from marriage undoubtedly

exists, however much the circumstances of social life ma: 
hamper its employment! The great problem of the futur 
betterment of the human race is confessedly, at the presen’ 
time, hardly advanced beyond the stage of academic inter: 
est, but thought and action move swiftly nowadays, an 
it is by no means impossible that a generation which ha: 
witnessed the exclusion of the Chinese race from the cus 
tomary privileges of settlers in two continents, and th 
deportation of a Hebrew population from a large portion! 
of a third, may live to see other analogous acts performed 
under sudden socialistic pressure. The striking results of 
an evil inheritance have already forced themselves so far| 
on the popular mind, that indignation is freely expressed, 
without any marks of disapproval from others, at the yearly 
output by unfit parents of weakly children who are con- 
stitutionally incapable of growing up into serviceable 
citizens, and who are a serious encumbrance to the nation. 
The questions about to be considered may unexpectedly 
acquire importance as falling within the sphere of practical 
politics, and if so, many demographic data that require 
forethought and time to collect, and a dispassionate and 
leisurely judgment to discuss, will be hurriedly and sorely 
needed. 
The topics to which I refer are the relative fertility of 
different classes and races, and their tendency to supplant 
one another under various circumstances. 
The whole question of fertility under the various con- 
ditions of civilized life requires more detailed research 
than it has yet received. We require further investigations 
into the truth of the hypothesis of Malthus, that there is 
really no limit to over-population beside that which is

International Congress of Demography, held in London in 1892.

fforded by misery or prudential restraint. Is it true that 
isery, in any justifiable sense of that word, provides the 
nly check which acts automatically, or are other causes in 
existence, active, though as yet obscure, that assist in re- 
straining the overgrowth of population? Itis certain that 
the productiveness of different marriages differs greatly 
in consequence of unexplained conditions. The variation 
in fertility of different kinds of animals that have been 
captured when wild and afterwards kept in menageries is, 
as Darwin long since pointed out, most notable and appar- 
ently capricious. The majority of those which thrive in con- 
finement, and apparently enjoy excellent health, are never- 
theless absolutely infertile; others, often of closely allied 
species, have their productivity increased. One of the 
many evidences of our great ignorance of the laws that 
govern fertility, is seen in the behaviour of bees, who have 
somehow discovered that by merely modifying the diet and 
the size of the nursery of any female grub, they can at 
will cause it to develop, either into a naturally sterile 
worker, or into the potential mother of a huge hive. 
Demographers have, undoubtedly, collected and collated 
a vast amount of information bearing on the fertility of 
different nations, but they have mainly attacked the prob- 
lem in the gross and not in detail, so that we possess little 
more than mean values that are applicable to general 
populations, and are very valuable in their way, but we 
remain ignorant of much else, that a moderate amount of 
judiciously directed research might, perhaps, be able to tell. 
As an example of what could be sought with advantage, 
+ us suppose that we take a number, sufficient for 
statistical purposes, of ‘persons occupying different social 
classes, those who are the least efficient in physical, intel- 
lectual, and moral grounds, forming our lowest class, and  
-P-A-G-E-20
  xxii | PREFATORY CHAPTER 
  
those who are the most efficient forming our highest class] 
The question to be solved relates to the hereditary per: 
manence of the several classes. What proportion of each 
class is descended from parents who belong to the same 
class, and what proportion is descended from parents whol 
belong to each of the other classes? Do those persons 
who have honourably succeeded in life, and who are: pre- 
sumably, on the whole, the most valuable portion of our' 
human stock, contribute on the aggregate their fair share 
of posterity to the next generation? If not, do they con- 
tribute more or less than their fair share, and in what 
degree? In other words, is the evolution of man in each 
particular country, favourably or injuriously affected by its 
special form of civilization ? 
Enough is already known to make it certain that the 
productiveness of both the extreme classes, the best and 
the worst, falls short of the average of the nation as a 
whole, Therefore, the most prolific class necessarily lies 
between the two extremes, but at what intermediate point 
does it lie? Taken altogether, on any reasonable principle, 
are the natural gifts of the most prolific class, bodily, in- 
tellectual, and moral, above or below the line of national 
mediocrity? If above that line, then the existing con- 
ditions are favourable to the improvement of the race. If 
they are below that line, they must work towards its 
degradation. 
These very brief remarks serve to shadow out the prob- 
lem; it would require much more space than is now 
available, before it could be phrased in a way free from 
ambiguity, so that its solution would clearly instruct us 
whether the conditions of life at any period in any given 
race were tending to raise or to depress its natural 
qualities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21

Whatever other countries may or may not have lost, 
ours has certainly gained on more than one occasion by 
the infusion of the breed of selected sub-races, especially 
of that of the Protestant refugees from religious persecu- 
tion on the Continent. It seems reasonable to look upon 
the Huguenots as men who, on the whole, had inborn 
qualities of a distinctive kind from the majority of their 
countrymen, and who may, therefore, be spoken of as a 
sub-type—that is to say, capable, when isolated, of con- 
tinuing their race without its showing any strong tendency 
to revert to the form of the earlier type from which it was 
a well-defined departure. It proved, also, that the cross 
breed between them and our ancestors was a singularly 
successful mixture. Consequently, England has been 
largely indebted to the natural refinement and to the solid 
worth of the Huguenot breed, as well as to the culture 
and technical knowledge that the Huguenots brought 
with them. 
The frequency in history with which one race has sup- 
planted another over wide geographical areas is one of the 
most striking facts in the evolution of mankind. The deni- 
zens of the world at the present day form a very different 
human stock to that which inhabited it a dozen generations 
ago, and to all appearance a no less difference will be found 
in our successors a dozen of generations hence. Partly it 
may be that new human varieties have come into per- 
manent or only into temporary existence, like that most re- 
markable mixed race of the Normans many centuries ago, 
in whom, te use well-known words of the late Professor 
Freeman, the indomitable vigour of the Scandinavians, 
joined to the buoyant vivacity of the Gaul, produced the 
conquering and ruling race of Europe. But principally 
the change of which I spoke is due to great alterations in
-P-A-G-E-22
  xxiv | PREFATORY CHAPTER 
the proportions of those who belong to the old and well 
established types. The Negro now born in the United 
States has much the same natural faculties as his distant 
cousin who is born in Africa ; the effect of his transplanta- 
tion being ineffective in changing his. nature, but very 
effective in increasing his numbers, in enlarging the range 
of his distribution, and in destroying native American races. 
There are now some 8,000,000 of Negroes in lands where 
not one of them existed twelve generations ago, and prob- 
ably not one representative of the race which they displaced 
remains there; on the other hand, there has been no 
corresponding diminution of numbers in the parent home 
of the Negro. Precisely the same may be said of the 
European races who have during the same period swarmed 
over the temperate regions of the globe, forming the nuclei 
of many future nations. 
It is impossible, even in the vaguest way, in a brief 
space, to give a just idea of the magnitude and variety of 
changes produced in the human stock by the political 
events of the last few generations, and it would be difficult 
to do so in such a way as not to seriously wound the 
patriotic susceptibilities of many readers. The natural 
temperaments and moral ideals of different races are 
various, and praise or blame cannot be applied at the dis- 
cretion of one person without exciting remonstrance from 
others who take different views with perhaps equal justice. 
The birds and beasts assembled in conclave may try to 
pass a unanimous resolution in favour of the natural duty 
of the mother to nurture and protect her offspring, but the 
cuckoo would musically protest. The Irish Celt may desire 
the extension of his race and the increase of its influence 
in the representative governments of England and America, 
but the wishes of his Anglo-Saxon or Teuton fellow-sub-
-P-A-G-E-23

jects may lie in the opposite direction ; and so on indefin- 
itely. My object now is merely to urge inquiries into the 
historical fact whether legislation, which has led to the 
substitution on a large scale of one race for another, has 
not often been the outcome of conflicting views into which 
the question of race hardly entered at all, and which were 
so nearly balanced that if the question of race had been 
properly introduced into the discussion the result might 
have been different. The possibility of such being the 
case cannot be doubted, and affords strong reason for justly 
appraising the influence of race, and of hereafter including 
it at neither more nor less than its real value, among the 
considerations by which political action will be determined. 
The importance to be attached to race is a question that 
deserves a far larger measure of exact investigation than 
it receives. We are exceedingly ignorant of the respective 
ranges of the natural and acquired faculties in different 
races, and there is too great a tendency among writers 
to dogmatize wildly about them, some grossly magnifying, 
others as greatly minimising their several provinces. It 
seems however possible to answer this question unam- 
* biguously, difficult as it is. 
The recent attempts by many European nations to utilize 
Africa for their own purposes gives immediate and practical 
interest to inquiries that bear on the transplantation of 
races. They compel us to face the question as to what 
races should be politically aided to become hereafter the 
chief occupiers of that continent. The varieties of 
Negroes, Bantus, Arab half-breeds, and others who now 
inhabit Africa are very numerous, and they differ much 
from one another in their natural qualities. Some of them 
must be more suitable than others to thrive under that 
form of moderate civilization which is likely to be intro-
-P-A-G-E-24
    xxvi PREFATORY CHAPTER 
duced into Africa by Europeans, who will enforce justice 
and order, excite a desire among the natives for comforts 
and luxuries, and make steady industry almost a condition 
of living at all. Such races would spread and displace the 
others by degrees. Or it may prove that the Negroes, 
one and all, will fail as completely under the new con- 
ditions as they have failed under the old ones, to submit 
to the needs of a superior civilization to their own ; in this 
case their races, numerous and prolific as they are, will in 
course of time be supplanted and replaced by their betters. 
It seems scarcely possible as yet to assure ourselves as 
to the possibility of any variety of white men to work, to 
thrive, and to continue their race in the broad regions of 
the tropics. Wecould not do so without better knowledge 
than we now possess of the different capacities of indivi- 
duals to withstand their malarious and climatic influences, 
Much more care is taken to select appropriate varieties of 
plants and animals for plantation in foreign settlements, 
than to select appropriate types of men. Discrimination 
and foresight are shown in the one case, an indifference 
born of ignorance is shown in the other. The importance 
is not yet sufficiently recognized of a more exact examina- * 
tion and careful record than is now made of the physical 
qualities and hereditary antecedents of candidates for em- 
ployment in tropical countries. We require these records 
to enable us to learn hereafter what are the conditions in 
youth that are prevalent among those whose health sub- 
sequently endured the change of climatic influence satis- 
factorily, and conversely as regards those who failed. It is 
scarcely possible to properly conduct such an investigation 
retrospectively. , ' 
In conclusion I wish again to emphasize the fact that 
¥ the improvement of the natural gifts of future generations
-P-A-G-E-25
  TO THE EDITION OF 1892 xxvii 
of the human race is largely, though indirectly, under our 
control. We may not be able to originate, but we can guide. 
The processes of evolution are in constant and spontaneous 
activity, some pushing towards the bad, some towards the 
good. Our part is to watch for opportunities to intervene 
by checking the former and giving free play to the latter. 
We must distinguish clearly between our power in this 
fundamental respect and that which we also possess of 
ameliorating education and hygiene. It is earnestly to be 
hoped that inquiries will be increasingly directed into 
historical facts, with the view of estimating the possible 
effects of reasonable political action in the future, in gra- 
dually raising the present miserably low standard of the 
human race to one in which the Utopias in the dreamland 
of philanthropists may become practical possibilities.

  HEREDITARY GENIUS 
INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 
I propose to show in this book that a man’s natural 
abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the’ 
same limitations as are the form and physical features of: 
the whole organic world. Consequently, as it is easy, 
notwithstanding those limitations, to obtain by careful 
selection a permanent breed of dogs or horses gifted with 
peculiar powers of running, or of doing anything else, so 
it would be quite practicable to produce a highly-gifted 
race of men by judicious marriages during several con- 
secutive generations. I shall show that social agencies of 
an ordinary character, whose influences are little suspected, 
are at this moment working towards the degradation of 
human nature, and that others are working towards its 
improvement. I conclude that each generation has enor- 
mous power over the natural gifts of those that follow, 
and maintain that it is a duty we owe to humanity to 
investigate the range of that power, and to exercise it 
in a way that, without being unwise towards ourselves, 
shall be most advantageous to future inhabitants of the 
earth, 
I am aware that my views, which were first published 
four years ago in Macmillan’s Magazine (in June and 
August 1865), are in contradiction to general opinion ; but 
the arguments I then used have been since accepted, to my 
E 3 B  
-P-A-G-E-32
  2 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER 
  
great gratification, by many of the highest authorities on! 
heredity. In reproducing them, as I now do, in a much 
more elaborate form, and on a greatly enlarged basis of 
induction, I feel assured that, inasmuch as what I then 
wrote was sufficient to earn the acceptance of Mr. Darwin 
(“Domestication of Plants and Animals,” ii. 7), the increased 
amount of evidence submitted in the present volume is not 
likely to be gainsaid. 
The general plan of my argument is to show that high 
reputation is a pretty accurate test of high ability ; next 
to discuss the relationships of a large body of fairly 
eminent men—namely, the Judges of England from 1660 
to 1868, the Statesmen of the time of George III., and 
the Premiers during the last 100 years—and to obtain 
from these a general survey of the laws of heredity in 
respect to genius. Then I shall examine, in order, the 
kindred of the most illustrious Commanders, men of 
Literature and of Science, Poets, Painters, and Musicians, 
of whom history speaks. I shall also discuss the kindred 
of a certain selection of Divines and of modern Scholars. 
Then will follow a short chapter, by way of comparison, 
on the hereditary transmission of physical gifts, as deduced 
from the relationships of certain classes of Oarsmen and 
Wrestlers. Lastly, I shall collate my results, and draw 
conclusions. 
It will be observed that I deal with more than one 
grade of ability. Those upon whom the greater part of 
my volume is occupied, and on whose kinships my argu- 
ment is most securely based, have been generally reputed 
as endowed by nature with extraordinary genius. There 
are so few of these men that, although they are scattered 
throughout the whole historical period of human existence, 
their number does not amount to more than 400, and yet 
a considerable proportion of them will be found to be 
interrelated. 
Another grade of ability with which I deal is that which 
includes numerous highly eminent, and all the illustrious 
names of modern English history, whose immediate de- 
scendants are living among us, whose histories are popularly 
known, and whose relationships may readily be traced by
-P-A-G-E-33
  INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER 3 
  
the help of biographical dictionaries, peerages, and similar 
books of reference. 
A third and lower grade is that of the English Judges, 
massed together as a whole, for the purpose of the pre- 
fatory statistical inquiry of which I have already spoken. 
No one doubts that many of the ablest intellects of our 
race are to be found among the Judges; nevertheless the 
average ability of a Judge cannot be rated as equal to that 
of the lower of the two grades I have described. 
I trust the reader will make allowance for a large and 
somewhat important class of omissions I have felt myself 
compelled to make when treating of the eminent men 
of modern days. I am prevented by a sense of decorum 
from quoting names of their relations in contemporary life 
who are not recognized as public characters, although their 
abilities may be highly appreciated in private life. Still 
less consistent with decorum would it have been, to intro- 
duce the names of female relatives that stand in the same 
category. My case is so overpoweringly strong, that I am 
perfectly able to prove my point without having recourse 
to this class of evidence. Nevertheless, the reader should 
bear in mind that it exists; and I. beg he will do me 
the justice of allowing that I have not overlooked the 
whole of the evidence that does not appear in my pages. 
I am deeply conscious of the imperfection of my work, 
but my sins are those of omission, not of commission. 
Such errors as I may and must have made, which give 
a fictitious support to my arguments, are, I am confident, 
out of all proportion fewer than such omissions of facts as 
would have helped to establish them. 
I have taken little notice in this book of modern men 
of eminence who are not English, or at least well known 
to Englishmen. I feared, if I included large classes of 
foreigners, that I should make glaring errors. It requires 
a very great deal of labour to hunt out relationships, 
even with the facilities afforded to a countryman having 
access to persons acquainted with the various families; 
much more would it have been difficult to hunt out the 
kindred of foreigners. I should have especially liked to 
investigate the biographies of Italians and Jews, both of 
B2

whom appear to be rich in families of high intellectual] 
breeds. Germany and America are also full of interest. 
It is a little less so with respect to France, where the 
Revolution and the guillotine made sad havoc among the 
progeny of her abler races. 
There is one advantage to a candid critic in my having 
left so large a field untouched; it enables me to propose 
a test that any well-informed reader may easily adopt who 
doubts the fairness of my examples. » He may most reason- 
ably suspect that I have~been unconsciously influenced 
by my theories to select men whose kindred were most 
favourable to their support. If so, I beg he will test my 
impartiality as follows :—Let him take a dozen names of 
his own selection, as the most eminent in whatever pro- 
fession and in whatever country he knows most about, and 
let him trace out for himself their relations. It is necessary, 
as I find by experience, to take some pains to be sure that 
none, even of the immediate relatives, on either the male 
or female side, have been overlooked. If he does what 
I propose, I am confident he will be astonished at the 
completeness with which the results will confirm my 
theory. I venture to speak with assurance, because it has 
often occurred to me to propose this very test to incre- 
dulous friends, and invariably, so far as my memory serves 
me, as large a proportion of the men who were named 
were discovered to have eminent relations, as the nature 
of my views on heredity would have led me to expect.
-P-A-G-E-35
  CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 5 
CLASSIFICATION OF MEN ACCORDING TO 
THEIR REPUTATION 
THE arguments by which I endeavour to prove that 
genius is hereditary, consist in showing how large is the 
number of instances in which men who are more or less 
illustrious have eminent kinsfolk. It is necessary to have 
clear ideas on the two following matters before my argu- 
ments can be rightly appreciated. The first is the degree 
of selection implied by the words “ eminent” and “ illus- 
trious.” Does “eminent” mean the foremost in a hundred, 
in a thousand, or in what other number of men? The 
second is the degree to which reputation may be accepted 
as a test of ability. 
It is essential that I, who write, should have a minimum 
qualification distinctly before my eyes whenever I employ 
the phrases “eminent” and the like, and that the reader 
should understand as clearly as myself the value I ‘attach 
to those qualifications. An explanation of these words 
will be the subject of the present chapter. A subsequent 
chapter will be given to the discussion of how far 
“eminence” may be accepted as a criterion of natural 
gifts. It is almost needless for me to insist, that the sub- 
jects of these two chapters are entirely distinct. 
T look upon social and professional life as a continuous 
examination. All are candidates for the good opinions of 
others, and for success in their several professions, and they 
achieve success in proportion as the general estimate is 
large of their aggregate merits. In ordinary scholastic 
examinations marks are allotted im stated proportions to
-P-A-G-E-36
    6 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
various specified subjects—so many for Latin, so many for 
Greek, so many for English history, and the rest. The 
world, in the same way, but almost unconsciously, allots 
marks to men. It gives them for originality of conception, 
for enterprise, for activity and energy, for administrative | 
skill, for various acquirements, for power of literary ex- 
pression, for oratory, and much besides of general value, 
as well as for more specially professional merits. It does 
not allot these marks according to a proportion that can 
easily be stated in words, but there is a rough common- 
sense that governs its practice with a fair approximation 
to constancy. Those who have gained most of these 
tacit marks are ranked, by the common judgment of the 
leaders of opinion, as the foremost men of their day. 
The metaphor of an examination may be stretched much 
further. As there are alternative groups in any one of 
which a candidate may obtain honours, so it is with repu- 
tations—they may be made in law, literature, science, art, 
and in a host of other pursuits. Again: as the mere 
attainment of a general fair level will obtain no honours 
in an examination, no more will it do so in the struggle 
for eminence. A man must show conspicuous power in at 
least one subject in order to achieve a high reputation. 
Let us see how the world classifies people, after ex- 
amining each of them, in her patient, persistent manner, 
during the years of their manhood. How many men of 
“eminence” are there, and what proportion do they bear 
to the whole community ? 
I will begin by analysing a very painstaking biographical 
handbook, lately published by Routledge and Co., called 
“Men of the Time.” Its intention, which is very fairly 
and honestly carried out, is to include none but those 
whom the world honours for their ability. The catalogue 
of names is 2,500, and a full half of it consists of American 
and Continental celebrities. It is well I should give ina 
foot-note ! an analysis of its contents, in order to show the 
1 Contents of the ‘* Dictionary of Men of the Time,” Ed. 1865 :— 
62 actors, singers, dancers, &c. ; 7 agriculturists ; 71 antiquaries, archie- 
ologists, numismatists, &c. ; 20 architects; 120 artists (painters and 
designers); 950 authors; 400 divines; 43 engineers and mechanicians ;
-P-A-G-E-37
  ACCORDING TO THEIR REPUTATION 7 
  
exhaustive character of its range. The numbers I have 
prefixed to each class are not strictly accurate, for I 
measured them off rather than counted them, but they 
are quite close enough. The same name often appears 
under more than one head. 
On looking over the book, I am surprised to find how 
large a proportion of the “Men of the Time” are past 
middle age. It appears that in the cases of high (but by 
no means in that of the highest) merit, a man must outlive 
the age of fifty to be sure of being widely appreciated. 
It takes time for an able man, born in the humbler ranks 
of life, to emerge from them and to take his natural posi- 
tion. It would not, therefore, be just to compare the 
numbers of Englishmen in the book with that of the whole 
adult male population of the British isles ; but it is neces-. 
sary to confine our examination to those of the celebrities 
who are past fifty years of age, and to compare their number 
with that of the whole male population who are also above 
fifty years. I estimate, from examining a large part of 
the book, that there are about 850 of these men, and that 
500 of them are decidedly well known to persons familiar 
with literary and scientific society. Now, there are about 
two millions of adult males in the British isles above fifty 
years of age ; consequently, the total number of the “Men 
of the Time” are as 425 to a million, and the more select 
part of them as 250 to a million. 
The qualifications for belonging to what I call the more 
select part are, in my mind, that a man should have dis- 
tinguished himself pretty frequently either by purely 
original work, or as a leader of opinion. I wholly 
exclude notoriety obtained by a single act. This is 
a fairly well-defined line, because there is not room for 
10 engravers ; 140 lawyers, judges, barristers, and legists; 94 medical 
practitioners, physicians, surgeons, and physiologists; 39 merchants, 
capitalists, manufacturers, and traders ; 168 military officers; 12 miscel- 
laneous ; 7 moral and metaphysical philosophers, logicians ; 32 musicians 
and composers ; 67 naturalists, botanists, zoologists, &c. ; 36 naval officers ; 
40 philologists and ethnologists ; 60 poets (but also included in authors) ; 
60 political and social economists and philanthropists ; 154 men of science, 
astronomers, chemists, geologists, mathematicians, &c. ; 29 sculptors; 
64 sovereigns, members of royal families, &c. ; 376 statesmen, diplomatists, 
colonial governors, &c. ; 76 travellers and geographers.
-P-A-G-E-38
  8 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
many men to be eminent. ach interest or idea has 
its mouthpiece, and a man who has attained and can 
maintain his position as the representative of a party 
or an idea, naturally becomes much more conspicuous 
than his coadjutors who are nearly equal but inferior in 
ability. This is eminently the case in positions where 
eminence may be won by official acts. The balance may 
be turned by a grain that decides whether A, B, or C 
shall be promoted to a vacant post. The man who 
obtains it has opportunities of distinction denied to the’ 
others. I do not, however, take much note of official 
rank. People who have left very great names behind 
them have mostly done so through non-professional 
labours. I certainly should not include mere officials, 
except of the highest ranks, and in open professions, 
among my select list of eminent men. 
Another estimate of the proportion of eminent men 
to the whole population was made on a different basis, 
and gave much the same result. I took the obituary 
of the year 1868, published in the Zimes on January Ist, 
1869, and found in it about fifty names of men of the 
more select class. This was in one sense a broader, and 
in another a more rigorous selection than that which I 
have just described. It was broader, because I included 
the names of many whose abilities were high, but who 
died too young to have earned the wide reputation they 
deserved; and it was more rigorous, because I excluded 
old men who had earned distinction in years gone by, 
but had not shown themselves capable in later times 
to come again to the front. On the first ground, it was 
necessary to lower the limit of the age of the population 
with whom they should be compared. Forty-five years 
of age seemed to me .a fair limit, including, as it was 
supposed to do, a year or two of broken health preceding 
decease. Now, 210,000 males die annually in the British 
isles above the age of forty-five; therefore, the ratio 
of the more select portion of the “Men of the Time” 
on these data is as 50 to 210,000, or as 288 to a 
million. 
Thirdly, I consulted obituaries of many years back.
-P-A-G-E-39
  : ACCORDING TO THEIR REPUTATION 9 
when the population of these islands was much smaller, 
and they appeared to me to lead to similar conclusions, 
viz. that 250 to a million is an ample estimate. 
There would be no difficulty in making a further selec- 
tion out of these, to any degree of rigour. We could 
select the 200, the 100, or the fifty best out of the 250, 
without much uncertainty. But I do not see my way 
to work downwards. If I were asked to choose the 
thousand per million best men, I should feel we had 
descended to a level where there existed no sure data 
for guidance, where accident and opportunity had undue 
influence, and where it was impossible to distinguish 
general eminence from local reputation, or from mere 
notoriety. 
These considerations define the sense in which I 
propose to employ the word “eminent.” When I speak 
of an eminent man, I mean one who has achieved a 
position that is attained by only 250 persons in each 
million of men, or by one person in each 4,000. 4,000 
is a very large number—difficult for persons to realize 
who are not accustomed to deal with great assemblages. 
On the most brilliant of starlight nights there are 
never so many as 4,000 stars visible to the naked eye 
at the same time; yet we feel it to be an extraordinary 
distinction to a star to be accounted as the brightest 
in the sky. This, be it remembered, is my narrowest 
area of selection. I propose to introduce no name 
whatever into my lists of kinsmen (unless it be marked 
off from the rest by brackets) that is less distin- 
guished. 
The mass of those with whom I deal are far more 
rigidly selected—many are as one in a million, and not 
a few as one of many millions. I use the term “ illus- 
trious ” when speaking of these. They are men whom the 
whole intelligent part of the nation mourns when they die ; 
who have, or deserve to have, a public funeral; and who 
rank in future ages as historical characters. 
Permit me to add a word upon the meaning of a million, 
being a number so enormous as to be difficult to conceive. 
It is well to have a standard by which to realize it. Mine

will be understood by many Londoners ; it is as follows :-— 
One summer day I passed the afternoon in Bushey Park 
to see the magnificent spectacle of its avenue of horse- 
chestnut trees, a mile long, in full flower. As the hours 
passed by, it occurred to me to try to count the number 
of spikes of flowers facing the drive on one side of the 
long avenue—I mean all the spikes that were visible in 
full sunshine on one side of the road. Accordingly,I fixed 
upon a tree of average bulk and flower, and drew ima- 
ginary lines—first halving the tree, then quartering, and 
so on, until I arrived at a subdivision that was not too 
large to allow of my counting the spikes of flowers it 
included. I did this with three different trees, and arrived 
at pretty much the same result: as well as I recollect, the 
three estimates were as nine, ten, and eleven. Then I 
counted the trees in the avenue, and, multiplying all to- 
gether, I found the spikes to be just about 100,000 in 
number. Ever since then, whenever a million is mentioned, 
I recall the long perspective of the avenue of Bushey Park, 
with its stately chestnuts clothed from top to bottom with 
spikes of flowers, bright in the sunshine, and I imagine a 
similarly continuous floral band, of ten miles in length. 
In illustration of the value of the extreme rigour 
implied by a selection of one in a million, I will take 
the following instance. The Oxford and Cambridge boat- 
race excites almost a national enthusiasm, and the men 
who represent their Universities as competing crews have 
good reason to be proud of being the selected champions 
of such large bodies. The crew of each boat consists of 
eight men, selected out of about 800 students ; namely, the 
available undergraduates of about two successive years. In 
other words, the selection that is popularly felt to be so 
strict, is only as one in a hundred. Now, suppose there 
had been so vast a number of universities that it would 
have been possible to bring together 800 men, each of 
whom had pulled in a University crew, and that from this 
body the eight best were selected to form a special crew 
of comparatively rare merit : the selection of each of these 
would be as 1 to 10,000 ordinary men. Let this process 
be repeated, and then, and not till then, do you arrive at
-P-A-G-E-41
  ACCORDING TO THEIR REPUTATION wu 
  
a superlative crew, representing selections of one in a 
million, This is a perfectly fair deduction, because the 
youths at the Universities are a hap-hazard collection 
of men, so far as regards their thews and sinews. No 
one is sent to a University on account of his powerful 
muscle. Or, to put the same facts into another form :— 
it would require a period of no less than 100 years, before 
either University could furnish eight men, each of whom 
would have sufficient boating eminence to rank as one of 
the medium crew. Ten thousand years must elapse 
before eight men could be furnished, each of whom would 
have the rank of the superlative crew. 
It is, however, quite another matter with respect to brain 
power, for, as I shall have occasion to show, the Uni- 
versities attract to themselves a large proportion of the 
eminent scholastic talent of all England. There are 
nearly a quarter of a million males in Great Britain who 
arrive oe year at the proper age for going to the Uni- 
versity® therefore, if Cambridge, for example, received only 
one in every five of the ablest scholastic intellects, she 
would be able, in every period of twenty years, to boast of 
the fresh arrival of an undergraduate, the rank of whose 
scholastic eminence was that of one in a million.

I HAVE no patience with the hypothesis occasionally ex- 
pressed, and often implied, especially in tales written to 
teach children to be good, that babies are born pretty 
much alike, and that the sole agencies in creating dif- 
ferences between boy and boy, and man and man, are 
steady application and moral effort. It is in th® most 
unqualified manner that I object to pretensions of natural 
equality. The experiences of the nursery, the school, the 
University, and of professional careers, are a chain of 
proofs to the contrary. I acknowledge freely the great 
power of education and social influences in developing 
the active powers of the mind, just as I acknowledge the 
effect of use in developing the muscles of a blacksmith’s 
arm, and no further. Let the blacksmith labour as he 
will, he will find there are certain feats beyond his power 
that are well within the strength of a man of herculean 
make, even although the latter may have led a sedentary 
life. Some years ago, the Highlanders held a grand 
gathering in Holland Park, where they challenged all 
England to compete with them in their games of strength. 
The challenge was accepted, and the well-trained men of 
the hills were beaten in the foot-race by a youth who 
was stated to be a pure Cockney, the clerk of a London 
banker. 
Everybody who has trained himself to physical exercises 
discovers the extent of his muscular powers to a nicety. 
When he begins to walk, to row, to use the dumb bells,

or to run, he: finds to his great delight that his thews 
strengthen, and his endurance of fatigue increases day after 
day. So long as he is a novice, he perhaps flatters himself 
there is hardly an assignable limit to the education of his 
muscles ; but the daily gain is soon discovered to diminish, 
and at last it vanishes altogether, His maximum per- 
formance becomes a rigidly determinate quantity. He 
learns to an inch, how high or how far he can jump, when 
he has attained the highest state of training. He learns 
to half a pound, the force he can exert on the dyna- 
mometer, by compressing it. He can strike a blow against 
the machine used to measure impact, and drive its index 
to a certain graduation, but no further. So it is in running, 
in rowing, in walking, and in every other form of physical 
exertion.( There is a definite limit to the muscular powers 
of every man, which he cannot by any education or exertion overpass. 4 
This is precisely analogous to the experience that every 
student has had of the working of his mental powers. J 
The eager boy, when he first goes to school and confronts 
intellectual difficulties, is astonished at his progress. He 
glories in his newly-developed mental grip and growing 
capacity for application, and, it may be, fondly believes 
it to be within his reach to become one of the heroes who 
have left their mark upon the history of the world. The 
years go by; he competes in the examinations of school 
and college, over and over again with his fellows, and soon 
finds his place among them. He knows he can beat such 
and such of his competitors; that there are some with 
whom he runs on equal terms, and others whose intellectual 
feats he cannot even approach. Probably his vanity still 
continues to tempt him, by whispering in a new strain: It 
tells him that classics, mathematics, and other subjects 
taught in universities, are mere scholastic specialities, and 
no test of the more valuable intellectual powers. It 
reminds him of numerous instances of persons who had 
been unsuccessful in the competitions of youth, but who 
had shown powers in after-life that made them the foremost 
men of their age, Accordingly, with newly furbished hopes, 
and with all the ambition of twenty-two years of age, he 
leaves his University and enters a larger field of compe-
-P-A-G-E-44
    14 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
tition. The same kind of experience awaits him here that 
he has already gone through. Opportunities occur—they 
occur to every man—and he finds himself incapable of 
grasping them. He tries, and is tried in many things. In 
a few years more, unless he is incurably blinded by self- 
conceit, he learns precisely of what performances he is 
capable, and what other enterprises lie beyond his compass. 
When he reaches mature life, he is confident only within 
certain limits, and knows, or ought to know, himself just 
as he is probably judged of by the world, with all his 
unmistakeable weakness and all his undeniable strength. 
He is no longer tormented into hopeless efforts by the 
fallacious promptings of overweening vanity, but he limits 
his undertakings to matters below the level of his reach, 
and finds true moral repose in an honest conviction that 
he is engaged in as much good work as his nature has 
rendered him capable of performing. 
There can hardly be a surer evidence of the enormous 
difference between the intellectual capacity of men, than 
the prodigious differences in the numbers of marks ob- 
tained by those who gain mathematical honours at Cam- 
bridge. I therefore crave permission to speak at some 
length upon this subject, although the details are dry and 
of little general interest. There are between 400 and 450 
students who take their degrees in each year, and of these, 
about 100 succeed in gaining honours in mathematics, and 
are ranged by the examiners in strict order of merit. 
About the first forty of those who take mathematical 
honours are distinguished by the title of wranglers, and it 
is a decidedly creditable thing to be even a low wrangler ; 
it will secure a fellowship in a small college. It must, be 
carefully borne in mind that the distinction of being the 
first in this list of honours, or what is called the senior 
wrangler of the year, means a vast deal more than being 
the foremost mathematician of 400 or 450 men taken at 
hap-hazard. No doubt the large bulk of Cambridge men 
are taken almost.at hap-hazard. A boy is intended by 
his parents for some profession ; if that profession be either 
the Church or the Bar, it used to be almost requisite, and 
it is still important, that he should be sent to Cambridge 
or Oxford. These youths may justly be considered as
-P-A-G-E-45
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS 15 
  
having been taken at hap-hazard. But there are many 
others who have fairly won their way to the Universities, 
and are therefore selected from an enormous area. Fully 
one-half of the wranglers have been boys of note at their 
respective schools, and, conversely, almost all boys of note 
at schools find their way to the Universities. Hence it is 
that among their comparatively small number of students, 
the Universities include the highest youthful scholastic 
ability of all England. The senior wrangler, in each suc- 
cessive year, is the chief of these as regards mathematics, 
and this, the highest distinction, is, or was, continually 
won by youths who had no mathematical training of 
importance before they went to Cambridge. All their 
instruction had been received during the three years of 
their residence at the University. Now, I do not say 
anything here about the merits or demerits of Cambridge 
mathematical studies having been directed along a too 
narrow groove, or about the presumed disadvantages of 
ranging candidates in strict order of merit, instead of 
grouping them, as at Oxford, in classes, where their names 
appear alphabetically arranged. All I am concerned with 
here are the results; and these are most appropriate to 
my argument. The youths start on their three years’ 
race as fairly as possible. They are then stimulated to 
run by the most powerful inducements, namely, those of 
competition, of honour, and of future wealth (for a good 
fellowship zs wealth); and at the end of the three years 
they are examined most rigorously according to a system 
that they all understand and are equally well prepared 
for. The examination lasts five and a half hours a day 
for eight days, All the answers are carefully marked by 
the examiners, who add up the marks at the end and 
range the candidates in strict order of merit. The fair- 
ness and thoroughness of Cambridge examinations have 
never had a breath of suspicion cast upon them. 
Unfortunately for my purposes, the marks are not 
published. They are not even assigned on a uniform 
system, since each examiner is permitted to employ his 
own scale of marks; but whatever scale he uses, the results 
as to proportional merit are the same. I am indebted to 
a Cambridge examiner for a copy of his marks in respect
-P-A-G-E-46
    16 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
to two examinations, in which the scales of marks were so 
alike as to make it easy, by a slight proportional adjust- 
ment, to compare the two together. This was, to a certain 
degree, a confidential communication, so that it would be 
improper for me to publish anything that would identify 
the years to which these marks refer. I simply give them 
as groups of figures, sufficient to show the enormous 
differences of merit. The lowest man in the list of honours 
gains less than 300 marks; the lowest wrangler gains 
about 1,500 marks ; and the senior wrangler, in one of the 
lists now before me, gained more than 7,500 marks. Con- 
sequently, the lowest wrangler has more than five times 
the merit of the lowest junior optime, and less than one- 
fifth the merit of the senior wrangler.

“served to identify the years. For reasons already given, I desire to afford 
no data to serve that purpose.
-P-A-G-E-47

The precise number of marks obtained by the senior 
wrangler in the more remarkable of these two years was 
7,634; by the second wrangler in the same year, 4,123 ; 
and by the lowest man in the list of honours, only 287. 
Consequently, the senior wrangler obtained nearly twice 
as many marks as the second wrangler, and more than 
thirty-two times as many as the lowest man. I have 
received from another examiner the marks of a year in 
which the senior wrangler was conspicuously eminent. 
He obtained 9,422 marks, whilst the second in the same 
year—whose merits were by no means inferior to those 
of second wranglers in general—obtained only 5,642. The 
man at the bottom of the same honour list had only 309 
marks, or one-thirtieth the number of the senior wrangler. 
T have some particulars of a fourth very remarkable year, 
in which the senior wrangler obtained no less than ten 
times as many marks as the second wrangler, in the 
“problem paper.” Now, I have discussed with practised 
examiners the question of how far the numbers of marks 
may be considered as proportionate to the mathematical 
power of the candidate, and am assured they are strictly 
proportionate as regards the lower places, but do not afford 
full justice to the highest. In other words, the senior 
wranglers above mentioned had more than thirty, or thirty- 
two times the ability of the lowest men on the lists of 
honours. They would be able to grapple with problems 
more than thirty-two times as difficult; or when dealing 
with subjects of the same difficulty, but intelligible to 
all, would comprehend them more rapidly in perhaps the 
square root of that proportion. It is reasonable to expect 
that marks would do some injustice to the very best men, 
because a very large part of the time of the examination 
is taken up by the mechanical labour of writing. _When- 
ever the thought of the candidate outruns his pen, he gains 
no advantage from his excess of promptitude in conception, 
I should, however, mention that some of the ablest men 
have shown their superiority by comparatively little writing. 
They find their way at once to the root of the difficulty in 
the problems that are set, and, with a few clean, apposite, 
powerful strokes, succeed in proving they can overthrow it, 
; 0
-P-A-G-E-48
  18 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
and then they go on to another question. Every word| 
they write tells. Thus, the late Mr. H. Leslie Ellis, who 
was a brilliant senior wrangler in 1840, and whose name 
is familiar to many generations of Cambridge men as al 
prodigy of universal genius, did not even remain during] 
the full period in the examination room: his health was 
weak, and he had to husband his strength. 
The mathematical powers of the last man on the list of 
honours, which are so low when compared. with those of 
a senior wrangler, are mediocre, or even above mediocrity, 
when compared with the gifts of Englishmen generally. 
Though the examination places 100 honour men above 
him, it puts no less than 300 “poll men” below him. 
Even if we go so far as to allow that 200 out of the 300 
refuse to work hard enough to get honours, there will 
remain 100 who, even if they worked hard, could not 
get them. Every tutor knows how difficult it is to drive 
abstract conceptions, even of the simplest kind, into the 
brains of most people—how feeble and hesitating is their 
mental grasp—how easily their brains are mazed—how 
incapable they are of precision and soundness of know- 
ledge. It often occurs to persons familiar with some 
scientific subject to hear men and women of mediocre gifts 
relate to one another what they have picked up about it 
from some lecture—say at the Royal Institution, where 
they have sat for an hour listening with delighted atten- 
tion to an admirably lucid account, illustrated by experi- 
ments of the most perfect and beautiful character, in all 
of which they expressed themselves intensely gratified 
and highly instructed. It is positively painful to hear 
what they say. Their recollections seem to be a mere 
chaos of mist and misapprehension, to which some sort of 
shape and organization has been given by the action of 
their own pure fancy, altogether alien to what the lecturer 
intended to convey. The average mental grasp even of 
what is called a well-educated audience, will be found to 
be ludicrously small when rigorously tested. 
In stating the differences between man and man, let it 
not be supposed for a moment that.mathematicians are 
necessarily one-sided in their natural gifts. There are
-P-A-G-E-49
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS AD) 
numerous instances of the reverse, of whom the following 
will be found, as instances of hereditary genius, in the 
appendix to my chapter on “ScrEeNcE.” I would espe- 
cially name Leibnitz, as being universally gifted; but 
Ampére, Arago, Condorcet, and D’Alembert, were all of 
them very far more than mere mathematicians. Nay, 
since the range of examination at Cambridge is so ex- 
tended as to include other subjects besides mathematics, 
the differences of ability between the highest and lowest 
of the successful candidates is yet more glaring than what 
I have already described. We still find, on the one 
hand, mediocre men, whose whole energies are absorbed 
in getting their 237 marks for mathematics ; and, on the 
other hand, some few senior wranglers who are at the same 
time high classical scholars and much more _ besides. 
Cambridge has afforded such instances. Its lists of 
classical honours are comparatively of recent date, but 
other evidence is obtainable from earlier times of their 
occurrence. Thus, Dr. George Butler, the Head Master 
of Harrow for very many years, including the period 
when Byron was a schoolboy (father of the present Head 
Master, and of other sons, two of whom are also head 
masters of great public schools), must have obtained 
that classical office on account of his eminent classical 
ability ; but Dr. Butler was also senior wrangler in 1794, 
the year when Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst was second. 
Both Dr. Kaye, the late Bishop of Lincoln, and Sir E. 
Alderson, the late judge, were the senior wranglers and 
the first classical prizemen of their respective years, 
Since 1824, when the classical tripos was first established, 
the late Mr. Goulburn (son of the Right Hon. H. Goulburn, 
Chancellor of the Exchequer) was second wrangler in 1835, 
and senior classic of the same year. But in more recent 
times, the necessary labour of preparation, in order to 
acquire the highest mathematical places, has become so 
enormous that there has been a wider differentiation of 
studies. There is no longer time for a man to acquire 
the necessary knowledge to succeed to the first place in 
more than one subject. There are, therefore, no instances 
of a man being absolutely first in both examinations, but 
: c2
-P-A-G-E-50
20 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
      
a few can be found of high eminence in both classics an 
mathematics, as a reference to the lists published in th 
“Cambridge Calendar” will show. The best of these 
more recent degrees appears to be that of Dr. Barry, late| 
Principal of Cheltenham, and now Principal of King’s} 
College, London (the son of the eminent architect, Sir 
Charles Barry, and brother of Mr. Edward Barry, who 
succeeded his father as architect). He was fourth 
wrangler and seventh classic of his year. 
In whatever way we may test ability, we arrive at 
equally enormous intellectual differences. Lord Macaulay 
(see under “ LITERATURE” for his remarkable kinships) 
had one of the most tenacious of memories. He was able 
to recall many pages of hundreds of volumes by various 
authors, which he had acquired by simply reading them 
over. An average man could not certainly carry in his 
memory one thirty-second—ay, or one hundredth—part as 
much as Lord Macaulay. ‘The father of Seneca had one of 
the greatest memories on record in ancient times (sce 
under “ LirERATURE ” for his kinships). Porson, the Greek 
scholar, was remarkable for this gift, and, I may add, the’ 
“Porson memory ” was hereditary in that family) In 
-statesmanship, generalship, literature, science, poetry, art, 
just the same enormous differences are found between 
man and man; and numerous instances recorded in this 
book, will show in how small degree, eminence, either in 
these or any other class of intellectual powers, can be con- 
sidered as due to purely special powers. They are rather 
to be considered in those instances as the result of con- 
centrated efforts, made by men who are widely gifted. 
People lay too much stress on apparent specialities, think- 
ing over-rashly that, because a man is devoted to some 
particular pursuit, he could not possibly have succeeded in 
anything else. They might just as well say that, because a 
youth had fallen desperately in love with a brunette, he could 
not possibly have fallen in love with a blonde. He may or 
may not have more natural liking for the former type of 
beauty than the latter, but it is as probable as not that 
the affair was mainly or wholly due to a general amorous- 
ness of disposition. It is just the same with special
-P-A-G-E-51
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS 21 
pursuits. (a gifted man is often capricious and fickle 
before he selects his occupation, but when it has been 
chosen, he devotes himself to it with a truly passionate 
ardour, After a man of genius has selected his hobby, and 
so adapted himself to it as to seem unfitted for any other 
occupation in life, and to be possessed of but one special 
aptitude, I often notice, with admiration, how well he 
bears himself when circumstances suddenly thrust him into 
a strange position. He will display an insight into new con- 
ditions, and a power of dealing with them, with which even 
his most intimate friends were unprepared to accredit him. 
Many a presumptuous fool has mistaken indifference and 
neglect for incapacity ; and in trying to throw a man of 
genius on ground where he was unprepared for attack, has 
himself received a most severe and unexpected fall. Iam 
sure that no one who has had the privilege of mixing in 
the society of the abler men of any great capital, or who 
is acquainted with the biographies of the heroes of history, 
can doubt the existence of grand human animals, of natures 
pre-eminently noble, of individuals born to be kings of 
men. I have been conscious of no slight misgiving that I 
was committing a kind of sacrilege whenever, in the 
preparation of materials for this book, I had occasion to 
take the measurement of modern intellects vastly superior 
to my own, or to criticise the genius of the most magni- 
ficent historical specimens of our race. It was a process 
that constantly recalled to me a once familiar sentiment 
in bygone days of African travel, when I used to take 
altitudes of the huge cliffs that domineered above me as 
I travelled along their bases, or to map the mountainous 
landmarks of unvisited tribes, that loomed in faint grandeur 
beyond my actual horizon. 
I have not cared to occupy myself much with 
people whose gifts are below the average, but they 
would be an interesting study. The number of idiots 
and imbeciles among the twenty million inhabitants of 
England and Wales is approximately estimated at 
50,000, or as 1 in 400. Dr. Seguin, a great French 
authority on these matters, states that more than thirty 
per cent. of idiots and imbeciles, put under suitable
-P-A-G-E-52
22 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
    instruction, have been taught to conform to social and| 
moral law, and rendered capable of order, of good feel- 
ing, and of working like the third of an average man. 
He says that more than forty per cent. have become 
capable of the ordinary transactions of life, under friendly 
control; of understanding moral and social abstractions, 
and of working like two-thirds of a man. And, lastly, 
that from twenty-five to thirty per cent. come nearer 
and nearer to the standard of manhood, till some of 
them will defy the scrutiny of good judges, when com- 
pared with ordinary young men and women. ' In the 
order next above idiots and imbeciles are a large number 
of milder cases scattered among private families and 
kept out of sight, the existence of whom is, however, 
well known to relatives and friends; they are too silly 
to take a part in general society, but are easily amused 
with some trivial, harmless occupation. Then comes 
a class of whom the Lord Dundreary of the famous play 
may be considered a representative; and so, proceeding” 
through successive grades, we gradually ascend to 
mediocrity. / I know two good instances of hereditary 
silliness short of imbecility, and have reason to believe 
I could easily obtain a large number of similar facts. ) 
To conclude, the range of mental power betwéen— 
I will not say the highest Caucasian and the lowest 
savage—but between the greatest and least of English 
intellects, is enormous. There is a continuity of natural 
ability reaching from one knows not what height, and 
descending to one can hardly say what depth. I propose 
in this chapter to range men according to their natural 
abilities, putting them into classes separated by equal 
degrees of merit, and to show the relative number of 
individuals included in the several classes. Perhaps some 
person might be inclined to make an offhand guess 
that the number of men included in the several classes 
would be pretty equal. If he thinks so, I can assure him 
he is most egregiously mistaken. 
The method I shall employ for discovering all this 
_ is an application of the very curious theoretical law 
of “deviation from an average.” First, I will explain 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS 23 
  
the law, and then I will show that the production. of 
natural intellectual gifts comes justly within its scope. 
The law is an exceedingly general one. M. Quetelet, 
the Astronomer-Royal of Belgium, and the greatest 
authority on vital and social statistics, has largely used 
it in his inquiries. He has also constructed numerical 
tables, by which the necessary calculations can be easily 
made, whenever it is desired to have recourse to the 
law. Those who wish to learn more than I have space 
to relate, should consult his work, which is a very read- 
able octavo volume, and deserves to be far better known 
to statisticians than it appears to be. Its title is “ Letters 
on Probabilities,” translated by Downes. Layton and Co. 
London: 1849. 
So much has been published in recent years about 
statistical deductions, that I am sure the reader will 
be prepared to assent freely to the following hypothetical 
case :—Suppose a large island inhabited by a single 
race, who intermarried freely, and who had lived for 
many generations under constant conditions; then the 
average height of the male adults of that population 
would undoubtedly be the same year after year. Also 
—still arguing from the experience of modern statistics, 
which are found to give constant results in far less 
carefully-guarded examples—we should undoubtedly find, 
year after year, the same proportion maintained between 
the number of men of different heights. I mean, if 
the average stature was found to be sixty-six inches, 
and if it was also found in any one year that 100 per 
million exceeded seventy-eight inches, the same proportion 
of 100 per million would be closely maintained in all other 
years. An equal constancy of proportion would be main- 
tained between any other limits of height we pleased to 
specify, as between seventy-one and seventy-two inches ; be- 
tween seventy-two and seventy-three inches; and so on. 
Statistical experiences are so invariably confirmatory of 
what I have stated would probably be the case, as to 
make it unnecessary to describe analogous instances. 
Now, at this point, the law of deviation from an average 
steps in. It shows that the number per million whose

téights range nee seventy-one ae weiner: two inches 
(or “between any other limits we please to name) can 
be predicted from the previous datum of the average, 
and of any one other fact, such as that of 100 per 
million exceeding seventy-eight inches. 
The appended diagram will make this more intelligible. 
Suppose a million of the men to stand in turns, with their 
backs against a vertical 
board of sufficient height, 
Scale and their heights to be 
pees: dotted off upon it. The 
L board would then present 
the appearance shown in 
the diagram. The line 
of average height is that 
which divides the dots 
: into two equal parts, and 
BE ak stands, in the case we 
T AVERAGE HEIGHT have assumed, at the 
height of sixty-six inches. 
The dots will be found to 
be ranged so symmetric- 
ally on either side of the 
line of average, that the 
lower half of the diagram   
  
  
    
100 PER muLLioN _| fire BeLow mus cine}   
    
Fen? will be almost a precise 
[| reflection of the upper. 
Pla Next, let a hundred dots 
    r be counted from above 
downwards, and let a line 
be drawn below them. 
According to the con- 
ditions, this line will stand at the height of seventy-eight 
inches. Using the data afforded by ‘these two lines, it is 
possible, by the help of the law of deviation from an 
average, to reproduce, with extraordinary closeness, the 
entire. system of dots on the board. 
M. Quetelet gives tables in which the uppermost line, 
instead of cutting off 100 in a million, cuts off only one in 
a million, He divides the intervals between that line and   
   
-P-A-G-E-55
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS 25 
  
the line of average, into eighty equal divisions, and gives 
the number of dots that fall within each of those divisions. 
It is easy, by the help of his tables, to calculate what 
would occur under any other system of classification we 
pleased to adopt. 
This law of deviation from an average is perfectly general 
in its application.) Thus, if the marks had been made by 
bullets fired at a horizontal line stretched in front of the 
target, they would have been distributed according to the 
same law. Wherever there is a large number of similar 
events, each due to the resultant influences of the same 
variable conditions, two effects will follow. First, the 
average value of those events will be constant; and, 
secondly, the deviations of the several events from the 
average, will be governed by this law (which is, in prin- 
ciple, the same as that which governs runs of luck at a 
gaming-table). 
The nature of the conditions affecting the several events 
must, I say, be the same. It clearly would not be proper 
to combine the heights of men belonging to two dissimilar 
races, in the expectation that the compound results would 
be governed by the same constants. A union of two dis- 
similar systems of dots would produce the same kind of 
confusion as if half the bullets fired at a target had been 
directed to one mark, and the other half to another mark. 
Nay, an examination of the dots would show to a person, 
ignorant of what had occurred, that such had been the 
case, and it would be possible, by aid of the law, to dis- 
entangle two or any: moderate number of superimposed 
series of marks. The law may, therefore, be used as a 
most trustworthy criterion, whether or no the events of 
which an average has been taken, are due to the same or 
to dissimilar classes of conditions. 
I selected the hypothetical case of a race of men living 
on an island and freely intermarrying, to ensure the con- 
ditions under which they were all supposed to live, being 
uniform in character. It will now be my aim to show there 
is sufficient uniformity in the inhabitants of the British 
Isles to bring them fairly within the grasp of this law. 
For this purpose, I first call attention to an example
-P-A-G-E-56
    26 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
given in Quetelet’s book. It is of the measurements of the 
circumferences of the chests of a large number of Scotch 
soldiers. The Scotch are by no means a strictly uniform 
race, nor are they exposed to identical conditions. They 
are a mixture of Celts, Danes, Anglo-Saxons, and others, 
in various proportions, the Highlanders being almost purely 
Celts. On the other hand, these races, though diverse in 
origin, are not very dissimilar in character. Consequently, 
it will be found that their deviations from the average 
follow theoretical computations with remarkable accuracy. 
The instance is as follows. M. Quetelet obtained his facts 
from the thirteenth volume of the Edinburgh Medical 
Journal, where the measurements are given in respect to 
5,788 soldiers, the results being grouped in order of mag- 
nitude, proceeding by differences of one inch. Professor 
Quetelet compares these results with those that his tables 
give, and here is the result. The marvellous accordance 
between fact and theory must strike the most unpractised 
eye. I should say that, for the sake of convenience, both 
the measurements and calculations have been reduced to 
per thousandths :—

I will now take a case where there is a greater dis- 
similarity in the elements of which the average has been 
taken. It is the height of 100,000 French conscripts. 
There is fully as much variety in the French as in the 
English, for it is not very many generations since France
-P-A-G-E-57
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS 27 
  
was divided into completely independent kingdoms. 
Among its peculiar races are those of Normandy, Brit- 
tany, Alsatia, Provence, Bearne, Auvergne—each with 
their special characteristics; yet the following table shows 
a most striking agreement between the results of experience 
compared with those derived by calculation, from a purely 
theoretical hypothesis :—

The greatest differences are in the lowest ranks. They 
include the men who were rejected from being too short 
for the army. M. Quetelet boldly ascribes these differ- 
ences to the effect of fraudulent returns. It certainly 
seems that men have been improperly taken out of the 
second rank and put into the first, in order to exempt 
them from service. Be this as it may, the coincidence of 
fact with theory is, in this instance also, quite close enough 
to serve my purpose. 
I argue from the results obtained from Frenchmen and 
from Scotchmen, that, if we had measurements of the 
adult males in the British Isles, we should find those 
measurements to range in close accordance with the law 
of deviation from an average, although our population is 
as much mingled as I described that of Scotland to have 
been; and although Ireland is mainly peopled with Celts,
-P-A-G-E-58
    28 CLASSIFICATION OF MEN 
  
Now, if this be the case with stature, then it will be 
true as regards every other physical feature—as circum- 
ference of head, size of brain, weight of grey matter, 
number of brain fibres, &c.; and thence, by a step on 
which no physiologist will hesitate, as regards mental 
capacity. 
This is what I am driving at—that analogy clearly shows 
there must be a fairly constant average mental capacity in 
the inhabitants of the British Isles, and that the deviations 
from that average—upwards towards genius, and down- 
wards towards stupidity—must follow the law that governs 
deviations from all true averages. 
I have, however, done somewhat more than rely on 
analogy, by discussing the results of those examinations in 
which the candidates had been derived from the same 
classes. Most persons have noticed the lists of successful 
competitors for various public appointments that are 
published from time to time in the newspapers, with the 
marks gained by each candidate attached to his name. 
These lists contain far too few names to fall into such 
beautiful accordance with theory, as was the case with the 
Scotch soldiers. There are rarely more than 100 names 
in any one of these examinations, while the chests of 
no less than 5,700 Scotchmen were measured. I cannot 
justly combine the marks of several independent exami- 
nations into one fagot, for I understand that different 
examiners are apt to have different figures of merit; so 
each examination was analysed separately. The following 
isa calculation I made on the examination last before me ; 
it will do as well as any other. It was for admission into 
the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, December 1868. 
The marks obtained were clustered most thickly about 
3,000, so I take that number as representing the average 
ability of the candidates. From this datum, and from the 
fact that no candidate obtained more than 6,500 marks, 
I computed the column B in the following table, by 
the help of Quetelet’s numbers. It will be seen that 
column B accords with column A quite as closely as the _ 
small number of persons examined could have led us to 
expect.

  The symmetry of the descending branch has been rudely 
spoilt by the conditions stated at the foot of column A, 
There is, therefore, little room for doubt, if everybody in 
England had to work up some subject and then to pass 
before examiners who employed similar figures of merit, 
that their marks would be found to range, according to the 
law of deviation from an average, just as rigorously as the 
heights of French conscripts, or the circumferences of the 
chests of Scotch soldiers. 
The number of grades into which we may divide ability 
is purely a matter of option.) We may consult our con- 
venience by sorting Englishmen into a few large classes, or 
into many small ones. I will select a system of classi- 
fication that shall be easily comparable with the numbers 
of eminent men, as determined in the previous chapter. 
We have seen that 250 men per million become eminent ; 
accordingly, I have so contrived the classes in the following 
table that the two highest, F and G, together with X 
(which includes all cases beyond G, and which are 
unclassed), shall amount to about that Segre 
to 248 per million :—

  The proportions of men living at different ages are calculated from the 
proportions that are true for England and Wales. (Census 1861, Appendix, 
p. 107.) 
Example.—The class F contains 1 in every 4,300 men. In other words, 
there are 233 of that class in each million of men. The same is true of 
class f. In the whole United Kingdom there are 590 men of class F (and 
the same number of f) between the ages of 20 and 30; 450 between the 
ages of 30 and 40 ; and so on. 
It will, I trust, be clearly understood that the numbers 
of men in the several classes in my table depend on no 
uncertain hypothesis. They are determined by the assured 
law of deviations from an average. It is an absolute fact 
that if we pick out of each million the one man who is 
naturally the ablest, and also the one man who is the 
most stupid, and divide the remaining 999,998 men into 
fourteen classes, the average ability in each being separated 
from that of its neighbours by equal grades, then the 
numbers in each of those classes will, on the average of 
many millions, be as is stated in the table. The table may 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL GIFTS 31 
be applied to special, just as truly as to general ability. 
It would be true for every examination that brought out 
natural gifts, whether held in painting, in music, or in 
statesmanship. The proportions between the different 
classes would be identical in all these cases, although the 
classes would be made up of different individuals, according 
as the examination differed in its purport. 
It will be seen that more than half of each million 
is contained in the two mediocre classes a and A; the 
four mediocre classes a, b, A, B, contain more than four- 
fifths, and the six mediocre classes more than nineteen- 
twentieths of the entire population. Thus, the rarity of 
commanding ability, and the vast abundance of mediocrity, 
is no accident, but follows of necessity, from the very nature 
of these things. 
The meaning of the word “ mediocrity ” admits of little 
doubt. It defines the standard of intellectual power found 
in most provincial gatherings, because the attractions of a 
more stirring life in the metropolis and elsewhere, are apt 
to draw away the abler classes of men, and the silly and 
the imbecile do not take a part in the gatherings. Hence, 
the residuum that forms the bulk of the general society 
of small provincial places, is commonly very pure in its 
mediocrity. \ 
The class’C possesses abilities a trifle higher than those 
commonly possessed by the foreman of an ordinary jury. 
D includes the mass of men who obtain the ordinary 
prizes of life. Eis a stage higher. Then we reach F, 
the lowest of those yet superior classes of intellect, with 
which this volume is chiefly concerned. 
On descending the scale, we find by the time we have 
reached f, that we are already among the idiots and im- 
beciles. We have seen in p. 21, that there are 400 idiots 
and imbeciles, to every million of persons living in this 
country ; but that 80 per cent. of their number, appear to 
be light cases, to whom the name of idiot is inappropriate. 
There will remain 280 true idiots and imbeciles, to every 
million of our population. This ratio coincides very closely 
with the requirements of class f. No doubt a certain pro- 
portion of them are idiotic owing to some fortuitous cause,  
-P-A-G-E-62
32 CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO GIFTS 
which may interfere with the working of a naturally good 
brain, much as a bit of dirt may cause a first-rate chrono- 
meter to keep worse time than an ordinary watch. But 
I presume, from the usual smallness of head and absence 
of disease among these persons, that the proportion of 
accidental idiots cannot be very large. 
7 Hence we arrive at the undeniable, but unexpected 
conclusion, that eminently gifted men are raised as much 
above mediocrity as idiots are depressed below it? a fact 
that is calculated to considerably enlarge our ideas of the 
enormous differences of intellectual gifts between man 
and man. 
I presume the class F of dogs, and others of the more 
intelligent sort of animals, is nearly commensurate with 
the f of the human race, in respect to memory and powers 
of reason. Certainly the class G of such animals is far 
superior to the g of humankind.

                                Is reputation a fair test of natural ability? Itis the only 
one I can employ—am I justified in using it ? ( How much 
of a man’s success is due to his opportunities, how much 
to his natural power of intellect ? ) 
This is a very old question, on which a great many 
commonplaces have been uttered that need not be repeated 
here. I will confine myself to a few considerations, such 
as seem to me amply adequate to prove what is wanted 
for my argument. 
Let it clearly be borne in mind, what I mean by repu- 
tation and ability. By reputation, I mean the opinion ot 
contemporaries, revised by posterity—the favourable result 
of a critical analysis of each man’s character, by many 
biographers. I do not mean high social or official position, 
nor such as is implied by being the mere lion of a London 
season; but I speak of the reputation of a leader of 
opinion, of an originator, of a man to whom the world 
deliberately acknowledges itself largely indebted. 
By natural ability, I mean those qualities of intellect 
and disposition, which urge and qualify a man to perform 
acts that lead to reputation. I do not mean capacity 
without zeal, nor zeal without capacity, nor even a com- 
bination of both of them, without an adequate power of 
doing a great deal of very laborious work. But I mean 
a nature which, when left to itself, will, urged by an in- 
herent stimulus, climb the path that leads to eminence, 
and has strength to reach the summit—one which, if 
hindered or thwarted, will fret and strive until the hin- 
D
-P-A-G-E-64
34 COMPARISON OF THE 
    
drance is overcome, and it is again free to follow iti 
labour-loving instinct. It is almost a contradiction in 
terms, to doubt that such men will generally become emi 
nent. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence in 
this volume to show that few have won high reputations| 
without possessing these peculiar gifts. (It follows that] 
the men who achieve eminence, and those who are naturally, 
capable, are; to a large extent, identical. 
The particular meaning in which I’employ the word 
ability, does not restrict my argument from a wider appli- 
cation ; for, if I succeed in showing—as I undoubtedly 
shall do~-that the concrete triple event, of ability combined 
with zeal and with capacity for hard labour, is inherited, 
much more will there be justification for believing that any 
one of its three elements, whether it be ability, or zeal, or 
capacity for labour, is similarly a gift of inheritance.) 
I believe, and shall do my best to show, that; if the 
“eminent ” men of any period, had been changelings when 
babies, a very fair proportion of those who survived and 
retained their health up to fifty years of age, would, not- 
withstanding their altered circumstances have equally 
risen to eminence. Thus—to take a strong case—it is 
incredible that any combination of circumstances, could 
have repressed Lord Brougham to the level of undis- 
tinguished mediocrity. 
The arguments on which I rely are as follow. I will 
limit their application for the present to men of the pen 
and toartists. First, it is a fact, that numbers of men rise, 
before they are middle-aged, from the humbler ranks of 
life to that worldly position, in which it is of no importance 
to their future career, how their youth has been passed. 
They have overcome their hindrances, and thus start fair 
with others more fortunately reared, in the subsequent race 
of life. A boy who is to be carefully educated is sent to 
a good school, where he confessedly acquires little useful 
information, but where he is taught the art of learning. 
The man of whom I have been speaking has contrived 
to acquire the same art in a school of adversity. Both 
stand on equal terms, when they have reached mature life. 
They compete for the same prizes, measure their strength 
by efforts in the same direction, and their relative successes 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
TWO Sees 35 
  are thenceforward due to their relative natural gifts. There 
are many such men in the “eminent” class, as biographies 
abundantly show. Now, if the hindrances to success were 
very great, we should expect all who surmounted them 
to be ‘prodigies of genius. The hindrances would form a 
system of natural ‘selection, by repressing all whose gifts 
were below a certain very high level. But what is the 
case? We find very many who have risen from the ranks, 
who are by no means prodigies of genius ; many who have 
no claim to “eminence,” who have risen easily in spite of 
all obstacles. The hindrances undoubtedly form a system 
of natural selection that represses mediocre men, and even 
men of pretty fair powers—in short, the classes below D ; 
but many of D succeed, a great many of E, and I believe 
a very large majority of those above. 
If a man is gifted with vast intellectual ability, eagerness 
to work, and power of working, I cannot comprehend how 
such a man should be repressed. The world is always 
tormented with difficulties waiting to be solved—struggling 
/ with ideas and feelings, to which it can give no adequate 
expression. If, then, there exists a man capable of solving 
those difficulties, or of giving a voice to those pent-up 
feelings, he is sure to be welcomed with universal accla- 
mation. We may almost say that he has only to put his 
pen to paper, and the thing is done. I am here speaking 
of the very first-class men—prodigies—one in a million, or 
one in ten millions, of whom numbers will be found described 
in this volume, as specimens of hereditary genius. 
Another argument to prove, that the hindrances of 
English social life, are not effectual in repressing high 
ability is, that the number of eminent men in England, 
is as great as in other countries where fewer hindrances 
exist. Culture is far more widely spread in America, 
than with us, and the education of their. middle and 
lower classes far more advanced; but, for all that, 
America most certainly does not beat us in first-class 
works of literature, philosophy, or art. The higher kind 
of books, even of the most modern date, read in America, 
are principally the work of Englishmen. The Americans 
have an immense amount of the newspaper-article-writer, 
or of the member-of-congress stamp of ability; but the 
D2
-P-A-G-E-66
       36 COMPARISON OF THE    
   
         
   number of their really eminent authors is more limite 
even than with us. I argue that, if the hindrances to th 
rise of genius, were removed from. English society-as com: 
pletely as they have been removed from that of America, 
we should not become materially richer in highly eminen 
men. 
| People seem to have the idea that the way to eminence 
is one of great. self-denial, from which there are hourl: 
temptations te diverge: in which a man can be kept in 
his boyhood, only by a schoolmaster’s severity or a parent’s 
incessant watchfulness, and in after life by the attrac- 
tions of fortunate friendships and other favourable cir- 
cumstances. This is true enough of the great majority 
of men, but it is simply not true of the generality of 
those who have gained great reputations. Such men, 
biographies show to be haunted and driven by an in- 
cessant instinctive craving for intellectual work. If 
forcibly withdrawn from the path that leads towards 
eminence, they will find thet way back to it, as surely 
as a lover to his mistress,/ They do not work for the 
sake of eminence, but to satisfy a natural craving for 
brain work, just as athletes cannot endure repose on 
account of their muscular irritability, which insists upon 
exercise. It is very unlikely that any conjunction of cir- 
cumstances, should supply a stimulus to brain work, 
commensurate with what these men carry in their own 
constitutions. The action of external stimuli must be 
uncertain and intermittent, owing to their very nature ; 
the disposition abides. It keeps a man ever employed— 
now wrestling with his difficulties, now brooding over his 
immature ideas—and renders him a quick and eager 
listener to innumerable, almost inaudible teachings, that 
others less keenly on the watch, are sure to miss. 
These considerations lead to my third argument. I have 
shown that social hindrances cannot impede men of high 
ability, from becoming eminent. I shall now maintain that 
social advantages are incompetent to give that status to 
a man of moderate ability. It would be easy to point 
out several men of fair capacity, who have been pushed 
forward by all kinds of help, who are ambitious, and exert 
themselves to the utmost, but who completely fail in

attaining eminence. If great peers, they may be lord- 
lieutenants of counties; if they belong to great county 
families, they may become influential members of parlia- 
ment and local notabilities. When they die, they leave a 
blank for a while in a large circle, but there is no West- 
minster Abbey and no public mourning for them—perhaps 
barely a biographical notice in the columns of the daily 
papers. 
It is difficult to specify two large classes of men, with 
equal social advantages, in one of which they have high 
hereditary gifts, while in the other they have not. I must 
not compare the sons of eminent men with those of non- 
eminent, because much which I should ascribe to breed, 
others might ascribe to parental encouragement and ex- 
ample. Therefore, I will compare the sons of eminent 
men with the adopted sons of Popes and other dignitaries 
of the Roman Catholic Church. The practice of nepotism 
among ecclesiastics is universal. It consists in their giving 
those social helps to a nephew, or other more distant 
relative, that ordinary people give to their children, 
Now, I shall show abundantly in the course of this book, 
that the nephew of an eminent man has far less chance 
of becoming eminent than a son,-and that a more remote 
kinsman has far less chance than a nephew. We may 
therefore make a very fair comparison, for the purposes of 
my argument, between the success of the sons of eminent 
men and that of the nephews or more distant relatives, 
who stand in the place of sons to the high unmarried 
ecclesiastics of the Romish Church. If social help is really 
of the highest importance, the nephews of the Popes will 
attain eminence as frequently, or nearly so, as the sons of 
other eminent men ; otherwise, they will not. 
Are, then, the nephews, &c., of the Popes, on the whole, 
as highly distinguished as are the sons of other equally 
eminent men? I answer, decidedly not. There have been 
a few Popes who were offshoots of illustrious races, such as 
that of the Medici, but in the enormous majority of cases 
the Pope is the ablest member of his family. I do not 
profess to have worked up the kinships of the Italians 
with any especial care, but I have seen amply enough of 
them, to justify me in saying that the individuals whose
-P-A-G-E-68
  38 COMPARISON OF THE 
  
advancement has been due to nepotism, are curiously un- 
distinguished. The very common combination of an able 
son and an eminent parent, is not matched, in the case 
of high Romish ecclesiastics, by an eminent nephew and 
an eminent uncle. The social helps are the same, but 
hereditary gifts are wanting in the latter case. 
To recapitulate : I have endeavoured to show in respect 
to literary and artistic eminence— 
1. That men who are gifted with high abilities—even 
men of class E—easily rise through all the obstacles caused 
by inferiority of social rank, 
2. Countries where there are fewer hindrances than in 
England, to a poor man rising in life, produce a much 
larger proportion of persons of culture, but not of what I 
call eminent men. 
3. Men who are largely aided by social advantages, are 
unable to achieve eminence, unless they are endowed with 
high natural gifts. 
It may be well to add a few supplementary remarks on 
the small effects of a good education on a mind of the 
highest order. A youth of abilities G, and X, is almost 
independent of ordinary school education. He does not 
want a master continually at his elbow to explain diffi- 
culties and select suitable lessons. On the contrary, he is 
receptive at every pore. He learns from passing hints, 
with a quickness and thoroughness that others cannot 
comprehend. He is omnivorous of intellectual work, 
devouring a vast deal more than he can utilize, but ex- 
tracting a small percentage of nutriment, that makes, 
in the aggregate, an enormous supply. The best care 
that a master can take of such a boy is to leave him 
alone, just directing a little here and there, and checking 
desultory tendencies. 
It is a mere accident if a man is placed in his youth in 
the profession for which he has the most special vocation. 
It will consequently be remarked in my short biographical 
notices, that the most illustrious men have frequently 
broken loose from the life prescribed by their parents, and 
followed, careless of cost, the paramount dictation of their 
own natures : in short, they educate themselves. D’Alem- 
bert is a striking instance of this kind of self-reliance. He
-P-A-G-E-69
  TWO CLASSIFICATIONS 39 
  
was a foundling (afterwards shown to be well bred as 
respects ability), and put out to nurse as a pauper baby, 
to the wife of a poor glazier. The child’s indomitable 
tendency to the higher studies, could not be repressed by 
his foster-mother’s ridicule and dissuasion, nor by the 
taunts of his schoolfellows, nor by the discouragements of 
his schoolmaster, who was incapable of appreciating him, 
nor even by the reiterated deep disappointment of finding 
that his ideas, which he knew to be original, were not 
novel, but long previously discovered by others. Of course, 
we should expect a boy of this kind, to undergo ten or 
more years of apparently hopeless strife, but we should 
equally expect him to succeed at last; and D’Alembert 
did succeed in attaining the first rank of celebrity, by the 
time he was twenty-four. The reader has only to turn 
over the pages of my book, to find abundant instances of 
this emergence from obscurity, in spite of the utmost 
discouragement in early youth, 
A prodigal nature commonly so prolongs the period 
when a man’s receptive faculties are at their keenest, that 
a faulty education in youth, is readily repaired in after 
life. _The education of Watt, the great mechanician, was 
of a merely elementary character. During his youth and 
manhood he was engrossed with mechanical specialities. 
It was not till he became advanced in years, that he had 
leisure to educate himself, and yet by the time he was an 
old man, he had become singularly well-read and widely 
and accurately informed. The scholar who, in the eyes of 
his contemporaries and immediate successors, made one of 
the greatest reputations, as such, that any man has ever 
made, was Julius Cesar Scaliger. His youth was, I be- 
lieve, entirely unlettered. He was in the army until he 
was twenty-nine, and then he led a vagrant professional 
life, trying everything and sticking to nothing. At length 
he fixed himself upon Greek. His first publications were 
at the age of forty-seven, and between that time and the 
period of a somewhat early death, he earned his remark- 
able reputation, only exceeded by that of his son. Boy- 
hood and youth—the period between fifteen and twenty- 
two years of age, which afford to the vast majority of men, 
the only period for the acquirement of intellectual facts
-P-A-G-E-70
  40 COMPARISON OF THE 
  
and habits—are just seven years—neither more nor less 
important than other years—in the lives of men of the 
highest order. People are too apt to complain of their 
imperfect education, insinuating that they would have done 
great things if they-had been more fortunately circum- 
stanced in youth. (But if their power of learning is 
materially diminished by the time they have discovered 
their want of knowledge, it is very probable that their 
abilities are not of a very high description, and that, how- 
ever well they might have been educated, they would 
have succeeded but little better.) 
( Even if a man be long unconscious of his powers, 
an opportunity is sure to occur—they occur over and 
over again to every man—that will discover them.) He 
will then soon make up for past arrears, and outstrip 
competitors with very many years’ start, in the 
race of life. (There is an obvious analogy’ between 
the man of brains and the man of muscle, in the 
unmistakable way in which they may discover and 
assert their claims to superiority over less gifted, but 
far better educated, competitors.) An average sailor 
climbs rigging, and an average Alpine guide scrambles 
along cliffs, with a facility that seems like magic to a 
man who has been reared away from ships and mountains. 
But if he have extraordinary gifts, a very little trial 
will reveal them, and he will rapidly make up for his 
arrears of education. A born gymnast would soon, 
in his turn, astonish the sailors by his feats. Before 
the voyage was half over, he would outrun them like 
an escaped monkey. I have witnessed an instance of 
this myself. Every summer, it happens that some 
young English tourist who had never previously planted 
his foot on crag or ice, succeeds in Alpine work to a 
marvellous degree. 
Thus far, I have spoken only of literary men and 
artists, who, however, form the bulk of the 250 per 
million, that attain to eminence. The reasoning that 
is true for them, requires large qualifications when 
applied to statesmen and commanders. Unquestionably, 
the most illustrious statesmen and commanders belong, 
to. say the least, to the classes F and G of ability;
-P-A-G-E-71
  TWO CLASSIFICATIONS. 41 
  
but it does not at all follow that an English cabinet 
minister, if he be a great territorial lord, should belong 
to those classes, or even to the two or three below them. 
Social advantages have enormous power in bringing a man 
into so prominent a position as a statesman, that it is 
impossible to refuse him the title of “eminent,” though 
it may be more than probable that if he had been changed 
in his cradle, and reared in obscurity he would have 
lived and died without emerging from humble life. Again, 
we have seen that a union of three separate qualities— 
intellect, zeal, and power of work—are necessary to 
raise men from the ranks. Only two of these qualities, 
in a remarkable degree, namely intellect and power of 
work, are required by a man who is pushed into public 
life; because when he is once there, the interest is so 
absorbing, and the competition so keen, as to supply the 
necessary stimulus to an ordinary mind. - Therefore, many 
men who have succeeded as statesmen, would have been 
nobodies had they been born in a lower rank of life: they 
would have needed zeal to rise. Talleyrand would have 
passed his life in the same way as other grand seigneurs, 
if he had not been ejected from his birthright, by a family 
council, on account of his deformity, and thrown into the 
vortex of the French Revolution. The furious excitement 
of the game overcame his inveterate indolence, and he 
developed into the foremost man of the period, after 
Napoleon and Mirabeau. As for sovereigns, they belong 
to a peculiar category. The qualities most suitable to the 
ruler of a great nation, are not such as lead to eminence 
in private life. Devotion to particular studies, obstinate 
perseverance, geniality and frankness in social relations, are 
important qualities to make a man rise in the world, but 
they are unsuitable to a sovereign. He has to view many 
interests and opinions with an equal eye; to know how 
to yield his favourite ideas to popular pressure, to be 
reserved in his friendships and able to stand alone. On 
the other hand, a sovereign does not greatly need the 
intellectual powers that are essential to the rise of a 
common man, because the best brains of the country 
are at his service. Consequently, I do not busy myself in 
this volume with the families of merely able sovereigns
-P-A-G-E-72
  42 COMPARISON OF THE 
  
only with those few whose military and administrative capa- 
city is acknowledged to have been of the very highest order. 
As regards commanders, the qualities that raise a man 
to a peerage, may be of a peculiar kind, such as would not 
have raised him to eminence in ordinary times. Strategy 
is as much a speciality as chess-playing, and large practice 
is required to develop it. It is difficult to see how strate- 
gical gifts, combined with a hardy constitution, dashing 
courage, and a restless disposition, can achieve eminence in 
times of peace. These qualities are more likely to attract 
a man to the hunting-field, if he have enough money; or 
if not, to make him an unsuccessful speculator. It con- 
sequently happens that generals of high, but not the very 
highest order, such as Napoleon’s marshals and Cromwell's 
generals, are rarely found to have eminent kinsfolk. Very 
different is the case, with the most illustrious commanders. 
They are far more than strategists and men of restless 
dispositions; they would have distinguished themselves 
under any circumstances. Their kinships are most re- 
markable, as will be seen in my chapter on commanders, 
which includes the names of Alexander, Scipio, Hannibal, 
Cesar, Marlborough,.Cromwell, the Princes of Nassau, 
Wellington, and Napoleon. 
Precisely the same remarks are applicable to demagogues. 
Those who rise to the surface and play a prominent part 
in the transactions of a troubled period, must have courage 
and force of character, but they need not have high in- 
tellectual powers. Nay, it is more appropriate that the 
intellects of such men should be narrow and one-sided, 
and their dispositions moody and embittered. These are 
not qualities that lead to eminence in ordinary times. 
Consequently, the families of such men, are mostly un- 
known to fame. But the kinships of popular leaders of 
the highest order, as of the two Gracchi, of the two 
Arteveldes, and of Mirabeau, are illustrious. 
I may mention a class of cases that strikes me forcibly 
as a proof, that a sufficient power of command to lead to 
eminence in troublous times, is much less unusual than is 
commonly supposed, and that it lies neglected in the course 
of ordinary life. In beleaguered towns, as, for example, 
during the great Indian mutiny, a certain type of character 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  TWO CLASSIFICATIONS 43 
  
very frequently made its appearance. People rose into 
notice who had never previously distinguished themselves, 
and subsided into their former way of life, after the occa- 
sion for exertion was over; while during the continuance 
of danger and misery, they were the heroes of their situa- 
tion. They were cool in danger, sensible in council, cheer- 
ful under prolonged suffering, humane to the wounded and 
sick, encouragers of the faint-hearted.. Such people were 
formed to shine only under exceptional circumstances. 
They had the advantage of possessing too tough a fibre to 
be crushed by anxiety and physical misery, and perhaps 
in consequence of that very toughness, they required a 
stimulus of the sharpest kind, to ~ goad them to all the 
exertions of which they were capable. 
The result of what I have said, is to show that in 
statesmen and commanders, mere “eminence” is by no 
means a satisfactory criterion of such natural gifts as 
would make a man distinguished under whatever circum- 
stances he had been reared. On the other hand, states- 
men of a high order, and commanders of the very highest, 
who overthrow all opponents, must be prodigiously gifted. 
The reader himself must judge the cases quoted in proof 
of hereditary gifts, by their several merits. I have 
endeavoured to speak of none but the most illustrious 
names. It would have led to false conclusions, had I taken a 
larger number, and thus descended to a lower level of merit. 
In conclusion, I see no reason to be dissatisfied with the 
conditions of accepting high reputation as a very fair test 
of high ability. The nature of the test would not have 
been altered, if an attempt had been made to readjust each 
man’s reputation according to his merits, because this 
is what every biographer does. If I had possessed the 
critical power of a Ste. Beuve, I should have merely thrown 
into literature another of those numerous expressions of 
opinion, by the aggregate of which all reputations are built. 
\ To conclude : T feel convinced that no man can achieve 
avery high reputation without being gifted with very high 
abilities ; “and I trust that reason has been given for the 
belief, that few who possess these very high abilities can 
fail in achieving eminence. )

NOTATION 
I ENTREAT my readers not to be frightened at the 
first sight of the notation I employ, for it is really very 
simple to understand and easy to recollect. It was im- 
possible for me to get on without the help of something 
of the sort, as I found our ordinary nomenclature far 
too ambiguous as well as cumbrous for employment in 
this book. 
For example, the terms “uncle,” “nephew,” “grand- 
father,” and “ grandson,” have each of them two distinct 
meanings. An uncle may be the brother of the father, 
or the brother of the mother; the nephew may be the 
son of a brother, or the son of a sister; and so on. 
There.are four kinds of first cousins, namely, the sons of 
the two descriptions of uncles and those of the two cor- 
responding aunts. ‘ There are sixteen kinds of first cousins 
“once removed,” for either A. may be the son of any one 
of the four descriptions of male or of the four female 
cousins of B., or B. may bear any one of those relation- 
ships to A. I need not quote more instances in illustration 
of what I have said, that unbounded confusion would have 
been introduced had I confined myself in this book, to our 
ordinary nomenclature. 
The notation I employ gets rid of all this confused 
and cumbrous language. It disentangles relationships 
in a marvellously complete and satisfactory manner, and 
enables us to methodise, compare, and analyse them in any 
way we like. 
Speaking generally, and without regarding the type in » « »

which the letters are printed, F. stands for Father; G. for 
Grandfather; U. for Uncle; N. for Nephew; B. for 
Brother ; -S. for Son; and P. for Grandson (Petit-fils in 
French). 
These letters are printed in capitals when the relation- 
ship to be expressed has passed through the male line, 
and in small type when through the female line. _There- 
fore U. is the paternal uncle; G. the paternal grandfather ; 
N. is a nephew that is son of a brother; P.a grandson 
that is the child of a son. So again, u. is the maternal 
uncle ; g. the maternal grandfather; n. a nephew that is 
son of a sister; p. a grandson that is the child of a 
daughter. 
Precisely the same letters, in the form of Italics, are 
employed. for the female relations. For example in cor- 
respondence with U. there is U. to express an aunt that 
is the sister of a father; and to u. there is wu. to express an 
aunt that is the sister of a mother. 
It is a consequence of this system of notation, that F. 
and B, and §. are always printed in capitals, and that 
their correlatives for mother, sister, and daughter are 
always expressed in small italicised type, as /., b., and s. 
The reader must mentally put the word his before the 
letter denoting kinship, and was after it. Thus :— 
Adams, John ; second President of the United States. 
8. John Quincey Adams, sixth President.

  THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 49 
  
THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND .BETWEEN 
1660 AND 1865 
THE Judges of England, since the restoration of the 
monarchy in 1660, form a group peculiarly well adapted 
to afford a general outline of the extent and limitations of 
heredity in respect to genius. A judgeship is a guarantee 
of its possessor being gifted with exceptional ability; the 
Judges are sufficiently numerous and prolific to form an 
adequate basis for statistical inductions, and they are the 
subjects of several excellent biographical treatises. It is 
therefore well to begin our inquiries with a discussion of 
their relationships. We shall quickly arrive at definite 
results, which subsequent chapters, treating of more illus- 
trious men, and in other careers, will check and amplify. 
It is necessary that I should first say something in 
support of my assertion, that the office of a judge is really 
a sufficient guarantee that its possessor is exceptionally 
gifted. In other countries it may be different to what it 
is with us, but we all know that in England, the Bench is 
never spoken of without reverence for the intellectual 
power of its occupiers. A seat on the Bench is a great 
prize, to be won by the best men. No doubt there are 
hindrances, external to those of nature, against a man 
getting on at the Bar and rising to a judgeship. The 
attorneys may not give him briefs when he is a young 
barrister ; and even if he becomes a successful barrister, 
his political party may be out of office for a long period, 
at a time when he was otherwise ripe for advancement. 
I cannot, however, believe that either of these are serious 
E
-P-A-G-E-80
  50 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
obstacles in the long run. Sterling ability is sure to make 
itself felt, and to lead to practice; while as to politics, the 
changes of party are sufficiently frequent to give a fair 
chance to almost every generation. For every man who 
is a judge, there may possibly be two other lawyers of 
the same standing, equally fitted for the post, but it is 
hard to believe there can be a larger number. 
If not always the foremost, the Judges are therefore 
among the foremost, of a vast body of legal men. The 
Census speaks of upwards of 3,000 barristers, advocates, 
and special pleaders; and it must be recollected that 
these do not consist of 3,000 men taken at hap-hazard, 
but a large part of them are already selected, and it is 
from these, by a second process of selection, that the 
judges are mainly derived. When I say that a large part 
of the barristers are selected men, I speak of those among 
them who are of humble parentage, but have brilliant 
natural gifts—who attracted notice as boys, or, it may be, 
even as children, and were therefore sent to a good school. 
There they won exhibitions and fitted themselves for col- 
lege, where they supported themselves by obtaining scholar- 
ships. Then came fellowships, and so they ultimately 
found their way tothe Bar. Many of these have risen to 
the Bench. The parentage of the Lord Chancellors jus- 
tifies my statement. There have been thirty of them 
within the period included in my inquiries. Of these, 
Lord Hardwicke was the son of a small attorney at Dover, 
in narrow circumstances ; Lord Eldon (whose brother was 
the great Admiralty Judge, Lord Stowell) was son of a 
“coal fitter ;” Lord Truro was son of a sheriff's officer ; 
and Lord St. Leonards (like Lord Tenterden, the Chief 
Justice of Common Pleas) was son of a barber. Others 
were sons of clergymen of scanty. means. Others have 
begun life in alien professions, yet, notwithstanding their 
false start, have easily recovered lost ground in after life. 
Lord Erskine was first in the navy and then in the army, 
before he became a barrister. Lord Chelmsford was 
originally a midshipman. Now a large number of men 
with antecedents as unfavourable to success as these, and 
yet successful men, are always to be found at the Bar, and
-P-A-G-E-81
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 51 
therefore I say the barristers are themselves a selected 
body; and the fact of every judge having been taken 
from the foremost rank of 3,000 of them, is proof that his 
exceptional ability is of an enormously higher order than 
if the 3,000 barristers had been conscripts, drawn by lot 
from the general mass of their countrymen. I therefore 
need not trouble myself with quoting passages from 
biographies, to prove that each of the Judges whose name 
I have occasion to mention, is a highly gifted man. It 
is precisely in order to avoid the necessity of this tedious 
work, that I have selected the Judges for my first chapter. 
In speaking of the English Judges, I have adopted the 
well-known Lives of the Judges, by Foss, as my guide. 
It was published in 1865, so I have adopted that date as 
the limit of my inquiries. I have considered those only as 
falling under the definition of “judges ” whom he includes 
as such. They are the Judges of the Courts of Chancery 
and Common Law, and the Master of the Rolls, but not 
the Judges of the Admiralty nor of the Court of Canter- 
bury. By the latter limitation, I lose the advantage of 
counting Lord Stowell (brother of the Lord Chancellor 
Eldon), the remarkable family of the Lushingtons, that of 
Sir R. Phillimore, and some others. Through the limitation 
as regards time, I lose, by ending with the year 1865, the 
recently-created judges, such as Judge Selwyn, brother 
of the Bishop of Lichfield, and also of the Professor 
of Divinity at Cambridge. But I believe, from cursory 
inquiries, that the relations of these latter judges, speaking 
generally, have not so large a share of eminence as we 
shall find among those of the judges in my list. This 
might have been expected, for it is notorious that the 
standard of ability in a modern judge is not so high as 
it used to be. The number of exceptionally gifted men 
being the same, it is impossible to supply the new demand 
for heads of great schools and for numerous other careers, 
now thrown open to able youths, without seriously limiting 
the field whence alone good judges may be selected. By 
beginning at the Restoration, which I took for my com- 
mencement, because there was frequent jobbery in earlier 
days, I lose a Lord Keeper (of the same rank as a Lord 
i E2
-P-A-G-E-82
  THE Poe OF ENGLAND 
Chancellor), and his still greater son, also a Lord Chan- 
cellor, namely, the two Bacons. I state these facts to 
show that I have not picked out the period in question, 
because it seemed most favourable to my argument, but 
simply because it appeared the most suitable to bring out 
the truth as to hereditary genius, and was, at the same 
time, most convenient for me to discuss. 
There are 286 judges within the limits of my inquiry ; 
109 of them have one or more eminent relations, and three 
others have relations whom I have noticed, but they are 
marked off with brackets, and are therefore not to be 
included in the following statistical deductions. As the 
readiest method of showing, at a glance, the way in which 
these relations are distributed, I give a table below in 
which they are all compactly registered. This table is 
a condensed summary of the Appendix to the present 
chapter, which should be consulted by the reader when- 
ever he desires fuller information.

54 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
  Several remarkable features in the contents of this table 
will catch the eye at once. I will begin by shortly alluding 
to them, and will enter more into details a little further 
on. First, it will be observed, that the Judges are so 
largely interrelated, that 109 of them are grouped into 
only 85 families. There are seventeen doublets, among 
the Judges, two triplets, and one quadruplet. In addition 
to these, might be counted six other sets, consisting of 
those whose ancestors sat on the Bench previously to the 
accession of Charles II, namely, Bedingfield, Forster, 
Hyde, Finch, Windham, and Lyttleton. Another fact 
to be observed, is the nearness of the relationships in my 
list. The single letters are far the most common. Also, 
though a man has twice as many grandfathers as fathers, 
and probably more than twice as many grandsons as sons, 
yet the Judges are found more frequently to have eminent 
fathers than grandfathers, and eminent sons than grandsons. 
In the third degree of relationship, the eminent kinsmen 
are yet more rare, although the number of individuals in 
those degrees is increased in a duplicate proportion. When 
a judge has no more than one eminent relation, that relation 
is nearly always to be found in the first or second degree. 
Thus in the first section of the table, which is devoted to 
single relationships, though it includes as many as thirty- 
nine entries, there are only two among them (viz. Browne 
and Lord Brougham) whose kinships extend beyond the 
second degree. It is in the last section of the table, which 
treats of whole families, largely gifted with ability, that the 
distant kinships are chiefly to be found. I annex a table 
(Table II.) extracted from the preceding one, which 
exhibits these facts with great clearness. Column A con- 
tains the facts just as they were observed, and column D 
shows the percentage of individuals, in each degree of 
kinship to every 100 judges, who have become eminent.

D. Percentage of eminent men in each degree of kinship to the most eminent member of distinguished families ; it was obtained by dividing B by C and multiplying by 100. E. Percentages of the previous column reduced in the proportion of (286~ 24,1 or) 242 to 85, in order to apply to families generally. 
Table II. also gives materials for judging of the com- 
parative influence of the male and female lines, in con- 
veying ability. Thanks to my method of notation, it is 
perfectly easy to separate the two lines in the way I am 
about to explain. I do not attempt to compare relations 
in the first degree of kinship—namely, fathers with 
mothers, sons with daughters, or brothers with sisters, 
because there exists no criterion for a just comparison of 
the natural ability of the different sexes. Nay, even if 
there were means for testing it, the result would be falla- 
cious. A mother transmits masculine peculiarities to her 
male child, which she does not and cannot possess; and, 
similarly, a woman who is endowed with fewer gifts of a 
masculine type than her husband, may yet contribute in 
a larger degree to the masculine intellectual superiority 
of her son. I therefore shift my inquiry from the first, to 
1 That is to say, 286 Judges, less 24, who are included as subordinate members of the $5 families. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  56 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
  
the second and third degrees of kinship. As regards the 
second degree, I compare the paternal grandfather with 
the maternal, the uncle by the father’s side with the uncle 
by the mother’s, the nephew by the brother's side with the 
nephew by the sister’s, and the grandson by the son with 
the grandson by the daughter. On the same principle 
I compare the kinships in the third degree: that is to 
say, the father of the father’s father with the father of the 
mother’s mother, and so on. The whole of the work is 
distinctly exposed to view in the following compact 
table :— 
In THE SEconpD DEGREE. 
7G.°+9U. + 14N. +11P. = a kinships through males. 
6g. + 6u.+2n.+ 5p. = esi 33 females, 
In THE Turrp Drcrer. 
1GF. + 1GB. + 5 US. + 7NS. + 2PS. = 19 kinships through males. 
OgF. + OgB. + 10S. + OnS.+0pS. = 1 >» females. 
Total, 60 through males, 20 through females. 
The numbers are too small to warrant any very decided 
conclusion ; but they go far to prove that the female in- 
fluence is inferior to that of the male in conveying ability. 
It must, however, be observed, that the difference between 
the totals in the second degree is chiefly due to the 
nephews—a relationship difficult to trace on the female 
side, because, as a matter of fact, biographers do not speak 
so fully of the descendants of the sisters of their hero as 
of those of his brothers. As regards the third degree, the 
relationships on the female side are much more difficult to 
ferret out than those on the male, and I have no doubt 
Ihave omitted many of them. In my earlier attempts, 
the balance stood still more heavily against the female 
side, and it has been reduced exactly in “proportion to the 
number of times I have revised my data. Consequently, 
though I first suspected a large residuum against the 
female line, I think there is reason to believe the influ- 
ence of females but little inferior to that of males, in 
transmitting judicial ability. 
It is, of course, a grief to me, in writing this book, that 
circumstances make it impossible to estimate the influence 
of the individual peculiarities of the mother—for good or
-P-A-G-E-87
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 57 
  
for bad—upon her offspring. They appear to me, for the 
reasons stated, to be as important elements in the inquiry 
as those of the father, and yet I am obliged to completely 
ignore them in a large majority of instances, on account of 
the lack of reliable information. Nevertheless, I have 
numerous arguments left to prove that genius is here- 
ditary. 
Before going further, J must entreat my readers to 
abandon an objection which very likely may present itself 
to their minds, and which I can easily show to be untenable, 
People who do not realize the nature of my arguments 
have constantly spoken to me to this effect : “It is ofno use 
your quoting successes unless you take failures into equal 
account. Eminent men may have eminent relations, but 
they also have very many who are ordinary, or even stupid, 
and there are not a few who are either eccentric or down- 
right mad.” I perfectly allow all this, but it does not in 
the least affect the cogency of my arguments. If a man 
breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, 
the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of 
their parents. They will commonly be: of a mongrel, 
nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to 
crop out in the offspring. Yet notwithstanding all this, it 
is easy to develop the desirable characteristics of individual 
dogs into the assured heirloom of a new breed. The 
breeder selects the puppies that most nearly approach the 
wished-for type, generation after generation, until they 
have no ancestor, within many degrees, that has objection-. 
able peculiarities. So itis with men and women. Because 
one or both of a child’s parents are able, it does not in the 
least follow as a matter of necessity, but only as one of 
moderately unfavourable odds, that the child will be able 
also. He inherits an extraordinary mixture of qualities 
displayed in his grandparents, great-grandparents, and 
more remote ancestors, as well as from those of his father 
and mother. The most illustrious and so-called “ well- 
bred” families of the human race, are utter mongrels as 
regards their natural gifts of intellect and disposition. 
What I profess to prove is this: that if two children are 
taken, of whom one has a parent exceptionally gifted in
-P-A-G-E-88
  THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
a high degree—say as one in 4,000, or as one in a million— 
and the other has not, the former child has an enormously 
greater chance of turning out to be gifted in a high degree, 
than the other. Also, I argue that, as a new race can be 
obtained in animals and plants, and can be raised to so 
great a degree of purity that it will maintain itself, with 
moderate care in preventing the more faulty members of 
the flock from breeding, so a race of gifted men might be 
obtained, under exactly similar conditions. 
I must apologize for anticipating, in this off-hand and 
very imperfect manner, the subject of a future. chapter by 
these few remarks; but I am really obliged to do so, 
knowing from experience how pertinaciously strangers 
to the reasoning by which the laws of heredity are 
established, are inclined to prejudge my conclusions, by 
blindly insisting that the objection to which I have 
referred has overbearing weight. 
I will now proceed with an examination of what may 
be learnt from the relationships of the Judges. First, I 
would ask, are the abler judges more rich in eminent 
relations than those who are less able? There are two 
ways of answering this question: the one is to examine 
into the relationships of the law lords as compared with 
that of the puisne judges, or of the chancellors compared 
with that of the judges generally; and the other is to 
determine whether or no the persons whose names are 
entered in the third column of Table I. are above the 
average of judges in respect to ability. Here are a few of 
the Lord Chancellors. There are only 30 of those 
high legal officers within the limits of my inquiry, yet 24 
of these have eminent relations; whereas out of the (286 
—30 or) 256 other judges, only (114 — 24 or) 90 have 
eminent relations. There are therefore 80 per cent. of 
the chancellors, as compared to 36 per cent. of the rest of 
the judges, that have eminent relations. The proportion 
would have been greater if I had compared the chancellors, 
or the chancellors and the other law lords, with the puisne 
judges. 
The other test I proposed, is equally satisfactory. 
There can be no doubt of the exceptionally eminent 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 59 
ability of the men whose names appear in the third 
column. To those who object to my conclusion because 
Lord Chancellors have more opportunities of thrusting 
relatives, by jobbery, into eminence than are possessed by 
the other judges, I can do no more than refer them to 
what I have already said about reputation being a test of 
ability, and by giving a short list of the more remarkable 
cases of relations to the Lord Chancellors, which I think 
will adequately meet their objection. They are— 
1. Earl Bathurst and his daughter’s son, the famous 
judge, Sir F. Buller. 2. Earl Camden and his father, 
Chief Justice Pratt. 3. Earl Clarendon and the remark- 
able family of Hyde, in which were two uncles and one 
cousin, all English judges, besides one Welsh judge, and 
many other men of distinction, 4, Earl Cowper, his 
brother the judge, and his great-nephew the poet. 5. 
Earl Eldon and his brother Lord Stowell. 6. Lord 
Erskine, his eminent legal brother the Lord Advocate of 
Scotland, and his son the judge. 7. Earl Nottingham and 
the most remarkable family of Finch. 8, 9, 10. Earl 
Hardwicke and his son, also a Lord Chancellor, who died 
suddenly, and that son’s great-uncle, Lord Somers, also a 
Lord Chancellor. 11. Lord Herbert, his son a judge, his 
cousins Lord Herbert of Cherbury and George the poet 
and divine. 12. Lord King and his uncle John Locke the 
philosopher. 13. The infamous but most able Lord 
Jeffreys had a cousin just like him, namely, Sir J. Trevor, 
Master of the Rolls. 14. Lord Guilford is member of a 
family to which I simply despair of doing justice, for it 
is linked with connexions of such marvellous ability, 
judicial and statesmanlike, as to deserve a small volume to 
describe it. It contains thirty first-class men in near 
kinship, including Montagus, Sydneys, Herberts, Dudleys, 
and others. 15. Lord Truro had two able legal brothers, 
one of whom was Chief Justice at the Cape of Good 
Hope; and his nephew is an English judge, recently 
created Lord Penzance. I will here mention Lord 
Lyttleton, Lord Keeper of Charles I., although many 
members of his most remarkable family do not fall within 
my limits. His father, the Chief Justice of North Wales,
-P-A-G-E-90
60 : THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
  married a lady, the daughter of Sir J. Walter, the Chief 
Justice of South Wales, and also sister of an English 
judge. She bore him Lord Keeper Lyttleton, also Sir 
Timothy, a judge. Lord Lyttleton’s daughter’s son (she 
married a cousin) was Sir T. Lyttleton, the Speaker of 
the House of Commons, 
There is, therefore, abundant reason to conclude that 
the kinsmen of Lord Chancellors are far richer in natural 
gifts than those of the other judges. 
I will now take another test of the existence of heredi- 
tary ability. It is a comparison of the number of entries 
in the columns of Table I. Supposing that natural gifts 
were due to mere accident, unconnected with parentage, 
then the entries would be distributed in accordance with 
the law that governs the distribution of accidents. If it 
be a hundred to one against some member of any family, 
within given limits of kinship, drawing a lottery prize, it 
would be a million to one against three members of the 
same family doing so (nearly, but not exactly, because the 
size of the family is limited), and a million millions to one 
against six members doing so. Therefore, if natural gifts 
were due to mere accident, the first column of Table I. 
would have been enormously longer than the second column, 
and the second column enormously longer than the third ; 
but they are not so. There are nearly as many cases of 
two or three eminent relations as of one eminent relation ; 
and as a set-off against the thirty-nine cases that appear 
in the first column, there are no less than fifteen cases in 
the third. 
It is therefore clear that ability is not distributed at 
hap-hazard, but that it clings to certain families. 
“We will proceed to a third test. 
If genius be hereditary, as I assert it to be, the character- 
istics that mark a judge ought to be frequently transmitted 
to his descendants. The majority of judges belong to a 
strongly-marked type. They are not men who are carried 
away by sentiment, who love seclusion and dreams, but 
they are prominent members of a very different class, one 
that Englishmen are especially prone ‘to honour for at 
least the six lawful days of the week. I mean that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  61 BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 
are vigorous, shrewd, practical, helpful men; glorying in 
the rough-and-tumble of public life, tough in constitution 
and strong in digestion, valuing what money brings, 
aiming at position and influence, and desiring to found 
families. The vigour of a judge is testified by the fact 
that the average age of their appointment in the last 
three reigns has been fifty-seven. The labour and respon- 
sibility of the office seem enormous to lookers-on, yet 
these elderly men continue working with ease for many 
more years; their average age of death is seventy-five, 
and they commonly die in harness. Now are these 
remarkable gifts and peculiarities inherited by their sons ? 
Do the judges often have sons who succeed in the same 
career, where success would have been impossible if they 
had not been gifted with the special qualities of their 
fathers? The best answer is a list of names. They will 
be of much interest to legal readers; others can glance 
them over, and go on to the results.

Out of the 286 Judges, more than one in every nine of 
them have been either father, son, or brother to another 
judge, and the other high legal relationships have been 
even more numerous. There cannot, then, remain a doubt 
but that the peculiar type of ability that is necessary to 
a judge is often transmitted by descent. 
The reader must guard himself against the supposition, 
that because the Judges have so many legal relations, 
therefore they have few other relations of eminence in 
other walks of life. A long list might be made out of 
those who had bishops and archbishops for kinsmen. No 
less than ten judges—of whom one, Sir Robert Hyde, 
appeared in the previous list—have a bishop or an arch- 
bishop for a brother. Of these, Sir William Dolben was 
brother to one Archbishop of York and son of the sister 
of another, namely of John Williams, who was also the 
Lord Keeper to JamesI. There are cases of Poet-relations, 
as Cowper, Coleridge, Milton, Sir Thomas Overbury, and: 
Waller. There are numerous relatives who are novelists, 
physicians, admirals, and generals. My lists of kinsmen 
at the end of this chapter are very briefly treated, but 
they include the names of many great men, whose deeds 
have filled large volumes. It is one of my most serious  
-P-A-G-E-93
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 68 
drawbacks in writing this book, to feel that names, which 
never now present themselves to my eye without asso- 
ciations of respect and reverence, for the great qualities 
of those who bore them, are likely to be insignificant and 
meaningless to the eyes of most of my readers—indeed 
to all of those who have never had occasion to busy them- 
selves with their history. I know how great was my own 
ignorance of the character of the great men of previous 
generations, before I occupied myself with biographies, and 
I therefore reasonably suspect that many of my readers 
will be no better informed about them than I was myself. 
A collection of men that I have learned to look upon as 
an august Valhalla, is likely to be regarded, by those who 
are strangers to the facts of biographical history, as‘an 
assemblage of mere respectabilities. 
The names of North and Montagu, among the Judges, 
introduce us to a remarkable breed of eminent men, set 
forth at length in the genealogical tree of the Montagus, 
and again in that of the Sydneys (see the chapter on 
“LirERARY MEN”), to whose natural history—if the ex- 
pression be permitted—a few pages may be profitably 
assigned. There is hardly a name in those pedigrees 
which is not more than ordinarily eminent: many are 
illustrious. They are closely tied together in their kin- 
ship, and they extend through ten generations. The 
main roots of this diffused ability lie in the families of 
Sydney and Montagu, and, in a lesser degree, in that 
of North. 
The Sydney blood—I mean that of the descendants 
of Sir William Sydney and his wife—had_ extraordinary 
influence in two different combinations. First with the 
Dudleys, producing in the first generation, Sir Philip 
Sydney and his eminent brother and sister ; in the second 
generation, at least one eminent man; and in the third 
generation, Algernon Sydney, with his able brother and 
much be-praised sister. The second combination of the 
Sydney blood was with the Harringtons, producing in the 
first generation a literary peer, and Elizabeth the mother 
of the large and most remarkable family that forms the 
chief feature in my genealogical table.
-P-A-G-E-94
  64 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
The Montagu blood, as represented by Sir Edward, who 
died in the Tower, 1644, is derived from three distinct 
sources. His great-grandfather (gF.) was Sir John Fin- 
nieux, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench ; his grandfather 
(g.) was John Roper, Attorney-General to Henry VIIL.; 
and his father—by far the most eminent of the three— 
was Sir Edward Montagu, Chief Justice of the King’s 
Bench. Sir Edward Montagu, son of the Chief Justice, 
married Elizabeth Harrington, of whom I have just 
spoken, and had a large family, who in themselves and 
in their descendants became most remarkable. To men- 
tion only the titles they won : in the first generation they 
obtained two peerages, the earldom of Manchester and 
the barony of Montagu; in the second they obtained two 
more, the earldom of Sandwich and the barony of Capel ; 
in the third five more, the dukedom of Montagu, earl- 
doms of Halifax and of Essex, the barony of. Guilford, 
and a new barony of Capel (second creation); in the 
fourth one more, the dukedom of Manchester (the Premier 
in 1701); in the fifth one more, the earldom of Guilford. 
The second Earl of Guilford, the Premier of George III. 
(best known as Lord North), was in the sixth generation. 
It is wholly impossible for me to describe the charac- 
teristics of all the individuals who are jotted down in 
my genealogical tree. I could not do it without giving a 
vast deal more room than I can spare. But this much 
I can do, and ought to do; namely, to take those who 
are most closely linked with the Judges, and to show that 
they possessed sterling ability, and did not hold their 
high positions by mere jobbery, nor obtain their reputa- 
tions through the accident of birth or circumstances. I 
will gladly undertake to show this, although it happens 
in the present instance to put my cause in a peculiarly 
disadvantageous light, because Francis North, the Lord 
Keeper, the first Baron Guilford, is the man of all others, 
in that high position (identical, or nearly so, with that 
of a Lord Chancellor), whom modern authorities vie in 
disparaging and condemning. Those who oppose my 
theories might say, the case of North being Lord Keeper 
shows it is impossible to trust official rank as a criterion 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 65 
of abilitv; he was promoted by jobbery, and jobbed 
when he was promoted,; he inherited family influence, 
not natural intellectual gifts: and the same may be said 
of all the members of this or of any other pedigree. As 
I implied before, there is enough truth in this objection 
to make it impossible to meet it by a flat contradiction, 
based on a plain and simple statement. It is necessary 
to analyse characters, and to go a little into detail. I 
will do this, and when it is concluded I believe many of 
my readers will better appreciate than they did before, 
how largely natural intellectual gifts are the birthright of 
some families, 
Francis North, the Lord Keeper, was one of a family of 
five brothers and one sister. The lives of three of the 
brothers are familiarly known to us through the charming 
biographies written: by another brother, Roger North. 
Their position in the Montagu family is easily discovered 
by means of the genealogical tree. They fall in the third 
of those generations I have just described—the one in 
which the family: gained one dukedom, two earldoms, and 
two baronies. Their father was of a literary stock, con- 
tinued backwards in one line during no less than five 
generations. The first Lord North was an eminent lawyer 
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and his son—an able man 
and an ambassador—married the daughter of Lord Chan- 
cellor Rich. His son again—who did not live to enjoy the 
peerage—married the daughter of a Master of the Court 
of Requests, and his great-great-grandsons—the inter- 
mediate links being more or less distinguished, but of 
whose marriages I know little—were the brothers North, 
of whom I am about to speak. 
The father of these brothers was the fourth Baron North. 
He was a literary man, and, among other matters, wrote 
the life of the founder of his family. He was an “eco- 
nomical” man, and “exquisitely virtuous and sober in 
his person.” The style of his writings was not so bright 
as that of his father, the second baron, who was described 
as full of spirit and flame, and who was an author both 
in prose and verse; his poems were praised by Walpole. 
The mother of the brothers, namely, Anne Montagu, is 
F
-P-A-G-E-96
  66 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
  
described by her son as a compendium of charity and 
wisdom. I suspect it was from the fourth Baron North 
that the disagreeable qualities in three of the brothers 
North were derived—such as the priggishness of the Lord 
Keeper, and that curious saving, mercantile spirit that 
appeared under different forms in the Lord Keeper, the 
Financier, and the Master of Trinity College. I cannot 
avoid alluding to these qualities, for they are prominent 
features in their characters, and find a large place in their 
biographies. 
In speaking of the Lord Keeper, I think I had better 
begin with the evil part of his character. When that has 
been admitted and done with, the rest of my task will be 
pleasant and interesting. In short, the Lord Keeper is 
mercilessly handled in respect to his public character. 
Lord Campbell calls him the most odious man that ever 
held the Great Seal, and says that throughout his whole life 
he sought and obtained advancement by the meanest arts. 
Bishop Burnet calls him crafty and designing. Lord 
Macaulay accuses him of selfishness, cowardice, and mean- 
ness. I have heard of no writer who commends his public 
character except his brother, who was tenderly attached to 
him. I should say, that even Lord Campbell acknowledges 
the Lord Keeper to have been extremely amiable in all his 
domestic relations, and that nothing can be more touching 
than the account we have of the warm and steady affec- 
tion between him and his brother, who survived to be his 
biographer. I am, however, no further concerned with 
the Lord Keeper’s public character than to show that, 
notwithstanding his most unworthy acts to obtain advance- 
ment, and notwithstanding he had relatives in high offices 
to help him, his own ability and that of his brothers were 
truly remarkable. 
Bishop Burnet says of him that he had not the virtues 
of his predecessor (Lord Nottingham), but he had parts 
far beyond him. However, Lord Campbell dissents from 
this, and remarks that “a Nottingham does not arise above 
once in a century.” (I will here beg the reader not to 
be unmindful of the marvellous hereditary gifts of the 
Nottingham or Finch family.) Macaulay says his in-
-P-A-G-E-97
  eee 1660 AND 1865 67 
  
tellect was clear, his iiahee great, his proficiency in 
letters and science respectable, and his legal learning more 
than respectable. His brother Roger writes thus of the 
Lord Keeper’s youth :— 
“Tt was singular and remarkable in him that, together 
with the study of the law, which is thought ordinarily to 
devour the whole studious time of a young gentleman, he 
continued to pursue his inquiries into all ingenious arts, 
history, humanity, and languages; whereby he became not 
only a good lawyer, but a good historian, politician, mathe- 
matician, natural philosopher, and, I.must add, musician 
in perfection.” 
The Hon. Sir Dudley North, his younger brother, was 
a man of exceedingly high abilities and vigour. He went 
as a youth to Smyrna, where his good works are not 
yet forgotten, and where he made a large fortune ; then, 
returning to England, he became at once a man of the 
highest note in Parliament as a financier. There was 
an unpleasant side to his character when young, but he 
overmastered and outgrew it. Namely, he first showed a 
strange bent to traffic when at school, afterwards he 
cheated sadly, and got into debts ; then he cheated his 
parents to pay the debts. At last he made a vigorous 
effort, and wholly reformed himself, so that his brother 
concludes his biography in this way :— 
“Tf I may be so free as to give my thoughts of his 
morals, I must allow that, as to all the mercantile arts and 
stratagems of trade which could be used to get money 
from those he dealt with, I believe he was no niggard ; but 
as for falsities . . . he was as clear as any man living.” 
It seems, from the same authority, that he was a very 
forward, lively, and beautiful child. At school he did not 
get on so well with his books, as he had an excessive desire 
for action ; still, his ability was such that a little applica- 
tion went a long way with him, and in the end he came out 
a moderate scholar. He was a great swimmer, and could 
live in the water fora whole afternoon. (I mention this, 
because I shall hereafter have occasion to speak of physical 
gifts not unfrequently accompanying intellectual ones.) He 
sometimes left his clothes in charge of a porter below 
F2
-P-A-G-E-98
    68 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
London Bridge, then ran naked upon the mud-shore of the 
Thames up almost as high as Chelsea, for the pleasure of 
swimming down to his clothes with the tide, and he loved 
to end by shooting the cascade beneath old London Bridge. 
I often marvel at his feat, when I happen to be on the 
river in a steamer. 
I will now quote Macaulay’s description of his first 
appearance, in his after life, on the stage of English 
politics. Speaking, in his “ History of England,” of the 
period immediately following the accession of James IL, 
Macaulay says— 
“The person on whom devolved the task of devising 
ways and means was Sir Dudley North, younger brother 
of the Lord Keeper. Dudley North was one of the ablest 
men of his time. He had early in life been sent to the 
Levant, where he had long been engaged in mercantile 
pursuits. Most men would, in such a situation,. have 
allowed their faculties to rust; for at Smyrna and Con- 
stantinople there were few books and few intelligent 
companions. But the young factor had one of those 
vigorous understandings which are independent of external 
aids. In his solitude he meditated deeply on the philo- 
sophy of trade, and thought out, by degrees, a complete 
and admirable theory—substantially the same with that 
which a hundred years later was expounded by Adam 
Smith.” North was brought into Parliament for Banbury ; 
and, though a new member, was the person on whom the 
Lord Treasurer chiefly relied for the conduct of financial 
business in the Lower House. “ North’s ready wit and 
perfect knowledge of trade prevailed, both in the Treasury 
and the Parliament, against all opposition. The old 
members were amazed at seeing a man who had not been a 
fortnight in the House, and whose life had been chiefly 
passed in foreign countries, assume with confidence, and 
discharge with ability, all the functions of a Chancellor of 
the Exchequer.” He was forty-four years old at the 
time. 
Roger North describes the financial theories of his 
brother, thus: “One is, that trade is not distributed, as 
government, by nations and kingdoms, but is one through-
-P-A-G-E-99
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 69 
  
out the whole world; as the main sea, which cannot be 
emptied or replenished in one part, but the whole more or 
less will be affected.” Another was “concerning money ; 
that no nation could want money (specie), and they would 
not abound init... . For if a people want money, they 
will give a price for it; and then merchants, for gain, 
bring it and lay it down before them.” 
Roger North, speaking of Sir Dudley and of the Lord 
Keeper, says: “These brothers lived with extreme satis- 
faction in each other’s society ; for both had the skill and 
knowledge of the world, as to all affairs relating to their 
several professions, in perfection, and each was an Indies 
to the other, producing always the richest novelties, of 
which the best understandings are greedy.” 
The Hon. Dr. John North, Master of Trinity College, 
Cambridge, differed in some respects from his brothers, 
and resembled them in others :— 
“ When he was very young, and also as he grew up, he 
was of a nice and tender constitution—not so vigorous and 
athletic as most of his brothers were.” “His temper was 
always reserved and studious. . . . If anything so early 
seemed amiss in him, it was a non-natural gravity, which 
in youths is seldom a good sign, for it argues imbecility of 
body and mind, or both; but his lay wholly in the 
former, for his mental capacity was vigorous, as none 
more.” 
Thus he became devoted to study, and the whole of his 
expenditure went to books; in other respects he was penu- 
rious and hoarding. Consequently, as his brother says, 
“he was over-much addicted to thinking, or else he per- 
formed it with more labour and intenseness than other men 
ordinarily do. . . . He was, in a word, the most intense 
and passionate thinker that ever lived, and was in his right 
_ mind.” This ruined his health. “ His flesh was strangely 
flaccid and soft; his going weak and shuffling, often 
crossing his legs as if he were tipsy.; his sleep seldom or 
never easy, but interrupted with unquiet and painful 
dreams—the reposes he had were short and by snatches ; 
his active spirit had rarely any settlement or rest.” 
It is evident that he played foolish tricks with his brain,
-P-A-G-E-100
    70 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
  
and the result was that he had a stroke, and utterly broke 
up, decaying more and more in mind and body until death 
relieved him, zt. 38. 
There is no doubt that Dr. John North deserved more 
reputation than he has obtained, partly owing to his early 
death, and partly to his exceeding sensitiveness in respect 
to posthumous criticism. He left peremptory orders that 
all his MSS. should be burnt. He appears to have been 
especially skilled in Greek and Hebrew scholarship. 
The Lord Keeper and the Master of Trinity resembled 
each other in their painfully shy dispositions and studious 
tastes. The curious money-saving propensities were 
common to all three brothers.’ The indolent habits of the 
Master of Trinity were shared by Sir Dudley after his 
return to England, who would take no exercise what- 
ever, but sat all day either at home, or else steering a little 
sailing-vessel on the Thames. The Lord Keeper was 
always fanciful about his health.~ 
The Hon. Mary North, afterwards Lady Spring, was the 
sister of these brothers, and no less gifted than they. 
Roger North says— 
“ Besides the advantage of her person, she had a superior 
wit, prodigious memory, and was most agreeable in con- 
versation.” She used to rehearse “by heart -prolix 
romances, with the substance of speeches and letters, as 
well as passages; and this with little or no hesitation, but 
in a continual series of discourse—the very memory of 
which is to me at this day very wonderful.” 
She died not long after the birth of her first child, and 
the child died not long after her. 
Roger North, the biographer of his brothers, from whom 
I have quoted so much, was the author of other works, and 
among them is a memoir on Music, showing that he shared 
the musical faculty that was strongly developed in the 
Lord Keeper. Little is known of his private life. He was 
Attorney-General to the consort of James II. There can 
be no doubt as to his abilities, The “ Lives of the Norths” 
is a work of no ordinary writer. It is full of touches of 
genius and shrewd perception of character. Roger North 
seems to have been a most loving and loveable man.
-P-A-G-E-101
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 us 
Charles, the fifth Lord North, was sake sldets of the 
family, and succeeded to the title; but. he did not, so far 
as I am aware, show signs of genius, However, he had a 
daughter whose literary tastes were curiously similar to 
those of her uncle, Dr. John. She was a Dudley North, 
who, in the words of Roger, “ emaciated herself with study, 
whereby she had made familiar to her not only the Greek 
and Latin, but the Oriental languages.” She died early, 
having collected a choice library of Oriental works. 
I will conclude this description of the family with a 
characteristically quaint piece of their biographer’s preface : 
“Really, the case is memorable for the happy circumstance 
of a flock so numerous and diffused as this of the last 
Dudley Lord North’s was, and no one scabby sheep in it.” 
The nearest collateral relation of the North family by 
the Montagu side is Charles Hatton, their first cousin, 
He is alluded to three times in Roger North’s “ Lives,” 
and each time with the same epithet—“the incomparable 
Charles Hatton.” Why he was so distinguished there is 
no information, but it is reasonable to accept Roger North’s 
estimate of his merits, so far as to classify him among the 
gifted members of the Montagu family. 
I will mention only four more of the kinsmen of the 
Norths. The first'is their great-uncle, Sir Henry Montagu, 
Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, and created Earl of 
Manchester, who was grandfather to James Montagu, Ch. 
B.E. (Geo. III.), and uncle of William, Ch. B. E. (Jas. IT.), 
both of whom are included in my list. Lord Clarendon 
says of Sir Henry, that he was “a man of great industry 
and sagacity in business, which he delighted in exceedingly ; 
and preserved so great a vigour of mind, even to his death, 
that some who had known him in his younger years 
did believe him to have much quicker parts in his age 
than before.” 
The second Earl of Manchester, gN. to the Norths, was 
the Baron Kimbolton, of Marston Moor, and, as Lord 
Campbell says, “one of the most distinguished men who 
appeared in the most interesting period of our history ; 
having, as Lord Kimbolton, vindicated the liberties of his 
country in the Senate, as Earl of Manchester in the field,
-P-A-G-E-102
  72 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
and having afterwards mainly contributed to the sup- 
pression of anarchy by the restoration of the royal line.” 
The first Earl of Sandwich, also gN. to the Norths, was 
the gallant High Admiral of England in the time of 
Charles II. He began life as a soldier, when only eighteen 
years of age, with a Parliamentary regiment that he himself 
had raised ; and he ended it in a naval battle against the 
Dutch in Southwold Bay. He also translated a Spanish 
work on Metallurgy. I do not know that the book is of 
any value, but the fact is worthy of notice as showing that 
he was more than a mere soldier or sailor. 
The last of the eminent relations of the Norths of whom 
I shall speak at length, was the great-grandson of the 
eldest brother, who became the famous Premier—the Lord 
North—of the time of the American war. Lord Brougham 
says that all contemporaries agree in representing his talents 
as having shone with a great and steady lustre during that 
singularly trying period. He speaks of a wit that never 
failed him, and a suavity of temper that could never be 
ruffled, as peculiar qualities in which he, and indeed all his 
family (his immediate family), excelled most other men, 
The admirable description of Lord North by his daughter, 
Lady Charlotte Lindsay, that is appended to his bio- 
graphy by Lord Brougham, is sufficient proof of that lady’s 
high ability. 
There is yet another great legal family, related to the 
Norths, whose place in the pedigree I do not know: it is 
that of the Hydes, and includes the illustrious first Earl 
of Clarendon. It appears that the Lord Chief Justice 
Hyde used to take kindly notice of the Lord Keeper, 
Francis North, when a young rising barrister, and allude 
to his kinship, and call him “ cousin.’ 
It is want of space, not want of material, that compels 
me to conclude the description of the able relatives of the 
Norths and Montagus. But I am sure I have said enough 
to prove the assertion with which I prefaced it, that natural 
gifts of an exceedingly high order were inherited by a 
very large number of the members of the family, and that 
these owed their reputations to their abilities, and not to 
family support.
-P-A-G-E-103
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 73 
  
Another test of the truth of the hereditary character of 
ability is to see whether the near relations of very eminent 
men are more frequently eminent than those who are 
more remote. Table IT. (p. 55) answers this question with 
great distinctness in the way I have’ already explained. 
It shows that the near relations of the Judges are far 
richer in ability than the more remote—so much so, that 
the fact of being born in the fourth degree of relationship 
is of no sensible benefit at all, The data from which 
I obtained column C of that table are as follow :—I find 
that 23 of the Judges are reported to have had “large 
families,” say consisting of four adult sons in each; 11 
are simply described as having “issue,” say at the rate of 
1} sons each ; and that the number of the sons of others 
are specified as amounting between them to 186 ; forming 
thus far a total of 294. In addition to these, there are 
9 reported marriages of judges in which no allusion is 
made to children, and there are 31 judges in respect to 
whom nothing is said about marriage at all. I think we 
are fairly justified, from: these data, in concluding that 
each judge is father, on an average, to not less than one 
son who lives to an age at which he might have distin- 
guished himself, if he had the ability to do so. J also 
find the (adult) families to consist on an average of 
not less than 24 sons and 2} daughters each, conse- 
quently each judge has an average of 14 brothers and 2} 
sisters. 
From these data it is perfectly easy to reckon the 
number of kinsmen in each order. Thus the nephews 
consist of the brothers’ sons and the sisters’ sons: now 
100 judges are supposed to have 150 brothers and 250 
sisters, and each brother and each sister to have, on the 
average, only one son; consequently the 100 judges will 
have (150 + 250, or) 400 nephews. 
I need not trouble the reader with more figures ; suffice 
it to say, I have divided the total numbers of eminent 
kinsmen to 100 judges by the number of kinsmen in each 
degree, and from that division I obtained the column D 
in Table IL, which I now project into a genealogical tree 
in Table III.

It will be observed that Table III. refers only to distin- 
guished families. If we modified it to correspond with 
column E of Table II., in which all the Judges, whether 
they have distinguished relations or no, are considered, 
the proportion between the eminent kinsmen in each 
different degree would be unchanged, though their abso- 
lute numbers would be reduced to about one-third of 
their value. 
Table III. shows in the most unmistakable manner 
the enormous odds that a near kinsman has over one that 
is remote, in the chance of inheriting ability. Speaking 
roughly, the percentages are quartered at each successive 
remove, whether by descent or collaterally. Thus in the 
first degree of kinship the ‘percentage is about 28; in the 
second, about 7; and in the third, 14. 
The table also testifies to another fact, in which people 
do not commonly believe. It shows that when we regard 
the averages of many instances, the frequent sports of 
nature in producing prodigies must be regarded as appa-
-P-A-G-E-105
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 75 
  
rent, and not as real. Ability, in the long run, does not 
suddenly start into existence and disappear with equal 
abruptness, but rather, it rises in a gradual and regular 
curve out of the ordinary level of family life. The statistics 
show that there is a regular average increase of ability 
in the generations that precede its culmination, and as 
regular a decrease in those that succeed it. In the 
first case the marriages have been consentient to its 
production, in the latter they have been incapable of 
preserving it. 
After three successive dilutions of the blood, the descend- 
ants of the Judges appear incapable of rising to eminence. 
These results are not surprising even when compared with 
the far greater length of kinship through which features 
or diseases may be transmitted. Ability must be based 
on a triple footing, every leg of which has to be firmly 
planted. In order that a man should inherit ability in 
the concrete, he must inherit three qualities that are 
separate and independent of one another: he must in- 
herit capacity, zeal, and vigour; for unless these three, 
or, at the very least, two of them are combined, he 
cannot hope to make a figure in the world. The proba- 
bility against inheriting a combination of three qualities 
not correlated together, is necessarily in a triplicate pro- 
portion greater than it is against inheriting any one of 
them. 
There is a marked difference between the percentage of 
ability in the grandsons of the judge when his sons (the 
fathers of those grandsons) have been eminent than when 
they have not. Let us suppose that the son of a judge 
wishes to marry: what expectation has he that his own 
sons will become eminent men, supporters of his family, 
and not a burden to it, in their after life ? 
In the case where the son of the judge is himself emi- 
nent, I find, out of the 226 judges previous to the present 
reign, 22 whose sons have been distinguished men. I do 
not count instances in the present reign, because the 
grandsons of these judges are for the most part too young 
to have achieved distinction. 22 out of 226 gives 10 in 
100 .as the percentage of the judges that have had distin-
-P-A-G-E-106

guished sons. (The reader will remark how near this 
result is to the 94 as entered in my table, showing the 
general truth of both estimates.) Of these 22 I count the 
following triplets. The Atkyns family as two. It is true 
that the grandfather was only Chief Justice of North 
Wales, and not an English judge, but the vigour of the 
blood is proved by the line of not only his son and two 
grandsons being English judges, but also by the grandson 
of one of them, through the female line, being an English 
judge also. Another line is that of the Pratts, viz. the 
Chief Justice and his son, the Lord Chancellor, Earl 
Camden, and his grandson, the son of the Earl, created 
the Marquis Camden; the latter was Chancellor of the 
University of Cambridge, and a man of note in many 
ways. Another case is in the Yorke line, for the son of 
the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Hardwicke, was Charles 
Yorke, himself a Lord Chancellor. His sons were able 
men: one became First Lord of the Admiralty, another 
was Bishop of Ely, a third was a military officer of dis- 
tinction and created Baron Dover, a fourth was an admiral 
of distinction. I will not count all these, but will reckon 
them as three favourable instances. The total, thus far, is 
six; to which might be added in. fairness something from 
that most remarkable Montagu family and its connexions, 
of which several judges, both before and after the acces- 
sion of Charles I., were members. However, I wish to be 
well within bounds, and therefore will claim only six 
successes out of the 22 cases (I allow one son to each 
judge, as before), or 1 in 4. Even under these limita- 
tions it is only 4 to 1, on the average, against each 
child of an eminent son of a judge becoming a distin- 
guished man. 
Now for the second category, where the son is not emi- 
nent, but the grandson is. There are only seven of these 
cases to the (226—22 or) 204 judges that remain, and 
one or two of them are not of a very high order. They 
are the third Earl Shaftesbury, author of the “Charac- 
teristics ;” Cowper, the poet; Lord Lechmere, the Attor- 
ney-General ; Sir Wm. Mansfield, Commander-in-Chief in 
India ; Sir Eardley Willmot, who filled various offices with
-P-A-G-E-107
  BETWEEN 1660 AND 1865 77 
credit and was created a baronet; and Lord Wyndham, 
Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Fielding, the novelist, was 
grandson of Judge Gould, by the female line. Hence it 
is 204 to 7, or 30 to 1, against the non-eminent son of 
a judge having an eminent child. 
The figures in these two categories are clearly too few 
to justify us in relying on them, except so far as to show 
that the probability of a judge having an eminent grand- 
son is largely increased if his sons are also eminent. It 
follows that the sons or daughters of distinguished men 
who are themselves gifted with decidedly high ability, as 
tested at the University or elsewhere, cannot do better 
than marry early in life.. If they have a large family, the 
odds are in their favour that one at least of their children 
will be eminently successful in life, and will be a subject of 
pride to them and a help to the rest. 
Let us for a moment consider the bearing of the facts 
just obtained, on the theory of an aristocracy where able 
men earn titles, and transmit them by descent through the 
line of their eldest male representatives. The practice 
may be justified on two distinct grounds. On the one 
hand, the future peer is reared in a home full of family 
traditions, that form his disposition. On the other hand, 
he is presumed to inherit the ability of the founder of the 
family. The former is a real justification for the law of 
primogeniture, as applied to titles and possessions; the 
latter, as we see from the table, is not. A man who has 
no able ancestor nearer in blood to him than a great- 
grandparent, is inappreciably better off in the chance of 
being himself gifted with ability, than if he had been taken 
out of the general mass of men. An old peerage is a 
valueless title to natural gifts, except so far as it may 
have been furbished up by a succession of wise inter- 
marriages. When, however, as is often the case, the direct 
line has become extinct and the title has passed to a 
distant relative, who had not been reared in the family 
traditions, the sentiment that is attached to its possession 
is utterly unreasonable. I cannot think of any claim to 
respect, put forward in modern days, that is so entirely 
an imposture, as that made by a peer on the ground of
-P-A-G-E-108
    78 THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND 
  
descent, who has neither been nobly educated, nor has any 
eminent kinsman, within three degrees. 
I will conclude this chapter with a few facts I have 
derived from my various jottings, concerning the “ natural 
history” of Judges. It appears that the parentage of the 
Judges in the last six reigns, viz. since the accession of 
George I., is as follows, reckoning in percentages: noble, 
honourable, or baronet (but not judges), 9; landed gen- 
tlemen, 35; judge, barrister, or attorney, 15; bishop or 
clergyman, 8; medical, 7; merchants and various, un- 
classed, 10; tradesmen, 7; unknown, 9. There is, there- 
fore, no very marked class peculiarity in the origin of the 
Judges. They seem to be derived from much the same 
sources as the scholars of our Universities, with a decided 
but not excessive preponderance in favour of legal parents. ° 
T also thought it worth while to note the order in which 
the Judges stood in their several families, to see whether 
ability affected the eldest more than the youngest, or if 
any important fact of the kind might appear. I find in 
my notes that I have recorded the order of the birth of 
72 judges. The result of the percentages is, that the judge 
was an only son in 11 cases; eldest in 17; second in 38; 
third in 22; fourth in 9; fifth in 1; and of a yet later 
birth in 2 instances. It is clear that the eldest. sons do 
not succeed as judges half as well as the cadets. I suppose 
that social influences are, on the whole, against their 
entering, or against their succeeding at the law.

than 112 of them find a place in the following list. Among the Judges are 
included the Lord Chancellors, 30 in number, and of these eminent officers 
no less than 24, or 80 per cent. of the whole, will be found to have eminent

STATESMEN 
I propose in this chapter to discuss the relationships of 
modern English Statesmen. It is my earnest desire, 
throughout this book, to steer safely between two dangers : 
on the one hand, of accepting mere official position or 
notoriety, as identical with a more discriminative reputa- 
tion, and on the other, of an unconscious bias towards 
facts most favourable to my argument. In order to guard 
against the latter danger, I employ groups of names 
selected by others; and, to guard against the former, 
I adopt selections that command general confidence. It 
is especially important in dealing with statesmen, whose 
eminence, as such, is largely affected by the accident of 
social position, to be cautious in both these respects. It 
would not be a judicious plan to take for our select list 
the names of privy councillors, or even of Cabinet 
ministers; for though some of them are illustriously 
gifted, and many are eminently so, yet others belong to a 
decidedly lower natural grade. For instance, it seemed 
in late years to have become a mere incident to the 
position of a great territorial duke to have a seat in the 
Cabinet, as a minister of the Crown. No doubt some few 
of the dukes are highly gifted, but it may be affirmed, 
with equal assurance, that the abilities of the large 
majority are very far indeed from justifying such an 
appointment. 
_ Again, the exceptional position of a Cabinet minister
-P-A-G-E-129
  STATESMEN 99 
cannot possibly be a just criterion of a correspondingly 
exceptional share of natural .gifts, because statesmanship 
is not an open profession. It was much more so in the 
days of pocket-boroughs, when young men of really high 
promise were eagerly looked for by territorial magnates, 
and brought into Parliament, and kept there to do gladia- 
torial battle for one or other of the great contending 
parties of the State. With those exceptions, parliamen- 
tary life was not, even then, an open career, for only 
favoured youths were admitted to compete. But, as is 
the case in every other profession, none, except those who 
are extraordinarily and peculiarly gifted, are likely to 
succeed in parliamentary life, unless engaged in it from 
their early manhood onwards. Dudley North, of whom I 
spoke in the chapter on Judges, was certainly a great 
success ; so, in recent times, was Lord George Bentinck ; 
so in one way or another, was the Duke of Wellington; 
and other cases could easily be quoted of men beginning 
their active parliamentary life in advanced manhood and 
nevertheless achieving success; but, as a rule, to which 
there are very few exceptions, statesmen consist of men 
who had obtained—it little matters how—the privilege of 
entering Parliament in early life, and of being kept there. ~ 
Every Cabinet is necessarily selected from a limited field. 
No doubt it always contains some few persons of very 
high natural gifts, who would have found their way to the 
front under any reasonably fair political régime, but it also 
invariably contains others who would have fallen far 
behind in the struggle for place and influence, if all 
England had been admitted on equal terms to the 
struggle. 
Two selections of men occurred to me as being, on the 
whole, well worthy of confidence. One, that of the 
Premiers, begun, for convenience’ sake, with the reign of 
George III.; their number is 25, and the proportion of 
them who cannot claim to be much more than “emi- 
nently” gifted, such as Addington,— 
“Pitt is to Addington as London to Paddington,”— 
is very small. The other selection is Lord Broughami’s 
LIBRARY HQ 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE Te noe em
-P-A-G-E-130
100 STATESMEN 
  
“Statesmen of the Reign of George III.” It consists of 
no more than 53 men, selected as the foremost statesmen 
in that long reign. Now of these, 11 are judges and, I 
may add, 7 of those judges were described in the ap- 
pendix to the last chapter, viz. Lords Camden, Eldon, 
Erskine, Ellenborough, King, Mansfield, and Thurlow. 
The remaining 4 are Chief Justices Burke and Gibbs, 
Sir William Grant, and Lord Loughborough. — Lord 
Brougham’s list also contains the name of Lord Nelson, 
which will be more properly included among the 
Commanders; and that of Earl St. Vincent, which may 
remain in this chapter, for he was a very able adminis- 
trator in peace as well asa navalcommander. In addition 
to these, are the names of 9 Premiers, of whom one is 
the Duke of Wellington, whom I count here, and again 
among the Commanders, leaving a net balance, in the 
selection made by Lord Brougham, of 31 new names to 
discuss. The total of the two selections, omitting the 
judges, is 57. 
The average natural ability of these men may very 
justly be stated as superior to class F. Canning, Fox, 
the two Pitts, Romilly, Sir Robert Walpole (whom 
Lord Brougham imports into his list), the Marquess 
Wellesley, and the Duke of Wellington, probably exceed 
G. It will be seen how extraordinary are the relationships 
of these families. The kinship of the two Pitts, father 
and son, is often spoken of as a rare, if not a sole, instance 
of high genius being hereditary; but the remarkable * 
kinships of William Pitt were yet more widely diffused. 
He was not only son of a premier, but nephew of 
another, George Grenville, and cousin of a third, Lord 
Grenville. Besides this, he had the Temple blood. His 
pedigree, which is given in the appendix to this chapter, 
does scant justice to his breed. The Fox pedigree is also 
very remarkable in its connexion with the Lords Holland 
and the Napier family. But one of the most conspicuous 
is that of the Marquess Wellesley, a most illustrious 
statesman, both in India and at home, and his younger 
brother, the great Duke of Wellington. It is also curious, 
from the fact of the Marquess possessing very remarkable 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  STATESMEN 101 
  
gifts as a scholar and critic. They distinguished him in 
early life and descended to his son, the late Principal of 
New Inn Hall, at Oxford, but they were not shared by his 
brother. Yet, although the great Duke had nothing of the 
scholar or art-critic in him, he had qualities akin to both. 
His writings are terse and nervous, and eminently effective. 
His furniture, equipages, and the like were characterised 
by unostentatious completeness and efficiency under a 
pleasing form. 
I do not intend to go seriatim through the many names 
mentioned in my appendix. The reader must do that for 
himself, and he will find it well worth his while to do 
so; but I shall content myself here with throwing results 
into the same convenient statistical form that I have 
already employed for the Judges, and arguing on the 
same bases that the relationships of the Statesmen abun- 
dantly prove the hereditary character of their genius. 
In addition to the English statesmen of whom I have 
been speaking, I thought it well to swell their scanty 
numbers by adding a small supplementary list, taken from 
various periods and other countries. I cannot precisely 
say how large was the area of selection from which this 
list was taken. I can only assure the reader that it contains 
a considerable proportion of the names, that seemed to me 
the most conspicuous among those that I found described 
at length, in ordinary small biographical dictionaries.

First, have the ablest statesmen the largest number of 
able relatives? Table I. answers this in the affirmative. 
There can be no doubt, that its third section contains more 
illustrious names than the first ; and the more the reader 
will take the pains of analysing and “weighing” the 
relationships, the more, I am sure, will he find this truth 
to become apparent. Again, the Statesmen, as a whole, 
are far more eminently gifted than the Judges ; accordingly 
it will be seen in Table IT., by a comparison of its column 
B with the corresponding column in p. 55,° that their rela- 
tions are more rich in ability. 
To proceed to the next test ; we see, that the third 
section is actually longer than either the first or the second, 
showing that ability is not distributed at haphazard, but, 
that it affects certain families. 
Thirdly, the statesman’s type of ability is largely trans- 
mitted or inherited. It would be tedious to count the 
instances in favour, Those to the contrary are Disraeli, 
Sir P. Francis (who was hardly a statesman, but rather 
a bitter controversialist), and Horner. In all the other 
1 For explanation refer to the similar table in p. 55.

35. or 36 cases in my appendix, one or more statesmen 
will be found among their eminent relations. In other 
words, the combination of high intellectual gifts, tact in 
dealing with men, power of expression in debate, and 
ability to endure exceedingly hard work, is hereditary. 
Table II. proves, just as distinctly as it did in the case 
of the Judges, that the nearer kinsmen of the eminent 
Statesmen are far more rich in ability than the more 
remote. It will be seen, that the law of distribution, as 
gathered from these instances, is very similar to what we 
had previously found it to be. I shall not stop here to 
compare that law, in respect to the Statesmen and the 
Judges, for I propose to treat all the groups of eminent 
men, who form the subjects of my several chapters, in a 
precisely similar manner, and to collate the results, once 
for all, at the end of the book.

Died worn out in body and spirits xt. 65. 
He eloped in youth with Miss Linley, a popular singer of 
great personal charms and exquisite musical talents, 
Tom Sheridan was the son of that marriage. Miss 
‘ Linley’s father was a musical composer and manager of 
Drury Lane Theatre. The Linley family was “a nest 
of nightingales:” all had genius, beauty, and voice. 
Mrs. Tickel was one of them. The name of Sheridan 
is peculiarly associated with a clearly marked order of

STATESMEN 
brilliant and engaging but “ne’er-do-weel” qualities. 
Richard Brinsley’s genius worked in flashes, and left 
results that were disproportionate to its remarkable 
power. His oratorical power and winning address 
made him a brilliant speaker and a star in society ; 
but he was neither a sterling statesman nor a true 
friend. He was an excellent boon companion, but 
unhappy in his domestic relations. Reckless prodi- 
gality, gambling, and wild living, brought on debts and 
duns and a premature break of his constitution. These 
qualities are found in a greater or less degree among 
numerous members of the Sheridan family, as well as 
in those whose biographies have been published. It is 
exceedingly instructive to observe how strongly here- 
ditary they have proved to be. 
Thomas Sheridan, author of the Dictionary. Taught 
oratory, connected himself with theatres, became, xt. 25, 
manager of Drury Lane. He was a whimsical but not 
an opinionated man. 
Frances Chamberlain, most accomplished and amiable. 
Her father would not allow her to learn writing ; her 
brothers taught her secretly: wt. 15, her talent for 
literary composition showed itself. She wrote some 
comedies, one of which was as highly eulogized by 
Garrick, as her novel “Sydney Biddulph” was pane-

i18 STATESMEN   
SUPPLEMENTARY LIST OF GREAT STATESMEN 
OF VARIOUS PERIODS AND COUNTRIES. 
Adams, John (1735-1826), the second President of the United 
States. Educated for the law, where he soon gained 
great reputation and practice ; was an active politician 
zt, 30; took a prominent part in effecting the inde- 
pendence of his country. 
8. John Quincey Adams, sixth President of the United States ; 
previously minister in Berlin, Russia, and Vienna. 
P. Charles Francis Adams, the recent and well-known 
American minister in London ; author of “ Life of John 
Adams.” 
Arteveldt, James Van (1345%); brewer of Ghent; popular 
leader in the revolt of Flanders ; exercised sovereign 
power for nine years. 
8. Philip Van Arteveldt. See below. 
Arteveldt, Philip Van (1382 ?) ; leader of the popular party, 
long subsequently to his father’s death. He was well 
educated and wealthy, and had kept aloof from politics 
till et. 42, when he was dragged into them by the 
popular party, and hailed their captain by acclamation. 
He led the Flemish bravely against the French, but 
was finally defeated and slain. 
F. James Van Arteveldt. See above. 
Burleigh, Earl. See Crom. 
Cecil, William; created Lord Burleigh ; statesman (Eliza- 
beth); Lord Treasurer, “The ablest minister of an 
able reign.” Was Secretary, or chief Minister, during 
almost the whole of Queen Elizabeth’s long reign of 
forty-five years. He was distinguished at Cambridge 
for his power of work and for his very regular habits. 
Married for his second wife the daughter of Sir Anthony 
Cooke, director of the studies of Edward VI., and sister 
of Lady Bacon, the mother of the great Lord Bacon, 
and had by her— 
S. Robert Cecil, who was created Earl of Salisbury the 
same day that his elder brother was created Earl of 
Exeter. He was of weakly constitution and de- 
formed. Succeeded his father as Prime Minister 
under Elizabeth, and afterwards under James I.; 
was unquestionably the ablest minister of his time, 
but cold:hearted and selfish, Lord Bacon was uS. to him.
-P-A-G-E-149
  STATESMEN 119 
Cecil, William, continued— 
te: Ist Earl of Exeter. 
Master of the Robes to Henry VIII. 
Colbert, Jean Baptiste; French statesman and financier Pad Aizw (Louis XIV.); eminent for the encouragement he 
gave to public works and institutions, to commerce 
and manufactures. He was fully appreciated in his 
early life by Mazarin, who recommended him as his 
successor. He became minister et. 49, and used to 
work for sixteen hours a day. His family gave 
many distinguished servants to France. 
. Odart ; a merchant who became a considerable financier. 
Charles ; statesman and diplomatist. 
Jean Baptiste; statesman; intelligent and firm of 
purpose ; commanded, when still a mere youth, the 
expedition against Genoa in 1684. 
Jacques Nicholas, archbishop ; member of the Academy 
. Jean Baptiste (son of Charles) ; diplomatist. 
. Charles Joachim ; prelate. 
The family continued to show ability in the succeeding 
generation. 
Cromwell, Oliver ; Lord Protector of the Commonwealth. 
US. Hampden the patriot, whom Lord Clarendon speaks of 
as having “a head to contrive, a tongue to persuade, 
and a heart to execute any mischief ;”—this word “ mis- 
chief” meaning, of course, antagonism to the King. 
* Up. Edmund Waller, the poet, a man of very considerable 
8. abilities both in parliamentary eloquence and in poetry, 
but he was not over-stedfast in principle. He was n. 
to Hampden. 
Henry ; behaved with gallantry in the army, and acted 
with much distinction in Ireland as Lord Deputy. 
He had one other son and four daughters, who married 
able men, but their descendants were not remarkable. 
The Cromwell breed has been of much less importance 
than might have been expected from his own genius 
and that of his collaterals, Hampden and Waller. 
Besides his son Henry, there is no important name 
in the numerous descendants of Oliver Cromwell. 
Henry’s sons were insignificant people, so were those 
of Richard, and so also were those of Cromwell’s 
daughters, notwithstanding their marriage with such 
eminent men as Ireton and Fleetwood, One of

Oliver’s sisters married Archbishop Tillotson, and 
had issue by him, but they proved nobodies. 
Guise, Francis Balafré, Duke of. The most illustrious 
among the generals and great political leaders of this 
powerful French family. He had high military talent. 
He greatly distinguished himself as a general ext. 34, 
and was then elevated to the dignity of Lieutenant- 
General of the kingdom: 
B. Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. 
8. Henry (Duke of Guise, also called Balafré). He was 
Jess magnanimous and more factious than his father ; 
was the adviser of the massacre of St. Bartholomew ; 
and he caused Coligny to be murdered; was himself 
murdered by order of Henri IIL, xt. 38. 
8. Cardinal, arrested and murdered in prison, on the same 
day as his brother. 
[S.] Duc de Mayenne. 
P. Charles, who, together with his uncle, the Duc de 
Mayenne, was leader of the league against Henri IV. 
PS. Henry, conspired against Cardinal Richelieu. 
Thus there were four generations of notable men in the 
Guise family. 
Mirabeau, H. G. Riquetti, Comte de; French statesman, 
“The Alcibiades of the French Revolution.” A man 
of violent passions, ardent imagination, and great 
abilities. He had prodigious mental activity, and 
hungered for every kind of knowledge. 
F. Marquis de Mirabeau ; author of “ L’Ami des Hommes,” 
a leader of the school of the Economists ; a philanthro- 
pist by profession, and a harsh despot in his own family. 
{Band 6.] There were remarkable characters among the 
brothers and sisters of Mirabeau, but I am unable 
to state facts by which their merits may be distinctly 
appraised, 
It is said that among many generations of the Mirabeaus 
—or more properly speaking, of the Riquettis, for 
Mirabeau was an assumed name—were to be found 
men of great mental vigour and character. Thus St. 
Beuve says—and I give the extract in full and without 
apology on account of the interest ever attaching itself 
to Mirabeau’s characteristics: 
“Les Correspondances du pére et de l’oncle du grand 
tribun, la Notice sur son grand-pére, et en général

qu’a descendre pour se répandre ensuite, pour se pré- 
cipiter comme il l’a fait et se distribuer 4 tous, telle- 
ment qu’on peut dire qu'il n’a été que l’enfant perdu, 
Venfant prodigue et sublime de sa race.” 
He combined his paternal qualities with those of his 
mother :— 
“Ce n’était suivant la définition de son pére qu'un mile 
monstreux au physique et au moral. 
“Tl tenait de sa mére la largeur du visage, les instincts, 
les appétits prodigues et | sensuels, mais probablement 
aussi ce certain fond gaillard et gaulois, cette faculté de se 
familiariser et de s’humaniser que les Riquetti n’avaient 
pas, et qui deviendra un des moyens de sa puissance. 
“Une nature riche, ample, copieuse, généreuse, souvent 
grossiére et vicée, souvent fine aussi, noble, méme élé- 
gante, et, en somme, pas du tout monstreuse, ‘mais des 
plus humaines.” 
  More, Sir Thomas ; Lord Chancellor (Henry VIII.) ; eminent 
statesman and writer ; singularly amiable, unaffectedly 
pious, and resolute to death. When et. 13, the Dean 
of St. Paul’s used to say of him, “There was but one 
wit in England, and that was young More.” 
F. Sir John More, Just. K. B. 
[S. and 3 s.] Besides his three accomplished daughters, 
Margaret Roper, Elizabeth Dauncy, and Cecilia 
Heron, Sir Thomas More had one son called John. 
Too much has been said of the want of capacity of 
this son. His father commended the purity of his 
Latin more than that of his daughters, and Gryneus 
(see under Drvines) dedicated to him an edition of 
Plato, while Erasmus inscribed to him the works of 
Aristotle. He had enough strength of character to 
deny the king’s supremacy, and on that account he 
lay for some time in the Tower under sentence of 
death. (“Life of More,’ by Rev. Joseph Hunter, 
1828, Preface, p. xxxvi.) 
Richelieu, Armand J. du Plessis, Cardinal Duc de. The 
great minister of France under Louis XIV. He was 
educated for arms, but devoted himself to study, and 
entered the Church at a very early age—earlier than 
was legal—and became Doctor. Ait. 39 he was chief

pursued but one end—the establishment of a strong 
despotism. Died xt. 57. 
F. Francois du Plessis, seigneur de Richelieu; signalized 
himself as a soldier and a diplomatist. Was promoted 
to be “grand prévét de France,” and was highly 
rewarded by Henri IV.

a duel just when he was about to be promoted to the

behaved nobly in Lyons at the time of the plague. 
BP. (Grandson of Henri.) Louis F. Armand, Due de Riche- 
lieu. He was Marshal of France, and personified the 
eighteenth century ; being frivolous, fond of intrigue, 
immoral, without remorse, imperturbably  good- 
humoured, and courageous. He was a seven months’ 
child, and lived to et. 92. His children were—

Witt, De, John. The younger brother of two of the ablest and 
more honourable of Dutch statesmen. They were in- 
separable in their careers, but different in character ; 
each, however, being among the finest specimens of his 
peculiar type. John played the more prominent part, 
on account of his genial, versatile, and aspiring

  ENGLISH PEERAGES, THEIR INFLUENCE UPON RACE 123 
  
ENGLISH PEERAGES, 
THEIR INFLUENCE UPON RACE 
It is frequently, and justly, remarked, that the families of 
great men are apt to die out; and it is argued from that 
fact, that men of ability are unprolific. If this were the 
case, every attempt to produce a highly-gifted race of men 
would eventually be defeated. Gifted individuals might 
be reared, but they would be unable to maintain their 
breed. I propose in a future chapter, after I have dis- 
cussed the several groups of eminent men, to examine the 
degree in which transcendent genius may be correlated 
with sterility, but it will be convenient that I should now 
say something about the causes of failure of issue of 
Judges and Statesmen, and come to some conclusion 
whether or no a breed of men gifted with the average 
ability of those eminent men, could or could not maintain 
itself during an indefinite number of consecutive genera- 
tions. I will even go a little further a-field, and treat 
of the extinct peerages generally. 
First, as to the Judges: there is a peculiarity in their 
domestic relations that interferes with a large average of 
legitimate families. Lord Campbell states in a foot-note 
to his life of Lord Chancellor Thurlow, in his “ Lives of 
the Chancellors,” that when he (Lord Campbell) was first 
acquainted with the English Bar, one half of the judges 
had married their mistresses. He says it was then the
-P-A-G-E-154
  124 ENGLISH PEERAGES, 
  
understanding that when a barrister was elevated to the 
Bench, he should either marry his mistress, or put her 
away. 
According to this extraordinary statement, it would 
appear that much more than one half of the judges that * 
sat on the Bench in the beginning of this century, had no 
legitimate offspring before the advanced period of their 
lives at which they were appointed judges. One half of 
them could not, because it was at that stage in their career 
that they married their mistresses ; and‘there were others 
who, having then put away their mistresses, were, for the 
first time, able to marry. Nevertheless, I have shown that 
the number of the legitimate children of the Judges is 
considerable, and that even under that limitation, they are, 
on the whole, by no means an unfertile race. Bearing in 
mind what I have just stated, it must follow that they are 
extremely prolific. Nay, there are occasional instances of 
enormous families, in all periods of their history. But do 
not the families die out? I will examine into the de- 
scendants of those judges whose names are to be found 
in the appendix to the chapter upon them, who gained 
peerages, and who last sat on. the Bench previous to the 
close of the reign of George IV. There are thirty-one of 
them; nineteen of the peerages remain and twelve are 
extinct. Under what conditions did these twelve become 
extinct? Were any of those conditions peculiar to the 
twelve, and not shared by the remaining nineteen ? 
In order to obtain an answer to these inquiries, I 
examined into the number of children and grandchildren 
of all the thirty-one peers, and into the particulars of their 
alliances, and tabulated them ; when, to my astonishment, 
I found a very simple, adequate, and novel explanation, 
of the common cause of extinction of peerages, stare me 
in the face. It appeared, in the first instance, that a con- 
siderable proportion of the new peers and of their sons 
married heiresses. Their motives for doing so are in- 
telligible enough, and not to be condemned. They have 
a title, and perhaps a sufficient fortune, to transmit to their 
eldest son, but they want an increase of possessions for the 
endowment of their younger sons and their daughters. On
-P-A-G-E-155
THEIR INFLUENCE UPON RACE 125 
  
the other hand, an heiress has a fortune, but wants a title. 
Thus the peer and heiress are urged to the same issue of 
marriage by different impulses. But my statistical lists 
showed, with unmistakable emphasis, that these marriages 
are peculiarly unprolific. We might, indeed, have expected 
that an heiress, who is the sole issue of a marriage, would 
not be so fertile as a woman who has many brothers and 
sisters. Comparative infertility must be hereditary in the 
same way as other physical attributes, and I am assured it 
is so in the case of the domestic animals. Consequently, 
the issue of a peer’s marriage with an heiress frequently 
fails, and his title is brought to an end. I will give the 
following list of every case in the first or second generation 
of the Law Lords, taken from the English Judges within 
the limits I have already specified, where there has been 
a marriage with an heiress or a co-heiress, and I will 
describe the result in each instance. Then I will sum- 
marize the facts.

Judges who obtained Peerages, and who last sat on the Bench 
between the beginning of the reign of Charles II, and the end 
of the reign of George IV. 
(The figures within parentheses give the date of their peerages. ) 
Colpepper, Ist Lord (1664). Married twice, and had issue by 
both marriages ; in all, five sons and four daughters. The 
eldest son married .an heiress, and died without issue. The 
second son married a co-heiress, and had only one daughter. 
The third married, but had no children, and the other two 
never married at all, so the title became extinct. 
Cooper, Ist Earl of Shaftesbury (1672). His mother was a 
sole heiress. He married three times, and had only one son, 
However, the son was prolific, and the direct male line 
continues. 
Cowper, Ist Earl (1718). First wife was an heiress ; he had 
no surviving issue by her. His second wife had two sons 
and two daughters. His eldest son married a co-heiress for 
his first wife, and had only one son and one daughter. The 
direct male line continues. : 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
  196° - ENGLISH PEERAGES, 
Finch, lst Earl of Nottingham (1681). Had fourteen children. 
The eldest married a co-heiress for his first wife, and had 
only one daughter by her. 
Harcourt, Ist Lord (1712). Had three sons and two daughters. 
Two of the sons died young. The eldest married an heiress, 
whose mother was an heiress also. He had by her two sons 
and one daughter. Both of the sons married, and both died 
issueless, so the title became extinct. 
Henley, 1st Earl of Northington (1764). His mother was a 
co-heiress. He married, and had one son and five daughters. 
The son died unmarried, and so the title became extinct. 
Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon (1661). Married a lady who 
was eventually sole heiress, and had four sons and two 
daughters by her. The third son died unmarried, and the 
fourth was drowned at sea, consequently there remained only 
two available sons to carry on the family. Of these, the 
eldest, who became the 2d Earl, married a lady who died, 
leaving an only son. He then married for his second wife, 
an heiress, who had no issue at all. This only son had but 
one male child, who died in youth, and was succeeded in 
the title by the descendants of the Ist Earl’s second son. 
He ‘(the son of an heiress) had only one son and four 
daughters, and this son, who was 4th Earl of Clarendon, had 
only one son and two daughters. The son died young, so 
the title became extinct. 
Jeffreys, Ist Lord (of Wem—1685). Had one son and two 
daughters. The son married an heiress, and had only one 
daughter, so the title became extinct. 
Kenyon, Ist Lord (1788). Had three sons. Although one of 
them married a co-heiress, there were numerous descendants 
in the next generation. ‘ 
North, 1st Lord Guilford (1683). Married a co-heiress. He 
had only one grandson, who, however, lived and had chil- 
dren. . 
Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield (1721). This family has 
narrowly escaped extinction, threatened continually by its 
numerous errors of alliance. The 1st Earl married a co- 
heiress, and had only one son and one daughter. The son 
married a co-heiress, and had two sons; of these, the second 
married a co-heiress, and had no issue at all. The eldest 
son (grandson of the 1st Earl) was therefore the only male 
that remained in the race. He had two sons and one 
daughter. Now, of these two, the only male heirs in the
-P-A-G-E-157
  THEIR INFLUENCE UPON RACE 127 
third generation, one married a co-heiress, and had only 
one daughter. The remaining one fortunately married 
twice, for by the first marriage he had only daughters. 
A son by the second marriage is the present peer, and is 
the father, by two marriages—in neither case with an 
heiress—of eleven sons and four daughters. 
Pratt, 1st Earl of Camden (1786). This family affords a 
similar instance to the last one, of impending destruction to 
the race. The lst Earl married an heiress, and had only 
one son and four daughters. The son married an heiress, 
and had only one son and three daughters. The son 
married a co-heiress, but fortunately had three sons and 
eight daughters. 
Raymond, 1st Lord (1731). He had one son, who married 
a co-heiress, and left no issue at all, so the title became 
extinct. 
Scott, Lord Stowell. See further on, under my list of 
STATESMEN. 
Talbot, 1st Lord (1733). This family narrowly escaped ex- 
tinction. The Ist Lord married an heiress, and had three 
sons. The eldest son married an heiress, and had only one 
daughter. The second son married a co-heiress, and had no 
issue by her. However, she died, and he married again, 
and left four sons. The third son of the first Earl had 
male issue. 
Trevor, Ist Lord (1711). Married first a co-heiress, and had 
two sons and three daughters. Both of the sons married, 
but they had only one daughter each. Lord Trevor married 
again, and had three sons, of whom one died young, and 
the other two, though they married, left no issue at all. 
‘Wedderburn, 1st Lord Loughborough and Earl of Rosslyn 
(1801). Married an heiress for his first wife, and had no 
issue at all, He married again, somewhat late in life, and 
had no issue. So the direct male line is extinct. 
Yorke, Ist Earl of Hardwicke (1754). Is numerously repre- 
sented, though two of his lines of descent have failed, in 
one of which there was a marriage with a co-heiress. 
The result of all these facts is exceedingly striking 
It is:— 
Ist. That out of the thirty-one peerages, there were no 
less than seventeen in which the hereditary influence of an 
heiress or co-heiress affected the first or second generation,
-P-A-G-E-158
  ; 
  i 
128 ENGLISH PEERAGES, 
  
That this influence was sensibly an agent in producing 
sterility in sixteen out. of these seventeen peerages, and 
the influence was sometimes shown in two, three, or more 
cases in one peerage. 
2d. That the direct male line of no less than eight 
peerages, viz. Colpepper, Harcourt, Northington, Claren- 
don, Jeffreys, Raymond, Trevor, and Rosslyn, were actually 
extinguished through the influence of the heiresses, and 
that six others, viz. Shaftesbury, Cowper, Guilford, Parker, 
Camden, and Talbot, had very narrow escapes from ex- 
tinction, owing to the same cause. I literally have only 
one case, that of Lord Kenyon, where the race-destroying 
influence of heiress-blood was not felt. 
3d. Out of the twelve peerages that have failed in the 
direct male line, no less than eight failures are accounted 
for by heiress-marriages. 
Now, what of the four that remain? Lords Somers and 
Thurlow both died unmarried. Lord Alvanley had only 
two sons, of whom one died unmarried. There is only his 
ease and that of the Earl of Mansfield, out of the ten 
who married and whose titles have since become extinct, 
where the extinction may not be accounted for by heiress- 
marriages. No one can therefore maintain, with any show 
of reason, that there are grounds for imputing exceptional 
sterility to the race of judges. The facts, when carefully 
analysed, point very strongly in the opposite direction. 
I will now treat the EStek of George ITI. and the 
Premiers since the accession of George ITI. down to recent 
times, in the same way as I have treated the Judges ; in- 
cluding, however, only those whose pedigrees I can easily 
find, namely, such as were peers or nearly related to peers. 
There are twenty-two of these names. I find that fourteen 
have left no male descendants, and that seven of those 
fourteen peers or their sons have married heiresses—namely, 
Canning, Castlereagh, Lord Grenville, George Grenville, 
Lord Holland, Lord Stowell, and Walpole (the first Earl 
of Orford). On the other hand, I find only three cases of 
peers marrying heiresses without failure of issue—namely, 
Addington (Lord Sidmouth), the Marquis of Bute, and the 
Duke of Grafton.
-P-A-G-E-159
  THEIR INFLUENCE UPON RACE 129 
  
The seven whose male line became extinct from other 
causes are Bolingbroke, Earl Chatham, Lord Liverpool, 
Earl St. Vincent, Earl Nelson, William Pitt (unmarried), 
and the Marquess of Wellesley (who left illegitimate issue). 
The remaining five required to complete the twenty-two 
cases are the Duke of Bedford, Dundas (Viscount Melville), 
Perceval, Romilly, and Wilberforce. None of these were 
allied or descended from heiress-blood, and they have all 
left descendants. 
I append to this summary the history of the heiress- 
marriages, to correspond with what has already been given 
in respect to the Judges. 
Bute, Marquess of. Married a co-heiress, but had a large 
family. 
Canning, George. Married an heiress, and had three sons 
and one daughter. The eldest died young ; the second. was 
drowned in youth; and the third, who was the late Earl 
Canning, married a co-heiress, and had no issue : so the line 
is extinct. 
Castlereagh, Viscount. Married a co-heiress, and had neither 
son nor daughter ; so the line became extinct. 
Grafton, Duke of. Married an heiress, and had two sons and 
one daughter. By a second wife he had a larger family. 
Grenville, George. Had three sons and four daughters. The 
eldest son married an heiress, and had no male grand- 
children ; the second was apparently unmarried; the third 
was Lord Grenville (Premier) : he married, but was issueless ; 
so the line is extinct. 
Holland, Lord. Had one son and one dngelicar The son 
married an heiress, and had only one son and one daughter. 
That son died issueless ; so the male line is extinct. 
Rockingham, 2d Marquis. Married an heiress, and had no 
issue ; so the title became extinct. 
Sidmouth, Viscount (Addington). Was son of an heiress, and 
he had only one son and four daughters. The son had 
numerous descendants. 
Stowell, Lord. Married a co-heiress. He had only one son, 
who died unmarried, and one daughter ; so the male line is 
extinct. 
Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford. Had three sons and two 
daughters. The eldest son married an heiress, and had only 
K  
-P-A-G-E-160
  130 ENGLISH PEERAGES, 
one son, who died unmarried. The second and third sons 
died unmarried ; so the male line is extinct. 
The important result disclosed by these facts, that inter- 
marriage with heiresses is a notable agent in the extinction 
of families, is confirmed by more extended inquiries. I 
devoted some days to ransacking Burke’s volumes on the 
extant and on the extinct peerages. I first tried the 
marriages made by the second peers of each extant title. 
It seemed reasonable to expect that the eldest son of the 
first peer, the founder of the title, would marry heiresses 
pretty frequently ; and so they do, and with terrible destruc- 
tion to their race. I examined one-seventh part of the 
peerage. Leaving out co-heiresses—for I shall weary the 
reader if I refine overmuch—the following were the results : 
No. of cases. 
1 Abingdon, 2d Earl; wife and mother both heiresses. No issue. 
2 Aldborough, 2d Earl ; married two heiresses. No issue. 
1 Annesley, 2d Earl; wife and mother both heiresses, 3 sons and 2 
daughters. 
1 Arran, 2d Earl ; wife and mother both heiresses. 4 sons and 3 
daughters. 
a (His son, the 3d Earl, married an heiress, and had no issue. ) 
1 Ashburnham, 2d Baron ; wife and mother both heiresses. No issue. 
a (His brother succeeded as 3d Earl, and married an heiress; by her 
no issue. ) 
1 Aylesford, 2d Earl; wife heiress, mother co-heiress. 1 son and 3 
daughters. 
1 Barrington, 2d Viscount ; wife and mother both heiresses. No issue. 
2 Beaufort, 2d Duke ; marr. two heiresses. By one no issue; by the 
other 2 sons. 
1 Bedford, 2d Duke ; married heiress. 2 sons and 2 daughters. 
1 Camden, 2d Earl; wife and mother both heiresses. 1 son and 3 
daughters. 
14 
Making a grand total of fourteen cases out of seventy 
peers, resulting in eight instances of absolute sterility, and 
in two instances of only one son. 
I tried the question from another side, by taking the 
marriages of the last peers and comparing the numbers 
of the children when the mother was an heiress with those 
when she was not. I took precautions to exclude from 
the latter all cases where the mother was a co-heiress, or
-P-A-G-E-161

the father an only son. Also, since heiresses are not so 
very common, I sometimes went back two or three gene- 
rations for an instance of an heiress-marriage. In this 
way I took fifty cases of each. I give them below, having 
first doubled the actual results, in order to turn them into 
percentages :—

I find that among the wives of peers— 
100 who are heiresses have 208 sons and 206 daughters. 
100 who are not heiresses have 336 sons and 284 daughters. 
The table shows how exceedingly precarious must be 
the line of a descent from an heiress, especially when 
younger sons are not apt to marry. One-fifth of the 
heiresses have no male children at all; a full third have 
not more than one child; three-fifths have not more than 
two. It has been the salvation of many families that the 
husband outlived the heiress whom he first married, and 
was able to leave issue by a second wife. i 
1 I fear I must have overlooked one or two sterile marriages ; otherwise 
I cannot account for the smallness of this number. 
K2
-P-A-G-E-162
  132 ENGLISH PEERAGES, 
Every advancement in dignity is a fresh inducement to 
the introduction of another heiress into the family. Con- 
sequently, dukes have a greater impregnation of heiress- 
blood than earls, and dukedoms might be expected to be 
more frequently extinguished than earldoms, and earldoms 
to be more apt to go than baronies. Experience shows 
this to be most decidedly the case. Sir Bernard Burke, 
in his preface to the “Extinct Peerages,” states that all 
the English dukedoms created from the commencement 
of the order down to the commencement of the reign of 
Charles II. are gone, excepting three that are merged in 
royalty, and that only eleven earldoms remain out of 
the many created by the Normans, Plantagenets, and 
Tudors, 
This concludes my statistics about the heiresses. I do 
not care to go farther, because one ought to know some- 
thing more about their several histories before attempting 
to arrive at very precise results in respect to their fertility. 
An heiress is not always the sole child of a marriage con- 
tracted early in life and enduring for many years. She 
may be the surviving child of a larger family, or the child 
of a late marriage, or the parents may have early left her 
an orphan. We ought also to consider the family of the 
husband, whether he be a sole child, or one of a large 
family. These matters would afford a very instructive field 
of inquiry to those who cared to labour in it, but it falls 
outside my line of work. The reason I have gone so far 
is simply to show that, although many men of eminent 
ability (I do not speak of illustrious or prodigious genius) 
have not left desceifdants behind them, it is not because 
they are sterile, but because they are apt to marry sterile 
women, in order to obtain wealth to support the peerage 
with which their merits have been rewarded. I look 
upon the peerage as a disastrous institution, owing to its 
destructive effects on our valuable races. The most 
highly-gifted men are ennobled; their elder sons are 
tempted to marry heiresses, and their younger ones not 
to marry at all, for these have not enough fortune to 
support both a family and an aristocratical position. So 
the side-shoots of the genealogical tree are hacked off,
-P-A-G-E-163
  THEIR INFLUENCE UPON RACE 133 
  
and the leading shoot is blighted, and the breed is lost. for 
ever. 
It is with much satisfaction that I have traced and, I 
hope, finally disposed of the cause why families are apt 
to become extinct in proportion to their dignity—chiefly 
so, on account of my desire to show that able races are not 
necessarily sterile, and secondarily because it may put 
an end to the wild and ludicrous hypotheses that are 
frequently started to account for their extinction.

134 COMMANDERS 
  
COMMANDERS 
In times of prolonged war, when the reputation ofa great 
commander can alone be obtained, the profession of arms 
affords a career that offers its full share of opportunities 
tomen of military genius. Promotion is quick, the demand 
for able men is continuous, and very young officers have 
frequent opportunities of showing their powers. Hence it 
follows that the list of great commanders, notwithstanding 
it is short, contains several of the most gifted men recorded 
in history. They showed enormous superiority over their 
contemporaries by excelling in many particulars. They 
were foremost in their day, among statesmen and generals, 
and their energy was prodigious. Many, when they were 
mere striplings, were distinguished for political capacity. 
In their early manhood, they bore the whole weight and 
responsibility of government; they animated armies and 
nations with their spirit; they became the champions of 
great coalitions, and coerced millions of other men by the 
superior power of their own intellect and will. 
I will run through a few of these names in the order in 
which they will appear in the appendix to this chapter, to 
show what giants in ability their acts prove them to have 
been, and how great and original was the position they 
occupied at ages when most youths are kept in the back- 
ground of general society, and hardly suffered to express 
opinions, much less to act, contrary to the prevailing 
sentiments of the day. 
Alexander the Great began his career of conquest at the 
age of twenty, having previously spent four years at home 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  COMMANDERS 135 
  
in the exercise of more or less sovereign power, with a 
real statesmanlike capacity. His life’s work was over 
zt. 32. Bonaparte, the Emperor Napoleon I, was general 
of the Italian army et. 26, and thenceforward carried 
everything before him, whether in the field or in the State, 
in rapid succession. He was made emperor wt. 35, and 
had lost Waterloo et. 46. Cesar, though he was prevented 
by political hindrances from obtaining high office and from 
commanding in the field till wt. 42, was a man of the 
greatest political promise as a youth; nay, even as a boy. 
Charlemagne began his wars «et. 30. Charles XII. of 
Sweden began his, et. 18; and the ability showed by him 
at that early period of life was of the highest order. 
Prince Eugene commanded the imperial army in Austria 
get. 25. Gustavus Adolphus was as precocious in war and 
statesmanship as his descendant Charles XII. Hannibal 
and his family were remarkable for their youthful supe- 
riority. Many of them had obtained the highest commands, 
and had become the terror of the Romans, before they 
were what we call “of age.” The Nassau family are 
equally noteworthy. When William the Silent was a mere 
boy, he was the trusted confidant, even adviser, of the 
Emperor Charles V. His son, the great general Maurice 
of Nassau, was only eighteen when in chief command of 
the Low Countries, then risen in arms against the Spaniards. 
His grandson, Turenne, the gifted French general, and 
his great-grandson, our William ITI., were both of them 
illustrious in early life. Marlborough was from 46 to 50 
years of age during the period of his greatest success, but he 
was treated much earlier as a man of high mark. Scipio 
Africanus Major was only 24 when in chief command 
in Spain against the Carthaginians. Wellington broke 
the Mahratta power et. 35, and had won Waterloo et. 
46, 
But though the profession of arms in time of prolonged 
war affords ample opportunities to men of high military 
genius, it is otherwise in peace, or in short wars. The 
army, in every country, is more directly under the influ- 
ence of the sovereign than any other institution. Guided 
by the instinct of self-preservation, the patronage of the
-P-A-G-E-166
  136 COMMANDERS 
  
army is always the last privilege that sovereigns are 
disposed to yield to democratic demands. Hence it is, 
that armies invariably suffer from those evils that are 
inseparable from courtly patronage. Rank and political 
services are apt to be weighed against military ability, 
and incapable officers to occupy high places during periods 
of peace. They may even be able to continue to fill 
their posts during short wars without creating a public 
scandal; nay, sometimes to carry away honours that 
ought in justice to have been bestowed on their more 
capable subordinates in rank. 
It is therefore very necessary, in accepting the reputation 
of a commander as a test of his gifts, to confine ourselves, 
as I propose to do, to those commanders only whose 
reputation has been tested by prolonged wars, or whose 
ascendency over other men has been freely acknow- 
ledged. 
There is a singular and curious condition of success in 
the army and navy, quite independent of ability, that 
deserves a few words. In order that a young man may 
fight his way to the top of his profession, he must survive 
many battles. But it so happens that men of equal 
ability are not equally likely to escape shot free. Before 
explaining why, let me remark that the danger of being 
shot in battle is considerable. No less than seven of the 
thirty-two commanders mentioned in my appendix, or 
between one-quarter and one-fifth of them, perished in 
that way; they are Charles XII., Gustavus Adolphus, Sir 
Henry Lawrence, Sir John Moore, Nelson, Tromp, and 
Turenne, (I may add, while talking of these things, though 
it does not bear on my argument, that four others were 
murdered, viz. Cesar, Coligny, Philip II. of Macedon, and 
William the Silent; and that two committed suicide, viz. 
Lord Clive and Hannibal. In short, 40 per cent. of the 
whole number died by violent deaths.) 
There is a principle of natural selection in an enemy’s 
bullets which bears more heavily against large than against 
small men. Large men are more likely to be hit. I cal- 
culate that the chance of a man being accidentally shot is 
as the square root of the product of his height multiplied
-P-A-G-E-167
  
COMMANDERS 187 
into his weight ;1 that where a man of 16 stone in weight, 
and 6 feet 24 inches high, will escape from chance shots for 
two years,a man of 8 stone in weight and 5 feet 6 inches 
high, would escape for three. But the total proportion of 
the risk run by the large man, is, I believe, considerably 
greater. He is conspicuous from his size, and is therefore 
more likely to be recognised and made the object of a 
special aim. It is also in human nature, that the shooter 
should pick out the largest man, just as he would pick out 
the largest bird in a covey, or antelope in a herd. Again, 
of two men who are aimed at, the bigger is the more likely 
to be hit, as affording a larger target. This chance is a 
trifle less than the ratio of his increased sectional area, for 
it is subject to the law discussed in p. 25, though we are 
unable to calculate the decrease, from our ignorance of 
the average distance of the enemy and the closeness of 
his fire. At long distances, and when the shooting was 
wild, the decrease would be insensible ; at comparatively 
close ranges it would be unimportant, for even the sums of 
A and B, p. 30, are only about one-fifth more than 2 A. 
(In the last column of the table 774+48=125 is only 21, 
or about one-fifth more than 2 x 48 = 96.) As a matter 
of fact, commanders are very frequently the objects of 
special aim. I remember, when Soult visited England, 
that a story appeared in the newspapers, of some English 
veteran having declared that the hero must have lived 
a charmed life, for he had “covered” him with his rifle 
(I think my memory does not deceive me) upwards of 
thirty times, and yet had never the fortune to hit him. 
Nelson was killed by one of many shots aimed directly 
at him, by a rifleman in the maintop of the French vessel 
with which his own was closely engaged. 
1 The chance of a man being struck by accidental shots is in proportion 
to his sectional area—that is, to his shadow on a neighbouring wall cast by 
a distant light; or to his height multiplied into his average breadth. 
However, it is equally easy and more convenient to calculate from the 
better known data of his height and weight. One man differs from 
another in being more or less tall, and more or less thick-set. It is 
unnecessary to consider depth (of chest, for example) as well as width, for 
the two go together. Let # = a man’s height, w = his weight, b = his 
average breadth taken in any direction we please, but it must be in the 
same direction for all, Then his weight, w, varies as hb, and his sectional 
area varies as hb, or as/h X hb*, or as hw. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
188 t COMMANDERS 
  
The total relative chances against being shot in battle, 
of two men of the respective heights and weights I have 
described, are as 3 to 2 in favour of the smaller man in 
respect to accidental shots, and in a decidedly more 
favourable proportion in respect to direct aim; the latter 
chance being compounded of the two following,—first, a 
better hope of not being aimed at, and secondly, a hope 
very little less than 3 to 2, of not being hit when made 
the object of an aim. 
This is really an important consideration. Had Nelson 
been a large man, instead of a mere feather-weight, the 
probability is that he would not have survived so long. 
Let us for a moment consider the extraordinary dangers 
he survived. Leaving out of consideration the early part 
of his active service, which was only occasionally hazardous, 
as also the long interval of peace that followed it, we find 
him, et. 35, engaged in active warfare with the French, 
when, through his energy at Bastia and Calvi, his name 
became dreaded throughout the Mediterranean. Ait. 37, 
he obtained great renown from his share in the battle of 
St. Vincent. He was afterwards under severe fire at Cadiz, 
also at Teneriffe where he lost an arm by a cannon-shot. 
He then received a pension of £1,000 a year. The memo- 
rial which he was required to present on this occasion, 
stated that he had been in action one hundred and twenty 
times, and speaks of other severe wounds besides the loss 
of his arm and eye. Ait. 40, he gained the victory of the 
Nile, where the contest was most bloody. He thereupon 
was created Baron Nelson with a pension of £3,000 a year, 
and received the thanks of Parliament ; he was also made 
Duke of Bronté by the King of Naples, and he became 
idolized in England. dt. 43, he was engaged in the severe 
battle of Copenhagen, and et. 47 was shot at Trafalgar. 
Thus his active career extended through twelve years, 
during the earlier part of which he was much more ‘fre- 
quently under fire than afterwards. Had he only lived 
through two-thirds, or even three-fourths, of his battles, he 
could not have commanded at the Nile, Copenhagen, or 
Trafalgar. His reputation under those circumstances would 
have been limited to that of a dashing captain or a young
-P-A-G-E-169

and promising admiral. Wellington was a small man; if 
he had been shot in the Peninsula, his reputation, though 
it would have undoubtedly been very great, would have 
lost the lustre of Waterloo. In short, to have survived 
is an essential condition to becoming a famed commander ; 
4 yet persons equally endowed with military gifts—such as 
the requisite form of high intellectual and moral ability 
and of constitutional vigour—are by no means equally 
qualified to escape shot free. The enemy’s bullets are 
least dangerous to the smallest men, and therefore small 
men are more likely to achieve high fame as commanders 
than their equally gifted contemporaries whose physical . 
» frames are larger. 
I now give tables on precisely the same principle as 
those in previous chapters,

ables, as from those I have already given ; but they make

in the third section of Table I. should, on the whole, be 
those of men of greater weight, than are included in the 
first section. There cannot be a shadow of doubt that 
this is the fact. But the table shows more. Its third 
section is proportionally longer than it was in the

Now, the average natural gifts of the different groups are 
apportioned in precisely the same order. The Commanders 
are more able than the Statesmen, and the Statesmen 
more able than the Judges. Consequently, comparing the 
three groups together, we find the abler men to have, on 
the average, the larger number of able kinsmen, Similarly, 
the proportion borne by those Commanders who have 
any eminent relations at all, to those who have not, is 
much greater than it is in Statesmen; and in these, much 
greater than in the Judges. 
Their peculiar type of ability is largely transmitted, 
My limited list of Commanders contains several notable 
families of generals. _ That of William the Silent is a most 
illustrious family, and I must say, that in at least two out 
of his four wives—namely, the daughter of the Elector of 
Saxony and that of the great Coligny—he could not 
have married more discreetly. To have had Maurice of 
Nassau for a son, Turenne for a grandson, and our 
William III. for a great-grandson, is a marvellous instance 
of hereditary gifts. Another most illustrious family is 
that of Charlemagne. First, Pepin de Heristhal, virtual 
sovereign of France; then his son, Charles Martel, who 
drove back the Saracenie invasion that had overspread 
the half of France ; then his grandson, Pepin le Bref, the 
founder of the Carlovingian dynasty ; and lastly, his great- 
grandson, Charlemagne, founder of the Germanic Empire. 
The three that come last, if not the whole of the four, 
were of the very highest rank as leaders of men. 
Another yet more illustrious family is that of Alexander, 
including Philip of Macedon, the Ptolemys, and his second 
cousin, Pyrrhus. I acknowledge the latter to be a far-off 
relation, but Pyrrhus so nearly resembled Alexander in 
character, that I am entitled to claim his gifts as hereditary. 
Another family is that of Hannibal, his father and his
-P-A-G-E-172

brothers ; again, there is that of the Scipios ; also the in- 
teresting near relationship between Marlborough and the 
Duke of Berwick. Raleigh’s kinships are exceedingly 
appropriate to my argument, as affording excellent in- 
stances of hereditary special aptitudes. I have spoken in 
the last chapter about Wellington and the Marquess of 
Wellesley, so I need not repeat myself here. Of Com- 
manders of high but not equally illustrious stamp, I should 
mention the family of Napier, of Lawrence, and the 
singular naval race of Hyde Parker. There were five 
brothers Grant, all highly distinguished in Wellington’s 
campaigns. I may as well mention, that though I know 
too little about the great Asiatic warriors, Genghis Khan 
and Timurlane, to insert them in my appendix, yet they 
are doubly though very distantly interrelated. 
The distribution of ability among the different degrees 
of kinship, will be seen to follow much the same order that 
it did in the Statesmen and in the Judges.

ordinary judgment in public affairs, having governed 
Macedonia during the absence of his father. He 
succeeded to the throne, and began his great career 
of conquest wt. 20, and died et. 32. Living as he 
did in a time when the marriage tie was loose, there 
necessarily exists some doubt as to his relationships 
However, his reputed relationships are of a very 
high order. He inherited much of the natural dis- 
position of both of his parents; the cool forethought 
and practical wisdom of his father, and the ardent 
enthusiasm and ungovernable passions of his mother. 
He had four wives, but only one son, a posthumous child, 
who was murdered ext. 12.

Philip II. of Macedonia, an illustrious general and states- 
man, who created and organized an army that was held 
together by a system of discipline previously unknown, 
and kept the whole of Greece in check. At. 24 he had 
shown his cool forethought and practical skill in deliver- 
ing himself from embarrassing political difficulties. He 
had a robust frame, a noble and commanding presence, 
a ready eloquence, and dexterity in the management of 
men and things. Cicero praises him for having been 
“always great.” He keenly enjoyed the animal plea- 
sures of life. He was murdered ext. 47. 
Olympias, ardent in her enthusiasms, ungovernable in her 
passions, ever scheming and intriguing. She suffered 
death like a heroine. 
(Half-brother.) Ptolemy Soter I. He became the first 
king of Egypt after Alexander’s death, and was the 
son of Philip II. by Arsinoe. Alexander rated him 
very highly. He was very brave, and had all the 
qualities of an able and judicious general. He was 
also given to literature, and he patronised learned 
men. He had twelve descendants, who became kings 
of Egypt, who were all called Ptolemy, and who nearly 
all resembled one another in features, in statesmanlike 
ability, in love of letters, and in their voluptuous 
dispositions. This race of Ptolemys is at first sight 
exceedingly interesting, on account of the extraordinary 
number of their close intermarriages. They were 
matched in and in like prize cattle; but these near 
marriages were unprolific—the inheritance mostly 
passed through other wives. Indicating the Ptolemys 
by numbers, according to the order of their succession, 
II. married his niece, and afterwards his sister; IV. 
his sister ; VI. and VII. were brothers, and they both 
consecutively married the same sister—VII. also sub- 
sequently married his niece ; VIII. married two of his 
own sisters consecutively; XII. and XIII. were 
brothers, and both consecutively married their sister, 
the famous Cleopatra. 
Thus there are no less than nine cases of close inter- 
marriages distributed among the thirteen Ptolemys. 
However, when we put them, as below, into the form 
of a genealogical tree, we shall clearly see that the 
main line of descent was untouched by these inter-
-P-A-G-E-175
  
  COMMANDERS 145 
marriages, except in the two cases of III. and of VIII. 
The personal beauty and vigour of Cleopatra, the last 
of the race, cannot therefore be justly quoted in dis- 
proof of the evil effects of close breeding. On the 
contrary, the result of Ptolemaic experience was dis- 
tinctly to show that intermarriages are followed by 
sterility.

of Suez canal, sent voyages of discovery down the Red 
Sea, founded the Alexandrian library and caused the

monarch of his day if he had had perseverance. The 
links that connected him in blood with Alexander 
appear to have mostly been of a remarkable character, 
but hardly deserving of special record here. The 
character of Pyrrhus resembled that of Alexander, 
whom he also took as his model from an early 
age, being fired with the ambition of imitating his 
exploits.

succession. He was then made lieutenant-general of 
the French armies, and created a Spanish grandee.

Bonaparte, Napoleon I. His extraordinary powers did not 
show themselves in boyhood. He was a taciturn lad.

“Distinguished in mathematical studies, tolerably 
versed in history and geography, much behind in his 
Latin and belles-lettres and other accomplishments, 
of regular habits, studious and well-behaved, and 
enjoying excellent health” (Bourienne). He first 
distinguished himself, wt. 24, at the siege of Toulon.

Became general of the army of Italy, when it was 
in a disorganized condition, wt. 26 ; and thenceforward 
began his almost uninterrupted career of victory. He 
was emperor, wt. 35; was vanquished at Waterloo, et. 
46 ; and died at St. Helena six years after. Among 
the more remarkable qualities of this extraordinary 
man were a prodigious memory and intellectual rest- 
lessness. His vigour was enormous. 
There are so many considerable persons in the Bonaparte 
family, while at the same time some of these have been 
so helped and others so restrained by political circum- 
stances, that it is very difficult to indicate which should 
be and which should not be selected as instances of 
hereditary genius. I will give a genealogical tree of 
the family (p. 147), and shall assume the ratio of 
hereditary influence to be— 
J. B., b., 8., and 2 N. 
Lucien, Eliza, and Louis were very gifted persons, and 
others of the brothers and sisters of Napoleon I. were 
certainly above the average. There. are members of 
the family yet alive, including the Cardinal at Rome, 
who may have high political parts to play. 
Cesar, Julius; Dictator of Rome. Was not only a general 
s&s of the highest order and a statesman, but also an 
orator and man of letters. He gave the greatest 
promise, even when a boy, and was remarkable in his 
youth for his judgment, literary ability, and oratori- 
cal powers. Owing to the disturbed state of Roman 
politics, he did not become Consul till wt. 41, nor 
begin his military career till wt. 42. Thenceforward 
he had unbroken success for fourteen years. He was 
assassinated wt. 56. He must be considered as a 
peculiarly profligate man, even when his character is 
measured by the low standard of the time in which he 
lived. He had no brothers, only two sisters. He was 
married four times, and had one illegitimate son, by 
Cleopatra, called Cexesarion, whom Augustus caused to 
be executed while still a boy, for political reasons ; also 
one daughter, as follows— 
Julia, married to Pompey, and greatly beloved by him 
(though the marriage was merely made up for political 
reasons) and by the whole nation. She was singularly 
endowed with ability, virtue, and beauty. Died

prematurely, four years after her marriage, from the 
shock of a serious alarm, when she was advanced in 
pregnancy. 
Jf. Aurelia: seems to have been no ordinary woman ; sne 
carefully watched over the education of her children, 
and Cesar always treated her with the greatest 
affection and respect. 
n. Atia, the mother of Augustus, who carefully tended his 
education, and who is classed along with Cornelia, the 
mother of the Gracchi, and Aurelia, the mother of Czesar. 
nS, Augustus Cesar, Ist Emperor of Rome. The public 
opinion of his own time considered him to be an 
excellent prince and statesman. He was adopted by 
Cesar, who rated him very highly, and devoted much 
time out of his busy life to his education. He had 
great caution and moderation. Was very successful 
as a general in early life, after the death of Julius 
Cresar. Married three wives, but left only one 
daughter. 
U. Sex. Julius Cesar ; Consul, p.c. 91. 
1 Mark Antony. His mother belonged to the family of 
Julius Cesar, but in what degree she was connected 
with it is unknown. 
(Caius Marius, the general, married the aunt (u.) of 
Julius Cesar, but had no children by her: Marius the 
younger, who had much of the character and ability 
of Caius, being only an adopted son.) 
Charlemagne, founder of the Germanic Empire and a great 
general. Began his wars wt. 30; died et. 72. Was 
an eminent legislator and great patron of learning. 
Had very many children, including Louis le Débon-

volunteers to the Huguenot camp. 
uS. Gawen Champernoun, engaged with Raleigh in later

him, that he might be unfit to rule when he grew to 
manhood : nevertheless he entered, «t. 17, on a career 
of ambition, and by ext. 29 he had acquired large 
dominion, This energetic man ruled for forty years 
in undisputed mastery over numerous turbulent pro- 
vinees, although his health was so broken by excesses 
and low indulgence, wt. 50, that he could not stand

beaten by Charles XII. was, nevertheless, a man. of 
mark. He was luxurious and licentious. 
u. Count Kéningsmarck was brother to Marshal Saxe’s beau- 
tiful but frail mother. He intrigued with the wife of 
George I. of England, and was assassinated. Was a 
handsome dashing man, always in gay adventures, 
ps. Madame Dudevant (Georges Sand), the French novelist. 
Her grandmother was a natural daughter of Marshal 
Saxe. 
Scipio, P. Cornelius; Africanus Major; conqueror of

Julius Cesar, He was only 24 years old when ap-

in Spain. 
The Scipio family produced many great men, and to 
that family Rome was largely indebted for obtaining 
the empire of the world.

Hannibal, and finally defeated and killed by the 
Carthaginian forces under Hasdrubal and Mago. 
G. L. Cornelius Scipio; drove the Carthaginians out of

larger amount of learning. 
His brother, L. Corn. 8. Afr., is called “a degenerate 
son of his illustrious sire.” 
Cornelia, who married Tiber. Sempr. Gracchus, was 
almost idolized by the people. She inherited from her 
father a love of literature, and united in her person the 
severe virtues of the old Roman matron with the 
superior knowledge, refinement, and civilization which 
then began to prevail in the higher classes of Rome. 
Her letters were extant in the time of Cicero, and 
, were considered models of composition. 
2P. Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, bold defenders of popular 
rights ; famous for their eloquence and their virtues.

him as his son. He was a most accomplished scholar 
and distinguished orator.

distinguished in war; exceedingly beloved. In his 
youth he was somewhat dissipated, but after he became 
emperor he showed himself eminently moderate and 
just.

of Rome, entirely through his own great merits as a 
general and as a statesman. 
Tromp, Marten; famous Dutch admiral, who rose through 
his own merits to the supreme command at a momen- 
tous epoch. Though he was captured in youth, and 
his professional advancement thereby checked for some 
years, he had become a noted admiral and a dreaded 
opponent of the English et. 40. Killed in battle et. 56. 
8. Cornelius van Tromp, celebrated Dutch admiral, who 
obtained that rank, on active service, xt. 33. His 
professional eminence was beyond all question, though 
scarcely equal to that of his father. 
Turenne, Henri, Viscount de; the greatest of French gen- 
erals before the time of Napoleon. All his acts bear 
the impress of a truly great mind. He was clear and 
comprehensive in his views, energetic in action, and 
above the narrow feelings of a mere religious partisan. 
He was eminently pure in domestic life. He had weak 
health till et. 11. As a boy he was fond of books, 
and pored over the lives of eminent warriors. He 
learned slowly and with difficulty, rebelled against 
restraint, and showed: dogged perseverance. He was 
very fond of athletic exercises, and improved his health 
by practising them. His first opportunity of distinc- 
tion was xt. 23, on which occasion he was made 
“maréchal du camp,” then the next step in rank to 
Maréchal de France. He was killed by a cannon-shot 
wt. 64, 
F. Henri, Duc de Bouillon, one of the ablest soldiers bred 
in the school of Henry IV. His high rank, love of 
letters, attachment to the Calvinistic faith, and abilities 
as a statesman, raised him to the leadership of the 
Huguenot party after the death of that prince.

LITERARY MEN 
THosE who are familiar with the appearance of great 4 
libraries, and have endeavoured to calculate the number 
of famed authors, whose works they include, cannot fail to 
be astonished at their multitude. The years go by: in 
every year, every nation produces literary works of sterling 
value, and stores of books have accumulated for centuries. 
Among the authors, who are the most eminent? This is 
a question I feel incompetent to answer. It would not be 
difficult to obtain lists of the most notable literary cha- 
racters of particular periods, but I have found none that 
afford a compact and trustworthy selection of the great 
writers of all times. Mere popular fame in after ages is 
an exceedingly uncertain test of merit, because authors 
become obsolete. Their contributions to thought and 
language are copied and re-copied by others, and at length 
they become so incorporated into the current literature and 
expressions of the day, that nobody cares to trace them 
back to their original sources, any more than they interest 
themselves in tracing the gold converted into sovereigns, 
to the nuggets from which it was derived or to the gold- 
diggers who discovered the nuggets. 
Again: a man of fair ability who employs himself in 
literature turns out a great deal of good work. There is; 
always a chance that some of it may attain a reputation 
very far superior to its real merits, because the author may 
have something to narrate which the world wants to hear ; 
or he may have had particular experiences which qualify 
him to write works of fiction, or otherwise to throw out

views, singularly apposite to the wants of the time but of 
no importance in after years. Here, also, fame misleads. 
‘ Under these circumstances, I thought it best not to 
occupy myself over-much with older times; otherwise, I 
should have been obliged to quote largely in justification 
of my lists of literary worthies : but rather to select authors 
of modern date, or those whose reputation has been freshly 
preserved in England. I have therefore simply gone 
through dictionaries, extracted the names of literary men 
whom I found the most prominent, and have described 
those who had decidedly eminent relations in my appendix. 
I have, therefore, left out several, whom others might with 
reason judge worthy to have appeared. My list is a very 
incongruous collection ; for it includes novelists, historians, _ 
scholars, and philosophers. There are only two peculiarities 
common to all these men; the one is a desire of expressing 
themselves, and the other a love of ideas, rather than of 
material possessions. Mr. Disraeli, who is himself a good 
instance of hereditary literary power, in a speech at the 
anniversary of the Royal Literary Fund, May 6, 1868, 
described the nature of authors. His phrase epitomizes 
what has been graphically delineated in his own novels, 
and, I may add, in those of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, 
now Lord Lytton (who, with his brother Sir Henry Bulwer, 
and in his son “Owen Meredith,” is a still more remarkable 
example of hereditary literary gifts than Mr. Disraeli). 
He said: “The author is, as we must ever remember, a 
peculiar organization. He is a being with a predisposition 
which with him is irresistible—a bent which he cannot in 
any way avoid; whether it drags him to the abstruse re- 
searches of erudition, or induces him to mount into the fervid 
and turbulent atmosphere of imagination.” The majority of 
the men described in the appendix to this chapter justify 
the description by Mr. Disraeli. Again, that the powers 
of many of them were of the highest order, no one can 
doubt. Several were prodigies in boyhood, as Grotius, 
Lessing, and Niebuhr; many others were distinguished in 
youth ; Charlotte Bronté published “Jane Eyre” et. 22; 
Chateaubriand was of note at an equally early age; 
Fénelon made an impression when only 15; Sir Philip 
M  
-P-A-G-E-192
  162 LITERARY MEN 
Sidney was of high mark before he was 21, and had acquired 
his great fame, and won the heart of the nation in a few 
more years, for he was killed in battle when only 32. I 7 
may add, that there are occasional cases of great literary 
men having been the reverse of gifted in youth. Boileau is 
the only instance in my appendix. He was a dunce at 
school, and dull till he was 30. But, among other 
literary men of whom I have notes, Goldsmith was accounted 
a dull child, and he was anything but distinguished at 
Dublin University. He began to write well t.32. Rous- 
seau was thought a dunce at school whence he ran away 
zt. 16 
It is a striking confirmation of what I endeavoured to 
prove in an early chapter—that the highest order of 
“reputation is independent of external aids—to note how 
irregularly many of the men and women have been edu- 
cated whose names appear in my appendix—such as 
Boileau, the Bronté family, Chateaubriand, Fielding, the 
two Gramonts, Irving, Carsten Niebuhr, Porson (in one 
sense), Roscoe, Le Sage, J. C. Scaliger, Sévignéd, and Swift. 
I now give my usual table, but I do not specify with 
confidence the numbers of eminent literary people con- 
tained in the thirty-three families it includes. They 
have many. literary relations of considerable merit, but 
I feel myself unable, for the reasons stated at the begin- 
ning of this chapter, to sort out those that are “eminent” 
from among them. The families of Taylor, both those of 
Norwich and those of Ongar, have been inserted as being 
of great hereditary interest, but only a few of their 
members (see AUSTEN) are summed up in the following 
table.

It would be both a tedious and an unnecessary task, if I 
applied the same tests to this table with the same minute- 
ness that they were applied to those inserted in previous 
chapters. Its contents are élosely similar in their generg 
character, and therefore all that can be derived from 
analysis of the others may, with equal justice, be derived 
from this. The proportion of eminent grandsons is small, 
but the total number is insufficient. to enable us to draw 
conclusions from that fact, especially as the number |of 
eminent sons is not small in the same ratio. There are 
other minor peculiarities which will appear more distinctly 
when all the corresponding tables are collated and dis 
cussed towards the end of the book. In the meantime, 
we may rest satisfied that an analysis of kinsfolk shows 
literary genius to be fully as hereditary as any other ki 
of ability we have hitherto discussed.

  APPENDIX TO LITERARY MEN. 
TuE merits of literary men are so differently rated by their contemporaries 
and by posterity, that I gave up in despair the project of selecting a small 
list of first-class authors. I have, therefore, confined myself to the names 
of able writers that came most prominently in my way, and have 
occasionally inserted men who were not quite of the first class, but who 
were interesting in other respects. It is remarkable to find how little 
is known of the near kinsmen of many of the greatest literary men, 
especially of those who lived in ancient times ; and I have reason to think 
that our ignorance is in many due to mere historical neglect rather 
than to the fact of their abilities or achievements being unworthy of 
record. The general result of my inquiries is such as to convince me, that 
more than one-half of the great literary men have had kinsmen of high 
abilil 
‘The total number of names included in my list of kinships is thirty- 
seven. I will here add the names of those into whose lives I inquired, who 
do not appear to have had ‘eminent ” relations; they are nineteen 
in number, as follow :-—

La Fontaine ; Genlis, Mme. ; Gibbon (however, sce Lord Chancellor Hard- 
wicke for a distant kinship); Goldsmith ; Jeffrey ; Samuel Johnson

  the Edinburgh Review. The epitaph on his own tomb 
is so condensed and just, and those written by himself 
on his children who died before him are so accurate 
as well as touching, that I insert them here. His own 
epitaph in St. Paul’s Cathedral is as follows :— 
“Henry Haram, the historian of the Middle Ages, of 
the Constitution of his country, and of the Literature 
of Europe. This monument is raised by many friends, 
who, regarding the soundness of his learning, the simple 
eloquence of his style, his manly and capacious intellect, 
the fearless honesty of his judgments, and the moral 
dignity of his life, desire to perpetuate his memory 
within these sacred walls, as of one who has best 
illustrated the English language; the English character, 
and the English name.” 
He had a vigorous constitution ; his massive head was 
well carried by a robust frame; he was precocious 
as a child ; could read well at 4 years old, and wrote 
sonnets at 9 or 10; d. wt. 82. Married a sister of 
Sir Charles Elton, Bart. ; he was author of poems and 
translations.

8S. Arthur Henry, d. . et. 23; the subject of Tennyson’s “In 
Memoriam.” His epitaph at Clevedon is as follows :— 
“ And now, in this obscure and solitary church, repose 
the mortal remains of one too early lost for public 
fame, but already distinguished among his contem- 
poraries for the brightness of his genius, the depth of 
his understanding, the nobleness of his disposition, 
the fervour of his piety, and the purity of his life. 
Vale dulcissime, desideratissime. Requiescas in pace 
usque ad tubam.””

bending under this second bereavement, record here

that loveliness of temper and that heavenly-minded 
piety which are lost to them, but are gone to their 
own reward.” She had great abilities. 
8. Henry Fitzmaurice Hallam, d. wt. 26. “In whose clear 
and vivid understanding, sweetness of disposition, and 
purity of life, an image of his elder brother was before 
the eyes of those who had most loved him. Distin- 
guished, like him, by early reputation, and by the 
affection of many friends, he was, like him also, cut 
off by a short illness in a foreign land.” 
Helvetius, Claude Adrian (Schweitzer) (1715-1771). The 
celebrated and persecuted author of a materialistic 
philosophy. He was universally accomplished ; hand- 
some, graceful, robust, and full of genius. By et. 23 
he had obtained a farmer-generalship in France.

and whom Charles Lamb watched with the utmost 
solicitude. She ultimately recovered her reason, and

strong intellect and of a heart the counterpart of her 
brother’s in humanity. She was authoress of many 
pieces that are published in her brother’s works.

governed for many years a large part of the Madras

S. Francis ; literature and art (“ Golden Treasury ”’). 
Giffard ; orientalist and traveller in Arabia. 
Porson, Richard ; eminent Greek scholar and critic. From 
childhood, his mother used to say, whatever Richard 
did, was done in a superior manner. He spun better 
yarn than his brothers or sisters, and yet he had always 
a book lying open before him while he was spinning. 
Before he could write, he had taught himself, from an 
old book, as far as the cube root in arithmetic. As he 
grew up his memory became stupendous. He had un- 
wearied application, great acuteness, strong sound sense, 
a lively perception both of the beautiful and the 
ludicrous, and a most pure and inflexible sense of truth. 
He had great bodily strength ; was often known to walk 
from Cambridge to London, a distance of fifty-two miles, 
to attend his club in the evening, not being able to 
afford the coach fare. Got drunk occasionally, as was 
not an infrequent custom in his day, but he ended by 
doing so habitually. 
F. A weaver and parish clerk, a man of excellent sense and 
great natural powers of arithmetic. 
JF. A housemaid at the clergyman’s, who read his books on 
the sly. He found her one day at Shakespeare, and dis- 
covered, to his amazement, that she had a sound know- 
ledge of the book, and of very much else, so he helped 
her as he best could. She had a remarkable memory. 
B. Thomas. In the opinion of Dr. Davy, the then Master of 
Caius College, Cambridge, who was intimately ‘hequainted 
with both brothers, he was fully the equal of Richard in 
scholastic ability. He kept a classical school, but died

Le Sage ; novelist (“ Gil Blas”’) ; was an only son, and early 
an orphan. He became a handsome and engaging 
youth ; he married at 26, and worked hard. His first 
“ suecess was the ‘ Diable Boiteux” et. 39. He was 
67 when the last volume of “Gil Blas” appeared. 
He began to be deaf at 40, and at last his deaf- 
ness became complete. He had three sons, as 
follow :— 
S. René-André (Montménil) was an abbé, but broke away 
from the Church and joined the stage, to his father’s 
great grief. He wasanexcellent comedian. The father 
saw. him act, and forgave him. He died young and 
suddenly. 
§. A canon. He was a jolly fellow, with whom Le Sage 
spent his last days. He enjoyed life, and loved 
theatricals, and would have made an excellent come- 
dian. 
[S.] Became a bad actor, and died in obscurity. 
Scaliger, Julius Cesar ; scholar and natural philosopher (1484 
—1558, wt. 64) ; was of doubtful parentage. He served 
in the army till wt. 29, then studied theology, which he 
abandoned for medicine, and then began to learn Greek, 
He’ commenced his studies so late in life, that none of 
his works were published till wt. 47. He was one of 
the most extraordinary men of hisage. He had a most 
tenacious memory and sound understanding, but was

excessively irritable and vain, and made enemies. 
Scholars of subsequent ages have vied in panegyrising 
him, but his fame as a scholar and critic, though very 
great in his own days, was far eclipsed by that of his 
son Joseph. 
— §. Joseph Justus Scaliger. See below. 
| Scaliger, Joseph Justus ; scholar and critic (1540-1609, et. 
69). Was well educated, and he read intensely on his 
own account. He was one of that constellation of great 
scholars who ornamented the University of Leyden at 
the end of the sixteenth century. He was wholly ab- 
sorbed in study. He never married. Was irritable 
and vain, like his father. As a critic he is considered 
to have been pre-eminent, and there are very few 
scholars who can be compared with him. 
F. Julius Cesar Scaliger. See above. 
Schlegel, August Wilhelm von ; celebrated German scholar, 
critic, and poet, a translator of Shakespeare, and of 
Indian literature. At an early age he showed remark- 
able aptitude for languages. His fault, if any, was 
that of aiming too much at universality. He 
attached himself to Madame de Staél, and entirely 
abandoned himself to her intellectual influence.. Died 
et. 78. He and his brother have been called the 
“literary Dioscures” of their day. His grandfather 
was Councillor of the Court of Appeal of Meissen. He 
educated his children—the father and the uncles—care- 
fully. 
F. Jean Adolphe ; preacher of repute, also writer of poems. 
U. Jean Elie ; poet, dramatist, and critic. “ He is without 
exception the best dramatic author that Germany pro- 
duced during the first half of the eighteenth century.”

Schlegel, Friedrich Carl Wilhelm von ; historian, philosopher,

official under Metternich, who was his constant patron.

F. U. U. As above. 
B. August Wilhelm von Schlegel. See above. 
Seneca, Lucius Annzus ; Roman philosopher ; ; educated for 
rhetoric, but his taste rebelled against it, and he de- 
voted himself to philosophy. His noble sentiments 
and grand stoicism have greatly influenced even the 
Christian world, for Seneca was formerly much read 
and admired. He amassed an immense fortune, no one 
knows how, but it is suspected by equivocal means. He 
was the tutor of Nero, and naturally has not acquired 
much credit by his pupil, who put him to death et. 63. 
F. Marcus Anneus Seneca; rhetorician and author. He 
was a man of prodigious memory ; he could repeat two 
thousand words in the order he heard them. Married 
a Spanish lady. 
B. Marcus Novatus, who took the name Junius Gallio, and 
became proconsul of Achaia. It was before his tribunal 
that St. Paul was brought, on the accusation of intro- 
ducing innovations in religious matters. Eusebius de- 
scribes him as a distinguished rhetorician, and his 
brother calls him the most tolerant of men. 
N. Lucanus Marcus Annzeus (Lucan), the poet. His “ Phar- 
salia” is the only one of his works that has reached 
us. His father, the brother of Seneca, married the 
daughter of Lucanus, an eminent orator, from whom 
the son took his name. 
Sévigné, Marquise de (born Marie de Rabutin Chantal) ; 
authoress of charming letters. She was unsurpassed, 
perhaps unequalled, as a letter-writer. Her father was 
killed in battle when she was an infant, her mother 
died when she was ext. 6. She was an only child. 
Married, not happily, to a profligate man, who was 
killed in a duel on account of another lady. She 
wrote well before her widowhood, but not much; then 
she retired from the world to educate her children, and 
reappeared wt. 27, when she shone in society. Society 
improved, and did not spoil her. Her daughter married 
the Lieutenant-Governor of Provence, and it was to 
her that the famous letters were written. She had a 
joyous nature, beauty, grace, and wit; nothing con- 
cealed; all open as day. Even while living, her 
letters were celebrated in the Court and in society ;  
-P-A-G-E-207

they were handed about and read with infinite: 
pleasure. 
8. Marquis de Sévigné; a man of much ability and courage, 
who ended a restless and somewhat dissipated life in 
the practice of devotion, under the direction of eccle- 
siastics. He had not sufficient perseverance to succeed 
; in anything. 
US. Bussy-Rambutin ; a very excellent soldier, adventurous, 
rash, and somewhat dissipated. Would certainly 
have been made Marshal of France but for his 
ill-natured, caustic personalities, which led to his 
exile, and loss of all hope of advancement. He 
was an excellent letter-writer. He was really a man 
of great literary power, who improved the French 
language. ‘ 
There was a great deal more of sporadic talent in the 
family of Madame de Sévigné, but it never elsewhere 
achieved a full success. 
Sidney, Sir Philip; scholar, soldier, and courtier. “A 
gentleman finished and complete, in whom mildness was 
associated with courage, erudition modified by refine- 
ment, and courtliness dignified by truth.” Was grave 
as a boy. He left Cambridge et. 18 with a high 
reputation, and at once became a courtier, and a very 
successful one, owing to his accomplishments and figure. 
His “ Arcadia” is a work of rare genius, though cast 
in an unfortunate mould, It had an immense reputa- 
tion in its day. He was killed in battle wt. 32, and 
was mourned in England by a general mourning,—the 
first, it is believed, of the kind in this country. ‘(See 
also the genealogical tree under Monracu, in “ JupGEs,” 
pp. 88, 89.) F. Sir Henry Sidney, a man of great parts, much considered 
by both Mary and Elizabeth; was three times Lord 
Deputy of Ireland, and governed wisely.

most remarkable family, whose high qualities appear 
to have been mainly derived through an infusion of 
the Sydney blood, inasmuch as of the vast number of 
the other descendants of the first Ch. Just. Montagu

studies by her mother. After a serious illness she

Isaac CasauBoNn, whose name appears in the above list, 
was a learned Swiss divine and critic; professor of 
Greek at Geneva zt. 23, and subsequently at Paris. 
He passed the last years of his life in England, where 
he was greatly esteemed, and was made Prebend of 
Westminster and was highly pensioned by James I. 
p- Merrie Casauroy, his son, was equally eminent, but seems 
to have shrunk from public service. He was in vain 
solicited by Cromwell to write the history of the war, 
and by Christina, Queen of Sweden, to superintend the 
universities in her kingdom. 
Swift, Jonathan, D.D.; Dean of St. Patrick’s; satirist, 
politician. Was tall, muscular, and well-made ; had 
attacks of giddiness all his life. Educated by help of 
his uncles, at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was 
idle. Then he became secretary to Sir Wm. Temple, 
who had married a relation of his mother, and began 
to work seriously zt. 21. Lost his mind at 69, d. et.

bers have attained distinction in the law, in the arts, 
and in the army. The Nonconformist element runs

a very decided one, and to be accompanied with con- 
stitutional vigour ; thus Mrs. Gilbert died a short time 
since at the advanced age of 84. None of its members

MEN OF SCIENCE 
My choice of Men of Science, like that of the men of 
literature, may seem capricious. They were both governed 
to some extent by similar considerations, and therefore the 
preface to my last chapter is in a great degree applicable 
to this. There is yet another special difficulty in the 
selection of a satisfactory first-class of scientific men. 
The fact of a person’s name being associated with some 
one striking scientific discovery helps enormously, but 
often unduly, to prolong his reputation to after ages. Itis 
notorious that the same discovery is frequently made 
simultaneously and quite independently, by different 
persons. Thus, to speak of only a few cases in late years, 
the discoveries of photography, of electric telegraphy, and 
of the planet Neptune through theoretical calculations, 
have all their rival claimants. It would seem, that 
discoveries are usually made when the time is ripe for 
them—that is to say, when the ideas from which they 
naturally flow are fermenting in the minds of many men. 
When apples are ripe, a trifling event suffices to decide, 
which of them shall first drop off its stalk; so a small 
accident will often determine the scientific man who shall 
first make and publish a new discovery. There are many 
persons who have contributed vast numbers of original 
memoirs, all of them of some, many of great, but none of 
extraordinary importance. These men have the capacity 
of making a striking discovery, though they had not the 
luck to do so. Their work is valuable, and remains, but 
the worker is forgotten. Nay, some eminently scientific
-P-A-G-E-216
  186 MEN OF SCIENCE 
men have shown their original powers by little more than 
. a continuous flow of helpful suggestions and criticisms 
which were individually of too little importance to be 
remembered in the history of Science, but which, in their 
aggregate, formed a notable aid towards its progress. In 
the scanty history of the once well-known “ Lunar Society” 
of the Midland Counties—of which Watt, Boulton, and 
Darwin were the chief notabilities—there is frequent 
allusion toa man of whom nothing more than the name 
now remains, but who had apparently very great influence 
on the thoughts of his contemporaries—I mean Dr. Small. 
Or, to take a more recent case, I suppose that Dr. Whewell 
would be generally ranked in the class G of natural ability. 
His intellectual energy was prodigious, his writing un- 
ceasing, and his conversational powers extraordinary. 
Also, few will doubt that, although the range of his 
labours was exceedingly wide and scattered, Science in one 
form or another was his chief pursuit, His influence on 
the progress of Science during the earlier years, of his life 
was, I believe, considerable, but it is impossible to specify 
the particulars of that influence, or so to justify our 
opinion that posterity will be likely to pay regard to it. 
Biographers will seek in vain for important discoveries in 
Science, with which Dr. Whewell’s name may hereafter be 
identified. 
Owing to these considerations, the area of my choice is 
greatly narrowed. I can only include those scientific men 
who have achieved an enduring reputation, or who are 
otherwise well known to the present generation. I have 
proceeded in my selection just as I did in the case of the 
literary men—namely, I have taken the most prominent 
names from ordinary biographical dictionaries. 
I now annex my usual tables.

Table I. confirms all that has been already deduced from 
the corresponding tables in other groups, but the figures 
in Table IT. are exceptional. We find a remarkable dimi- 
nution in the numbers of F. and G., while §. and P. hold 
their own. We also find that, although the female in- 
fluence, on the whole, is but little different from previous 
groups, inasmuch as in the first degree— 
1G. + 5U. + 8N. + 6P = 20 kinsmen through males, 
5g +2u +2n,+0p = 9 5; females ; 
and in the second degree— 
OGF. + 0GB. + 3US. + 6NS. + 3PS. = 12 kinsmen through males, 
OgF. + OgB. + 4uS. + OnS. + OpS. 4 3 females , 
Totals, 32 through males ; 13 through females ; 
  yet, when we examine the lists of kinsmen more closely, 
we shall arrive at different conclusions, and we shall find 
the maternal influence to be unusually strong. There are 
5 g. to 1 G.; and in fully eight cases out of the forty-three, 
the mother was the abler of the two parents. These are 
1 See, for explanation, the foot-note to the similar table on p. 55. 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  
MEN OF SCIENCE 189 
the mothers of Bacon (remember also his four maternal 
aunts), of Buffon, Condorcet, Cuvier, D’Alembert, Forbes, 
Gregory, and Watt. Both Brodie and Jussieu had remark- 
able grandmothers, The eminent relations of Newton were 
connected with him by female links. 
It therefore appears to be very important to success in “ 
science, that a man should have an able mother. I believe 
the reason to be, that a child so circumstanced has the good 
fortune to be delivered from the ordinary narrowing, partisan 
influences of home education. Our race is essentially 
slavish ; it is the nature of all of us to believe blindly in 
what we love, rather than in that which we think most 
wise. We are inclined to look upon an honest, unshrink- 
ing pursuit of truth as something irreverent. We are 
indignant when others pry into our idols, and criticise 
them with impunity, just as a savage flies to arms when a 
missionary picks his fetish to pieces. Women are far 
more strongly influenced by these feelings than men: they 
are blinder partisans and more servile followers of custom. 
Happy are they whose mothers did not intensify their 
naturally slavish dispositions in childhood, by the frequent 
use of phrases such as, “ Do not ask questions about this 
or that, for it is wrong to doubt ;’ but who showed them, 
by practice and teaching, that inquiry may be absolutely 
free without being irreverent, that reverence for truth is 
the parent of free inquiry, and that indifference or 
insincerity in the search after truth is one of the most 
degrading of sins. It is clear that a child brought up 
under the influences I have described is far more likely to 
succeed as a scientific man than one who was reared under 
the curb of dogmatic authority. Of two men with equal 
abilities, the one who had a truth-loving mother would be 
the more likely to follow the career of science ; while the 
other, if bred up under extremely narrowing circumstances, 
would become as the gifted children in China, nothing 
better than a student and professor of some dead 
literature. 
It is, I believe, owing to the favourable conditions of / 
their early training, that an unusually large proportion of 
the sons of the most gifted men of science become dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  190 MEN OF SCIENCE   
tinguished in the same career. They have been nurtured 
in an atmosphere of free inquiry, and observing as they 
grow older that myriads of problems lie on every side of 
them, simply waiting for some moderately capable person 
to take the trouble of engaging in their solution, they 
throw themselves with ardour into a field of labour so pecu- 
liarly tempting. It is and has been, in truth, strangely 
neglected. There are hundreds of students of books for 
one student of nature ; hundreds of commentators for one 
original enquirer. The field of real science is in sore want 
of labourers. The mass of mankind plods on, with eyes 
fixed on the footsteps of the generations that went before, 
too indifferent or too fearful to raise their glances to judge 
for themselves whether the path on which they are travel- 
ling is the best, or to learn the conditions by which they 
are surrounded and affected. Hence, as regard the emi- 
nent sons of the scientific men—twenty-six in number— 
there are only four whose eminence was not achieved in 
science. These are the two political sons of Arago (himself 
a politician), the son of Haller, and the son of Napier. 
As I said before, the fathers of the ablest men in science 
have frequently been unscientific. Those of Cassini and 
Gmelin were scientific men; so, in a lesser degree, were 
those of Huyghens, Napier, and De Saussure; but the 
remainder—namely, those of Bacon, Boyle, De Candolle, 
Galilei, and Leibnitz—were either statesmen or literary 
men, 
As regards mathematicians, when we consider how many 
among them have been possessed of enormous natural gifts, 
it might have been expected that the lists of their eminent 
kinsmen would have been yet richer than they are. There 
are several mathematicians in my appendix, especially the 
Bernoulli family ; but the names of Pascal, Laplace, Gauss, 
and others of class G or even X, are absent. We might 
similarly have expected that the senior wranglers of Cam- 
bridge would afford many noteworthy instances of hereditary 
ability shown in various careers, but, speaking generally, 
this does not seem to be the case. I know of several 
instances where the senior wrangler, being eminently a 
man of mathematical genius, as Sir William Thomson and
-P-A-G-E-221
MEN OF SCIENCE 191 
  
“Mr. Archibald Smith, is related to other mathematicians 
or men of science, but I know of few senior wranglers 
whose kinsmen have been eminent in other ways. Among 
these exceptions are Sir John Lefevre, whose brother is 
the ex-Speaker, Viscount Eversley, and whose son is the 
present Vice-President of the Board of Trade; and Sir 
F. Pollock, the ex-Chief Baron, whose kinships are 
described in “Jupcxs.” I account for the rarity of such 
relationships in the following manner. A man given to 
abstract ideas is not likely to succeed in the world, unless 
he be particularly eminent in his peculiar line of intellectual 
effort. Ifthe more moderately gifted relative of a great 
mathematician can discover laws, well and good; but if 
he spends his days in puzzling over problems too insig- 
nificant to be of practical or theoretical import, or else 
too hard for him to solve, or if he simply reads what other 
people have written, he makes no way at all, and leaves 
no name behind him. There are far fewer of the numerous 
intermediate stages between eminence and mediocrity 
adapted for the occupation of men who are devoted to 
pure abstractions, than for those whose interests are of 
a social kind.

APPENDIX TO MEN OF SCIENCE 
Herr, as in the previous chapter, I have confined myself to the names 
that are most prominent in biographical collections, or that otherwise 
came most readily in my way. I add the names of those into whose lives 
I also inquired, who seem to have had no kinsmen of marked ability. 
They are eighteen in number, and as follow :—. 
Bacon, Roger; Berzelius; Blumenbach; Brahe, Tycho; Bramah ; 
Brewster ;_ Brown, Robert ; Copernicus; Galen; Galvani; Guericke ; 
Hooke; Kepler; Priestley; Réaumur; Count Rumford; Whewell; 
Dr. Young. 
Ampére, André Marie (1775-1836, et. 61); eminent man 
of science—mathematician, electrician, and philologist. 
He was entirely self-taught, for his parents were in 
humble circumstances. Even in early boyhood, he 
read voraciously and showed a most tenacious memory. 
He was endowed with a vast vigour of brain, accom- 
panied by a very shy and sensitive organization. Thus, 
though his genius was universal, he became in after 
life a great oddity, and his pupils made fun of him. 
He wanted perseverance in any one direction ; he was 
always flying off to new subjects. Arago thought that 
the discipline of a public school would have had a most 
salutary influence on his character. 
§. Jean Jacques Antoine, historian and literary man of con- 
siderable eminence and originality. Educated by his 
father, who left him free to follow the bent of his 
genius. He travelled much, and always with literary 
and scientific results. Was Professor of Modern French 
History in the College of France. 
Arago, Dominique Frangois; mathematician and astronomer. 
Writer on many scientific subjects; also a politician 
and strong republican. Asa boy, he made great and
-P-A-G-E-223

almost unassisted progress in mathematics. Became 
Academician wt. 23. He had a good deal of brusque- 
ness of manner and of self-assertion, His three 
brothers were distinguished in their different pro- 
fessions, as follows :— 
B. Jean, driven from France by an unjust accusation ; became 
a noted General in the Mexican Service, and rendered 
great service in their War of Independence. 
B, Jacques; traveller, artist, and author. He led a restless, 
wandering life, and was a man of great energy and 
literary power and productiveness. 
B. Etienne; dramatic author of considerable repute, and a 
most prolific writer; was a hot republican. He held 
office under the provisional government of 1848; was 
exiled under Napoleon III. 
8. Emmanuel ; barrister, elected, at the early age of thirty- 
four, ‘membre du conseil de l’ordre,”’ politician and 
hot republican. He took a prominent part in the 
Revolution of 1848, but was silenced after the coup 
@ état. 
8. Alfred, a painter, Inspecteur-Général des Beaux Arts. 
Aristotle. Founder of the Peripatetic School, one of the 
ablest of men in science and philosophy, teacher of 
Alexander. He joined Plato’s academy, who called 
him, xt. 17, “the intellect of his school.” He had 
weak health, but marvellous industry. Was restless ; 
taught as he walked—hence the name of the Peri- 
patetic School. Was very particular about his dress. 
‘Was wealthy ; lost his parents early in life. 
F. Nicomachus, friend and physician to Amyntas II., King 
of Macedonia ; author of works, now lost, on medicine 
and science. 
P. Nicomachus. According to Cicero, he was considered by 
some to have been the author of the “ Nicomachean 
Ethics,” generally attributed to Aristotle. 
Up. (t about the form of the U). Callisthenes, the philoso- 
pher who accompanied Alexander the Great to the 
East, an imprudent man, wanting in tact, but other- 
wise able. His mother, Hero, was Aristotle’s cousin. 
Bacon, Francis; created Lord Bacon, Lord Chancellor. 
“The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind” is an 
over-hard sentence on this most illustrious philosopher 
and statesman. His natural gifts were formed by the 
oO

simple addition of those of his mother to those of his 
father. It is doubtful whether or no he was very 
precocious, but Queen Elizabeth en took delight 
in his boyish wit, gravity, and judgment. 
F. Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. He 
was the first Lord Keeper who ranked as a Lord 
Chancellor. He was a grave stately man, fond of 
science, gardening, and house-building. In all this, 
his son Was just like him, Married twice. 
* Anne Cooke, a member of a most gifted family, and her- 8 y 
self a scholar of no mean order. Eminent for piety, 
virtue, and learning. Exquisitely skilled in Latin and 
Greek. 
[4u.] The four sisters of his mother are all spoken of 
in terms of the highest praise. 
g. Sir Anthony Cooke is described by Camden as “ vir 
uS. 
B, 
  2 antiquad serenitate.” Lloyd (State Worthies) says, 
“Contemplation was his soul, privacy his life, and dis- 
course his element.” Lord Seymour standing by when 
he chid his son, remarked, “Some men govern families 
with more skill than others do kingdoms,” and there- 
upon recommended him to the government of his young 
nephew Edward VI. “Such the majesty of his looks 
and gait, that awe governed,—such the reason and 
sweetness, that love obliged all his family: a family 
equally afraid to displease so good a head, and to offend 
so great.” He taught his daughters all the learning of 
the day. I greatly regret I have been unable to obtain’ 
any information about Sir Anthony’s ancestry or 
collateral relations. 
Cecil, Ist E. of Salisbury, eminent minister under 
Elizabeth and James I. His father was the great Lord 
Burleigh. 
Anthony ; had weak health, but a considerable share of 
the intellectual power which distinguished this remark- 
able family. 
B. (but by a different mother). Sir Nathaniel, Bart., a man 
of rare parts and generous disposition. He was a very 
good painter. Walpole considered him to have “ really 
attained the perfection of a master.” Peacham in his 
“Graphice” says, “None in my opinion deserveth 
more respect and admiration for his skill and practice 
in painting, than Master Nathaniel Bacon of Brome, in

Suffolk, not inferior in my judgment, to our skilfullest 
masters.” 
B. (by the same parents as the above). Sir Nathaniel of 
Stivekey. His father remarks of him, et. 22 (when 
Lord Bacon was wt. 7), “Indeed of all my children he 
is of best hope in learning.” 
N. (son of another brother). Nathaniel, antiquarian writer, 
Recorder of Bury, and Admiralty Judge. He was M.P. 
for Cambridge, and a sturdy republican. 
Bernoulli, Jacques. The first who rose to fame in a Swiss 
family that afterwards comprised an extraordinary 
number of eminent mathematicians and men of science. 
They were mostly quarrelsome and unamiable. Many 
were long-lived ; three of them exceeded eighty years of 
age. Jacques was destined for the Church, but early 
devoted himself to mathematics, in which he had 
accidentally become initiated. He had a_ bilious, 
melancholic temperament. Was sure but slow. He 
taught his brother Jean, but adopted, too long, a tone 
of superiority towards him ; hence quarrels and rivalry. 
Jacques was a mathematician of the highest order in 
originality and power. Member of French Academy.

but he had a passion for natural history, and by et. 20 
had made a considerable collection of mineralogy, which 
he afterwards improved until it’became one of the most 
complete in Switzerland. 
Boyle, Hon. Robert. “The Christian philosopher.” 
Eminent in natural science, especially in chemistry ; a 
scholar and a theologian. He also takes rank as a 
religious statesman, from his efforts in causing Christi- 
anity to be propagated among the natives of India and 
Nerth America. He was seventh son and fourteenth 
child. Was shy and diffident, and steadfastly refused 
the numerous offers of preferment that were pressed 
upon him. He was a member of a very remarkable 
family, of whom I give a genealogical tree (see newt page). 
F. Richard, 1st Earl of Cork, commonly called the Great 
Earl, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland ; distinguished in 
the Great Rebellion by his energy and military skill. 
He made a large fortune by improving his Irish

4 B. All did well, all prosperously married. One inherited 
the title, and the others were created’ peers. The most 
eminent of these is Roger, lst Karl of Orrery, Military 
Commander under Cromwell in Ireland, afterwards en- 
gaged in the restoration of Charles II., who ennobled 
him. Was offered, but refused, the Chancellorship. 
[t.] Also seven sisters married peers, and from the general 
accounts of the family I conclude, in the absence of 
knowledge of details, that some at least of them must 
have had considerable merits.

and was an excellent Greek and Latin scholar. . . . He 
was endowed with a.large share of energy and activity

(owing to politics). He attended to local business, and 
acquired a considerable local influence.

8. Frank Buckland ; naturalist ; well-known popular writer 
on natural history, especially on pisciculture. 
Buffon, G. L., Comte de; naturalist. ‘“Majestate nature 
par ingenium.” Nature gave him eyery advantage in 
figure, bearing, features, strength, and general energy. 
Voltaire said he had “ le corps d’un athléte et l’Ame d’un 
sage.” He was educated for the law, but had an 
irresistible bias to science—at first to physics and 
mathematics, and finally to zoology. 
J. From her he said that he derived his qualities. He always 
spoke with great affection of his mother. 
S. His abilities were considerable, and his attachment to his 
father was extreme. He was guillotined as an aristocrat. 
Cassini, Jean Dominique (1625-1712, wt. 87); celebrated 
Italian astronomer, whose name is chiefly connected 
with the discovery of the satellites of Saturn, with the 
rotations of the planets on their axes, and with the 
zodiacal light. He had an immense reputation in his 
day. Colbert induced him, by the offer of a pension, to 
settle in France, and to be naturalized as a Frenchman. 
He founded the Observatory of Paris. He was of a 
strong constitution, calm temper, and religious mind ; 
was the first of a family of a remarkable series of long- 
lived astronomers.

Condorcet, Jean Caritat, Marquis de; secretary of the 
French Academy ; also a writer on morals and politics. 
He was precocious in mathematical study, and had an 
insatiable and universal curiosity ; was very receptive 
of ideas, but not equally original; had no outward 
show of being vain, simply because he had a superb 
confidence in his own opinions. He was deficient in 
brilliancy. | His principal faculty was in combining 
and organizing. Different people estimate his cha- 
racter very differently. St. Beuve shows him to have 
been malign and bitter, with a provoking exterior of 
benignity. He poisoned himself wt. 51, to avoid the 
guillotine. 
[7] His mother was very devout. She devoted him to the 
Virgin, when a child, to dress in white for eight years, 
like a young girl,

of Vienne and with the Cardinal de Bernis, but I do 
not know in what degree. 
Cuvier, George, Baron de; one of the most illustrious of 
naturalists. He became well known et. 26; d. wt. 63. 
He had delicate health as a boy. 
[7] His mother was an accomplished woman, who took 
especial care in his early education. 
B. Frederick, who early devoted himself to natural history, 
and was little inferior in research to George, though 
he never accomplished anything comparable in scientitic 
value to his brother's works, except his “Teeth of 
Animals,” 
D’Alembert, Jean le Rond ; mathematician and philosopher 
of the highest order. He was illegitimate ; his mother 
abandoned him, and left him exposed in a public 
market, near the church of Jean le Rond, whence his 
Christian name; the origin of his surname is un- 
known. He showed, as a child, extraordinary eager- 
ness to learn, but was discouraged at every step. ‘The 
glazier’s wife, in whose charge he had been placed by 
the authorities as a foundling, ridiculed his pursuits ; 
at school he was dissuaded from his favourite mathe- 
matics; whenever he persuaded himself that he had 
done something original, he invariably found that 
others had found out the same thing before him. But 
his passion for science urged him on. He became 
member of the Academy et. 24, and thenceforward 
his career was one of honour. He was totally free 
from envy, and very charitable. Never married, but 
had curious Platonic relations with Mdlle. de Espi- 
nasse. 
His father was said to be M. Destouches, a commissary 
of artillery. 
J. Mdlle. de Tencin, novelist of high ability ; originally a 
nun, but she renounced her vows. She and both her 
sisters were adventuresses of note. She allied herself 
closely to her brother, the Cardinal de Tencin ; loved 
him passionately, and devoted herself to his advance- 
ment. She managed his house, which became a noted 
centre for eminent men. She was anything but vir- 
tuous. ‘Fontanelle, the Secretary of the French 
Academy (see in “Ports” wnder CoRNEILLE), was one 
of her admirers, previous to the birth of D’Alembert.

Bt. 34 she threw herself into political i intrigue. After 
D’Alembert had attained fame, it is diated that she 
for the first time introduced herself to him as his 
mother ; to whom he replied, “ You are only my step- 
mother ; the glazier’s wife is my mother.” 
The maternal relatives of D’Alembert formed a curious 
group. They were— 
[w.] Madame Feriol, mother of Pont de Veyle and of D’Ar- 
gental ; and 
[w.] Countess of Grolée ; and the following brothers— 
u. -Cardinal de Tencin, minister of state and nearly premier. 
uS. Pont de Veyle, song-writer and dramatist ; full of spirit, 
but a selfish man. He was brought up by a pedant, 
who roused in him a hatred of study. 
uS. Argental, Charles Aug. Feriol, Comte de; the confidant 
and great admirer of Voltaire, who made him the 
depositary of his writings. He was a polished literary 
critic, 
Darwin, Dr. Erasmus, physician, physiologist, and poet. 
His “Botanic Garden” had an immense reputation 
at the time it was written ; for, besides its intrinsic 
merits, it chimed in with the sentiments and mode 
of expression of his day. The ingenuity of Dr. 
Darwin’s numerous writings and theories is truly 
remarkable. He wasa man of great vigour, humour, 
and geniality. 
[F.] It is said that Dr. Darwin “sprang from a lettered and 
intellectual race, as his father was one amongst the 
earliest members of the Spalding Club.” 
S. Charles, student in medicine, died young and full of 
promise, from the effect of a wound when dissecting. 
He obtained the gold medal of Edinburgh University 
for a medical essay. 
8. Dr. Robert Darwin, of Shrewsbury, was a physician of 
very large practice, and of great consideration in other 
respects. 
P. Charles Darwin, the illustrious modern naturalist ; author 
of the “Theory of Natural Selection.” 
[2PS8.] One of the sons of the above was second wrangler at 
Cambridge, 1868, and another was second in the Wool- 
wich examination of the same year. 
The number of individuals in the Darwin family who 
have followed some branch of natural history, is very

remarkable—the more so because it so happens that 
the tastes appear (I speak from private sources of 
knowledge) to have been more personal than traditional. 
There is a strong element of individuality in the 
different members of the race which is adverse to 
traditional influence. Thus— 
[S.] Sir Francis Darwin, a physician ; was singularly fond of 
  animals. His place in Derbyshire was full of animal 
oddities—half-wild pigs ran about the woods, and the 
like.   
[P.] One of his sons is a well-known writer—though under 
  
a nom de plume 
sporting matters. 
I could add the names of others of the family who, in a 
lesser but yet decided degree, have shown a taste for 
subjects of natural history. on natural history subjects, and on 
Davy, Sir Humphry ; chemist and philosopher. He was not 
precocious as a child, but distinguished himself as a 
youth. He published his first essays wt. 21, Was 
Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution wt. 23. 
B. Dr. John Davy, author of many memoirs on physiology. 
Inspector-General of Army Hospitals. 
De Candolle, -Augustin Pyrame ; eminent Swiss botanist. 
His infancy resembled that of Cuvier ; both had mothers 
who were intelligent and affectionate ; both were of 
delicate health, and also of a most happy disposition. 
He had hydrocephalus, and nearly died of it xt. 7. 
Being unable to share the pursuits of other boys, he 
became studious, very fond of verse-making and of 
literature, but was not interested in science. He col- 
lected plants merely as subjects to draw from, but be- 
fore long he became deeply interested in them. When 
eet, 15, his weakness of health ceased. His is almost 
a solitary instance of complete recovery from hydro- 
cephalus. He then became very vigorous. He wrote a 
memoir wt. 20, that gained him some reputation. His 
essay, wt. 26, on being admitted Doctor of Medicine, 
was a very masterly one. Died et. 63.

burgh, but died young, wt. 39, of kidney disease. He 
was a true genius and a man of rare social and conver- 
sational powers. In early childhood he showed that he 
had remarkable moral and intellectual gifts. While 
still a young student in Edinburgh, he travelled and 
wrote on the natural history of Norway. He was con- 
stanthy on the move, sea-dredging and the like. Mar- 
ried, but had no children. The following is taken from 
Geikie’s Life of him: “ His immediate paternal ances- 
tors were most of them characterised by great activity 
and energy. The men were fond of travel; fond of 
society and social pleasures, free-handed, and better at 
spending than saving money.” 
Gentle and pious, passionately fond of flowers—a taste 
that she transmitted to her son, the future Professor of 
Botany. 
[3 u.] One died in Demerara, one in Surinam, and one was 
lost in Africa.

The other brother, an excellent mineralogist, was form- 
erly engaged in the mines of South America. 
A love of roving certainly runs in the blood of the Forbes

Gregory, James ; mathematician ; inventor of the reflecting

He was the most important member of a very import 
ant scientific family, partly eminent as mathematicians, 
and largely so as physicians. The annexed pedigree 
(p. 207) is necessary to explain their relationships, but 
I should add that I know it does not do full justice to 
the family. The talent came from the Andersons, of 
whom I wish I knew more. We may accept, at least, 
the following letters for the subject of this notice: /,,

genius are as astonishing as any upon record. He was 
rickety, feeble, and delicate as a child. Was exceed- 
ingly laborious, having written above 200 treatises, in- 
cluding some good poetry. He suffered from gout, and 
took opium immoderately.

small black eyes full of spirit. He became gouty, and 
acquired fanciful habits. He lay in bed thinking over- 
much at night time, and slept ill. He and all his brothers 
were very choleric. Married, no children. His rela- 
tionships show sterling ability. 
[5 B.] Five of his brothers were merchants of weight and

them made large fortunes. ‘The Merchants’: Map of

(Mem. This is the statement in the biography prefaced 
to his works, published by the Sydenham Society.) 
Up. (I believe.) Heneage Finch, created 1st Earl of Notting- 
ham, Lord Chancellor. His father was also eminent 
(see Frxcu, in “Jupers”). William Harvey calls Hene- 
age Finch “ his loving cousin ”’ in his will, and leaves him 
a legacy for his assistance in making it. I do not 
know the exact relationship. Earl Nottingham’s 
mother was daughter of a William Harvey, and she 
was not a sister of the physician, There were forty- 
three years’ difference of age between the physician and 
the Earl. It is probable that the Earl was first cousin 
once removed to Harvey, viz. the son of his father’s 
brother’s daughter. 
Herschel, Sir William; eminent astronomer ; President of 
the Royal Society. Educated asa musician ; came to 
England with the band of the Hanoverian Guards, then 
was organist at Bath. By wt. 41 he had acquired some 
knowledge of mathematics. Made his own telescopes, 
and became a renowned astronomer et. 43. Died xt. 83. 
[F.] Isaac; son of a land-agent, but was so fond of music 
that he joined the military band of the Hanoverian 
Foot Guards : it was a band of select performers. He 
became a musician of some note, chiefly as a performer 
on the violin and oboe. 
[B.] Alexander ; good performer on the violoncello ; had also 
b.

Miss Caroline Herschel co-operated in the most helpful 
manner, with her brother, in all his astronomical work. 
She received the gold medal of the Royal Society. 
Died ext. 98. 
Sir John Herschel, also famous as an astronomer, and one 
of the foremost philosophers of the day. 
[3 P.] Two of his grandsons have already made a name in the 
scientific world—Professor Alexander Herschel as a 
writer on meteorites, and Lieut. John Herschel, the 
first of his year at Addiscombe, who took charge of 
the expedition organized in 1868 by the Royal Society, 
to observe the total eclipse in India. The other son, 
William, a Bengal civilian, was first of his year at 
Haileybury. 
Musical gifts are strongly hereditary in the Herschel 
family.

  Newton’s ancestry appear to have been in no way remark- 
able for intellectual ability, and there is nothing of 
note that I can find out among his descendants, except 
what may be inferred from the fact that the two 
Huttons were connected with him in some unknown 
way, through the maternal line. The following para- 
graph is printed in the Catalogue of Portraits belong- 
ing to the Royal Society ; it will be found under the 
description of a portrait of Sir Isaac Newton, which 
was presented by Mr. Charles Vignolles, the eminent: 
engineer :—“The mother of James Hutton and the 
mother of Dr. Charles Hutton’ were sisters ; and his 
grandmother and the mother of Sir Isaac Newton 
were also sisters.” Mr. Vignolles, who is grandson 
of Dr. Charles Hutton, has kindly give me the history 
_ of the paragraph. It appears it was written on one 
of the few scraps of paper that he inherited from Dr. 
C. Hutton; it was in the handwriting of his aunt 
Miss Isabella Hutton, and appears to have been dic- 
tated by her father, Dr. C. Hutton. There is abso- 
lutely no other information obtainable. Now the word . 
“his” in the paragraph is not grammatical ; its inter- 
pretation is therefore ambiguous. It might be supposed 
to be intended to apply to Dr. C. Hutton, but a com- 
parison of dates makes me doubt this. Sir Isaac was 
born in 1642, and Dr. C. Hutton in 1737, leaving a 
difference of 95 years to be bridged over by only one 
intervening generation. This is not absolutely im- 
possible, but it is exceedingly incredible, It could 
have come to pass on some such extravagant hypothesis 
as the following, viz. that Newton’s mother may have 
been only 20 when her son was born ; also—which is 
just possible—that her sister may have been 35 years 
her junior. Also, that this sister may have been as 
much as 40 years old when her daughter was born, and 
that that daughter may also have been 40 years old 
when she gave birth to Dr. C. Hutton. As 40 + 40 
+ 35 — 20 = 95, this hypothesis would satisfy the 
dates. However, I strongly suspect that Miss Hutton, 
writing from her father’s not very clear dictation in 
his old age (he d. wt. 83), had omitted a phrase which 
I will supplemeht in brackets, and had thereby ‘unin- 
tentionally struck out one or even two intervening

generations. Thus, “The mother of Dr. James Hutton 
and the mother of Dr. Charles Hutton were sisters ; [they 
were children (or ? grandchildren) of Mr. — Hutton Y and 
his grandmother and the mother of Sir Isaac Newton 
were also sisters.” This reading would satisfy the 
possessive pronoun “his,” it would satisfy the dates, 
and it would also account for the exact nature of the 
relationship not having been a matter of distinct family 
tradition. If, on the other presumption, the mothers of 
the Huttons had been first cousins to Sir Isaac, the 
Huttons would assuredly have often alluded to the 
fact ; it is a simple form of kinship, easy to remember, 
and would have become well known to their contempo- 
raries, especially to those who were Fellows of the 
Royal Society, of which Dr. Charles Hutton. was the 
secretary ; and it would never have been overlooked 
by the biographers, either of Sir Isaac or of the Hut- 
tons. In the biographies of the Huttons, Newton is 
simply spoken of as having been their ancestor by the 
maternal line. 
Charles Hutton, LL.D., was the well-known mathe- 
matician, Secretary to the Royal Society, and Professor 
at Woolwich. 
James Hutton was ‘the geologist and chemist, and

was very great in his day, and whose writings some of

fortune was slow and mainly due to his fortunate 
association with Boulton, who supplied energy, concen- 
tration of purpose, daring, administrative skill and 
capital, Watt ailed continually, and he was very 
irresolute until he approached old age, when his vigour

have been common to every male of that family, so as 
to have become almost the birthright of both the grand- 
sons of Thomas Watt, ‘the old mathematician.’ And 
it may be added that the same inclination still con- 
tinued to ‘run in their veins’ till the line of direct 
male descent itself became extinct by the death, with- 
out issue, of both the sons of the illustrious improver of 
the steam-engine.” (Page 17.)

THE Poets and Artists generally are men of high aspi- 
rations, but, for all that, they are a sensuous, erotic race, 
exceedingly irregular in their way of life. Even the stern 
and virtue-preaching Dante is spoken of by Boccaccio in 
most severe terms.) Their talents are usually displayed 
early in youth, when they are first shaken by the tem- 
pestuous passion of love. Of all who have a place in the 
appendix to this chapter, Cowper is the only one who 
began to write in mature life; and none of the others 
who are named in the heading to my appendix, except 
possibly Camoens and Spenser, delayed authorship till 
after thirty. It may be interesting, and it is instructive, 
to state a few facts in evidence of their early powers. 
Béranger, a printer's compositor, taught himself and 
began to publish at 16. Burns was a village celebrity at 
16, and soon after began to write : Calderon at 14. Camp- 
bell’s “ Pleasures of Hope ” was published when he was 20. 
Goldoni produced a comedy in manuscript that amazed all 
who saw it, at 8. Ben Jonson, a bricklayer’s lad, fairly 
worked his way upwards through Westminster and Cam- 
bridge, and became famous by his “Every Man in his 
Humour,” at 24, Keats, a surgeon’s apprentice, first pub- 
lished at 21 and died at 25. Metastasio improvised in 
public when a child, and wrote at 15. Tom Moore pub- 
lished under the name of Thomas Little, and was famous

The results of Table II. are surprising. It appears that, 
if we except the kindred of Coleridge and Wordsworth, 
who have shown various kinds of ability, almost all the 
relations are in the first degree. Poets are clearly not 
founders of families. The reason is, I think, simple, and it 
applies to artists generally. To be a great artist, requires 
a rare and, so to speak, unnatural correlation of qualities. 
A poet, besides his genius, must have the severity and 
steadfast earnestness of those whose dispositions afford few 
temptations to pleasure, and he must, at the same time, 
have the utmost delight in the exercise of his senses and 
affections. This is a rare character, only to be formed 
by some happy accident, and is therefore unstable in 
inheritance. Usually, people who have strong sensuous 
tastes go utterly astray and fail in life, and this tendency 
is clearly shown by numerous instances mentioned in the 
following appendix, who have inherited the dangerous 
part of a poet’s character and not his other qualities that 
redeem and control it. 
+ See, for explanation, the foot-note to the similar table on p. 55.

  APPENDIX TO POETS 
I have examined into the relationships of the following 56 poets. Of 
some of them—as of those of Ferdusi, Terence, and Sappho—there seems 
to exist no record at all, and my information is very scanty about many of 
the others. Nevertheless I find that the 20 poets whose names are printed 
in italics, have had eminent kinsfolk, and that some of the remainder 
afford minor proofs of hereditary ability ; thus the father of Burns and 
the mother of Schiller were far from mediocrity; Southey’s aunt, 
Miss Tyler, was passionately fond of the theatre. We may fairly con- 
clude that at least 40 per cent. of the Poets have had eminently gifted 
relations,

Sophocles, but probably with a posthumous tragedy of 
4éschylus. 
{28 ] Euphorion and Bion were said to have gained four 
victories with posthumous pieces of Alschylus. What 
may have been their share and that of Philocles in the 
completion of these plays is unknown ; but at all events, 
from and by means of these persons arose what was 
called the tragic school of Aischylus, which continued 
for the space of 125 years. 
Ariosto, Ludovico ; author of the epic “Orlando Furioso,” 
and of many excellent satires. He wrote dramas 
as a boy, and showed an early disposition for poetry, 
but was educated for the law, which he ‘abandoned 
under an overpowering impulse towards literature. 
Never married ; had two illegitimate sons. 
B. Gabriel ; a poet of some distinction. He finished the comedy 
of “ La Scholastica,” which his brother had left wncom- 
pleted at his death. He wrote several poems, and left 
a MS. volume of Latin verses, which were published 
posthumously. 
N. Orazio was an intimate friend of Tasso. He wrote the 
“‘ Argomenti,” and other works. 
Aristophanes, Greek comedian of the highest order ; author 
of fifty-four comedies, of which only eleven have reached 
us. His genius showed itself so early, that his first 
play—and it won the second prize—was written when 
he was under the age prescribed by law for competitors. 
It was therefore submitted under a borrowed name. 
3. 8 His three sons—Philippus, Araros, and Nicostratus— 
were all poets of the middle comedy. 
Byron, Lord. Very ill-educated at home; did not show 
genius when at Harrow ; his “ Hours of Idleness ” were 
published wt. 19, and the “English Bards and Scotch 
Reviewers,” which made him famous, et. 21; d. et. 
36. 
[G.] Hon. Admiral Byron, circumnavigator ; author of the 
“ Narrative.” 
F.] Captain Byron ; imprudent and vicious 
‘Was strange, proud, passionate, and half-mad, “If ever 
there were a case in which hereditary influences, arising 
out of impulse, passions, and habits of life, could

Illustrious poet ; father of English poetry and, in some 
sense, of the English language also. 
S. Sir Thomas ; was Speaker of the House of Commons and 
ambassador to France. 
Chenier, André Marie de; eminent French poet. His 
mother was Greek and inspired him with a passionate 
taste for Greek literature. He was guillotined wt. 32. 
It was he who touched his forehead on the scaffold, and 
said regretfully, just before his execution, “ Pourtant 
jJavais quelque chose 1a.” 
B. Marie-Joseph ; also a poet. He wrote dramas and lyrical 
pieces. Among the latter was the “ Chant du Départ,” 
which nearly rivalled the “ Marseillaise.’ He was a 
leading politician under the Republic and the Empire. 
His first play was acted et. 20, and was hissed. 
Coleridge, Samuel Taylor; poet and metaphysician ; was 
filled with poetry and metaphysics et. 15; always 
slothful and imprudent. He had warm friendships, but 
was singularly regardless of duties, and somewhat 
querulous ; of a peculiarly hesitating disposition ; opium 
eater. Fully eight members of this family—indeed, 
nearly all of its male representatives—have been gifted 
with rare abilities,

Corneille, Pierre ; French dramatist ; creator of the dramatic 
art in France ; was brought up to the bar, but left it 
for poetry under an overpowering impulse. His first 
publication was a comedy, et. 23; d. wt. 78. 
B. Thomas, also a poet, who worked with Pierre, his elder 
and only brother. Their dispositions and way of life 
were in singularly close sympathy. Thus their differ- 
ence of ages being nineteen years, they married sisters 
the difference of whose ages was the same. Their 
respective families lived in the same house. They 
wrote about an equal number of plays, and their 
writings were alike in character. Thomas had the 
greater facility in authorship, but his style was inferior 
in energy to that of his brother. He succeeded Pierre 
at the Academy ; d. et. 84. 
n. Fontenelle, son of the only sister ; the celebrated Sec- 
retary of the French Academy for nearly forty years. 
His real name was Bovier. He says, “ Mon pére était 
une béte, mais ma mére avait de lesprit; elle était 
quidtiste.” His was a mixed character—partly that of 
a man of society of a frivolous and conventional type, 
and partly that of the original man of science and 
free-thinker. The Fontenelle of the opera and the 
Fontenelle of the Academy of Sciences seemed different 
people. Some biographers say he had more brain than 
heart ; others admire his disposition. He almost died 
from weakness on the day of his birth. He was a 
precocious child. At college the note attached to his 
name was, “ Adolescens omnibus partibus absolutus ” 
—a youth perfectly accomplished in every respect. He 
began public life by writing plays, in order to imitate 
his uncles, but his plays were hissed. Then he took to 
science, and became academician et. 34. He lived to 
extreme old age, becoming deaf and losing much of his

born about 150 years, or probably five generations, 
later than the Corneille family ; was a direct descendant 
of the mother of Fontenelle. 
Cowper, William ; a poet, whose writings have a singularly 
quiet charm, and are full of kindly and delicate feeling. 
He was past middle age when he began to publish ; 
his first success was wt. 54. He had a morbid 
constitutional timidity in youth, and insanity with 
religious terrors hung over his later life. He contended 
bravely against them, but ultimately they overpowered 
him. 
G. The judge, Sir Spencer Cowper. 
GB. The Lord Chancellor, Earl Cowper. 
Dibdin, Charles; writer of more than 900 naval ballads. 
He was intended for the Church, but a love of music 
so predominated that he connected himself with the 
stage. His first opera was acted at Covent Garden when 
he was «xt. 16. He afterwards became manager of 
theatres, but was improvident, and consequently much 
embarrassed in later life.

greatest men of genius the world has produced. His 
disposition, like that of Lord Bacon, appears to have 
been mainly formed by the simple addition of those of 
his ancestors. He was an exceedingly precocious child, 
for he wrote dialogues ‘and other pieces that were both 
original and good between the ages of 6 and 8. He was 
an eager student in boyhood and youth, though 
desultory in his reading. His character then was 
proud and fantastic. Goethe describes his hereditary 
peculiarities in a pretty poem, of part of which I give 
a translation from his “ Life” by Lewes :—“ From my 
father I inherit my frame and the steady guidance 
of my life; from dear little mother my happy dis- 
position and love of story-telling. My ancestor was a 
‘ladies’ man,’ and that haunts me now and then; my 
ancestress loved finery and show, which also runs in 
the blood.” To: go more into particulars, I take the 
substance of the two following paragraphs from Lewes’s 
«Life of Goethe.” 
J. One of the pleasantest figures in German literature, and 
one standing out with greater vividness than almost any 
other. She was the delight of children, the favourite 
of poets and princes. After a lengthened interview 
an enthusiastic traveller exclaimed, “‘ Now do I under- 
stand how Goethe has become the man he is.” The 
Duchess Amalia corresponded with her as an intimate 
friend ; a letter from her was a small jubilee at the 
Weimar court. She was married et. 17 to a man for 
whom she had no love, and was only 18 when the poet 
was born. 
[F.] “Was a cold, stern, formal, somewhat pedantic, but 
1 «* Vom Vater hab’ ich die Statur,

Von Miitterchen die Frohnatur,

Was ist den an dem ganzen Wicht

-P-A-G-E-257
  POETS 227 
truth-loving, upright-minded man.” From him the 
poet inherited the well-built frame, the erect carriage, 
and the measured movement, which in old age became 
stiffness, and was construed into diplomacy or haughti- 
ness; from him also came that orderliness and stoicism 
which have so much distressed those who cannot 
cenceive genius otherwise than as vagabond in its 
habits. The lust for knowledge, the delight in 
communicating it, the almost pedantic attention to 
details, which are noticeable in the poet, are all 
traceable in the father. 
Goethe married unsuitably, and had a son of no note, who 
died before him. 
Heine, Heinrich ; German poet, essayist, and satirist of the 
highest order. Wasintended for commerce, but took a 
disgust to it, and followed literature, as pupil and friend 
of A. W. Schlegel. He first published et. 25, but his 
writings were little appreciated by the public till zt. 28. 
He became partially paralysed wt. 47, and d. xt. 56. 
Was of Jewish parentage. 
U. Salomon Heine, German philanthropist; who raised 
himself from poverty to the possession of nearly two mil- 
lions sterling, and who gave immense sums to public 
institutions. 
[US.] The son of Salomon ; succeeded him in the management 
of his affairs. 
Hook, Theodore. Was a remarkably clever boy, who sang 
well and composed songs. He had great success et. 17. 
His constitution was naturally excellent, but he ruined 
it by dissipation ; d. wt. 53 of a broken constitution. 
‘Was unmarried, but had six illegitimate children.

and of considerable reputation in his day.

Man or Nature, failed not to lift up the heart to holy 
things ; tired not of maintaining the cause of the poor

be the chief minister, not only of noblest poesy, but of 
high and sacred truth,” 
He does not appear to have been precocious as a boy ;

THE general remarks I made in the last chapter on 
artists, apply with especial force to Musicians. The irre- 
gularity of their lives is commonly extreme ; the union of a 
painstaking disposition with the temperament requisite for 
a good musician is as rare as in poets, and the distractions 
incident to the public life of a great performer are vastly 
greater. Hence, although the fact of the inheritance of 
musical taste is notorious and undeniable, I find it exceed- 
ingly difficult to discuss its distribution among families, 
I also found it impossible to obtain a list of: first-class 
musicians that commanded general approval, of a length 
suitable to my purposes. There is excessive jealousy in 
the musical world, fostered no doubt by the dependence 
of musicians upon public caprice for their professional 
advancement, Consequently, each school disparages others; 
individuals do the same, and most biographers are un- 
-usually adulatory of their heroes, and unjust to those with 
whom they compare them. There exists no_firmly- 
established public opinion on the merits of musicians, 
similar to that which exists in regard to poets and painters, 
and it is even difficult to find private persons of fair musical 
tastes, who are qualified to give a deliberate and dis- 
passionate selection of the most eminent musicians. As I 
have mentioned at the head of the appendix to this chapter, 
I was indebted to a literary and artistic friend in whose 
judgment I have confidence, for the selection upon which 
I worked. 
The precocity of great musicians is extraordinary. There
-P-A-G-E-261

is no career in which eminence is achieved so early in life 
as in that of music. 
I now proceed to give the usual tables.

The nearness of degree of the eminent kinsmen is just 
as remarkable as it was in the case of the poets, and 
equally so in the absence of eminent relations through 
the female lines.

APPENDIX TO MUSICIANS 
Iam indebted to a friend for a list of 120 musicians, who appeared to 
him to be the most original and eminent upon record, They were made 
for quite another object to my own, and I therefore am the more disposed 
to rely on the justice of my friend’s choice. 26 of these, or about 1 in 5, 
have had eminent kinsmen, as is shown in the following catalogue. The 
illustrious musicians are only 7 in number; namely Sebastian Bach, 
Beethoven, Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Mozart, and Spohr. The 4 who 
are italicized are instances of hereditary genius.   
Allegri, Gregorio (1580—1652, xt. 72); composer of the 
“‘Miserere ” sung at the 8. Sixtine at Rome in Lent ; a 
man of kindly and charitable disposition, who used to 
visit the prisons daily, and give what he could to the 
prisoners. 
? Exact relation. Correggio Allegri and his family. See 
Parnters. 
Amati; a family of eminent makers of violins, who lived in 
Cremona, and were the 
first introducers of that 
instrument into Italy. Andrew. Nicholas. 
They are six in num- phil 
ber ; indeed, there is a me \ seventh — Joseph of Antonio. Jerome. 
Bologna, who wasliving Fle 
in 1786, but whose 
relationship to the others is unknown. 
Those of the family that showed the most original power 
are Andrea (B, 2 8, P), and Antonio (F, U, B, N). 
Bach, Sebastian ; a transcendent musical genius (1685—1750, 
eet. 65). He was very precocious, and arrived at the 
full maturity of his powers wt. 22. His home life was 
simple and quiet, He was a good husband, father. 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  MUSICIANS 233 
friend, and citizen. He was very laborious; and 
became blind from over-study. 
The Bachs were a musical family, comprising a vast 
number of individuals, and extending through eight 
generations. It began in 1550, it culminated in 
Sebastian (6 in the genealogical table) and its last 
known member was Regina Susanna, who was alive in 
1800, but in indigent circumstances. There are far 
more than twenty eminent musicians among the Bachs ; 
the biographical collections of musicians give the lives 
of no less than fifty-seven of them (see Fétis’ “ Dictio- 
nary of Musicians”’). It was the custom of the family 
to meet in yearly reunions, at which the entertainments 
were purely musical. In or about A.p. 1750 as many 
as 120 Bachs attended one of these meetings. A 
complete genealogy of the family is to be found in 
Korabinsky’s “ Beschreibung der Kéniglichen Ungari- 
schen Haupt Frey, und Krénungstadts Presburg,” 
t. i. p. 3; also a genealogical tree in No, 12 of the 
Leipsic “ Musical Gazette,” 1823. I give a modified copy 
of this, for it is otherwise impossible to convey the 
lines of descent in a sufficiently intelligible manner. 
Every person mentioned in the list ranks as a sterling 
musician, except where the contrary is distinctly 
stated. 
F. J. Ambrose, a distinguished organist. 
U. J. Christopher, a twin child with Ambrose. These two 
were so exceedingly alike in feature, address, and 
style, that they were the wonder of all who saw and

distinguish them except by their dresses.

I have not met with any notice of the Bach musical genius 
being transmitted through a female line. 
Beethoven, Ludwig von. I insert the name of this great 
composer on account of his having formerly been 
reputed the illegitimate son of Frederick the Great of 
Prussia. However, recent biographers consider this 
allegation to be absolutely baseless, and therefore, 
although I mention the ‘report, I do not accept its 
truth. His mother’s husband was a tenor singer of 
the Elector’s Chapel at Cologne. His two brothers 
were undistinguished. He had a nephew of some 
talent, who did not turn out well, and was cause of 
great grief to him, 
Beethoven began to publish his own musical compositions 
et. 13. 
Benda, Francesco (1709—1786, et. 77); was the elder 
member of a very remarkable family of violinists. His 
father was a poor weaver, but musical, and taught his 
sons to play. The following table shows how its eight 
principal members were related :—

B. Giorgio, the most eminent member of this interesting 
family. He had vast musical powers, but was fantastic, 
and wasted his time in reverie. It is said that, after 
his wife had died in his arms, he rushed to the piano to 
express his grief ; but soon, becoming interested in the

airs he was originating, he forgot both his grief and the 
cause of it so completely, that, when his servant 
interrupted him to ask about communicating the 
recent event to the neighbours, Giorgio jumped up| 
in a puzzle, and went to his wife’s room to consult her.

N. Ernest Fred., son of Giuseppi; promised to be an artist 
of the first order, but d. of fever wt. 31. 
Bononcini, Giovanni Maria (1640— 1?) ; composer and writer 
on music. 
[B.] But the relationship is not established. Domenichino, a 
musician at the court of Portugal, who lived to beyond 
85 years of age. 
B. Antonio, composer of Church music. 
8. Giovanni ; composed a very successful opera— Camilla” 
—t. 18. He was a rival in England of Handel, but 
had to yield. 
Dussek, Ladislas (1761—1812, et. 51); played on the piano 
zt. 5; a very amiable and noble character ; exceedingly 
careless about his own money ; equally celebrated as a 
performer and as a composer. He greatly advanced 
the power of the piano. Married Miss Corri (? Currie), 
a musician, 
gF. Giovanni ; excellent organist. 
B. Francesco ; very good violinist. 
s. Olivia ; inherited the talents of her parents ; performer on 
the piano and harp. 
Eichhorn, Jean Paul, 1787, and his two sons. Jean Paul 
was of humble birth. He showed remarkable aptitude 
for music, and without any regular instruction he 
became a good musician. He married twice ; his son 
by the first wife was Ernest, and by the second, whom 
he married very shortly after the death of the first in 
childbirth, was Edward 
28. These children were known as “ the Brothers Eichhorn.” 
They both had marvellous musical powers from the 
tenderest years, and played instinctively. Thence-

forward their father used them cruelly, to make as 
much money as he could, and compelled them to perform 
continually in public. Thus they lost all opportunity 
for that study and leisure which are required for the 
development of the highest artistic powers. 
Edward was not equal in musical ability to his brother. 
Gabrielli, Andrea (about 1520—1586, xt. about 66); an 
esteemed composer of music. 
N. Jean Gabrielli, a great and original artist, wholly devoted 
to musical labours ; eulogized in the highest terms by his 
contemporaries and scholars. 
Haydn, Francis Joseph. His disposition to music was 
evident from the earliest childhood. He was born in 
low circumstances, and gradually struggled upwards. 
His father was a village organist and wheelwright. 
He married, but not happily, and was soon separated 
from his wife who had no children by him. 
B. Jean Michael. Joseph Haydn considered him to be the 
best composer of Church music of his day. He was an 
excellent organist. 
Hiller, Jean Adam (Hiiller), (1728—1); a most eager 
student of music ; had a wretched hypochondriacal 
state of ill-health in early manhood, which somewhat. 
disappeared in later life He had an honourable re- 
putation both for his musical compositions and 
writings upon music. 
S. Frederick Adam Hiller (1768—1812, wt. 44) ; a first-rate 
violinist. He died when he was rising to a great 
reputation. 
Keiser, Reinhard (1673—1739, et. 66) ; one of the most illus- 
trious of German composers. He showed originality in 
his earliest musical efforts. He was a most fertile 
writer ; in forty years he wrote 116 operas, and much 
else besides ; but copies were seldom made of his works, 
and they are exceedingly rare. 
F, A distinguished musician and composer of Church music. 
_s. His daughter was an excellent singer. 
Mendelssohn, Bartholdy; had an early and strong dis- 
position towards music ; first published xt. 15. 
G. Moses Mendelssohn, a celebrated Jewish philosopher, who 
wrote, among other matters, on the zsthetics of music. 
He was precocious. 
IF, Abraham Mendelssohn, a rich banker in Berlin. His son

says to him, “I often cannot understand how it is 
possible to have so acute a judgment with regard to 
music without being yourself technically informed. ” 
(Letters, ii. 80.) 
[2 U.] His uncles were well-informed men. One was' 
associated with Abraham in the bank ; he wrote on 
Dante ; also on the currency. The other was a hard 
student. y 
6. Very musical ; as a pianist she was Mendelssohn’s equal, 
and of high genius. She was also very affectionate. 
Meyerbeer, James (the name is really Beer); was exceed- 
ingly precocious. He played brilliantly et. 6, and was: 
amongst the best pianists of Berlin et. 9. He began 
to publish compositions et. 19, and d. wt. 70. 
B. William Meyerbeer, the astronomer—Map of the Moon. 
B. Michael Beer, a poet of high promise, who died young. 
Mozart, J. ©. Wolfgang ; was exceedingly precocious as a 
child—quite a prodigy in music. He played beautifully 
zt. 4, and composed much of real merit between the 
ages of 4 and 6. He overworked himself, and d. st. 35. 
F. Leopold Mozart ; famous violinist. His method, which he 
published, was considered for fifty years to be the best 
work of its kind. He composed'a great deal. 
‘Was a hopeful musician as a child, an excellent pianist, 
but she did not succeed in after-life. 
Charles Mozart ; cultivated music as an amateur, and 
played with distinguished talent, but nothing more is 
recorded of him. 
. Wolfgang Amedée ; born four months after his father’s 
death ; was a distinguished performer, and has composed 
a good deal, but has not risen to high eminence as a 
composer. 
Palestrina, Jean Pierluigi de (b. ?—died 1594) ; composer of 
Church music ; one of the most illustrious of names in 
the history of music, yet nothing is known of his 
parentage or family, and even the dates of his birth and 
death are doubtful. He married young. 
44.8. His three eldest sons—Ange, Rodolphe, and Sylla— 
died in their youth. They seem to have had their 
father’s abilities, judging from such of their compositions 
as are preserved among Palestrina’s works. The 
fourth son—Hygin—edited his father’s musical com- 
positions. eos R

PAINTERS 
AMONG painters, as among musicians, I think no one 
doubts that artistic talent is, in some degree, hereditary. 
The question is rather, whether its distribution in families, 
together with the adjuncts necessary to form an eminent 
painter, follows much the same law as that which obtains 
in respect to other kinds of ability. It would be easy 
to collect a large number of modern names to show how 
frequently artistic eminence is shared by kinsmen. Thus, 
the present generation of the Landseers consists of two 
Academicians and one Associate of the, Royal Academy, 
who were all of them the sons of an Associate. The 
Bonheur family consists of four painters. Rosa, Juliette, 
Jules, and Auguste, and they are the children of an artist 
of some merit. Very many more instances could easily be 
quoted. But I wish to adduce evidence of the inter- 
relationship of artists of a yet higher order of merit, and 
I therefore limit my inquiry to the illustrious ancient 
painters, especially of Italy and the Low Countries, These 
are not numerous—only, as well as I can make out, about 
forty-two, whose natural gifts are unquestionably more 
than “eminent ;” and the fact of about half of them 
possessing eminent relations, and of some of them, as the 
Caracci and the Van Eycks, being actually kinsmen, is 
more important to my argument than pages filled with 
the relationships of men of the classes F or E of artistic 
gifts. It would be interesting to know the number of art 
students in Europe during the last three or more centuries,’ 
from whom the forty-two names I have selected are the 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  
240 PAINTERS 
most illustrious. It is assuredly very great, but it hardly 
deserves much pains in investigation, because it would 
afford a minimum, not a true fag Rafa of the artistic 
superiority of the forty-two over the rest of the world: 
the reason being, that the art students are themselves a 
selected class. Lads follow painting as a profession usually 
because they are instinctively drawn to it, and not as a 
career in which they were placed by accidental circum- 
stances. I should estimate the average of the forty-two 
painters to rank far above the average of class F, in the 
natural gifts necessary for high success in art. 
In the following table I have included ten individuals 
that do not find a place in the list of forty-two: namely, 
Isaac Ostade ; Jacopo and Gentile Bellini; Badille, Agos- 
tino Caracci, William Mieris; David Teniers; W. Van der 
Velde the elder; and Francesco da Ponte, both the elder 
and the younger. The average rank of these men is far 
above that of a modern Academician, though I have not 
ventured to include them: in the most illustrious class. 
I have kept Claude in the latter, notwithstanding recent 
strictures, on account of his previously long-established 
reputation.

APPENDIX TO PAINTERS. 
I have procured a list of 42 ancient painters of the Italian, Spanish, and 
Dutch schools, which includes, I believe, all who are ranked by common 
consent as illustrious. 18 of them have eminent relations, and 3 of the 
remainder—namely, Claude, Parmegiano, and Raffaelle—have kinsmen 
worthy of notice: these are printed in ¢alics in the following list, the 
remainder are in ordinary type.

Allegri, Antonio da Correggio (1494—1534, wt. 40); one 
of those rare examples of a man of innate and daring 
genius who, without a precursor and without a 
technical education, became a great painter. Very 
little is known of his parentage. 
S. Pomponeo Allegri, only son; his father died when he 
was only 12, but he painted in his father’s style. 
His fresco in Parma Cathedral is full of Correggiesque 
expression. 
[p.] Antonio Pelegrino, called “Tl Pittore.” 
+ “(I do not know the relation.) Gregorio Allegro, the 
musician, See. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273

Bassano. See Ponts. 
Bellini Giovanni (1422—1512, et. 90); was the first 
Venetian painter in oil, and the instructor of the two 
greatest painters of Venice—Giorgione and Titian. 
He was himself the first Venetian painter, when in his 
prime. 
F. Jacopo Bellini, one of the most reputable painters of the 
early period at which he lived. He was eminent for 
his portraits. 
B. Gentile Cav. Bellini, painter of very high reputation. 
The large pictures in the great Council Chamber of 
Venice are by him, The Senate gave him honour, and 
a stipend for life. 
Cagliari, Paolo, called “ Paolo Veronese ” (1532—1588, et. 
56). His genius showed itself early. It was said of 
him that, in the spring of life, he bore most excellent 
fruit. He was the most successful among painters of 
ornament and of scenes of sumptuous and magnificent 
arade. 
[F.] Gabrielle Cagliari, sculptor. 
u. Antonio Badile, the first of the Wenetian painters that 
entirely emancipated himself from the Gothic style. 
§.  Carletto Cagliari ; inherited the inventive genius of his 
father, and gave most flattering promise of future 
excellence, but died et. 26. 
[S.] Gabrielle Cagliari, a painter, but not a successful one, 
who afterwards abandoned the profession and followed 
commerce. 
Caracci, Lodovico (15551619, wt. 64); the principal 
founder of the school that bears the name of his 
family. His genius was slow in declaring itself ; his 
first master having counselled him to abandon art, and 
his fellow-pupils having nicknamed him, from his 
slowness, “the Ox.” But the slowness was more 
apparent than real ; it arose from profound reflection, 
as distinguished from vivacity. His powers were 
extraordinary. 
US. Agostino Caracci (1558—1601, wt. 43); an ‘excellent 
painter, but chiefly eminent as an engraver. His 
powers showed themselves in boyhood. He was an 
accomplished man of letters and science, and had the 
gifts of a poet. 
US. Annibale Caracci (1560—1609, wt. 49). This great 
R 2
-P-A-G-E-274
  244 PAINTERS 
artist was the younger brother of Agostino. He had 
received from nature the gifts of a great painter, and 
they were carefully cultivated by Lodovico. Annibale 
had more energy than Agostino, but a far less cultured 
mind ; he was even averse to literature. 
[US.] Francesco Caracci, a third brother of great pretensions 
as a painter, but of disproportionate merit. 
UP. Antonio Caracci, a natural son of Annibale; had 
much of his father’s genius, and became an able 
designer and painter. His constitution was weak, and 
he died et. 36. 
[B.] Paolo Caracci, a painter, but without original power. 
Claude. See Guin. 
Correggio. See ALLEGRI. 
Eyck, John van (1370—1441) ; the discoverer of oil painting. 
His pictures were held in the highest estimation at.the 
time in which he lived. 
B. Hubert van Eyck, equally eminent as a painter. In 
fact, the two brothers worked so much in conjunction 
that their works are inseparable. 
[F.] An obscure painter. 
6. Marguerite. She was passionately devoted to painting. 
Gelée, Claude (called Lorraine), (1600—1682, wt. 82). 
This eminent landscape painter began life as an appren- 
tice to a pastrycook, then travelling valet, and 
afterwards cook to an artist. His progress in painting 
was slow, but he had indomitable perseverance ; was 
at the height of his fame et. 30. He never married ; 
he was too devoted to his profession to do so. 
[B.] A carver in wood. 
Mazzuoli, Franc , called “Tl Parmegiano” (1504—1541, 
et. 37). This great colourist and graceful and delicate’ 
painter made such great progress as a student, though 
ill-taught, that et. 16 his painting was the astonishment 
of contemporary artists. According to Vasari, it was 
said at Rome that “the soul of Raffaelle had passed 
into the person of Parmegiano.” It is stated that when 
at the height of his fame be became seized with the 
mania of alchemy, and wasted his fortune and health 
in searching for the philosopher’s stone. 
[F. and 2 U.] Filippo Mazzuoli, and Michele and Pier Iario, 
were all three of them artists, but obscure. 
(2) US. Girolamo, son of Michele, and scholar of Parmegiano ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  
PAINTERS 245 
he married a cousin, the daughter of Pier Ilario, He 
was a painter of some success. The? is appended to 
his letter because it has been said that he was not a 
relation at all. It is singular to note the contradictions 
about the family concerns of the painters. There is 
less known of their domestic history than of any other 
class of eminent men except musicians. 
[uP. (and also ? UP).] Alessandro, son of Girolamo, and his 
scholar. He was but an inferior artist. 
Mieris, Francis (the Elder), (1635—1681, wt. 46). “Tt 
is too much, with all his merits, to say he is superior 
to, or even equal with, Gerard Dow; his admirers 
should be content with placing him at the head of the 
next rank.” 
8. John Mieris ; despaired of equalling his father in minute- 
ness and delicacy, so he followed historical painting and 
portraiture ; died et. 30. 
S. William Mieris; was an able artist et. 18, and was 
scarcely inferior to his father in the exquisite finish of 
his pictures. 
[P.] Francis Mieris (the Younger), son of William ; a painter 
in the same style as his father, but decidedly inferior 
to him. 
Murillo, Bartolomé Estevan (1613—1685, wt. 72). Few 
have a juster claim to originality than this ad- 
mirable Spanish painter. He showed early inclina- 
tion to the art. He was naturally humble-minded and 
retiring, and remarkably good and charitable, even to 
his own impoverishment. 
u. Juan del Castillo, a painter of considerable merit, 
and the instructor of some of the greatest artists in 
Spain, namely, Murillo, Alonzo Cano, and Pedro de 
Moya. 
u. Augustin Castillo, a good painter. 
uS. Antonio del Castillo, y Salvedra; eminent painter 
as regards composition and design, but inferior in 
colouring. He sank into a despondency after visiting 
Seville, where he first saw a collection of Murillo’s 
pictures, so much superior to his own, and he died 
of it. 
Ostade, Adrian van (1610—1685, wt. 75); eminent painter 
of Dutch domestic scenes and grotesque subjects. 
B, Isaac van Ostade; began by copying his brother’s style 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
246 PAINTERS 
without much success, but afterwards he adopted a 
manner of his own, and became a well-known painter. 
He died in the prime of life. 
Parmegiano. See Mazzvott. 
Ponte, Francesco da (the Elder), (1475—1530, wt. 55); the 
head of the family of the Bassanos, and the founder of 
the school distinguished by their name. 
§. Giacomo da Ponte (called Tl Bassano), (1510—1592, wt. 
82); eminent artist ; had extraordinary invention and 
facility of execution. He had four sons, as follow, all 
well-known painters :— 
P. Francesco da Ponte (the Younger) ; had eminent talents. 
He had attacks of melancholy, and committed suicide 
eet, 49. 
P. Giovanni Battista da Ponte, noticeable as a most precise 
copyist of the works of his father, Giacomo. 
P. Leandro da Ponte ; celebrated portrait painter. 
P. Girolamo da ; excellent copyist of his father’s works. 
Potter, Paul; admirable Dutch painter of animals; before 
he was et. 15, his works were held in the highest 
. estimation. 
F. Peter Potter, landscape painter, whose works are now 
rare, but they must have been of considerable merit, 
judging from the prints engraved from them by P. 
Nolpe. 
Raffaelle. See Sanzio, 
Robusti, Giacomo (called Il Tintoretto). This dis- 
tinguished Venetian painter showed. an artistic bent 
from infancy, and far outstripped his fellow-students, 
He was a man of impetuous genius and prompt 
execution. 
s. Marietta Robusti (Tintoretto); acquired considerable 
reputation as a portrait painter, and her celebrity was 
not confined to her native country. 
S. Domenico Robusti (Tintoretto) ; followed the traces of his 
father, but with unequal strength, He was also a good 
portrait painter, and painted many of the historical 
personages of his time. 
Ruysdael, Jacob (born about 1636); Dutch landscape 
painter. He showed extraordinary artistic ability et. 
14, but did not at first follow painting as a profession, 
He began life as a surgeon. 
‘[B.] Solomon Ruysdael, the elder brother, twenty years
-P-A-G-E-277
  
PAINTERS 247 
  
older than Jacob, was a landscape painter of feeble 
powers. 
Sanzio, Raffaelle, di Urbino. This illustrious artist has, by 
the general approbation of mankind, been considered as 
the prince of painters. 
[F.] Giovanni Sanzio, a painter whose powers were moderate, 
but certainly above the average. 
Teniers, David (the Younger), (1610—1694, et. 84). This 
celebrated Dutch painter followed the same style and 
adopted the same subjects as his father, such as village 
festivals and the like, but his compositions are by far 
the more varied and ingenious, and the superior in every 
way. 
F. David Teniers (the Elder), (1582—1649, xt. 67). His 
pictures were very original in style, and universally 
admired. They would have been considered among the 
happiest efforts in that class of drawings if they had 
not been greatly surpassed by the inimitable productions 
of his son. 
B, Abraham Teniers. He painted in the same style as his 
brother and father, but though a fair artist he was much 
inferior to both of them. 
Titian. See VEcELit. 
Vandyck, Sir Anthony (1599—1641); admirable portrait 
painter, second only to Titian. 
Et A painter on glass ; a man of some property. 
[f.] His mother was skilful in embroidery, which she 
wrought with considerable, taste, from designs both of 
landscape and figures. 
Vecelli, Tiziano da Cadore (Titian), (1477—1576); the 
great founder of the true principles of colouring. 
Showed considerable ability at the age of 18, and he 
painted until his death, by the plague, xt, 99. 
There are eight or nine good painters in this remarkable 
family: Bryan mentions six of them in his Dic- 
tionary, but it seems that he is not quite accurate 
as to their relationships. The annexed genealogical 
tree is compiled from Northcote’s descriptions. 
All those whose names appear in the diagram 
are painters. The connecting links indicated by 
crosses are, singularly enough, every one of them 
lawyers. 
B. and 2 8. Titian’s brother, Francesco, and two sons.

Pomponio and Horatio, had all of them great abilities, 
The brother was chiefly engaged in military duties, 
and was never able to make a profession of painting. 
The sons wanted the stimulus of poverty, but there is 
no doubt of their large natural capacities for art.

teresting as showing the persistent artistic quality of 
the Vecelli race. 
Velde, William van der (the Younger), (1633—1707). Is 
accounted the best marine painter that ever lived. 
Walpole says of him that he is “the greatest man 
that has appeared in this branch of painting: the 
palm is not less disputed with Raphael for history than 
with Vandervelde for sea-pieces.” He was born at 
Amsterdam. 
F, William van der Velde (the Elder), (1610—1693, et. 
83); admirable marine painter, born in Leyden. He 
taught his son, by whom he was surpassed. 
S. Also named William, and also a painter of the same 
subjects as his father and grandfather. 
There are three other eminent painters of the same 
family, name, towns, and period; but I find no notice 
of their relationships. Thus the two brothers, Esais 
and John van der Velde, were born in Leyden about 
1590 and 1595, and Adrian van der Velde was born in 
Amsterdam in 1639.

y AM now about to push my statistical survey into regions 
where precise inquiries seldom penetrate, and are not very 
generally welcomed. There is commonly so much vague- 
ness of expression on the part of religious writers, that I 
am unable to determine what they really mean when they 
speak of topics that directly bear on my present inquiry. 
I cannot guess how far their expressions are intended to 
be understood metaphorically, or in some other way to be 
clothed with a different meaning to what is imposed by the 
grammatical rules and plain meaning of language. The 
expressions to which I refer are those which assert the 
fertility of marriages and the establishment of families to 
be largely dependent upon godliness. I may even take 
a much wider range, and include those other expressions 
which assert that material well-being generally is influenced 
by the same cause.” 
I do not propose to occupy myself with criticising the 
interpretation of these or similar passages, or by endea- 
vouring to show how they may be made to accord with 
fact ; it is the business of theologians to do. these things. 
What I undertake is simply to investigate whether or no 
the assertions they contain, according to their primd facie 
interpretation, are or are not in accordance with statistical 
deductions. If an exceptional providence protects the

families of godly men, it is a fact that we must take into 
account. Natural gifts would then have to be conceived| 
as due, in a high and probably measurable degree, to 
ancestral piety, and, in a much lower degree than I might 
otherwise have been inclined to suppose, to ancestral natural 
peculiarities. 
All of us are familiar with another and an exactly] 
opposite opinion. It is popularly said that the children] 
of religious parents frequently turn out badly, and| 
numerous instances are quoted to support this assertion. 
If a wider induction and a careful analysis should prove 
the correctness of this view, it might appear to strongly 
oppose the theory of heredity. 
On both these accounts, it is absolutely necessary, to 
the just treatment of my subject, to inquire into the 
history of religious people, and learn the extent of their| 
hereditary peculiarities, and whether or no their lives are| 
attended by an exceptionally good fortune. 
I have taken considerable pains to procure a suitable} 
selection of Divines for my inquiries. The Roman Catholic 
Church is rich in ecclesiastical biography, but it affords no 
data for my statistics, for the obvious reason that its holy] 
personages, of both sexes, are celibates, and therefore in- 
capable of founding families. A collection of the Bishops 
of our Church would also be unsuitable, because, during 
many generations, they were principally remarkable as| 
administrators, scholars, polemical writers, or courtiers ; 
whence it would not be right to conclude, from the fact 
of their having been elevated to the Bench, that they 
were men of extraordinary piety. I thought of many 
other selections of Divines, which further consideration 
compelled me to abandon. At length I was fortunately 
directed to one that proved perfectly appropriate to my 
wants. 
Middleton’s “ Biographia Evangelica,” 4 vols, 8vo. 1786, 
is exactly the kind of work that suits my inquiries. The 
biographies contained in it are not too numerous, for there 
are only 196 of them altogether, extending from the 
Reformation to the. date of publication. Speaking more 
precisely, the collection includes the lives of 196 Evan-  
-P-A-G-E-281
  DIVINES 251 
gelical worthies, taken from the whole of Europe, who, 
with the exception of the four first—namely, Wickliffe, 
Huss, Jerome of Prague, and John of Wesalia—died 
between 1527 and 1785. This leaves 192 men during a 
period of 258 years; or 3 men in every 4—a sufficiently 
rigorous, but not too rigorous, selection for my purposes. 
The biographies are written in excellent English, with well- 
weighed epithets; and though the collection is, to some 
extent, a compilation of other men’s writings, it may justly 
be viewed as an integral work, in which a proportionate 
prominence has been given to the lives of the more im- 
portant men, and not as a combination of separate memoirs, 
written without reference to one another. Middleton assures 
the reader, in his preface, that no bigoted partiality to sects 
will be found in his collection ; that his whole attention 
has been paid to truly great and gracious characters of all 
those persuasions which hold the distinguishing principles 
of the Gospel. He does not define what, in his opinion, 
those principles are, but it is easy to see that his leaning 
is strongly towards the Calvinists, and he utterly reprobates 
the Papists. 
I should further say, that, after reading his work, I have 
gained a much greater respect for the body of Divines than 
I had before. One is so frequently scandalised by the 
pettiness, acrimony, and fanaticism shown in theological 
disputes, that an inclination .to these failings may reason- 
ably be suspected in men of large religious profession, 
But I can assure my readers, that Middleton’s biogtaphies 
appear, to the best of my judgment, to refer, in by the far 
greater part, to exceedingly noble characters. There are 
certainly a few personages of very doubtful reputation, 
especially in the earlier part of the work, which covers the 
turbid period of the Reformation ; such as Cranmer, “ saintly 
in his professions, unscrupulous in his dealings, zealous for 
nothing, bold in speculation, a coward and a time-server 
in action, a placable enemy, and a lukewarm friend.” 
(Macaulay.) Nevertheless, I am sure that Middleton’s 
collection, on the whole, is eminently fair and trustworthy. 
The 196 subjects of Middleton’s biographies may be 
classified as follow :—22 of them were martyrs, mostly

  252 DIVINES { 
by fire; the latest of these—Homel, a pastor in the 
Cevennes in the time of Louis XIV.—was executed, 1683, 
under circumstances of such singular atrocity, that, although 
they have nothing to do with my subject, I cannot forbear 
quoting what Middleton says about them. Homel was 
sentenced to the wheel, where “every limb, member, and 
bone of his body were broken with the iron bar, forty hours 
before. the executioner was permitted to strike him upon 
the breast, with a stroke which they call ‘le coup de grdce, 
the blow of mercy—that death-stroke which put an end 
to all his miseries.” Others of the 196 worthies, including 
_ many of the martyrs, were active leaders in the Reforma- 
tion, as Wickliffe, Zuinglius, Luther, Ridley, Calvin, Beza; 
others were most eminent administrators, as Archbishops 
Parker, Grindal, and Usher; a few were thorough-going 
Puritans, as Bishop Potter, Knox, Welch, the two Erskines, 
and Dr. J. Edwards; a larger number were men of an 
extreme, but more pleasing form of piety, as Bunyan, 
Baxter, Watts, and George Herbert. The rest, and the 
majority of the whole list, may be described as pious 
scholars. 
As a general rule, the men in Middleton’s collection had 
considerable intellectual capacity and natural eagerness for 
study, both of which qualities were commonly manifest in 
boyhood. Most of them wrote voluminously, and were 
continually engaged in preachings and religious services. 
They had evidently a strong need of utterance. They 
were generally, but by no means universally, of religious 
parentage, judging by the last 100 biographies of Middle- 
ton’s collection, the earlier part of the work giving too 
imperfect notices of their ancestry to make it of use to 
analyse it. It would appear that, out of 100 men, only 
41 had one or more eminently religious parents, nothing 
whatever being said of the parentage of the other 59, 
The 41 cases are divided thus :'—in 17 cases (a) the father 
was a minister; in 16 cases (0), the father not being a

minister, both parents were religious; in 5 cases (¢) the 
mother only is mentioned as pious; in 2 cases ‘(d) the 
mother’s near relatives are known to have been religious ; 
in 1 case (¢) the father alone is mentioned as pious. 
There is no case in which either or both parents are 
distinctly described as having been sinful, though there 
are two cases (f.)! of meanness, and one (g.)? of over- 
spending. 
The condition of life of the parents is mentioned in 66 
cases—more than one-third of the whole. They fall into 
the following groups :— 
4, Highly connected—Hamilton ; George, Prince of An- 
halt ; John & Lasco; Herbert. 
8. Ancient families (not necessarily wealthy)—Jewell, 
Deering, Gilpin, Hildersham, Ames, Bedell, Lewis de Dieu, 
Palmer. 
15. Well connected.—CEcolampadius, Zuinglius, Capito, 
Farel, Jones, Bugenhagius, Bullinger, Sandys, Featley, Dod, 
Fulke, Pool, Baxter, Griffith Jones, Davies. 
23. Professional——Melancthon and Toplady, officers in 
army ; Gataker, Usher, and Saurin, legal; seventeen were 
ministers (see list already given) ; Davenant, merchant. 
6. In Trade—Two Abbots, weaver ; Twisse, clothier ; 
Bunyan, tinker; Watts, boarding-school ; Doddridge, oil- 
man, 
4. Poor.—Huss, Ball, Gryneeus, Fagius, Latimer. 
6. Very poor.—Luther, Pellican, Musculus, Cox, An- 
dreas, Prideaux. 
There is, therefore, nothing anomalous in the parentage 
of the Divines; it is what we should expect to have found 
among secular scholars, born within the same periods of 
our history. 
The Divines are not founders of influential families. 
Poverty was not always the reason of this, because we read 
Flavel, Spener, Witsius, Shower, Doddridge, G. Jones, Davies, Guyse, 
Gill.

of many whose means were considerable. W. Gouge left 
a fair fortune to his son T. Gouge, wherewith he supported 
Welsh and other charities. Evans had considerable wealth, 
which he wholly lost by speculations in the South Sea 
Bubble; and others are mentioned who were highly con- 
nected, and therefore more or less well off. The only 
families that produced men of importance are those of 
Saufin, whose descendant was the famous Attorney-General 
of Ireland; of Archbishop Sandys, whose descendant after 
several generations became the Ist Lord Sandys; and of. 
Hooker, who is ancestor of the eminent botanists, the late 
and present Directors of the Kew Botanical Gardens. The 
Divines, as a whole, have had hardly any appreciable in- 
fluence in founding the governing families of England, or 
in producing our judges, statesmen, commanders, men of 
literature and science, poets or artists. 
The Divines are but moderately prolific. Judging from 
the later biographies, about one-half of them were married, 
and there were about 5, or possibly 6, children to each 
marriage. That is to say, the number actually recorded 
gives at the rate of 44, but in addition to these occurs, 
about once in 6 or 7 cases, the phrase “many children.” 
The insertion of these occasional unknown, but certainly 
large numbers, would swell the average by a trifling 
amount. Again, it is sometimes not clear whether the 
number of children who survived infancy may not be stated 
by mistake as the number of births, and, owing to this 
doubt, we must further increase the estimated average. 
Now in order that population should not decrease, each 
set of 4 adults, 2 males and 2 females, must leave at least 
4 children who live to be adults, behind them. In the case 
of the Divines, we have seen that only one-half are married 
men; therefore each married Divine must leave 4 adults 
to succeed him, if his race is not to decrease. This implies 
an average family of more than 6 children, or, as a 
matter of fact, larger families than the Divines appear to 
have had. 
Those who marry, often marry more than once. We 
hear in all of 81 married men ; 3 of these, namely, Junius, 
Gataker, and Flavel, had each of them 4 wives; Bucer and
-P-A-G-E-285
  
  DIVINES 255 
Mather had 3; and 12 others had 2 wives each, 
The frequency with which the Divines became widowers is 
a remarkable fact, especially as they did not usually marry 
when young. I account for the early deaths of their wives, 
on the hypothesis that their constitutions were weak, and 
‘my reasons for thinking so are twofold. First, a very large 
proportion of them died in childbirth, for seven such deaths 
are mentioned, and there is no reason to suppose that all, 
or nearly all, that occurred have been recorded by Middle- 
ton. Secondly, it appears, that the wives of the Divines 
were usually women of great piety ; now it will be shown 
a little further on, that there is a frequent correlation 
between an unusually devout disposition and a weak con- 
stitution. 
The Divines seem to have been very happy in their 
domestic life. I know of few exceptions to this rule: the 
wife of T. Cooper was unfaithful, and that of poor Hooker 
was a termagant. Yet in many cases, these simple-hearted 
worthies had made their proposals under advice, and not 
through love. Calvin married on Bucer’s advice; and as 
for Bishop Hall, he may tell his own story, for it is a 
typical one. After he had built his house, he says, in his 
autobiography, “The uncouth solitariness of my life, and 
the extreme incommodity of my single housekeeping, drew 
my thoughts after two years, to condescend to the necessity 
of a married estate, which God no less strangely provided 
for me, for walking from the church on Monday in the 
Whitsun week with a grave and reverend minister, Mr. 
Grandidge, I saw a comely and modest gentlewoman 
standing at the door of that house where we were invited 
to a wedding-dinner, and inquiring of that worthy friend 
whether he knew her, ‘ Yes, quoth he, ‘I know her well, 
and have bespoken her for your wife. When I further 
demanded an account of that answer, he told me she was 
the daughter of a gentleman whom he much respected, 
Mr. George Winniffe, of Bretenham; that out of an 
opinion had of the fitness of that match for me, he had 
already treated with her father about it, whom he found 
very apt to entertain it, advising me not to neglect the 
opportunity, and not concealing the just praises of the
-P-A-G-E-286
  256 < DIVINES 
  
modesty, piety, good disposition, and other virtues that 
were lodged in that seemly presence. I listened to the 
motion as sent from God ; and at last, upon due prosecution, 
happily prevailed, enjoying the company of that meet-help 
for the space of forty-nine years.” 
The mortality of the Divines follows closely the same 
order in those who are mentioned in the earlier, as in the 
later volumes of Middleton’s collection, although the con- 
ditions of life must have varied in the periods to which 
they refer. Out of the 196, nearly half of them die 
between the ages of 55 and 75; one quarter die before 55, 
and one quarter after 75: 62 or 68 is the average age at 
death, in the sense that as many die before that age as 
after it. This is rather less than I have deduced from the 
other groups of eminent men treated of in this volume. 
Dod, the most aged of all of the Divines, lived till he was 
98. Nowell and Du Moulin died between 90 and 95; and 
Zanchius, Beza, and Conant, between 85 and 90. The 
diseases that killed them are chiefly those due to a 
sedentary life, for, if we exclude the martyrs, one quarter 
of all the recorded cases were from the stone or strangury,. 
between which diseases the doctors did not then satis- 
factorily discriminate; indeed, they murdered Bishop 
Wilkins by mistaking the one for the other. There 
are five cases of plague, and the rest consist of 
the following groups in pretty equal proportions, viz. 
fever and ague, lung disease, brain attacks, and unclassed 
diseases, 
As regards health, the constitutions of most of the 
Divines were remarkably bad. It is, I find, very common 
among scholars to have been infirm in youth, whence, partly 
from inaptitude to join with other boys in their amuse- 
ments, and partly from unhealthy activity of the brain, they 
take eagerly to bookish pursuits. Speaking broadly, there 
are three eventualities to these young students. They die 
young; or they strengthen as they grow, retaining their 
tastes and enabled to indulge them with sustained energy ; 
or they live on ina sickly way. The Divines are largely 
recruited from the sickly portion of these adults. There is 
an air of invalidism about most religious biographies, that
-P-A-G-E-287
  DIVINES 257 
  
also seems to me to pervade, to some degree, the lives in 
Middleton’s collection. 
He especially notices the following fourteen or fifteen 
cases of weak constitution :— 
1. Melancthon, d. zt. 63, whose health required con- 
tinual management. 2. Calvin, d. et. 55, faint, thin, and 
consumptive, but who nevertheless got through an immense 
amount of work. Perhaps we may say 3. Junius, d. wt. 47, 
a most infirm and sickly child, never expected ‘to reach 
manhood, but he strengthened as he grew, and though he 
died young, it was the plague that killed’ him ; he more- 
over survived four wives. 4. Downe, d. wt. 61, a Somerset- 
shire vicar, who through all his life, “in health and 
strength, was a professed pilgrim and sojourner” in the 
world. 5. George Herbert, d. xt. 42, consumptive, and 
subject to frequent fevers and other infirmities, seems to 
have owed the bent of his mind very much to his ill-health, 
for he grew more pious as he became more stricken, and 
‘we can trace that courageous, chivalric character in him 
which developed itself in a more robust way in his 
ancestors and brothers, who were mostly gallant soldiers. 
One brother was a sailor of reputation ; another carried 
twenty-four wounds on his person. 6. Bishop Potter, d. 
zt. 64, was of a weak constitution, melancholic, lean, and 
puritanical. 7. Janeway, d. wt. 24, found “ hard study and 
work by far an overmatch for him.” 8. Baxter, d. et. 76, 
was always in wretched health; he was tormented with a 
stone in the kidney (which, by the way, is said to have 
been preserved in the College of Surgeons). 9. Philip 
Henry, d. wt. 65, called the “heavenly Henry,” when a 
young clergyman, was a weakly child ; he grew stronger as 
an adult, but ruined his improved health by the sedentary 
ways of a student’s life, alternating with excitement in the 
pulpit, where “he sweated profusely as he prayed 
fervently.” He died of apoplexy. 10. Harvey, d. xt. 30, 
was such a weakly, puny object, that his father did not like 
his becoming a minister, “ lest his stature should render him 
despicable.” 11. Moth, d. xt. ? seems another instance. 
Hardly any personal anecdote is given of him, except that 
“God was pleased to try him many ways,” which phrase I 
8  
-P-A-G-E-288
258 DIVINES 
  
interpret to include ill-health. 12. Brainerd, d. zt. 29, was 
naturally infirm, and died of a complication of obstinate 
disorders. 13. Hervey, d. xt. 55, though an early riser, 
was very weakly by nature; he was terribly emaciated 
before his death. 14, Guise, d. xt. 81, a great age for those 
times, was nevertheless sickly. He was hectic and over- 
worked in early life, afterwards ill and lame, and lastly blind. 
15. Toplady, d. et. 38, struggled in vain for health and a 
longer life, by changing his residence at the sacrifice of his 
hopes of fortune, 
In addition to these fifteen cases of constitutions stated 
to have been naturally weak, we should count at least 
twelve of those that broke down under the strain of work. 
Even when the labour that ruined their health was un- 
reasonably severe, the zeal which goaded them to work 
beyond their strength may be considered as being, in some 
degree, the symptom of a faulty constitution. Each case 
ought to be considered on its own merits; they are as 
follow :—1. Whitaker, d. wt. 48, laid the seeds of death by 
his incredible application. 2. Rollock, d. wt. 43, the first 
Principal of the University of Edinburgh, died in conse 
quence of over-work, though the actual cause of his deat 
was the stone. 3. Dr. Rainolds, d. xt. 48, called “th 
treasury of all learning, human and divine,” deliberatel: 
followed his instinct for over-work to the very grave, saying 
that he would not “ propter vitam vivendi perdere causas,’ 
—lose the ends of living for the sake of life. 4, Stock, d, 
eet. ? “spent himself like a taper, consuming himself for th 
good of others.” 5. Preston, d. wt. 41, sacrificed his life t 
excessive zeal; he is quoted as an example of the saying 
that “men of great parts have no moderation.” He died 
an “old” man at the age of 41. 6. Herbert Palmer, d] 
zt. 46, after a short illness ; “ for, having spent much of hi: 
natural strength in the service of God, there was less wor! 
for sickness to do.” 7. Baily, d. et. 54, who was so holy 
and conscientious, “that if he had been at any time bu 
innocently pleasant in the company of his friends, it cos 
him afterwards some sad reflections” (preserve me fro 
the privilege of such companions !) ; lost his health early i 
life. 8. Clarke, d. st. 62, was too laborious, and had it     
    
    
    
    
     
     
  
-P-A-G-E-289
  DIVINES 259 
consequence a fever wt. 43, which extremely weakened 
his constitution. 9. Ulrich, d. zt. 48, had an “ill habit of 
body, contracted by a sedentary life and the overstraining 
of his voice in preaching.” 10. Isaac Watts, d. wt. 74, a 
proficient child, but not strong; fell very ill «t. 24, and 
again wt. 38, and from this he never recovered, but passed 
the rest of his life in congenial seclusion, an inmate of the 
house of Sir T. Abney, and afterwards of his widow. 11. 
Davies, d. wt. 37, a sprightly boy and keen rider; grew 
into a religious man of so sedentary a disposition, that after 
he was made President of Yale College in America, he took 
hardly any exercise. He was there killed by a simple cold, 
followed by some imprudence in sermon-writing, his vital 
powers being too low to support any physical strain. 12. 
T. Jones, d. wt. 32: “Before the Lord was pleased to call 
him, he was walking in the error of his ways ;” then he was 
afflicted “with a disorder that kept him very low and 
brought him to death’s door,, during all which time his 
erowth in grace was great and remarkable.” 
This concludes my list of those Divines, 26 in number, 
who were specially noted by Middleton as invalids. It will 
e seen that about one-half of them were infirm from the . 
rst, and that the other half became broken down early in 
ife. It must not be supposed that the remainder of the 
96 were invariably healthy men. These biographies dwell 
ittle on personal characteristics, and therefore their silence 
n the matter of health must not be interpreted as neces- 
arily meaning that the health was good. On the contrary, 
s I said before, there is an air as of the sick-room running 
hhrough the collection, but to a much less degree than in 
eligious biographies that I have elsewhere read. A gently 
complaining, and fatigued spirit, is that in which Evan- 
elical Divines are very apt to pass their days. 
It is curious how large a part of religious biographies is 
ommonly given up to the occurrences of the sick-room. 
We can easily understand why considerable space should be 
evoted to such matters, because it is on the death-bed 
shat the believer's sincerity is most surely tested ; but this 
is insufficient to account for all we find in Middleton and 
Isewhere. There is, I think, an actual pleasure shown by

most people. Rivet, a French divine, has strangulation o

The remedies attempted, each successive pang, and each 
corresponding religious ejaculation is recorded, and so the 
history of his bowel-attack is protracted through forty-fiv 
pages, which is as much space as is allotted to th 
entire biographies of four average Divines. Mede’s death 
and its cause, is described with equal minuteness, an 
with still more repulsive details, but in a less diffused form 
I have thus far shown that 26 Divines out of the 196 
or one-eighth part of them, were certainly invalids, and 
have laid much stress on the hypothesis that silence abou 
health does not mean healthiness; however, I can ad 
other reasons to corroborate my very strong impression 
that the Divines are, on the whole, an ailing body of men 
I can show that the number of persons mentioned as robus 
are disproportionately few, and I would claim a comparison 
between the numbers of the notably weak and the notably 
strong, rather than one between the notably weak and the 
rest of the 196. In professions where men are obliged t 
speak much in public, the constitutional vigour of those 
who succeed is commonly extraordinary. It would be 
impossible to read a collection of lives of eminent orators| 
lawyers, and the like, without being impressed with th 
largeness of the number of those who have constitutions o: 
iron; but this is not at all the case with. the Divines, fo 
Middleton speaks of only 12, or perhaps 18 men who wer 
remarkable for their vigour. 
Two very instructive facts appear in connexion with thes 
vigorous Divines: we find, on the one hand, that of the 1 
or 13 who were decidedly robust, 5, if not 6, were irregulaj 
and wild in their youth ; and, on the other hand, that onl 
3 or 4 Divines are stated to have been irregular in thei 
youth, who were not also men of notably robust consti 
tutions. | We are therefore compelled to conclude th: 
robustness of constitution is antagonistic, in a very marke 
degree, to an extremely pious disposition. 
First as to those who were both vigorous in constitutioi 
and wild in youth; they are 5 or 6 in number. 1. Bez

d, xt. 86 ; “was a robust man of very strong constitution, 
and what is very unusual among hard students, never felt 
the headache ;” he yielded as a youth to the allurements 
of pleasure, and wrote poems of a very licentious character. 
2. Welch, d. wt. 53; was of strong robust constitution and 
underwent a great deal of fatigue; in youth he was a 
border-thief. 3. Rothwell, d. «et. 64; was handsome, well 
set, of great strength of body and activity; he hunted, 
bowled, and shot ; he also poached a little. Though he was 
a clergyman he did not reform till late, and still the “devil 
assaulted him” much and long. He got on particularly 
well with his parishioners in a wild part of the north of 
England. 4, Grimshaw, @. at. 55; was only once sick for 
the space of sixteen years, though he “used his body with 
less consideration than a merciful man would use his 
beast.” He was educated religiously, but broke loose, et. . 
18, at Cambridge. At the age of 26, being then a swearing, 
drunken parson, he was partly converted, and et. 34 his 
“preaching began to be profitable ;” then followed twenty- 
one years of eminent usefulness. 5. Whitefield, d. wt. 56 ; 
had extraordinary activity, constantly preaching and con- 
stantly travelling. He had great constitutional powers, 
though, “from disease,” he grew corpulent after wt. 40, 
He was extremely irregular in early youth, drinking and 
pilfering (Stephen, “ Eccl. Biog.”). [6.] It is probable that 
Trosse ought to be added to this list. He will again be 
spoken of in the next category but one. 
Next, as to those who were vigorous in constitution but 
not irregular in youth; they are 7 in number. 1. Peter 
Martyr, d. wt. 62; a large healthy man of grave, sedate, 
and well-composed countenance. His parts and learning 
were very uncommon. 2. Mede, d. wt. 52; was a fine, 
handsome, dignified man. Middleton remarks that his 
vitals were strong, that he did not mind the cold, and that 
he had a sound mind in a sound body. He was a sceptic 
when a student at college, but not wild. 3. Bedell, d. wt. 
72; a tall, graceful, dignified man; a favourite even with 
Italian papists ; suffered no decay of his: natural powers 
till near his death. 4. Leighton, d. et. 70 of a sudden 
attack of pleurisy. He looked so fresh up to that time .
-P-A-G-E-292
262, DIVINES 
  
that age seemed to stand still with him. 5, Burkitt, d, 
zt. 53 of a malignant fever, but “his strength was such 
that he might have been expected to live till 80.” He 
was turned to religion when a boy, by an attack of small- 
pox. 6. Alix, d. wt. 76; had an uncommon share of 
health and spirits; he was a singularly amiable, capable, 
and popular man. 7. Harrison, d. et.?; a strong, robus 
man, full of flesh and blood; humble, devout, and o 
bright natural parts. This concludes the list. I have 
been surprised to find none of the type of Cromwell’s 
« Tronsides.” 
Lastly, as to those who were irregular in youth but 
who are not mentioned as being vigorous in constitution. 
They are 3 or 4 in number, according as Trosse is omitted 
or included. 1. William Perkyns, d. wt. 43; a “cheerful, 
pleasant man ;” was wild and a spendthrift at Cambridge, 
and not converted till wt. 24, 2. Bunyan ; vicious in youth, 
was converted in a wild, irregular way, and had many’ 
blackslidings throughout his career. 3. Trosse, d. at. 82. 
His biography is deficient in particulars about which one 
would like to be informed, but his long life, following a 
bad beginning, appears to be a sign of an unusually strong 
constitution, and to qualify him for insertion in my first 
category. He was sent to France to learn the language, and 
he learnt also every kind of French rascality. The same 
process was repeated in Portugal. The steps by which 
his character became remarkably changed are not recorded, 
neither are his personal characteristics. [4.] T. Jones, d. zt. 
32, has already been included among the invalids, having 
been wild in youth but rendered pious by serious and 
lingering ill-health. 
T now come to the relationships of the Divines. Recol- 
lecting that there are only 196 of them altogether, that’ 
they are selected from the whole of Protestant Europe at 
the average rate of 2men in 3 years, the following results 
are quite as remarkable as those met with in the other’ 
groups. 
17 out of the 196 are interrelated. Thus Simon Grynzeus| 
is uncle of Thomas, who is father of John James, and there 
are others of note in this remarkable family of peasant,

origin, Whitaker’s maternal uncle was Dr. Nowell. Robert 
Abbot, Bishop of Salisbury, is brother to Archbishop 
Abbot. Downe’s maternal uncle was Bishop Jewell. 
Dod’s grandson (daughter's son) was Bishop Wilkins. 
William Gouge was father of Thomas Gouge. Philip Henry 
was father to Matthew Henry. Ebenezer Erskine was 
brother to Ralph Erskine. 
There are 8 others who have remarkable relationships, 
mostly with religious people, namely :—Knox’s grandson 
(the son of a daughter who married John Welch) was 
Josiah Welch, “the cock of the conscience.” F. Junius 
had a son, also called Francis, a learned Oxonian ; by his 
daughter, who married J. G. Vossius, he had for grand- 
children, Dionysius and Isaac Vossius, famous for their 
learning. Donne was descended through his mother from 
Lord Chancellor Sir John More and Judge Rastall. Herbert 
was brother to Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and had other 
eminent and interesting relationships. Usher’s con- 
nexions are most remarkable, for his father, father’s 
brother, mother’s father, mother’s brother, and his own 
brother, were all very eminent men in their day. The 
mother’s brother of Lewis de Dieu was a professor at, 
Leyden. The father and grandfather of Mather were 
eminent ministers. The father and three brothers of 
Saurin were remarkably eloquent. 
It cannot be doubted from these facts that religious 
gifts are, on the whole, hereditary ; but there are curious 
exceptions to the rule. Middleton’s work must not be 
considered as free from omissions of these exceptional 
cases, for neither he nor any other biographer would 
conceive it to be his duty to write about a class of 
facts, which are important for us to obtain; namely, the 
cases in which the sons of religious parents turned out 
badly. I have only lighted on a single instance of this 
apparent perversion of the laws of heredity in the whole 
of Middleton’s work, namely that of Archbishop Matthew, 
but it is often said that such cases are not uncommon, 
I rely mostly for my belief in their existence, upon 
social experiences of modern date, which could not be 
published without giving pain to innocent individuals, 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
    264 DIVINES 
Those of which I know with certainty are not numerous, 
but are sufficient to convince me of there being a real 
foundation for the popular notion. The notoriety of some 
recent cases will, I trust, satisfy the reader, and absolve me 
from entering any further into details. 
The summary of the results concerning the Divines, to 
which I have thus far arrived, is: That they are not 
founders of families who have exercised a notable influence 
on our history, whether that influence be derived from the 
abilities, wealth, or social position of any of their members. 
That they are a moderately prolific race, rather under, 
than above the average. That their average age at death 
is a trifle less than that of the eminent men comprised 
in my other groups. That they commonly suffer from 
over-work. That they have usually wretched constitutions. 
That those whose constitutions were vigorous, were mostly 
wild in their youth ; and conversely, that most of those who 
had been wild in their youth and did not become pious till 
later in life, were men of vigorous constitutions, That 
a pious disposition is decidedly hereditary. That there 
are also frequent cases of sons of pious parents who turned 
out very badly ; but I shall have something to say on what 
appears to me to be the reason for this. 
I therefore see no reason to believe that the Divines are 
an exceptionally favoured race in any respect; but rather, 
that they are less fortunate than other men. 
I now annex my usual tables.

  A comparison of the relative influences of the male and 
female lines of descent, is made in the following table :—

This table shows that the influence of the female line 
has an unusually large effect in qualifying a man _ to 
become eminent in the religious world. The only other 
group in which the influence of the female line is even 
comparable in its magnitude, is that of scientific men ; and 
I believe the reasons laid down when speaking of them, 
will apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Divines. It requires 
unusual qualifications, and some of them of a feminine 
cast, to become a leading theologian. A man must not 
only have appropriate abilities, and zeal, and power of 
work, but the postulates of the creed that he professes 
must be so firmly ingrained into his mind, as to be the 
equivalents of axioms. The diversities of creeds held by 
earnest, good, and conscientious men, show to a candid 
looker-on, that there can be no certainty as to any point 
on which many of such men think differently. But a 
divine must not accept this view ; he ‘must be convinced 
of the absolute security of the groundwork of his peculiar 
faith,—a blind conviction which can best be obtained 
through maternal teachings in the years of childhood. 
I will now endeavour to account for the fact, which Iam_ 
compelled to acknowledge, that the children of very reli- 
gious parents occasionally turn out extremely badly. It 
is a fact that has all the appearance of being a serious 
violation of the law of heredity, and, as such, has caused 
me more hesitation and difficulty than I have felt about 
any other part of my inquiry. However, I am perfectly 
satisfied that this apparent anomaly is entirely explained 
by what I am about to lay before the reader, premising 
that it obliges me to enter into a more free and thorough 
analysis of the religious character than would otherwise 
have been suitable to these pages. 
The disposition that qualifies a man to attain a place 
in a collection like that of the “Biographia Evangelica,” 
can best be studied by comparing it with one that, while 
it contrasts with it in essentials, closely resembles it in all 
unimportant respects. Thus, we may exclude from our  
-P-A-G-E-297
  
DIVINES 267 
  
comparison all except those whose average moral dispositions 
are elevated some grades above those of men generally; 
and we may also exclude all except such as think very 
earnestly, reverently, and conscientiously upon religious 
matters. The remainder range in their views, and, for the 
most part, in the natural disposition that inclines them to 
adopt those views, from the extremest piety to the ex- 
tremest scepticism. The “ Biographia Evangelica” affords 
many instances that approach to the former ideal, and 
we may easily select from history men who have ap- 
proached to the latter. In order to contrast, and so 
understand the nature of the differences between the two 
ideal extremes, we must lay aside for a while our own 
religious predilections—whatever they may be—and place 
ourselves resolutely on a point equidistant from both, 
whence we can survey them alternately with an equal eye. 
Let us then begin, clearly understanding that we are 
supposing both the sceptic and the religious man to be 
equally earnest, virtuous, temperate, and affectionate— 
both perfectly convinced of the truth of their respective 
tenets, and both finding moral content in such conclusions 
as those tenets imply. 
The religious man affirms, that he is conscious of an in- 
dwelling Spirit of grace, that consoles, guides, and dictates, 
and that he could not stand if it were taken away from 
him. It renders easy the trials of his life,and calms the 
dread that would otherwise be occasioned by the prospect 
of death. It gives directions and inspires motives, and 
it speaks through the voice of the conscience, as an oracle, 
upon what is right and what is wrong. He will add, 
that the presence of this Spirit of grace is a matter that 
no argument or theory is capable of explaining away, 
inasmuch as the conviction of its presence is fundamental 
in his nature, and the signs of its action are as unmistake- 
able as those of any other actions, made known to us 
through the medium of the senses. The religious man 
would further dwell on the moral doctrine of the form of 
creed that he professes ; but this we must eliminate from 
the discussion, because the moral doctrines of the different 
forms of creed are exceedingly diverse, some tending to  
-P-A-G-E-298
  268 DIVINES 
  
self-culture and asceticism, and others to active benevo- 
lence ; while we are seeking to find the nature of a religious 
disposition, so far as it is common to all creeds. 
The sceptic takes a position antagonistic to that which 
I have described, as appertaining to the religious man, 
He acknowledges the sense of an indwelling Spirit, which 
possibly he may assert to have himself experienced in its 
full intensity, but he denies its objectivity. He argues that, 
as it is everywhere acknowledged to be a fit question for 
the intellect to decide whether other convictions, however 
fundamental, are really true, or whether the evidences of 
the senses are,in any given case, to be depended on, so 
it is perfectly legitimate to submit religious convictions to 
a similar analysis. He will say that a floating speck in 
the vision, and a ringing in the ears, are capable of being 
discriminated by the intellect from the effects of external 
influences ; that in lands where mirage is common, the expe- 
rienced traveller has to decide on the truth of the appear- 
ance of water, by the circumstances of each particular case. 
And as to fundamental convictions, he will add, that it is 
well known the intellect can successfully grapple with them, 
for Kant and his followers have shown reasons—to which 
all metaphysicians ascribe weight—that Time and Space 
are, neither of them, objective realities, but only forms, 
under which our minds, by virtue of their own constitution, 
are compelled to act. The sceptic, therefore, claiming to 
bring the question of the objective existence of the Spirit 
of grace under intellectual examination, has decided— 
whether rightly or not has nothing to do with our in- 
quiries—that it is subjective, not objective. He argues 
that it is not self-consistent in its action, inasmuch as it 
prompts different people in different ways, and the same 
person in different ways at different times; that there is 
.no sharp demarcation between the promptings that are 
avowedly natural, and those that are considered super- 
natural ; lastly, that convictions of right and wrong are 
misleading, inasmuch as a person who indulges in them, 
without check from the reason, becomes a blind partisan, 
and partisans on hostile sides feel them in equal strength. 
As to the sense of consolation, derived from the creature
-P-A-G-E-299
DIVINES 269 
  
of a fond imagination, he will point to the experiences of 
the nursery, where the girl tells all its griefs to its doll, 
converses with it, takes counsel with it, and is consoled by 
it, putting unconsciously her own words into the mouth of . 
the doll. For these and similar reasons, which it is only 
necessary for me to state and not to weigh, the thorough- 
going ideal sceptic deliberately crushes those very 
sentiments and convictions which the religious man 
prizes above all things. He pronounces them to be idols 
created by the imagination, and therefore to be equally 
abhorred with idols made by the hands, of grosser material. 
Thus far, we have only pointed out an intellectual 
difference—a matter of no direct service in itself, in solving 
the question on which we are engaged, but of the utmost 
importance when the sceptic and religious man are sup- 
posed to rest contentedly in their separate conclusions. 
In order that a man may be. a contented sceptic of the 
most extreme type, he must have confidence in himself, 
that he is qualified to stand absolutely alone in the pre- 
sence of the severest trials of life, and of the terrors of 
impending death. His nature must have sufficient self- 
assertion and stoicism to make him believe that he can 
act the whole of his part upon earth without assistance. 
This is the ideal form of the most extreme scepticism, to 
which some few may nearly approach, but it is question- 
able if any have ever reached. On the other hand, the 
support of a stronger arm, and of a consoling voice, are 
absolute necessities to a man who has a religious dispo- 
sition, He is conscious of an incongruity in his nature, 
and of an instability in his disposition, and he knows his 
insufficiency to help himself. But all humanity is more 
or less subject to these feelings, especially in sickness, in 
youth, and in old age, and women are more affected by 
them than men. The most vigorous are conscious of 
secret weaknesses and failings, which give them, often in 
direct proportion to their intellectual stoicism,.agonies of 
self-distrust. But in the extreme and ideal form which 
we are supposing, the incongruity and instability would 
be extreme; he would not be fit to be a freeman, for 
he could not exist without a confessor and a master. Here, 
   
-P-A-G-E-300
  270 DIVINES 
  
then, is a broad distinction between the natural dispo- 
sitions of the two classes of men, The man of religious 
constitution considers the contented sceptic to be fool- 
hardy and sure to fail miserably; the sceptic considers 
the man of an extremely pious disposition to be slavish 
and inclined to superstition. 
It is sometimes said, that a conviction of sin is a 
characteristic of, a religious disposition; I think, how- 
ever, the strong sense of sinfulness in a Christian, to be 
partly due to the doctrines of his intellectual creed. The 
sceptic, equally with the religious man, would feel disgust 
and. shame at his miserable weakness in having done 
yesterday, in the heat of some impulse, things which 
to-day, in his calm moments, he disapproves. He is 
sensible that if another person had done the same thing, 
he would have shunned him; so he similarly shuns the 
contemplation of his own self. He feels he has done that 
which makes him unworthy of the society of pure-minded 
men ; that he is a disguised pariah, who would deserve to 
be driven out with indignation, if his recent acts and real 
character were suddenly disclosed. The Christian feels all 
this, and something more. He feels he has committed 
his faults in the full sight of a pure God; that he acts 
ungratefully and cruelly to a Being full of love and com- 
passion, who died as a sacrifice for sins like those he 
has just committed. These considerations add extreme 
poignancy to the sense of sin, but it must be recollected 
that they depend upon no difference of character. If the 
sceptic held the same intellectual creed, he would feel 
them in precisely the same way as the religious man. 
It is not necessarily dulness of heart that keeps him — 
back. 
It is also sometimes believed that Puritanic ways are 
associated with strong religious professions; but a 
Puritan tendency is by no means an essential part of a 
religious disposition. The Puritan’s character is joyless 
and morose; he is most happy, or, to speak less para- 
doxically, most at peace with himself when sad. It is 
a mental condition correlated with the well-known 
Puritan features, black straight hair, hollowed cheeks, and
-P-A-G-E-301
DIVINES 271 
  
sallow complexion. A bright, blue-eyed,. rosy-cheeked, 
curly-headed youth would seem an anomaly in a 
Puritanical assembly. But there are many Divines 
mentioned in Middleton, whose character was most sunny 
and joyful, and whose society was dearly prized, showing 
distinctly that the Puritan type is a speciality, and by no 
means an invariable ingredient in the constitution of men 
who are naturally inclined to piety. 
The result of all these considerations is to show that 
the chief peculiarity in the moral nature of the pious man 
is its conscious instability. He is liable to extremes 
—now swinging forwards into regions of enthusiasm, 
adoration, and self-sacrifice; now backwards into those of 
sensuality and selfishness. Very devout people are apt to 
style themselves the most miserable of sinners, and I 
think they may be taken to a considerable extent at their 
word. It would appear that their disposition is to sin 
more frequently and to repent more fervently than 
those whose constitutions are stoical, and therefore of 
a more symmetrical and orderly character. The am- 
plitude of the moral oscillations of religious men is greater 
than that of others whose average moral position is the 
same, 
The table (p. 30) of the distribution of natural gifts is¥ 
necessarily as true of morals as of intellect or of muscle. 
If we class a vast number of men into fourteen classes, 
separated by equal grades of morality as regards their 
natural disposition, the number of men per million in the 
different classes will be as stated in the table. I have no 
doubt that many of Middleton’s Divines belong to class G, 
in respect to their active benevolence, unselfishness, and 
other amiable qualities. But men of the lowest grades of 
morals may also have pious aptitudes; thus among 
prisoners, the best attendants on religious worship are 
often the worst criminals. I do not, however, think it is 
always an act of conscious hypocrisy in bad men when 
they make pious professions, but rather that they are 
deeply conscious of the instability of their characters, 
and that they fly to devotion as a resource and 
consolation,  
-P-A-G-E-302
  272 DIVINES 
These views will, I think, explain the apparent 
anomaly why the children of extremely pious parents 
occasionally turn out very badly. The parents are 
naturally gifted with high moral characters combined] 
with instability of disposition, but these peculiarities are 
in no way correlated. It must, therefore, often happen| 
that the child will inherit the one and not the other. I 
his heritage consist of the moral gifts without great in- 
stability, he will not feel the need of extreme piety; 
if he inherits great instability without morality, he will] 
be very likely to disgrace his name.

APPENDIX TO DIVINES 
(BIOGRAPHIA EVANGELICA.) 
Selected from the 196 names contained in Middleton’s Biographia 
Evangelica. An * means that the name to which it is attached appears 
also in the alphabetical list; that, in short, it is one of Middleton’s 196 
selections. 
Abbot, George, Archbp. of Canterbury (1562—1633, wt. 71). 
Educated at Guildford Grammar School, then at Balliol 
College : became a celebrated preacher. Att. 35 elected 
Master of University College, when the differences first 
began between him and Laud ; these subsisted as long 
as they lived, Abbot being Calvinist and Laud High 
Church. Made Bishop of Lichfield wt. 45; then of 
London ; and, xt. 49, Archbishop of Canterbury. He 
had great influence in the affairs of the time, but was 
too unyielding and too liberal to succeed as a courtier ; 
besides this, Laud’s influence was ever against him. 
He had great natural parts, considerable learning, 
charity, and public spirit. His parents were pious ; his 
father was a weaver. 
B. Robert Abbot,* Bishop of Salisbury. See below. 
B. Maurice, Lord Mayor of London and M.P. 
[N.] George, son of Maurice, wrote on the Book of Job. 
bbot, Robert, Bishop of Salisbury (1560—1617, wt. 57). 
His preferment was remarkably owing to his merit, 
particularly in preaching. King James I. highly 
esteemed him for his writings. Ait. 49 he was elected 
Master of Balliol College, which throve under his care. 
Three years afterwards he was made professor of 
Divinity, and wt. 55 Bishop of Salisbury. Died two 
T
-P-A-G-E-304
  274 DIVINES 
  
years later through gout and stone brought on by his 
sedentary life. In contrasting his character with that 
of his younger brother, the Archbishop, it was said, 
“ George was the more plausible preacher, Robert the 
greater scholar: gravity did frown in George and smile 
in Robert.” 
B. George Abbot,* Archbishop of Canterbury. See above. 
B. Maurice, Lord Mayor of London and M.P. 
[N. «| George, son of Maurice, wrote on Job. 
Clarke, Matthew (1664—1726, wt. 62); an eminent minister 
among the Dissenters. An exceedingly laborions man, 
who quite overtasked his powers. 
¥, Also Matthew Clarke, a man of learning, He spoke 
Italian and French with uncommon perfection. Was 
ejected from the ministry by the Uniformity Act. Dr, 
Watts wrote the epitaph of Matthew Clarke, junior, 
which begins with “a son bearing the name of his 
venerable father, nor less venerable himself.” 
Dieu, Lewis de (1590— ?). ‘In practical godliness and the 
knowledge of divinity, science of all kinds, and the 
languages, he was truly a star of the first magnitude.” 
Married, and had eleven children. 
F. Daniel de Dieu, minister of Flushing, a man of great! 
merit. He was uncommonly versed in the Oriental] 
languages, “and could preach with applause in German, 
Italian, French, and English.” 
u. David Colonius, professor at Leyden. 
Dod, John (1547—1645, wt. 98). This justly famous and 
reverend man was the youngest of seventeen children. 
Educated at Cambridge. He wasa great and continual 
preacher, eminent for the frequency, aptness, freeness, 
and largeness of his godly discourse ; very unworldly ; 
given to hospitality. He married twice, each time toa 
pious woman. 
p. John Wilkins,* D.D., Bishop of Chester (1614—-1672, eet 
58), a learned and ingenious prelate. Educated av 
Oxford, where he was very successful, and where, xt. 
34, he was made Warden of Wadham College by the| 
Committee of Parliament appointed for reforming the 
University. Married Robina, widow of P. French and| 
sister of Oliver Cromwell, who made him Master of 
Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he was ejected by] 
Charles II. Aut. 54 he was made Bishop of Chester,
-P-A-G-E-305
  DIVINES 275 
  
He was indefatigable in study, and tolerant of the 
opinions of others. He was an astronomer and 
experimentalist of considerable merit, and took an 
active part in the foundation of the Royal Society. 
I know nothing of his descendants, nor even if he had 
any. The Cromwell blood had less influence than 
might have been expected (see CRomwELL). A daughter 
of Robina Cromwell, by her first husband, married 
Archbishop Tillotson, and left issue, but undis- 
tinguished. 
Donne, John, D.D., Dean of St. Paul’s (1573—1631, wt. 58). 
“He was rather born wise than made so by study.” 
He is the subject of one of Isaac Walton’s biographies. 
The recreations of his youth were poetry ; the latter 
part of his life was a continual study. He early 
thought out his religion for himself, being thoroughly 
converted from Papacy through his own inquiries ext. 
20. His mind was liberal and unwearied in the search 
of knowledge. His life was holy and his death 
exemplary. 
[gU.]? Sir Thomas More, the Lord Chancellor, from whose 
family he was descended through his mother. Sir 
Thomas being born ninety-three years before him was, 
I presume, his great-grandfather or great-great-uncle. 
g.t William Rasiall, the worthy and laborious judge who 
abridged the statues of the kingdom. — Rastall was a 
generation younger than Sir Thomas More, and was 
therefore probably a grandfather or great-uncle of Dr. 
Donne. 
gF.? John Rastall, father of the judge, printer and author. 
Downe, John, B.D. See under JEwELL. 
u. John Jewell,* Bishop of Salisbury. 
Erskine, Ebenezer (about 1680—1754, wt. 74) ; originator of 
the Scottish secession. This pious minister preached 
freely against the proceedings of the Synod of Perth, 
for which he was reprimanded, and afterwards, owing 
to his continued contumacy, he was expelled from the 
Scottish Church. Hence the famous Secession. 
B. Ralph Erskine.* See below. 
Erskine, Ralph (1685—1752, wt. 67) ; also became a seceder. 
He did not simply follow his brother, but raised a 
separate religious tempest against himself. He wrote 
controversial tracts, was a strict Calvinist, and published 
m2   
    
-P-A-G-E-306
276 DIVINES 
     
sonnets that “breathe a warm spirit of piety, though 
they cannot be mentioned as finished poetical composi- 
tions.” He laboured in preaching and writing till 
almost the time of his death. He left a large family 
(bis father was one of thirty-three children), of whom 
three sons were ministers of the Secession, but died in

Evans, John, D.D. (1680—1730, wt. 50). His vivacity,

and, excepting one interruption, quite up to the Refor- 
mation: say six generations in all. 
  Gilpin, Bernard (1517—1583, wt. 66) ; the “ Apostle of the 
North.” Was one: of several children. He showed 
extraordinary genius in childhood, and an early dis- 
position to seriousness and contemplative life; but as 
he grew older he became practical and energetic, and 
none the less pious. He was greatly beloved. In 
beginning his career he suffered from religious per- 
secution, and if Queen Mary had lived a little longer, 
there is little doubt but that he would have. been 
martyred. He remained rector of Houghton during the 
whole of his later life, refusing a bishopric. He built 
a school, and picked up intelligent boys and educated 
them, and became their friend and guardian in after-life. 
He had extraordinary influence over the wild border- 
people of his neighbourhood, going fearlessly among 
them. He was affluent and generous; a hater of 
slander and a composer of differences, He was tall and 
slender, careless of amusement, and rather abstemious. 
Was unmarried. His relationships are good, but distant.

in London, for twenty-four years. He originated the 
scheme. which he carried on for a while with his own 
funds. of finding employment for the poor by flax-spin- 
ing, instead of giving them alms as beggars ; others 
afterwards developed the idea. He had a good fortune 
of his own, and finally applied almost the whole of it to 
charity in Wales, judging there was more occasion for 
help there than elsewhere. He contrived, with the 
further aid of subscriptions, to educate yearly from 800 
to 1,000 poor Welsh children, and to procure and print 
a translation of the Bible into Welsh. Also, he took 
great pains with Christ’s Hospital in London. He was 
humble and meek, and free from affected gravity and 
moroseness. His conversation was affable and pleasant ; 
he had wonderful serenity of mind and evenness of 
temper, visible in his countenance ; he was hardly ever 
merry, but never melancholy nor sad. He seemed 
always the same ; ever obliging, and ever tolerant of 
difference of opinion.

He was subsequently professor at Heidelberg, and 
thence retired to Basle as pastor. He used to be at

tempered with gravity. His remarkable learning and 
worth was well appreciated by his contemporaries ; and 
travellers from all parts, who had any concern for

with some observation of what he read. He was very 
devoutly inclined. His father spared no pains to edu-

great—first at Chester, and then at Hackney. He

went through the female line), “and tho soundness of

few men attain them single, in that degree he had them 
all. His skill in languages was extraordinary.” He 
was very temperate and grave, but sociable and cour- 
teous, and a thoroughly good man and divine. His

character.

which he became a Fellow, and where he “ grew very 
famous for piety and learning, and for his zeal in pro- 
moting the Reformation.” On Queen Mary’s accession 
he was marked out for Popish persecution, so he fled to 
Frankfort, whence he returned after her death, the 
first of the English exiles. He soon after ob- 
tained many and considerable preferments, and was 
made Dean of St. Paul’s wt. 49; then Rector of Had- 
ham in Yorkshire, where he became a frequent and 
painful preacher and a zealous writer. Aut. 84 he was 
elected Principal of Brasenose College, where, having 
enjoyed for a further term of six years the perfect use 
of his senses and faculties, he died. He was reckoned 
a very learned man and an excellent divine. His 
charity to the poor was great, especially if they had 
anything of the scholar in them; and his comfort to 
the afflicted either in body or mind was equally exten- 
sive. He wrote many religious works, especially 
a Catechism, which was highly esteemed, and which he 
was induced to write, by Cecil and other great men of 
the nation, on purpose to stop a clamour raised among 
the Roman Catholics, that the Protestants had no 
principles. His controversies were entirely with the 
Papists. He was so fond of fishing that his picture at 
Brasenose represents him surrounded with tackle.

young, and filled the chair with the greatest credit. 
Then he became a diligent student of religious writers 
and in a few years went thr ough almost all the Fathers 
of the Church. He laboured with incredible applica-

James Usher was, therefore, a remarkable instance of 
hereditary ability associated with constitutional vigour, 
and apparently of a durable type. Unluckily for the

therefore all that I said about the severity of the 
election implied by the latter degree (see pp. 15-20) is 
trictly applicable to the former. I have chosen the 
enior Classics for the subject of this chapter rather 
han the Senior Wranglers, for the reasons explained in 
. 190. 
The Classical Tripos was established in the year 1824. 
‘here have, therefore, been forty-six lists between that 
ime and the year 1869, both inclusive. In nine cases out 
f these, two or more names were bracketed together at 
e head of the list as equal in merit, leaving thirty-six 
lases of men who were distinctly the first classics of 
reir _several years. Their names are as follow :— 
Malkin, Isaacson, Stratton, Kennedy, Selwyn, Soames, 
ordsworth, Kennedy, Lushington, Bunbury, Kennedy, 
‘oulbwrn, Osborne, Humphry, Freeman, Cope, Denman, 
aine, Lushington, Elwyn, Perowne, Lightfoot, Roby, 
Tawkins, Butler, Brown, Clark, Sidgwick, Abbott, Jebb, 
ilson, Moss, Whitelaw, Smith, Sandys, Kennedy. 
It will be observed that the name of Kennedy occurs no 
ss than four times, and that of Lushington twice, in this 
ort series. I will give the genealogies of these, and of a 
w others of which I have particulars, and which I have 
alicised in the above list, begging it at the same time 
be understood that I do not mean to say that many

of the cantante may not also be distinguished for the 
eminence of their kinsmen; I have not cared to mak« 
extensive and minute inquiries, because the following list 
is amply sufficient for my purpose. It is obvious that the 
descending relationships must be generally deficient, since 
the oldest of all the Senior Classics took his degree im 
1824, and would therefore be only about sixty-seven at 
the present time. For the most part the sons have yet 
to be proved and the grandsons to be born. 
There is no case in my list of only a single eminent 
relationship. There are four, namely Denman, Goulburn, 
Selwyn, and Sidgwick, of only two or three; all the 
others have four or upwards.

I PROPOSE to supplement what I have written about brain 
by two short chapters on muscle. CNo one doubts that 
muscle is hereditary in horses and dogs, but humankind 
are so blind to facts and so governed by preconceptions, 
that I have heard it frequently asserted that muscle is 
not hereditary in men. Oarsmen and wrestlers have 
maintained that their heroes spring up capriciously, so 
I have thought it advisable to make inquiries into the 
matter. The results I have obtained will beat down 
another place of refuge for those who insist that each 
man is an independent creation, and not a mere function, 
physically, morally, and intellectually, of ancestral quali- 
ties and external influences. _ 
In respect to Oarsmen, let me assure the reader that 
they are no insignificant fraction of the community,—no 
mere waifs and strays from those who follow more civilized 
pursuits. A perfect passion for rowing pervades large 
classes. At Newcastle, when a great race takes place, all 
business is at a standstill, factories are closed, shops are 
shut, and offices deserted. The number of men who fall 
within the attraction of the career is very great ; and there 
can be no doubt that a large proportion of those among 
them who are qualified to succeed brilliantly, obey the 
attraction and pursue it. 
For the information in this and the following chapters, 
I am entirely indebted to the kind inquiries made for me 
by Mr. Robert Spence Watson of Newcastle, whose local 
knowledge is very considerable, and whose sympathies with 
athletic amusements are strong. Mr, Watson put himself
-P-A-G-E-327
  OARSMEN 297 
  
nto continual communication with one of the highest, 
believe by far the highest, authority on boating matters, 
, person who had reported nearly every boating race to 
he newspapers for the last quarter of a century. 
The list in the Appendix to this chapter includes the 
1ames of nearly all the rowing men of note who have 
igured upon the Tyne during the past six-and-twenty 
rears. It also includes some of the rowers on the Thames, 
yut_ the information about these is not so certain. The 
1ames are not picked and chosen, but the best men have 
een taken of whom any certain knowledge could be 
btained. 
It is not easy to classify the rowers, especially as many 
f the men have rarely, if ever, pulled in skiff matches, but 
ormed part of crews in pair-oared, four-oared, or six- 
ared matches. Their performances have, however, been 
arefully examined and criticised by Mr. Watson and his 
issessor, who have divided them into four classes. 
I have marked the names of the lowest with brackets 
], and have attached to them the phrase “moderately 
ood.” These are men who have either disappointed 
xpectations founded on early promise, or have not rowed 
ften enough to show of what feats they are really 
lapable. No complete failure is included. Few amateurs 
nm cope with men of this class, notwithstanding the 
ediocrity of their abilities when judged by a professional 
andard. 
The next ascending grade is also distinguished by 
rackets [ ], but no qualifying expression is added to their 
ames, ‘They consist of the steady, reliable men who 
rm good racing crews. 
The two superior grades contain the men whose names 
re printed without brackets—whom, in short, I treat as 
ing “eminently gifted.” In order to make a distinction 
tween the two grades, I add to the names of the men 
ho belong to the higher of them, the phrase “very 
cellent oarsmen.” 
It is not possible to do more than give a rough notion 
the places into which these four grades would respec- 
ely fall in my table (p. 30) of natural gifts. I have
-P-A-G-E-328
298 OARSMEN 
only two data to help me. The first is, that I am ix 
formed that in the early part of 1868, the Tyne Amateu 
Rowing Club, which is the most important institution « 
that kind in the north of England, had been fifteen yeas 
in existence and had comprised, in all, 377 members ; the 
three of these, as judged by amateur standards of com 
parison, had been considered of surpassing excellence « 
skiff-rowers, and that the best of these three was looke 
upon as equal to, or perhaps a trifle better than, the leas 
gvod of the brothers Matfin, who barely ranks as a 
“excellent” rower. 
The other datum is the deliberate opinion of th 
authorities to whom I am indebted for the materials « 
this chapter, that not 1 man in 10 will succeed as a rowe 
even of the lower of the two grades whose names ar 
marked in my Appendix by brackets, and that not 1 i 
100 rowers attains to excellence. Hence the minimur 
qualification for excellence is possessed by only 1 ma 
in 1,000. 
There is a rough accordance between these two dats 
A rowing club consists in part of naturally selected mer 
They are not men, all of whom have been taken at hap 
hazard as regards their powers of rowing. <A large par 
are undoubtedly mere conscripts from the race of clubabl 
men, but there must always be a considerable numb 
who would not have joined the club save for their cor 
sciousness of possessing gifts and tastes that special] 
qualified them for success on the water. To be the be: 
oarsman of the 377 men who are comprised in a cra¢ 
rowing club, means much more than to be the best 
377 men taken at haphazard. It would be much near 
the truth to say, that it means being the best of all wh 
might have joined the club, had they been so inclin 
and had appeared desirable members. Upon the 
grounds (see also my remarks in p. 10) it isa ve 
moderate estimate to conclude that the qualifications fi 
excellence as an oarsman, are only possessed by 1 mi 
in 1,000. 
The “very excellent” oarsmen imply, I presume, 
much more rigorous selection, but T really have no da 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
OARSMEN 299 
  
hhatever on which to found an estimate. Many men who 
bund they could attain no higher rank than “ excellence,” 
yould abandon the unprofitable pursuit of match rowing 
br more regular and, as some would say, creditable occu- 
ations. We shall not be more than half a grade wrong 
we consider the “ excellent” oarsmen to rank in at least 
lass F of natural gifts, with respect to rowing ability, and 
he “very excellent” to fall well within it. 
I do not propose to take any pains in analysing these 
elationships, for the data are inadequate. Rowing was 
omparatively little practised in previous generations, so 
ye cannot expect to meet with evidence of ancestral 
eculiarities among the oarsmen. Again, the successful 
wers are mostly single men, and some of the best have 
o children. It is important, in respect to this, to recollect 
. frequent trainings they have gone through. Mr. 
Vatson mentions to me one well-known man, who has 
po for an enormous number of races, and during the 
me of each training was most abstemious and in amazing 
ealth; then, after each trial was over, he commonly gave 
ray, and without committing any great excess, remained 
or weeks in a state of fuddle. This is too often the 
istory of these men. 
There are in the Appendix only three families, each 
ontaining more than one excellent oarsman; they are 
‘lasper, Matfin, and Taylor, and the total relationships 
xisting towards the ablest member of each family are, 
Band 158. 
There appears to be no intermarriage, except in the one 
ase that is mentioned, between the families of the 
ywers ; indeed there is much jealousy between the rival 
umilies.

Clasper, Henry; very excellent oarsman. Is the mos 
prominent member of a large and most remarkabl 
family of oarsmen. He was for many years stroke 
a four-oared crew, and frequently the whole crey 
including the coxswain, were members of the Claspe 
family. For eight years this crew won the champio: 
ship of the Tyne. Six times Henry Clasper pulle 
stroke for the crew winning the championship of th| 
Thames, and Coombes declared that he was the be 
stroke that ever pulled. Up to the year 1859, when hi 
was 47 years old, he had pulled stroke 78 times i 
pair or four-oared matches, and his crew had been 5 
times victorious. He had also pulled in 32. ski 
matches and won 20 of them, and had been champio 
of Scotland upon the only two occasions on whic: 
he contested for it. Nearly all these matches wer 
over a 4 or 4} mile course. He invented the ligh 
outrigger, and has been a very successful builder 
racing boats.

WRESTLERS OF THE NORTH 
COUNTRY 
I Am wholly indebted for the information contained in 
this chapter, as I was for that in the last, to Mr. Robert 
Spence Watson. With the assistance of a well-informed 
champion wrestler, that gentleman has examined into 
the history of those of the 172 men of whom anything 
could be learnt, who were either first or second at Carlisle 
lor Newcastle since the establishment of the champion- 
ship at those places; at the first, in 1809, and at the 
second, in 1839. 
It is exceedingly difficult to estimate the performances 
lof the ancestors of the present generation, because there 
were scarcely any prizes in former days; matches were 
then made simply for honour. We must not expect to 
be able to trace ancestral gifts among the wrestlers 
to a greater degree than among the oarsmen. 
I should add, that I made several attempts to obtain 
information on wrestling families in the Lake districts of 
Westmoreland and Cumberland, but entirely without 
success; no records seém to have been kept of the yearly 
meetings at Keswick and Bowness, and the wrestling deeds 
of past years have fallen out of mind. 
There are eighteen families in my Appendix, containing 
between them forty-six wrestlers, and the relationships 
existing towards the ablest wrestler of the family are

COMPARISON OF RESULTS 
Let us now bring our scattered results side to side, for 
the purpose of comparison, and judge of the extent 
to which they corroborate one another,—how far they 
confirm the provisional calculations made in the chapter 
lon JUDGES from more scanty data, and where and why 
hey contrast. 
The number of cases of hereditary genius analysed in 
the several chapters of my book, amounts to a large total. 
have dealt with no less than 300 families containing 
etween them nearly 1,000 eminent men, of whom 415 
re illustrious, or, at all events, of such note as to deserve 
eing printed in black type at the head of a paragraph 
f there be such a thing as a decided law of distribution 
f genius in families, it is sure to become manifest when 
we deal statistically with so large a body of examples. 
In comparing the results obtained from the different 
oups of eminent men, it will be our most convenient 
‘course to compare the columns B of the several tables. 
‘column B gives the number of eminent kinsmen in various 
egrees on the supposition that the number of families in 
he group to which it refers is 100. All the entries under 
have therefore the same common measure, they are all 
ercentages, and admit of direct intercomparison. I hope 
have made myself quite clear: lest there should remain 
ny misapprehension, it is better to give an example. 
hus, the families of Divines are only 25 in number, 
md in those 25 families there are 7 eminent fathers, 
brothers, and 10 sons; now in order to raise these

numbers to percentages, 7, 9, and 10 must be multiplied 
by the number of times that 25 goes into 100, namely 
by 4. They will then become 28, 36, and 40, and will

numbers 7, 9, 10, appearing in the same table in the

isa column B calculated from the whole of the families 
put together, with the intention of giving a general 
average ; and I have further attached to it its appropriate 
columns C and D, not so much for particular use in 
this chapter as for the convenience of the reader who may 
wish to make comparisons with the other tables, from the 
different point of view which D affords. 
The general uniformity in the distribution of ability 
among the kinsmen in the different groups, is strikingly 
manifest. The eminent sons are almost invariably more 
numerous than the eminent brothers, and these are 
a trifle more numerous than the eminent fathers. On 
proceeding further down the table, we come to a sudden 
dropping off of the numbers at the second grade of kin- 
ship, namely, at the grandfathers, uncles, nephews, and 
grandsons: this diminution is conspicuous in the entries 
im column D, the meaning of which has already been 
fully described in pp. 71-74. On reaching the third 
lerade of kinship, another abrupt dropping off in numbers 
is again met with, but the first cousins are found to 
ccupy a decidedly better position than other relations 
within the third grade. 
We further observe, that while the proportionate abun- 
ance of eminent kinsmen in the various grades is closely 
imilar in all the groups, the proportions deduced from the 
mtire body of illustrious men, 415 in number, coincide 
ith peculiar general accuracy with those we obtained 
rom the large subdivision of 109 Judges. There cannot, 
herefore, remain a doubt as to the existence of a law 
f distribution of ability in families, or that it is pretty 
ccurately expressed by the figures in column B, under 
the heading of “eminent men of all classes.” I do not, 
however, think it worth while to submit a diagram like 
hat in p. 74, derived from the column D in the last 
able, because little dependence can be placed on the 
mtries in C by the help of which that column had to be 
alculated. When I began my inquiries, I did indeed try 
o obtain real and not estimated data for C, by inquiring 
nto the total numbers of kinsmen in each degree, of every 
Illustrious man, as well as of those who achieved eminence,

810 COMPARISON OF RESULTS 
  
I wearied myself for a long time with searching bio- 
graphies, but finding the results very disproportionate to 
the labour, and continually open to doubt after they had 
been obtained, I gave up the task, and resigned myself to 
the rough but ready method of estimated averages, 
It is earnestly to be desired that breeders of animals 
would furnish tables, like mine, on the distribution of 
different marked physical qualities im families. The 
results would be far more than mere matters of curiosity ; 
they would afford constants for formule by which, as I shall 
briefly show in a subsequent chapter, the laws of heredity, 
as they are now understood, may admit of being expressed. 
In contrasting the columns B of the different groups, 
the first notable peculiarity that catches the eye is the 
small number of the sons of Commanders; they being 
31, while the average of all the groups is 48. There 
is nothing anomalous in this irregularity. I have already 
shown, when speaking of, the Commanders, that they 
usually begin their active careers in youth, and therefore, 
if married at all, they are mostly away from their wives 
on military service. It is also worth while to point out a 
few particular cases where exceptional circumstances stooi 
in the way of the Commanders leaving male issue, becaus 
the total number of those included in my lists is s 
small, being only 32, as to make them of appreciabl 
importance in affecting the results. Thus, Alexander th 
Great was continually engaged in distant wars, and die 
in early manhood: he had one posthumous son, but tha 
son was murdered for political reasons when still a boy, 
Julius Cesar, an exceedingly profligate man, left one ille 
gitimate son, by Cleopatra, but that son was also murdere 
for political reasons when still a boy. Nelson marrie 
a widow who had no children by her former husband, an 
therefore was probably more or less infertile by natur 
Napoleon I. was entirely separated from Marie Louis 
after she had borne him one son. 
Though the great Commanders have but few immediat 
descendants, yet the number of their eminent grandson| 
is as great as any other groups. I ascribe this to th 
superiority of their breed, which ensures eminence to ai 
unusually large proportion of their kinsmen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
COMPARISON OF RESULTS 311 
The next exceptional entry in the table is, the number 
of eminent fathers of the great scientific men as com- 
pared with that of their sons, there being only 26 of the 
former to 60 of the latter, whereas the average of all the 
groups gives 31 and 48. I have already attempted to 
account for this by showing, first, that scientific men owe 
much to the training and to the blood of their mothers ; 
and, secondly, that the first in the family who has scien- 
tific gifts is not nearly so likely to achieve eminence, as 
the descendant who is taught to follow science as a 
profession, and not to waste his powers on _profitless 
speculations. 
The next peculiarity in the table is, the small number 
of eminent fathers, in the group of Poets. This group is 
too small to make me attach much importance to the 
deviation ; it may be mere accident. 
The Artists are not a much larger group than the 
Poets, consisting as they do of only 28 families, but the 
number of their eminent sons is enormous and quite 
exceptional. It is. 89, whereas the average of all the 
groups is only 48, The remarks I made about the de- 
scendant of a great scientific man prospering in science, 
more than his ancestor, are eminently true as regards 
Artists, for the fairly-gifted son of a great painter or 
musician is farmore likely to become a professional celebrity, 
than another man who has equal natural ability, but is 
not especially educated for professional life. The large 
number of artists’ sons who have become eminent, testifies 
to the strongly hereditary character of their peculiar 
ability, while, if the reader will turn to the account of 
the Herschel family, p. 208, he will readily understand 
that many persons may have decided artistic gifts who 
have adopted some other more regular, solid, or lucrative 
occupation. 
I have now done with the exceptional cases ; it will be 
observed that they are mere minor variations in the law 
expressed by the general average of all the groups; for, 
if we say that to every 10 illustrious men, who have any 
minent relations at all, we find 8 or 4 eminent fathers 
or 5 eminent brothers, and 5 or 6 eminent sons, we shall

312 CORSE OF RESULTS 
be right in 17 instances Ci of 24; and in the 7 cases 
where ae are wrong, the error will consist of less than 
1 unit in 2 cases (the fathers of the commanders and men 
of literature), of 1 unit in 4 cases (the fathers of poets, 
and the sons of judges, commanders, and divines), and of 
more than 1 unit in the sole case of the sons of artists, 
The deviations from the average are naturally greater 
in the second and third grades of kinship, because the 
numbers of instances in the several groups are generally 
small; but as the proportions in the large subdivision 
of the 85 Judges correspond with extreme closeness to 
those of the general average, we are perfectly justified in 
accepting the latter, with confidence. 
The final and most important result remains to be 
worked out; it is this: if we know nothing else about 
a person than that he is a father, brother, son, grandson, 
or other relation of an illustrious man, what is the chance 
that he is or will be eminent? Column E in p. 265 gives 
the reply for Judges ; it remains for us to discover what it 
is for illustrious men generally. In each of the chapters 
Ihave given such data ‘as I possessed, fit for combining 
with the results in column D, in order to make the 
required calculation. They consist of the proportion o 
men whose relations achieved eminence, compared with 
the total number into whose relationships I inquired, 
The general result? is, that exactly one-half of the illus- 
trious men have one or more eminent relations. Conse- 
quently, if we divide the entries in column _D, of “ eminent 
men of all classes,” p. 308, by 2, we shall obtain the| 
corresponding column E,

selection. He may recollect my difficulty, avowed in many

that I have yielded to the temptation of inserting more 
than a due share of favourable cases. And I cannot 
wholly deny the charge, for I can recollect a few names 
that probably occurred to me owing to the double or 
treble weight given to them, by the cumulated perform- 
ances of two or three persons. Therefore I acknowledge 
it to be quite necessary, in the interests of truth, to appeal 
to some wholly independent selection of names; and will 
take for that purpose the saints, or whatever their right 
name may be, of the Comtist Calendar. Many of my 
readers will know to what I am referring ; how Auguste 
Comte, desiring to found a “Religion of Humanity,” 
selected a list of names, from those to whom human 
development was most indebted, and assigned the months 
to the most important, the weeks to the next class, and 
the days to the third. I have nothing whatever to do 
with Comtist doctrines in these pages : his disciples dislike 
Darwinism, and therefore cannot be expected to be favour- 
able to many of the discussions in this book ; so I have the 
ore satisfaction in the independence ‘of the testimony 
fforded by his Calendar to the truth of my views. Again, 
o one can doubt that Comte’s selections are entirely 
riginal; for he was the last man to pin his faith upon 
hat popular opinion which he aspired to lead, Every 
ame in his Calendar was.weighed, we may be sure, with 
crupulous care, though, I dare say, with a rather crazy 
alance, before it was inserted in the place which he 
ssigned for it. 
The Calendar consists of 18 months, each containing 
weeks. The following table gives the representatives 
f the 13 months in capital letters, and those of the 52 
weeks in ordinary type. I have not thought it worth 
hile to transcribe the representatives of the several days, 
hose marked with a * are included in my appendices, as 
aving eminent relations ; those with a + might have been

lo 20 persons of whose kinships we know nothing or next 
jo nothing, and therefore they should be struck out of the

It is singularly interesting to observe how strongly th 
results obtained from Comte’s selection corroborate m‘ 
own. Iam sure, then, we shall be within the mark if wi 
consider column D in the table, p. 308, to refer to th 
eminent kinsmen, not of the large group of illustrious an 
eminent men, but of the more select portion of illustriou 
men only, and then calculate our column E by dividin 
the entries under D by 2. 
For example, I reckon the chances of kinsmen of illus 
trious men rising, or having risen, to eminence, to be 15: 
to 100 in the case of fathers, 184 to 100 in the case oJ 
brothers, 24 to 100 in the case of sons. Or, putting thes 
and the remaining proportions into a more convenien 
form, we obtain the following results. In first grade: th 
chance of the father is 1 to 6 ; of each brother, 1 to 7; of 
each son, 1 to 4. In second grade: of each grandfather 
1 to 25; of each uncle,1 to 40; of each nephew, 1 to 40 
of each grandson, 1 to 29. In the third grade, the chance
-P-A-G-E-345
  COMPARISON OF RESULTS 315 
of each member is about 1 to 200, excepting in the case 
of first cousins, where it is 1 to 100. 
The large number of eminent descendants from illus- 
trious men must not be looked upon as expressing the 
results of their marriage with mediocre women, for the 
average ability of the wives of such men is above medio- 
crity. This is my strong conviction, after reading very 
many biographies, although it clashes with a commonly 
expressed opinion that clever men marry silly women. 
It is not easy to’ prove my point without a considerable 
mass of quotations to show the estimation in which the 
wives of a large body of illustrious men were held by 
their intimate friends, but the two following arguments 
are not without weight. First, the lady whom a man 
marries is very commonly one whom he has often met in 
the society of his own friends, and therefore not likely to 
be a silly woman. She is also usually related to some of 
them, and therefore has a probability of being hereditarily 
gifted. Secondly, as a matter of fact, a large number of 
eminent men marry eminent women. If the reader runs 
his eye through my Appendices, he will find many such 
instances. Philip II. of Macedon and Olympias; Cesar’s 
Ziaison with Cleopatra; Marlborough and his most able 
wife; Helvetius married a charming lady, whose hand 
was also sought by both Franklin and Turgot; August 
Wilhelm von Schlegel was ‘heart and soul devoted to 
Madame de Staél; Necker’s wife was a blue-stocking of 
he purest hue ; Robert Stephens, the learned printer, had 
[Petronella for his wife; the Lord Keeper Sir Nicholas 
[Bacon and the great Lord Burleigh married two of the 
ighly accomplished daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke. 
Every one of these names, which I have taken from the 
ppendices to my chapters on Commanders, Statesmen, 
nd Literary Men, are those of decidedly eminent women. 
hey establish the existence of a tendency of “like to 
ike” among intellectual men and women, and make it 
ost probable, that the marriages of illustrious men with 
Wwomen of classes E and D are very common. On the 
other hand, there is no evidence of a strongly marked 
antagonistic taste—of clever men liking really halfywitted 
women, A man may be conscious of serious defects in his

character, and select a wife to supplement what he wants 
as a shy man may be. attracted by a woman who has ne 
other merits than those of a talker and manager. Also, 
a young awkward philosopher may accredit the first girl 
who cares to show an interest in him, with greater intelli- 
gence than she possesses. But these are exceptional 
instances; the great fact remains that able men take 
pleasure in the society of intelligent women, and, if they 
can find such as would in other respects be suitable, they 
will marry them in preference to mediocrities. 
I think, therefore, that the results given in my tables, 
under the head of “Sons,” should be ascribed to the 
marriages of men of class F and above, with women 
whose natural gifts are, on the average, not inferior to 
those of class B, and possibly between B and C. 
I will now contrast the power of the male and femal 
lines of kinship in the transmission of ability, and for tha’ 
purpose will reduce the actual figures into percentages. 
As an example of the process, we may take the cases o 
the Judges. Here—as will be observed in the first tabl 
the actual figures corresponding to the specified varietie: 
of kinship are 41, 16,19, 1, making a total of 77; no 
I raise these to what they would be if this total wer 
raised to 100 ; in short, I multiply them by 100 and divid 
by 77, which converts them into 53, 21, 25,1; and thes 
are the figures inserted in the second table.

It will be observed that the ratio of the total kinships, 
nrough male and female lines, is almost identical in the 
rst. five columns, namely, in Judges, Statesmen, Com- 
anders, Men-of Literature, and Men of Science, and is 
is 70 to 30, or more than 2 to 1. The uniformity of 
nis ratio is evidence of the existence of a law, but it is 
ifficult to say upon what that law depends, because the 
tios are different for different varieties of kinship. Thus— 
confine ourselves to those in the second grade, which 
e sufficiently numerous to give averages on which de- 
lendence may be placed—we find that the sum of the 
tios of G., U., N., P. to those of gun, p., is also a 
ttle more than 2 to 1. Now, the actual figures are as

in those kinships which are most difficult to trace through 
female descent, and that the apparent inferiority is in exact 
proportion to that difficulty, Thus the parentage of a 
man’s mother is invariably stated in his biography ; con- 
sequently, an eminent g. is no less likely to be overlooked 
than a G.; but au. is more likely to be overlooked than 
a U., and an n. and p. much more likely than an N. 
and P. However, the solution suggested by these facts 
is not wholly satisfactory, because the differences appear to 
be as great in the well-known families of the Statesmen 
and Commanders, as in the obscure ones of the Literary 
and Scientific men. It would seem from this and from what 
I shall have to say about the Divines, that I have hunted 
out the eminent kinsmen in these degrees, with pretty 
equal completeness, in both male and female lines. 
The only reasonable solution which I can suggest, 
besides that of inherent incapacity in the female line 
for transmitting the peculiar forms of ability we are no 
discussing, is, that the aunts, sisters, and daughters o 
eminent men do not marry, on the average, so frequentl 
as other women. They would be likely not to marry si 
much or so soon as other women, because they would b 
accustomed to a higher form of culture and intellectual an 
moral tone in their family circle, than they could easily fin 
elsewhere, especially if, owing to the narrowness of thei 
means, their society were restricted to the persons in thei 
immediate neighbourhood, Again, one portion of the 
would certainly be of a dogmatic and self-asserting type 
and therefore unattractive to men, and others would fail t 
attract, owing to their having shy, odd manners, often me 
with in young persons of genius, which are disadvantageou! 
to the matrimonial chances of young women, It will b 
observed, in corroboration of this theory, that it accounts foi 
g. being as large as G., because a man must have an equa 
number of g. and G., but he need not have an equal numbe 
u,nm, p., and U., N.,P. Owing to want of further in 
formation, I am compelled to leave this question somewha: 
undecided. If my column C of the tables had been basec 
on facts instead of on estimate, those facts would hay 
afforded the information I want. 
(In the case of Puets and Artists, the influence of th

female line is enormously less than the male, and in these 
he solution I have suggested would be even more appro- 
priate than in the previous groups. 
Among the Divines we come to ‘@ wholly new order of 
hings. Here, the proportions are simply inverted, the 
emale influence being to the male as 73 to 27, instead 
of as, in the average of the first five columns, 30 to 70. 
[ have already, in the chapter on Divines, spoken at so 
much length about the power of female influence in 
nurturing religious dispositions, that I need not recur to 
hat question. As regards the presumed disinclination to 
marriage among the female relatives of eminent men gener- 
ally, an exception must certainly be made in the case 
f those of the Divines. They consider intellectual ability 
nnd a cultured mind of small importance compared with 
pious professions, and as religious society is particularly 
large, owing to habits of association for religious purposes, 
he necessity of choosing a pious husband is no material 
indrance to the marriage of a near female relation of an 
minent divine. 
(There is a common opinion that great men have re- 
arkable mothers. No doubt they are largely indebted 
© maternal influences, but the popular belief ascribes an 
mdue and incredible share to them. I account for the 
elief, by the fact that great men have usually high moral 
atures, and are affectionate and reverential, inasmuch as 
aere brain without heart is insufficient to achieve emi- 
ence. Such men are naturally disposed to show extreme 
lial regard, and to publish the good qualities of their 
others, with exaggerated praise.) 
I regret Iam unable to solve the simple question 
hether, and how far, men and women who are prodigies. 
f genius, are infertile. I have, however, shown, that 
en of eminence, such as the Judges, are by no means 
, and it will be seen, from my point of view of the 
ture of the human race, as described in a subsequent 
apter, that the fertility of eminent men is a more 
portant fact for me to establish, than that of prodigies. 
here are many difficulties in the way of discovering 
hether genius is, or is not, correlated with infertility.

agree upon the names of those who are pre-eminentl. 
men of genius, nor even upon the definition of the word 
Another is, that the men selected as examples are usuall; 
ancients, or at all events those who lived so long ago tha 
it is often impossible, and always very difficult, to lear 
anything about their families. (Another difficulty lies i 
the fact, that a man who has no children is likely to d 
more for his profession, and to devote himself mor 
thoroughly to the good of the public, than if he ha 
them. <A very gifted man will almost always rise, as | 
believe, to eminence; but if he is handicapped with th 
weight of a wife and children in the race of life, h 
cannot be expected to keep as much in the front as if hi 
were single. J He cannot pursue his favourite subject o 
study with the same absorbing passion as if he had nm 
other pressing calls on his attention, no domestic sorrows 
anxieties, and petty cares, no yearly child, no periodica 
infantine epidemics, no constant professional toil for th 
maintenance of a large family. 
There are other obstacles in the way of leaving de 
scendants in the second generation. The daughters woul¢ 
not be so likely as other girls to marry, for the reason 
stated a few pages back; while the health of the sons ij 
liable to be ruined by over-work. The sons of gifted me: 
are decidedly more precocious than their parents, as 
reference to my Appendices will distinctly show; I d 
not care to quote cases, because it is a normal fact, analo 
gous to what is observed in diseases, and in growths o 
all kinds, as has been clearly laid down by Mr. Darwi 
The result is, that the precocious child is looked upon aj 
a prodigy, abler even than his parent, because the parent’ 
abilities at the same age were less, and he is pushed forwar 
in every way by home influences, until serious harm is don 
to his constitution. 
So much for the difficulties in the way of arriving at 
right judgment on the question before us. Most assuredl, 
a surprising number of the ablest men appear to have le’ 
no descendants; but we are justified, from what I hay 
said, in ascribing a very considerable part of the adduce 
instances to other causes than an inherent tendency 4 
barrenness in men and women of genius. I believe they

is a large residuum which must be so ascribed, and I agree 
thus far with the suggestion of Prosper Lucas, that, as 
giants and dwarfs are rarely prolific, so men of prodigiously 
large or small intellectual powers may be expected to be 
deficient in fertility. On the other hand, I utterly dis- 
agree with the assertion of that famous author on heredity, 
that true genius is invariably isolated. 
There is a prevalent belief somewhat in accordance with 
the subject of the last paragraph but one, that men of 
genius are unhealthy, puny beings—all brain and no 
muscle—weak-sighted, and generally of poor constitutions, 
I think most of my readers would be surprised at the 
stature and physical frames of the heroes of history, who 
Il my pages, if they could be assembled together in a 
all. I would undertake to pick out of any group of 
them, even out of that of the Divines (see pp. 260, 261), 
n “eleven” who should compete in any physical feats 
hatever, against similar selections from groups of twice 
r thrice their numbers, taken at hap-hazard from equally 
well-fed classes. In the notes I made, previous to writing 
his book, I had begun to make memoranda of the physical 
ifts of my heroes, and regret now, that I did not continue 
he plan, but there is even almost enough printed in the 
ppendices to warrant my assertion. I do not deny that 
any men of extraordinary mental gifts have had wretched 
onstitutions, but deny them to be an essential or even the 
sual accompaniment. University facts are as good as any 
thers to serve as examples, so I will mention that both 
igh wranglers and high classics have been frequently the 
rst oarsmen of their years.. The Hon. George Denman, 
ho was senior classic in 1842, was the stroke of the Uni- 
ersity crew. Sir William Thompson, the second wrangler 
p 1845, won the sculls. In the very first boat-race between 
e two Universities, three men who afterwards became 
ishops rowed in one of the contending boats, and another 
wed in the other. It is the second and third-rate students 
ho are usually weakly. A collection of living magnates 
various branches of intellectual achievement is always 
feast to my eyes; being, as they are, such massive, vigor- 
s, capable-looking animals.

the different groups, and drew illustrative curves in orde 
to see whether there was anything abnormal in the con 
stitutions of eminent men, and this result certainly cam: 
out, (which goes far to show that the gifted men consist o 
two categories—the very weak and the very strong.) I 
was, that the curve of mortality does not make a singh 
bend, but it rises to a minor culminating point, and then 
descending again, takes a fresh departure for its principa 
are. There is a want of continuity in the regularity o 
its sweep. | I conclude that among the gifted men, there i: 
a small cldss who have weak and excitable constitutions 
who are destined to early death, but that the remainde 
consists of men likely to enjoy a vigorous old age. \ 
This double culmination was strongly marked in the 
group of Artists, and distinctly so in that of the Poets 
but it came out with most startling definition when I laic 
out the cases, of which I had made notes, 92 in number 
of men remarkable for their precocity. Their first culmi- 
nation was at the age of 38, then the death-rate sank til 
the age of 42; at 52 it had again risen to what it was ai 
38, and it attained its maximum at 64. The mortality oj 
the men who did not appear to have been eminently pre; 
cocious, 180 cases in all, followed a perfectly normal curv 
rising steadily to a maximum at 68 years, and then de 
clining as steadily. The scientific men lived the longes 
and the number of early deaths among them was decided] 
less than in any of the other groups. 
The last general remark I have to make is, that featur 
and mental abilities do not seem to be correlated. T 
son may resemble his parent in being an able man, but 
does not therefore follow that he will also resemble him j 
features. I know of families where the children who h; 
not the features of their parents inherited their dispositi 
and ability, and the remaining children had just the co: 
verse gifts. In looking at the portraits in the late Nation 
Exhibitions I was extremely struck with the absence 
family likeness, in cases where I had expected to find 4 
I cannot prove this point without illustrations ; the read 
must therefore permit me to leave its evidence in 
avowedly incomplete form. 
In concluding this chapter, I may point out some
-P-A-G-E-353
  COMPARISON OF RESULTS 323 
  
the groups that I have omitted to discuss. The foremost 
Engineers are a body of men possessed of remarkable 
natural qualities; they are not only able men, but are 
also possessed of singular powers of physical endurance 
and of boldness, combined with clear views of what can 
and what cannot be effected. I have included Watt and 
Stephenson among the men of science, but the Brunels, 
and the curious family of Mylne, going back for nine, if 
not twelve generations——all able and many eminent in 
their professions,—and several others, deserve notice. I do 
not, however, see my way to making a selection of emi- 
nently gifted engineers, because their success depends, ‘in 
a very great degree, on early opportunities. If a great 
engineering business is once established, with well-selected 
men at the heads of its various departments, it is easy to 
keep up the name and credit for more than one generation 
after the death of its gifted originator. 
The Actors are very closely connected—so much so as 
to form a caste; but here, as with the Engineers, we have 
great difficulty i in distinguishing the eminently g gifted from 
those whose success is largely due to the accident of edu- 
cation. I do not, however, like to pass them over without 
a notice of the Kemble family, who filled so large a space 
in the eyes of the British world, two generations ago. The

I was desirous of obtaining facts bearing on heredity 
from China, for there the system of examination is noto- 
riously strict and far-reaching, and boys of promise are 
sure to be passed on from step to step, until they have 
reached the highest level of which they are capable. The 
first honour of the year in a population of some 400 
millions—the senior classic and senior wrangler rolled into 
one—is the “ Chuan-Yuan.” Are the Chuan-Yuans ever 
related together? is a question I have asked, and to which 
a reply was promised me by a friend of high distinction 
in China, but which has not reached me up to the time 
I am writing these lines. However, I put a question on 
the subject into the pages of the Hong-Kong Notes and 
Queries (Aug. 1868), and found at all events one case, of 
a woman who, after bearing a child who afterwards became 
a Chuan-Yuan, was divorced from her husband, but marry- 
ing again, she bore a second child, who also became a 
(Chuan-Yuan, to her next husband. 
L I feel the utmost confidence that if the question of 
hereditary genius were thoroughly gone into by a com- 
petent person, China would be found to afford a perfect 
treasury of facts bearing upon it. There is, however, a 
considerable difficulty in making these inquiries, arising 
from the paucity of surnames in China, and also from the 
necessity of going back to periods (and there are many 
such) when corruption was far less rife in China than it is 
at present. ‘| 
The records of the Olympian Games in the palmy days) 
of Greece, which were scrupulously kept by the Eleans, 
would have been an excellent mine to dig into for facts 
bearing on heredity; but they are not now to be had 
However, I find one incidental circumstance in their history 
that is worth a few lines of notice. It appears, there wa‘ 
a single instance of a married woman having ventured} 
to be present while the games were going on, althoug 
death was the penalty of the attempt. She was foun 
out, but excused, because her father, brothers, and so 
had all been victors.

               I HAVE now completed what I had to say concerning the 
kinships of individuals, and proceed, in this chapter, to 
attempt a wider treatment of my subject, through a con- 
sideration of nations and races, 
Every long-established race has necessarily its peculiar 
fitness for the conditions under which it has lived, owing 
to the sure operation of Darwin’s law of natural selection. 
However, I am not much concerned, for the present, with 
the greater part of those aptitudes, but only with such as 
are available in some form or other of high civilization. 
We may reckon upon the advent of a time when civiliza- 
tion, which is now sparse and feeble and far more superficial 
than it is vaunted to be, shall overspread the globe. Ulti- 
mately it is sure to do so, because civilization is the necessary 
fruit of high intelligence when found in a social animal, 
and there is no plainer lesson to be read off the face of 
Nature than that the result of the operation of her laws 
is to evoke intelligence in connexion with sociability. 
Intelligence is as much an advantage to an animal as 
physical strength or any other natural gift, and there- 
fore, out of two varieties of any race of animal who are 
equally endowed in other respects, the most intelligent 
variety is sure to prevail in the battle of life: Similarly, 
among intelligent animals, the most social race is sure 
o prevail, other qualivies being equal. 
Under even a very moderate form of material civilization

ship of the fittest” and the unsparing destruction of the 
unfit, for hundreds of generations, have become as obsolete 
as the old mail-coach habits and customs, since the estab- 
lishment of railroads, and there is not the slightest use in 
attempting to preserve them ; they are hindrances, and not 
gains, to civilization. I shall refer to some of these a little 
further on, but I will first speak of the qualities needed in 
civilized society. They are, speaking generally, such as 
will enable a race to supply a large contingent to the 
various groups of eminent men, of w hom I have treated in 
my several chapters. Without going so far as to say that 
this very convenient test is perfectly fair, we are at all 
events justified in making considerable use of it, as I will 
do, in the estimates I am about, to give. 
In comparing the worth of different races, I shall make 
frequent use of the law of deviation from an average, to 
which I have already been much beholden; and, to save 
the reader’s time and patience, I propose to act upon an 
assumption that would require a good deal of discussion 
to limit, and to which the reader may at first demur, but 
which cannot lead to any error of importance in a rough 
provisional inquiry. I shall assume that the intervals 
between the grades of ability are the same in all the races 
—that is, if the ability of class A of one race be equal to 
the ability of class C in another, then the ability of class B 
of the former shall be supposed equal to that of class D 
of the latter, and so on. I know this cannot be strictly 
true, for it would be in defiance of analogy if the variability 
of all races were precisely the same; but, on the other 
hand, there is good reason to expect that the error intro- 
duced by the assumption cannot sensibly affect the off- 
hand results for which alone I propose to employ it; 
moreover, the rough data I shall adduce, will go far to 
show the justice of this expectation. 
Let us, then, compare the Negro race with the Anglo- 
Saxon, witlr respect to those qual’ ties alone which are 
capable of producing judges, statesmen, commanders, men 
of literature and science, poets, arvists, and divines. If 
the negro race in America had been affected by no social 
disabilities, a comparison of their achievements with those}        
            
   
     
  
-P-A-G-E-357
  OF DIFFERENT RACES if PE2F 
  
of the whites in their several branches of intellectual effort, 
having regard to the total number of their respective popu- 
lations, would give the necessary information. As matters 
stand, we must be content with much rougher data, 
First, the negro race has occasionally, but very rarely, 
produced such men as Toussaint l’Ouverture, who are of 
our class F ; that is to say, its X, or its total classes above 
G, appear to correspond with our F, showing a difference 
of not less than two grades between the black and white 
races, and it may be more. 
Secondly, the negro race is by no means wholly deficient 
in men capable of becoming good factors, thriving mer- 
chants, and otherwise considerably raised above the average 
of whites—that is to say, it cannot unfrequently supply 
men corresponding to our class C, or even D. It will be 
recollected that C implies a selection of 1 in 16, or some- 
what more than the natural abilities possessed by average 
foremen of common juries, and that D is as 1 in 64—a 
degree of ability that is sure to make a man successful in 
life. In short, classes E and F of the negro may roughly 
be considered as the equivalent of our C and D—a result 
which again points to the conclusion, that the average 
intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades 
below our own, 
Thirdly, we may compare, but with much caution, the 
relative position of negroes in their native country with 
that of the travellers who visit them. The latter, no doubt, 
bring with them the knowledge current in civilized lands, 
but that is an advantage of less importance than we are 
apt to suppose. A native chief has as good an education 
in the art of ruling men as can be desired; he is con- 
tinually exercised in personal government, and usually 
maintains his place by the ascendency of his character, 
shown every day over his subjects and rivals. A traveller 
in wild countries also fills, to a certain degree, the posi- 
tion of a commander, and has to confront native chiefs 
at every inhabited place. The result is familiar enough— 
the white traveller almost invariably holds his own in 
their presence. It is seldom that we hear of a white 
traveller meeting with a black chief whom he feels to be
-P-A-G-E-358
328 THE COMPARATIVE WORTIHT 
  
the better man. I have often discussed this subject with 
competent persons, and can only recall a few cases of the 
inferiority of the white man,—certainly not more than 
might be ascribed to an average actual difference of three 
grades, of which one may be due to the relative demerits 
of native education, and the remaining two toa difference 
in natural gifts. 
Fourthly, the number among the negroes of those whom 
we should call half-witted men is very large. Every book 
alluding to negro servants in America is full of instances, 
Iwas myself much impressed by this fact during my travels 
in Africa. The mistakes the negroes made in their own 
matters were so childish, stupid, and simpleton-like, as 
frequently to make me ashamed of my own species. I do 
not think it any exaggeration to say, that their c is as 
low as our e, which would be a difference of two grades, 
as before. I have no information as to actual idiocy among 
the negroes—I mean, of course, of that class of idiocy 
which is not due to disease. 
The Australian type is at least one grade below the 
African negro. I possess a few serviceable data about the 
natural capacity of the Australian, but not sufficient to 
induce me to invite the reader to consider them. 
The average standard of the Lowland Scotch and the 
English North-country men is decidedly a fraction of a 
grade superior to that of the ordinary English, because 
the number of the former who attain to eminence is far 
greater than the proportionate number of their race would 
have led us to expect. The same superiority is dis- 
tinctly shown by a comparison of the well-being of the 
masses of the population ; for the Scotch labourer is much 
less of a drudge than the Englishman of the Midland 
counties—he does his work better, and “lives his life” 
besides. The peasant women of Northumberland work 
all day in the fields, and are not broken down by the 
work; on the contrary they take a pride in their effec- 
tive labour as girls, and, when married, they attend well 
to the comfort of their homes. It is perfectly distressing 
to me to witness the draggled, drudged, mean look of 
the mass of individuals, especially of the women, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-359

me meets in the streets of London and other purely 
English towns. The conditions of their life seem too 
hard for their constitutions, and to be crushing them into 
eneracy. 
Pie ablest race of whom history bears record is un- 
juestionably the ancient Greek, partly because their 
master-pieces in the principal departments of intellectual 
ctivity are still unsurpassed, and in many respects un- 
qualled, and partly because the population that gave birth 
0 the creators of those master-pieces was very small. Of 
he various Greek sub-races, that of Attica was the ablest, 
nd she was no doubt largely indebted to the following 
ause for her superiority. Athens opened her arms to 
mmigrants, but not indiscriminately, for her social life 
vas such that none but very able men could take any 
leasure in it; on the other hand, she offered attractions 
uch as men of the highest ability and culture could find 
in no other city. Thus, by a system of partly unconscious 
election, she built up a magnificent breed of human 
nimals, which, in the space of one century—viz. between 
30 and 430 B.c.—produced the following illustrious per- 
lons, fourteen in number :— 
Statesmen and Commanders.—Themistocles (mother an 
lien), Miltiades, Aristeides, Cimon (son of Miltiades), 
ericles (son of Xanthippus, the victor at Mycale). 
Literary and Scientific Men.—Thucydides, Socrates, 
enophon, Plato.

We are able to make a closely-approximate estimate of 
e population that produced these men, because the num- 
r of the inhabitants of Attica has been a matter of, 
equent inquiry, and critics appear at length to be quite 
reed in the general results. It seems that the little 
strict of Attica contained, during its most flourishing 
riod (Smith’s “Class. Geog. Dict.”), less than 90,000 
tive free-born persons, 40,000 resident aliens, and a labour- 
g and artisan population of 400,000 slaves, The first item

to the truth, and may be accepted in the present case 
Consequently, we have to deal with a total population o 
270,000 free-born persons, or 135,000 males, born in th 
century I have named. Of these, about one-half, o 
67,500, would survive the age of 26, and one-third, o 
45,000, would survive that of 50, As 14 Athenians becam« 
illustrious, the selection is only as 1 to 4,822 in respect t 
the former limitation, and as 1 to 3,214 in respect to th 
latter. Referring to the table in page 30, it will be seer 
that this degree of selection corresponds very fairly to th 
classes F (1 in 4,300) and above, of the Athenian race 
Again, as G is one-sixteenth or one-seventeenth as numer 
ous as F, it would be reasonable to expect to find on 
of class G among the fourteen; we might, however, by 
accident, meet with tivo, three, or even four of that class— 
say Pericles, Socrates, Plato, and Phidias. 
Now let us attempt to compare the Athenian standar 
of ability with that of our own race and time. We have n 
men to put by the side of Socrates and Phidias, because th 
millions of all Europe, breeding as they have done for thi 
subsequent 2,000 years, have never produced their equal; 
They are, therefore, two or three grades above our G—the 
might rank as I or J. But, supposing we do not cou 
them at all, saying that some freak of nature acting at th 
time may have produced them, what must we say abo 
the rest ? Pericles and Plato would rank, I suppose, tl 
one among the greatest of philosophical statesmen, and tl 
other as at least the equal of Lord Bacon, They woul 
therefore, stand somewhere among our unclassed X; one 
two grades above G—let us call them between H and 
All the remainder—the F of the Athenian tace—wou 
rank above our G, and equal to or close upon o 
H. It follows from all this, that the average ability 
the Athenian race is, on the lowest possible estimate, ve 
nearly two grades higher than our own—that is, abo 
as much as our race is above that of the African Neg 
This estimate, which may seem prodigious to some, 
confirmed by the quick intelligence and high culture 
the Athenian commonalty, before whom literary wor 
were recited and works of art exhibited, of a far m 
severe character than could possibly be appreciated

he average of our race, the calibre of whose intellect is 
asily gauged by a glance at the contents of a railway 
ook-stall. 
We know, and may guess something more, of the 
eason why this marvellously- gifted race declined, ( Social 
norality grew exceedingly lax; marriage became naar 
onable, and was avoided ; many of the more ambitious 
nd accomplished women were avowed courtesans, and 
onsequently infertile, and the mothers of the incoming 
opulation were of a heterogeneous class. In a small sea- 
ordered country, where emigration and immigration are 
onstantly going on, and where the manners are as dissolute 
were those of Greece in the period of which I speak, the 
rity of a race would necessarily fail. It can be, there- 
re, no surprise to us, though it has been a severe 
isfortune to humanity, that the high Athenian breed 
lecayed and disappeared; for if it had maintained its 
cellence, and had multiplied and spread over large 
untries, displacing inferior populations (which it well 
ight have done, for it was naturally very prolific), it would 
suredly have accomplished results advantageous to 
human civilization, to a degree that transcends our powers 
imagination. 
If we could raise the average standard of our race only 
e grade, what vast changes would be produced! The 
mber of men of natural gifts equal to those of the eminent 
en of the present day, would be necessarily increased 
ore than tenfold, as will be seen by the fourth column 
the table p. 30, because there would be 2,423 of them 
each million instead of only 233; but far more 
nportant to the progress of civilization would be the 
crease in the yet higher orders of intellect. We know 
w intimately the course of events is dependent on the 
oughts of a few illustrious men. If the first-rate men in 
e different groups had never been born, even if those 
ong them who have a place in my Appendices on account 
their hereditary gifts, had never existed, the world would 
very different to what it is. Now the table shows that 
e numbers in these, the loftiest grades of intellect, would 
increased in a still higher proportion than that of which

I have been speaking; thus the men that now rank unde 
class G would be increased seventeenfold, by raising th 
average ability of the whole nation a single grade. We se 
by the table that all England contains (on the average, o 
course, of several years) only six men between the ages o 
thirty and eighty, whose natural gifts exceed class G ; bu 
in a country of the same population as ours, whose averag' 
was one grade higher, there would be eighty-two of sucl 
men ; and in another whose average was two grades highe 
(such as I believe the Athenian to have been, in the interva 
530—430 B.c.) no less than 1,355 of them would be found 
There is no improbability in so gifted a breed being abli 
to maintain itself, as Athenian experience, rightly under 
stood, has sufficiently proved ; and as has also been provec 
by what I have written about the Judges, whose fertilit; 
is undoubted, although their average natural ability is F, 0 
54 degrees above the average of our own, and 34 abov 
that of the average Athenians. 
It seems to me most essential to the well-being of futur 
generations, that the average standard of ability of th 
present time should be raised. Civilization is a new co 
dition imposed upon man by the course of events, just 
in the history of geological changes new conditions hav 
continually been imposed on different races of animal 
They have had the effect either of modifying the nature 
the races through the process of natural selection whe 
ever the changes were sufficiently slow and the race su 
ciently pliant, or of destroying them altogether when th| 
changes were too abrupt or the race unyielding. Th 
number of the races of mankind that have been entirel 
destroyed under the pressure of the requirements of a 
incoming civilization, reads us a terrible lesson. Probabl 
in no former period of the world has the destruction of th 
races of any animal whatever been effected over such wid 
areas and with such startling rapidity as in the case

ressure of a stronger race than through the influence of a 
ivilization they were incapable of supporting. And we 
00, the foremost labourers in creating this civilization, are 
yeginning to show ourselves incapable of keeping pace with 
ur own work. The needs of centralization, communica- 
ion, and culture, call for more brains and mental stamina 
han the average of our race possess. We are in crying 
ant for a greater fund of ability in all stations of life ; for 
either the classes of statesmen, philosophers, artisans, nor 
Jbourers are up to the modern complexity of their several 
rofessions. An extended civilization like ours comprises 
ore interests than the ordinary statesmen or philosophers 
ff our present race are capable of dealing with, and it 
xacts more intelligent work than our ordinary artisans 
md labourers are capable of performing. Our race is over- 
eighted, and appears likely to be drudged into degeneracy 
yy demands that exceed its powers. If its average ability 
ere raised a grade or two, our new classes F and G 
ould conduct the complex affairs of the state at home and 
road as easily as our present F and G, when in the 
josition of country squires, are able to manage the affairs 
their establishments and tenantry. All other classes of 
e community would be similarly promoted to the level 
the work required by the nineteenth century, if the 
erage standard of the race were raised. 
When the severity of the struggle for existence is not 
0 great for the powers of the race, its action is healthy 
d conservative, otherwise it is deadly, just as we may see 
emplified in the scanty, wretched vegetation that leads 
precarious existence near the summer snow line of the 
Ips, and disappears altogether a little higher up. We 
ant as much backbone as we can get, to bear the racket 
which we are henceforth to be exposed, and as good 
ains as possible to contrive machinery, for modern life to 
ork more smoothly than at present. We can, in some 
gree, raise the nature of a man to a level with the new 
mditions imposed upon his existence, and we can 
so, in some degree, modify the conditions to suit his 
ture. It is clearly right that both these powers 
ould be exerted, with the view of bringing his nature

and the conditions of his existence into as close harmon 
as possible. 
In proportion as the world becomes filled with mankind 
the relations of society necessarily increase in complexity 
and the nomadic disposition found in most barbarian 
becomes unsuitable to the novel conditions. There is 
most unusual unanimity in respect to the causes of in 
capacity of savages for civilization, among writers on thos 
hunting and migratory nations who are brought into con 
tact with advancing colonization, and perish, as they in 
variably do, by the contact. They tell us that the labou 
of such men is neither constant nor steady; that the lov: 
of a wandering, independent life prevents their settlin; 
anywhere to work, except for a short time, when urged b 
want and encouraged by kind treatment. Meadows say 
that the Chinese call the barbarous races on their border 
by a phrase which means “hither and thither, not fixed. 
And any amount of evidence might be adduced to shoy 
how deeply Bohemian habits of one kind or another wer: 
ingrained in the nature of the men who inhabited mo: 
parts of the earth now overspread by the Anglo-Saxon an 
other civilized races. Luckily there is still room fe 
adventure, and a man who feels the cravings of a rovin, 
adventurous spirit to be too strong for resistance, may y: 
find a legitimate outlet for it in the colonies, in the arm 
or on board ship. But such a spirit is, on the whole, a 
heirloom that brings more impatient restlessness an 
beating of the wings against cage-bars, than persons 
more civilized characters can readily comprehend, and 1 
is directly at war with the more modern portion of o 
moral natures. If aman be purely a nomad, he has onl} 
to be nomadic, and his instinct is satisfied; but n| 
Englishmen of the nineteenth century are purely nomadi 
The most so among them have also inherited man 
civilized cravings that are necessarily starved when the 
become wanderers, in the same way as the wandering i 
stincts are starved when they are settled at home. Cons 
quently their nature has opposite wants, which can nev 
be satisfied except by chance, through some very exce 
tional turn of circumstances. This is a serious calamity
-P-A-G-E-365
  OF DIFFERENT RACES 335 
and as the Bohemianism in the nature of our race is des- 
tined to perish, the sooner it goes the happier for mankind. 
The social requirements of English life are steadily de- 
stroying it. No man who only works by fits and starts is 
able to obtain his living nowadays; for he has not a chance 
of thriving in competition with steady workmen. If 
his nature revolts against the monotony of daily labour, he 
is tempted to the public-house, to intemperance, and, it may 
be, to poaching, and to much more serious crime ; otherwise 
he banishes himself from our shores. In the first case, he 
is unlikely to leave as many children as men of more 
domestic and marrying habits, and, in the second case, his 
breed is wholly lost to England. By this steady riddance 
of the Bohemian spirit of our race, the artisan part of our 
population is slowly becoming bred to its duties, and the 
primary qualities of the typical modern British workman 
are already the very opposite of those of the nomad. 
What they are now, was well described by Mr. Chadwick 
as consisting of “great bodily strength, applied under the 
command of a steady, persevering will, mental self-content- 
edness, impassibility to external irrelevant impressions, 
which carries them through the continued repetition of 
oilsome labour, ‘ steady as time.’ ” 
It is curious to remark how unimportant to modern 
ivilization has become the once famous and thorough- 
red looking Norman. The type of his features, which is, 
robably, in some degree correlated with his peculiar form — 
f adventurous disposition, is no longer characteristic of 
ur rulers, and is rarely found among celebrities of the 
resent day; it is more often met with among the undis- 
‘inguished members of highly-born families, and especially 
mong the less conspicuous officers of the army. Modern 
eading men in all paths of eminence, as may easily be seen 
ma collection of photographs, are of a coarser and more 
obust breed ; less excitable and dashing, but endowed with 
‘ar more ruggedness and real vigour. Such also is the case 
s regards the German portion of the Austrian nation ; they 
re far more high-caste in appearance than the Prussians, 
ho are so plain that it is disagreeable to travel north- 
ards from Vienna and watch the change; yet the

Prussians appear possessed of the greater moral anc 
physical stamina. 
Much more alien to the genius of an enlightened civili 
zation than the nomadic habit, is the impulsive and uncon- 
trolled nature of the savage. A civilized man must bea 
and forbear, he must keep before his mind the claims 0’ 
the morrow as clearly as those of the passing minute ; 0 
the absent, as well as of the present. This is the most 
trying of the new conditions imposed on man by civiliza: 
tion, and the one that makes it hopeless for any but 
exceptional natures among savages, to live under them 
The instinct of a savage is admirably consonant with the 
needs of savage life ; every day he is in danger through 
transient causes ; he lives from hand to mouth, in the how 
and for the hour, without care for the past or forethought 
for the future : but such an instinct is utterly at fault in 
civilized life. The half-reclaimed savage, being unable tc 
deal with more subjects of consideration than are directly 
before him, is continually doing acts through mere mal- 
adroitness and incapacity, at which he is afterwards deeply 
grieved and annoyed. The nearer inducements always 
seem to him, through his uncorrected sense of moral per- 
spective, to be incomparably larger than others of the same 
actual size, but more remote ; consequently, when the temp 
tation of the moment has been yielded to and passe 
away, and its bitter result comes in its turn before th 
man, he is amazed and remorseful at his past weakness 
It seems incredible that he should have done that yester- 
day which to-day seems so silly, so unjust, and so unkindly; 
The newly-reclaimed barbarian, with the impulsive 
unstable nature of the savage, when he also chances t 
be gifted with a peculiarly generous and affectionate dis 
position, is of all others the man most oppressed with th 
sense of sin. 
( Now it is a just assertion, and a common theme o 
moralists of many creeds, that man, such as we find him| 
is born with an imperfect nature. He has lofty aspirations 
but there is a weakness in his disposition, which incapaci: 
tates him from carrying his nobler purposes into effect

and should be his delight ; but his inclinations are fickle 
and base, and do not conform to his better judgment. 
The whole moral nature of man is tainted with sin, 
which prevents him from doing the things he knows to 
be right. 
The explanation I offer of this apparent anomaly, seems 
perfectly satisfactory from a scientific point of view. It is 
neither more nor less than that the development of our 
nature, whether under Darwin’s law of natural selection, or 
through the effects of changed ancestral habits, has not 
kept pace with the development of our moral civilization. 
Man was barbarous but yesterday, and therefore it is not to 
be expected that the natural aptitudes of, his race should 
already have become moulded into accordance with his 
very recent advance. We, men of the present centuries, 
are like animals suddenly transplanted among new con- 
ditions of climate and of food: our instincts fail us under 
the altered circumstances. 
My theory is confirmed by the fact that the seni 
of old civilizations are far less sensible than recent converts 
from barbarism, of their nature being inadequate to their 
moral needs, The conscience of a negro is aghast at his 
lown wild, impulsive nature, and is easily stirred by a 
preacher, but it is scarcely possible to ruffle the self- 
omplacency of a steady-going Chinaman. 
The sense of original sin would show, according to my 
theory, not that man was fallen from a high estate, but 
hat he was rising in moral culture with more rapidity than 
he nature of his race could follow. My view is corrobo- 
ated by the conclusion reached at the end of each of the 
any independent lines of ethnological research—that the 
uman race were utter savages in the beginning ; and that, 
fter myriads of years of barbarism, man has but very 
ecently found his way into the paths of morality and 
ivilization.

   BErorE speaking of the influences which affect the 
natural ability and intelligence of nations and races I must 
beg the reader to bring distinctly before his mind how 
reasonable it is that such influences should be expected to 
exist. How consonant it is to all analogy and experience 
to expect that the control of the nature of future genera- 
tions should be as much within the power of the living, as 
the health and well-being of the individual is in the power 
of the guardians of his youth. 
We are exceedingly ignorant of the reasons why we 
exist, confident only that individual life is a portion o: 
some vaster system that struggles arduously onwards 
towards ends that are dimly seen or wholly unknown tof 
us, by means of the various affinities—the sentiments, the 
intelligences, the tastes, the appetites—of innumerable} 
personalities who ceaselessly succeed one another on the 
stage of existence. 
There is nothing that appears to assign a more excep- 
tional or sacred character to a race, than to the families or 
individuals that compose it. We know how careless 
Nature is of the lives of individuals; we have seen how} 
careless she is of eminent families—how they are built up 
flourish, and decay: just the same may be said of races. 
and of the world itself; also, by analogy, of other scenes o: 
existence than this particular planet of one of innumerabl 
suns. Our world appears hitherto to have developed itsel:

mainly under the influence of unreasoning affinities; but 
of late, Man, slowly growing to be intelligent, humane, 
and capable, has appeared on the scene of life and 
profoundly modified its conditions. He has already 
become able to look after his own interests in an 
incomparably more far-sighted manner, than in the old 
pre-historic days of barbarism and flint knives; he is 
already able to act on the experiences of the past, to 
combine closely with distant allies, and to prepare for 
future wants, known only through the intelligence, long 
before their pressure has become felt. He has introduced 
a vast deal of civilization and hygiene which influence, in 
an immense degree, his own well-being and that of his 
children; it remains for him to bring other policies 
into action, that shall tell on the natural gifts of his 
race, 
It would be writing to no practically useful purpose, 
were I to discuss the effect that might be produced on the 
population, by such social arrangements as existed in 
Sparta. They are so alien and repulsive to modern 
feelings, that it is useless to say anything about them, 
so I shall wholly confine my remarks to agencies that 
are actually at work, and upon which there can be no 
hesitation in speaking. 
I shall have occasion to show that certain influences 
retard the average age of marriage, while others hasten it ; 
land the general character of my argument will be to prove, 
that an enormous effect upon the average natural ability 
f arace may be produced by means of those influences, 
shall argue that the wisest policy is that which results 
in retarding the average age of marriage among the weak, 
nd in hastening it among the vigorous classes ; whereas, 
ost unhappily for us, the influence of numerous social 
gencies has been strongly and banefully exerted in the 
recisely opposite direction. ’ 
An estimate of the effect of the average age of marriage 
n the growth of any section of a nation, is therefore the 
rst subject that requires investigation. Everybody is 
repared to admit that it is an element, sure to produce 
ome sensible effect, but few will anticipate its real

  340 INFLUENCES THAT AFFECT THE 
magnitude or will be disposed to believe that its results have 
so vast and irresistible an influence on the natural ability 
of a race, as I shall be able to demonstrate. 
The average age of marriage affects population in a three- 
fold manner. Firstly, those who marry when young have 
the larger families; secondly, they produce more genera- 
tions within a given period, and therefore the growth of a 
prolific race, progressing as it does, “ geometrically,” would 
be vastly increased at the end of a long period, by a habit 
of early marriages; and thirdly, more generations are 
alive at the same time among those races who marry when 
they are young. 
In explanation of the aggregate effect of these three 
influences, it will be best to take two examples that are 
widely but not extremely separated. Suppose two men, M 
and N, about 22 years old, each of them having therefore the 
expectation of living to the age of 55 or 33 years longer; and 
suppose that M marries at once, and that his descendants 
when they arrive at the same age do the same; but that N 
delays until he has laid by money, and does not marry 
before he is 33 years old, that is to say, 11 years later than 
M, and his descendants also follow his example. Let us 
further make the two very moderate suppositions, that the 
carly marriages of race N result in an increase of 14 in the 
next generation, and also in the production of 33 genera- 
tions in a century, while the late marriages of race N result 
in an increase of only 1} in the next generation and in 23 
generations in one century. 
It will be found that an increase of 1} in each genera- 
tion, accumulating on the principle of compound interest 
during 3} generations, becomes rather more than 15 times| 
the original amount ; while an increase of 14 for 24 genera 
tions is barely as much as } times the original amount, 
Consequently the increase of the race of M at the end o 
a century, will be greater than that of N in the ratio o 
18 to 7 ; that is to say, it will be rather more than 24 time: 
as great. In two centuries the progeny of M will be mor 
than 6 times, and in three centuries more than 15 times 
as numerous as those of N. 
The proportion which the progeny of M will bear at an;

time, to the total living population, will be still greater 
than this, owing to the number of generations of M who 
are alive at the same time, being greater than those of N. 
The reader will not find any difticulty in estimating the 
effect of these conditions, if he begins by ignoring children 
and all others below the age of 22, and also by supposing 
the population to be stationary in its number, in con- 
secutive generations. We have agreed in the case of M 
to allow 3? generations to one century, which gives about 
27 years to each generation ; then, when one of this race 
is 22 years old, his father will (on the average of many 
cases) be 27 years older, or 49 ; and as the father lives to 
55, he will survive the advent of his son to manhood for 
the space of 6 years. Consequently, during the 27 years 
intervening between each two generations, there will be 
found one mature life for the whole period and one other 
mature life during a period of 6 years, which gives for the 
total mature life of the race M, a number which may be 
expressed by the fraction *377, or $2. The diagram 
represents the course of three consecutive generations of 
race M: the middle line refers to that of the individual 
about whom I have just been speaking, the upper one to 
that of his father, and the lower to his son. The dotted 
line indicates the period of life before the age of 22; the 
double line, the period between 22 and the average time at 
which his son is born; the dark line is the remainder of 
his life. 
  A term of 27 years 
between two generations. 
   _ On the other hand, a man of the race N, which does not 
contribute more than 24 generations to a century, that is 
to say, 40 years to a single generation, does not attain the 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  342 t INFLUENCES THAT es THE 
age of 22 until (on the average of many cases) 7 years 
after his father’s death ; for the father was 40 years old 
when his son was born, and died at the age of 55 when the 
son was only 15 years old. In other words, during each 
period of 18 + 15 + 7, or 40 years, men of mature life of 
the race N are alive for only 18 + 15, or 33 of them; 
hence the total mature life of the race N may be expressed 
by the fraction 33. 
A term of 40 years 
between two generations. 
   It follows that the relative population due to the races 
of M and N, is as $4 to 2%, or as 40 to 271, which is very 
nearly as 5 to 3. 
We have been calculating on the supposition that the 
population remains stationary, because it was more con- 
venient to do so, but the results of our calculation will hold 
nearly true for all cases. Because, if population should | 
increase, the larger number of living descendants tends to 
counterbalance the diminished number of living ancestry ; 
and, conversely, if it decreases. 
Combining the above ratio of 5 to 3 with those pre- 
viously obtained, it results that at the end of one century 
from the time when the races M and N started fair, with 
equal numbers, the proportion of mature men of race M 
will be four times as numerous as those of race N ; at the 
end of two centuries, they will be ten times as numerous, 
and at the end of three centuries no less than twenty-six 
times as numerous. . 
I trust the reader will realize the heavy doom which

question will invariably be in the inverse ratio of the intervals between 
the two generations, which in the present case are 27 and 40 years.

these figures pronounce against all sub-sections of prolific 
races in which it is the custom to put off the period of 
marriage until middle age. It isa maxim of Malthus that 
the period of marriage ought to be delayed in order that 
the earth may not be overcrowded by a population for 
whom there is no place at the great table of nature. If 
this doctrine influenced all classes alike I should have 
nothing to say about it here, one way or another, for it 
would hardly affect the discussions in this book ; but, as it 
is put forward as a rule of conduct for the prudent part of 
mankind to follow, whilst the imprudent are necessarily 
left free to disregard it, I have no hesitation in saying that 
it is a most pernicious rule of conduct in its bearing upon 
race. Its effect would be such as to cause the race of the 
prudent to fall, after a few centuries, into an almost 
incredible inferiority of numbers to that of the imprudent, 
and it is therefore calculated to bring utter ruin upon the 
breed of any country where the doctrine prevailed. I 
protest against the abler races being encouraged to with- 
draw in this way from the struggle for existence. It may 
seem monstrous that the weak should be crowded out by 
the strong, but it is still more monstrous that the races 
best fitted to play their part on the stage of life, should 
be crowded out by the incompetent, the ailing, and the 
desponding. 
The time may hereafter arrive, in far distant years, when 
the population of the earth shall be kept as strictly within 
the bounds of number and suitability of race, as the sheep 
on a well-ordered moor or the plants in an orchard-house ; 
in the meantime, let us do what we can to encourage the 
raultiplication of the races best fitted to invent and conform 
to a high and generous civilization, and not, out of a 
mistaken instinct of giving support to the weak, preyent 
the incoming of strong and hearty individuals. 
The long period of the dark ages under which Europe 
has lain is due, I believe, in a very considerable degree, to 
the celibacy enjoined by religious orders on their votaries, 
Whenever a man or woman was possessed of a gentle 
nature that fitted him or her to deeds of charity, to 
meditation, to literature, or to art, the social condition
-P-A-G-E-374
   
  
  344 INFLUENCES THAT AFFECT THE

of the time was such that they had no refuge elsewhere 
than in the bosom of the Church, But the Church chose 
to preach and exact celibacy. The consequence was that 
these gentle natures had no continuance, and thus, by a 
policy so singularly unwise and suicidal that Iam hardly 
able to speak of it without impatience, the Church brutalized 
the breed of our forefathers. She acted precisely as if she 
had aimed at selecting the rudest portion of the community 
to be, alone, the parents of future generations. She 
practised the arts which breeders would use, who aimed at 
creating ferocious, currish, and stupid natures. No wonder 
that club law prevailed for centuries over Europe; the 
wonder rather is that enough good remained in the veins 
of Europeans to enable their race to rise to its present 
very moderate level of natural morality. 
A relic of this monastic spirit clings to our Universities, 
who say to every man who shows intellectual powers of the 
kind they delight to honour, “Here is an income of from 
one to two hundred pounds a year, with free lodging and 
various advantages in the way of board and society; we 
give it you on account of your ability; take it and enjoy it 
all your life if you like: we exact no condition to your 
continuing to hold it but one, namely, that you shall not 
marry.” 
The policy of the religious world in Europe was exerted 
in another direction, with hardly less cruel effect on the 
nature of future generations, by means of persecutions 
which brought thousands of the foremost thinkers and men 
of political aptitudes to the scaffold, or imprisoned them 
during a large part of their manhood, or drove them as 
emigrants into other lands. In every one of these cases 
the check upon their leaving issue was very considerable. 
Hence the Church, having first captured all the gentle 
natures and condemned them to celibacy, made another 
sweep of her huge nets, this time fishing in stirring waters, 
to catch those who were the most fearless, truth-seeking, 
and intelligent, in their modes of thought, and therefore the 
most suitable parents of a high civilization, and put a 
strong check, if not a direct stop, to their progeny. Those 
she reserved on these occasions, to breed the generations of

the future, were the servile, the indifferent, and, again, the 
stupid. Thus, as she—to repeat my expression—brutal- 
zed human nature by her system of celibacy applied to 
she gentle, she demoralized it by her system of persecution 
of the intelligent, the sincere, and the free, It is enough 
(0 make the blood boil to think of the blind folly that has 
saused the foremost nations of struggling humanity to be 
the heirs of such hateful ancestry, and that has so bred 
yur instincts as to keep them in an unnecessarily long- 
ontinued antagonism with the essential requirements of a 
teadily advancing civilization. In consequence of this 
nbred imperfection of our natures, in respect to the condi- 
‘ions under which we have to live, we are, even now, almost 
is much harassed by the sense of moral incapacity and sin, as 
vere the early converts from barbarism, and we steep our- 
elves in half-unconscious self-deception and hypocrisy, as a 
vartial refuge from its insistance, Our avowed creeds 
emain at variance with our real rules of conduct, and we 
ead a dual life of barren religious sentimentalism and 
ross materialistic habitudes. 
The extent to which persecution must have affected 
uropean races is easily measured by a few well-known 
atistical facts. Thus, as regards martyrdom and imprison- 
ent, the Spanish nation was drained of free-thinkers at 
e rate of 1,000 persons annually, for the three centuries 
tween 1471 and 1781; an average af 100 persons having 
een excuted and 900 imprisoned every year during that 
eriod. The actual data during those three hundred years 
e 32,000 burnt, 17,000 persons burnt in effigy (I pre- 
me they mostly died in prison or escaped from Spain), 
d 291,000 condemned to various terms of imprisonment 
d other penalties. It is impossible that any nation 
uld stand a policy like this, without paying a heavy 
nalty in the deterioration of its breed, as has notably 
en the result in the formation of the superstitious, unin- 
lligent Spanish race of the present day. 
Italy was also frightfully persecuted at an earlier date. 
the diocese of Como, alone, more than 1,000 were tried 
nually by the inquisitors for many years, and 300 were

846 INFLUENCES THAT AFFECT THE 
The French persecutions, by v hich the English have beer 
large gainers, through receiving their industrial refugees 
were on a nearly similar scale. In the seventeenth century 
three or four hundred thousand Protestants perished in 
prison, at the galleys, in their attempts to escape, or 01 
the scaffold, and an equal number emigrated. Mr. Smiles 
in his admirable book on the Huguenots, has traced th 
influence of these and of the Flemish emigrants on England 
and shows clearly that she owes to them almost all he 
industrial arts and very much of the most valuable life 
blood of her modern race. There has been another emigra 
tion from France of not unequal magnitude, but followec 
by very different results, namely that of the Revolution in 
1789. It is most instructive to contrast the effects of th 
two. The Protestant emigrants were able men, and havi 
profoundly influenced for good both our breed and ow: 
history ; on the other hand, the political refugees had bu 
poor average stamina, and have left scarcely any trace: 
behind them, 
It is very remarkable how large a proportion of the emi 
nent men of all countries bear foreign names, and are thi 
children of political refugees——men well qualified to intro 
duce a valuable strain of blood. We cannot fail to reflec 
on the glorious destiny of a country that should maintai 
during many generations, the policy of attracting eminentl, 
desirable refugees, but no others, and of encouraging thei 
settlement and the naturalization of their children, 
No nation has parted with more emigrants than Englan 
but whether she has hitherto been on the whole a gainer 
a loser by the practice, I am not sure. No doubt she h: 
lost a very large number of families of sterling wort 
especially of labourers and artisans; but, asa rule, the ve 
ablest men are strongly disinclined to emigrate ; they fe 
that their fortune is assured at home, and unless the 
spirit of adventure is overwhelmingly strong, they prefer 
live in the high intellectual, and moral atmosphere of t 
more intelligent circles of English society, to a self-banis| 
ment among people of altogether lower grades of mind ai 
interests. England has certainly got rid of a great dei 
of refuse through means of emigration, She has found

outlet for men of adventurous and Bohemian natures, who 
aré excellently adapted for colonizing a new country, but are 
not wanted in old civilizations; and she has also been 
Jisembarrassed of a vast number of turbulent radicals and 
the like, men who are decidedly able but by no means 
eminent, and whose zeal, self-confidence, and irreverence 
far outbalance their other qualities. 
The rapid rise of new colonies and the decay of old 
ivilizations is, I believe, mainly due to their respective 
ocial agencies, which in the one case promote, and in the 
ther case retard, the marriages of the most suitable breeds. 
n a young colony, a strong arm and an enterprising brain 
re the most appropriate fortune for a marrying man, and 
gain, as the women are few, the inferior males are seldom 
ikely to marry. In an old civilization, the agencies are 
ore complex. Among the active, ambitious classes, none 
ut the inheritors of fortune are likely to marry young ; 
here is especially a run against men of classes C, D, and 
'—those, I mean whose future fortune is not assured 
xcept through a good deal of self-denial and effort. It is 
Imost impossible that they should succeed well and rise 
igh in society, if they hamper themselves with a wife in 
their early manhood. Men of classes F and G are more 
dependent, but they are not nearly so numerous, and 
erefore their breed, though intrinsically of more worth 
an E or D, has much less effect on the standard of the 
ation at large. But even if men of classes F and G marry 
oung, and ultimately make fortunes and achieve peerages 
high social position, they become infected with the 
bition current in all old civilizations, of founding 
milies. Thence result the evils I have already described, 
speaking of the marriages of eldest sons with heiresses 
nd of the suppression of the marriages of the younger 
ms. Again, there is a constant tendency of the best men 
the country to settle in the great cities, where marriages 
e less prolific and children are less likely tolive. Owing 
these several causes, there is a steady check in an old 
vilization upon the fertility of the abler classes; the 
provident and unambitious are those who chiefly keep 
the breed. So the race gradually deteriorates,

becoming in each successive generation less fitted for a hig]

one, until the time comes when the whole political anc 
social fabric caves in and a greater or less relapse to bar: 
barism takes place, during the reign of which the race i:

The best form of civilization in respect to the improve 
ment of the race, would be one in which society was no 
costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professiona 
sources, and not much through inheritance ; where every 
lad had a chance of showing his abilities and, if high]; 
gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and 
entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the 
exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in hi: 
early youth ; where marriage was held in as high honour a: 
in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race wa: 
~ encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensica 
sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name) 
where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge i 
celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where th 
better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands wer 
invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalized.

  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 349 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Ir is confidently asserted by all modern physiologists 
hat the life of every plant and animal is built up of an 
normous number of subordinate lives; that each organism 
onsists of a multitude of elemental parts, which are to a 
reat extent independent of each other; that each organ 
as its proper life, or autonomy, and can develop and repro- 
uce itself independently of other tissues (see Darwin 
n “Domestication of Plants and Animals,” ii. 368, 369). 
‘hus the word “ Man,” when rightly understood, becomes 
noun of multitude, because he is composed of millions, 
erhaps billions of cells, each of which possesses, in some 
ort an independent life, and is parent of other cells. He is 
conscious whole, formed by the joint agencies of a host 
f what appear to us to be unconscious or barely conscious 
lements, 
Mr. Darwin, in his remarkable theory of Pangenesis, takes 
wo great strides from this starting point. He supposes, 
rst that each cell, having of course its individual peculi- 
rities, breeds nearly true to its kind, by propagating 
wnumerable germs, or to use his expression, “gemmules,” 
hich circulate in the blood and multiply there ; remaining 
1 that inchoate form until they are able to fix themselves 
pon other more or less perfect tissue, and then they 
ecome developed into regular cells. Secondly, the germs 
re supposed to be solely governed by their respective 
tural affinities, in selecting their points of attachment; 
id that, consequently, the marvellous structure of the 
ving form is built wp under the influence of innumerable 
ind affinities, and not under that of a central controlling 
wer,
-P-A-G-E-380
  . 
350 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This theory, propounded by Mr. Darwin as “ provisional, 
and.avowedly based, in some degree, on pure hypothesis an 
very largely on analogy, is—whether it be true or not—o 
enormous service to those who inquire into heredity 
It gives a key that unlocks every one of the hithert 
unopened barriers to our comprehension of its nature ; i 
binds within the compass of a singularly simple law, th 
multifarious forms of reproduction, witnessed in the wid 
range of organic life, and it brings all these forms of repro 
duction under the same conditions as govern the ordinar 
growth of each individual. It is, therefore, very advisabl 
that we should look at the facts of hereditary genius fron 
the point of view which the theory of Pangenesis affords, an 
to this I will endeavour to guide the reader, by speakin; 
in order of Typrs—Sports of Nature, Stability, Variation 
and Individuality. 
TYPES. 
Every type of character in a living being may be com 
pared to the typical appearance always found in differen 
descriptions of assemblages. It is true that the life of a1 
animal is conscious, and that the elements on which it i 
based are apparently unconscious, while exactly the revers« 
is the case in the corporate life of a body of men. Never 
theless the employment of this analogy will help us con 
siderably in obtaining a clear understanding of the law: 
which govern heredity, and they will not mislead us wher 
used in the manner I propose. The assemblages of which 
speak are such as are uncontrolled by any central authorit; 
but have assumed their typical appearance through the fre 
action of the individuals who compose them, each mai 
being bent on his immediate interest, and finding his plac 
under the sole influence of.an elective affinity to his neigh 
bours. A small rising watering-place affords as good ai 
illustration as any of which I can think. It is often hardl. 
possible to trace its first beginnings: two or three house! 
were perhaps built for private use, and becoming accidental: 
vacant, were seen and rented by holiday folk, who praise 
the locality,and raised a demand for further accommodation)
-P-A-G-E-381
  
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 351 
other houses were built to meet the requirement ; this led 
fo an inn, to the daily visit of the baker's and butcher's cart, 
the postman, and so forth. Then as the village increased 
and shops began to be established, young artisans, and 
other floating gemmules of English population, in search 
of a place where they might advantageously attach them- 
selves, became fixed, and so each new opportunity was seized 
pon and each opening filled up, as soon or very soon after 
t existed. The general result of these purely selfish affini- 
ies is that watering-places are curiously similar, even before 
jhe speculative builder has stepped in. We may predict 
hat kind of shops will be found and how they will be 
laced ; nay, even what kind of goods and*placards will be 
ut up in the windows. And so, notwithstanding abundant 
ndividual peculiarities, we find them to have a strong 
eneric identity. 
The type of these watering-places is certainly a durable 
me ; the human materials of which they are made remain 
imilar, and so are the conditions under which they exist, 
f having to supply the wants of the average British 
oliday seeker. Therefore the watering-place would always 
reed true to its kind. It would do so by detaching an offshoot’ 
m. the fissiparous principle, or like a polyp, from which you 
ay snip off a bit, which thenceforward lives an independent 
fe and grows into a complete animal. Or, to compare it’ 
ith a higher order of life, two watering-places at some 
istance apart might between them afford material to raise 
mother 1m an intermediate locality. 
Precisely the same remarks might be made about fishing 
illages, or manufacturing towns, or new settlements in the 
ush, or an encampment of gold diggers, and each of these 
ould breed true to its kind. If we go to more stationary 
rms of society than our own, we shall find numerous 
amples of the purest breed: thus, the Hottentot kraal or 
llage of to-day differs in no way from those described by 
e earliest travellers; or, to take an immensely longer 
ap, the information gathered from the most ancient 
intings in Egypt, accords with our observations of the 
odern life of the descendants of those peoples, whom the 
intings represent.

852 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  
Next, let us consider the nature of hybrids. Suppose a 
town to be formed under the influence of two others that 
differ, the one a watering-place and the other a fishing- 
town ; what will be the result? We find that particulai 
combination to be usually favourable, because the different 
elements do not interfere with but rather support one 
another. The fishing interest gives greater solidity to the 
place than the more ephemeral presence of the tourist 
population can furnish ; the picturesque seaside life is als 
an attraction to visitors, and the fishermen cater for thei 
food. On the other hand, the watering-place gives mor 
varied conditions of existence to the fishermen; th 
visitors are very properly mulcted, directly or indirectly 
for charities, roads, and the like, and they are not unwel 
come customers in various ways to their fellow-townsmen. 
Let us take another instance of an hybrid; one tha 
leads to a different result. Suppose an enterprising: manu 
facturer from a town at no great distance from an incipen 
watering-place, discovers advantages in its minerals, wate 
power, or means of access, and prepares to set up his mil} 
in the place. We may predict what will follow with muc 
certainty. Either the place will be forsaken as a watering 
place, or the manufacturer will be in some way or other go} 
rid of. The two elements are discordant. The dirt an 
noise and rough artisans engaged in the manufactory ar 
uncongenial to the population of a watering-place. 
The moral I have in view will be clear to the reader. 
wish to show that because a well-conditioned man marrie 
a well-conditioned woman, each of pure blood as regard 
any natural gift, it does not in the least follow that th 
hybrid offspring will succeed.    
     
     
       
    
     
     
      
    Sports oF NATURE. 
I will continue to employ the same metaphor, to explai 
the manner in which apparent sports of nature are pr 
duced, such as the sudden appearance of a man of gre: 
abilities in undistinguished families. Mr. Darwin maintat 
in the theory of Pangenesis, that the gemmules of inn 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 353 
merable qualities, derived from ancestral sources, circulate 
in the blood and propagate themselves, generation after 
eneration, still in the state of gemmules, but fail in deve- 
oping themselves into cells, because other antagonistic 
emmules are prepotent and overmaster them, in the 
truggle for points of attachment. Hence there is a vastly 
larger number of capabilities in every living being, than 
ver find expression, and for every patent element there 
re countless Jatent ones. The character of a man is wholly 
ormed through those gemmules that have succeeded in 
ttaching themselves ; the remainder that have been over- 
owered by their antagonists, count for nothing ; just as the 
olicy of a democracy is formed by that of the majority of 
ts citizens, or as the parliamentary voice of any place is 
eterthined by the dominant political views of the electors : 
im both instances, the dissentient minority is powerless. 
et, however, by the virtue of the more rapid propagation 
f one class of electors, say of an Irish population, the 
umerical strength of the weaker party be supposed to 
radually increase, until the minority becomes the majority, 
hen there will be a sudden reversal or revolution of the 
olitical equilibrium, and the character of the borough or 
ation as evidenced by its corporate acts, will be entirely 
hanged. This corresponds to a so-called “sport” of 
ature. Again, to make the simile still more closely 
ppropriate to our wants, suppose that by some alteration 
h the system of representation, two boroughs, each con- 
ining an Irish element in a large minority, the one having 
ways returned a Whig and the other a Conservative, to 
le combined into a single borough returning one member. 
; is clear that the Whig and Conservative party will neu- 
alize one another, and that the union of the two Irish 
inorities will form a strong majority, and that a member 
ofessing Irish interests is sure to be returned. This 
rictly corresponds to the case where the son has marked 
culiarities, which neither of his parents possessed in a 
tent form. 
The dominant influence of pure blood over mongrel 
liances is also easily to be understood by the simile 
' the two boroughs ; for if every perfect and inchoate

voter in one of them—that is to say, every male, man and 
child—be a radical to his backbone, the incoming of such 
a compact mass would overpower the divided polities 
of the inhabitants of the other, with which it was 
combined, 
These similes, which are perfectly legitimate according 
to the theory of Pangenesis, are well worthy of being 
indulged in, for they give considerable precision to our 
views on heredity, and compel facts that appear anomalou 
at first sight, to fall into intelligible order. 
   
       
    
    
     
    
     
    
      
     
  STABILITY 
I will now explain what I presume ought to be under 
stood, when we speak of the stability of types, and what i 
the nature of the changes through which one type yield: 
to another. Stability is a word taken from the languag’ 
of mechanics ; it is felt to be an apt word; let us see wha 
the conception of types would be, when applied to me 
chanical conditions. It is shown by Mr. Darwin, in hi 
great theory of “The Origin of Species,” that all forms 0 
organic life are in some sense convertible into one anothe 
for all have, according to his views, sprung from commo: 
ancestry, and therefore A and B having both descended fro: 
C, the lines of descent might be remounted from A to 
and redescended from C to B. Yet the changes are not b 
insensible gradations ; there are many, but not an infiniti 
number of intermediate links; how is the law of continuit' 
to be satisfied by a series of changes in jerks? Th 
mechanical conception would be that of a rough ston 
having, in consequence of its roughness, a vast number 
natural facets, on any one of which it might rest in “ stable 
equilibrium, That is to say, when pushed it would som 
what yield, when pushed much harder it would again yiel 
but in a less degree; in either case, on the pressure bein 
withdrawn it would fall back into its first position, Bu 
if by a powerful effort the stone is compelled to overpa: 
the limits of the facet on which it has hitherto found res 
it will tumble over into a new position of stability, when 
just the same proceedings must be gone through as befor
-P-A-G-E-385
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 355 
  
before it can be dislodged and rolled another step onwards. 
The various positions of stable equilibrium may be looked 
upon as so many typical attitudes of the stone, the type 
being more durable as the limits of its stability are 
wider. We also see clearly that there is no violation 
of the law of continuity in the movements of the stone, 
though it can only repose in certain widely separated 
positions. 
Now for another metaphor, taken from a more complex 
system of forces. We have all known what it is to be jammed 
in the midst of a great crowd, struggling and pushing and 
swerving to and fro, in its endeavour to make a way through 
some nairow passage. There is a dead-lock ; each member 
of the crowd is pushing, the mass is agitated, but there is 
no progress. If, by a great effort, a man drives those in 
front of him but a few inches forward, a recoil is pretty 
sure to follow, and there is no ultimate advance. At length, 
by some accidental unison of effort, the dead-lock yields, a 
forward movement is made, the elements of the crowd fall 
into slightly varied combinations, but in a few seconds there 
is another dead-lock, which is relieved, after a while, 
through just the same processes as before. Hach of these 
formations of the crowd, in which they have found them- 
selves in a dead-lock, is a position of stable equilibrium, and 
represents a typical attitude. 
It is easy to form a general idea of the conditions of 
stable equilibrium in the organic world, where one element 
is so correlated with another that there must be an enor- 
mous number of unstable combinations for each that is 
capable of maintaining itself unchanged, generation after 
generation. 
VARIATION 
I will now make afew remarks on the subject of in- 
dividual variation. The gemmules whence every cell of 
levery organism is developed, are supposed, in the theory 
lof Pangenesis, to be derived from two causes: the one, 
unchanged inheritance; the other, changed inheritance. 
Mr. Darwin, in his latter work, “ Variation of Animals 
AA
-P-A-G-E-386
  356 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  
and Plants under Domestication,” shows very clearly that 
individual variation is a somewhat more important feature 
than we might have expected. It becomes an interesting 
inquiry to determine how much of a person’s constitution 
is due, on an average, to the unchanged gifts of a remote 
ancestry, and how much to the accumulation of individual 
variations. The doctrine of Pangenesis gives excellent 
materials for mathematical formule, the constants of which 
might be supplied through averages of facts, like those 
contained in my tables, if they were prepared for the 
purpose. My own data are too lax, to go upon; the 
averages ought to refer to some simple physical character- 
istic, unmistakable in its quality, and not subject to the 
doubts which attend the appraisement of ability. Let me 
remark, that there need be no hesitation in accepting 
averages for this purpose ; for the meaning and value of an 
average are perfectly clear. It would represent the results, 
supposing the competing “ gemmules” to be equally fertile, 
and. also supposing the proportion of the gemmules affected 
by individual variation, to be constant in all the cases. 
The immediate consequence of the theory of Pangenesis 
- is somewhat startling. It appears to show that a man is 
wholly built up of his own and ancestral peculiarities, and 
only in an infinitesimal degree of characteristics handed 
down in an unchanged form, from extremely ancient times, 
It would follow that under a prolonged term of con- 
stant conditions, it would matter little or nothing what 
were the characteristics of the early progenitors of a race, 
the type being supposed constant, for thé progeny would 
invariably be moulded by those of its more recent ancestry. 
The reason for what I have just stated is easily to be 
comprehended, if easy though improbable figures be em- 
ployed in illustration, Suppose, for the sake merely of a 
very simple numerical example, that a child acquired one- 
tenth of his nature from individual variation, and inherited 
the remaining nine-tenths from his parents. It follows, that 
his two parents would have handed down only nine- 
tenths of nine-tenths, or 4%5 from his grandparents, 75235 
from his great-grandparents, and so on; the numerator 
of the fraction increasing in each successive step less

vanishing value of the fraction.

s 7 is a fraction less than 1 (it was 8; in the imaginary case discussed in 
text, and would generally be very small, but I have no conception 
hat,—perhaps as small as 4p, or some numbers still nearer unity), the 
alue of 7” + 1 will vanish if x be taken sufficiently large, in which ,case 
the individual may be considered as wholly derived from gemmules 
odified by individual variations posterior to the n‘* generation. 
It must be understood that I am speaking of variations well within the 
mits of stability of the race, and also that Lam not speaking of cases where 
lhe individuals are selected for some peculiarity, generation after generation, 
in this event a new element must be allowed for, inasmuch as the average 
alue of 7 cannot be constant. In proportion as the deviation from 
e mean position of stability is increased, the tendency of individual 
fariation may reasonably be expected to lie more strongly towards the mean 
osition than away from it. The treatment of all this seems well within the 
rasp of analysis, but we want a collection of facts, such as the breeders of 
imals could well supply, to guide us for a few steps out of the region of 
ure hypothesis. 
The formula also shows how much of a man’s nature is derived on the 
erage from any given ancestor ; for if we call the father the Ist gencra- 
lon, the grandfather the 2nd, and so on, as aman has 2”. parents in the 
‘* generation, and as the formula shows that he only inherits Gr” un- 
hanged gemmules from all of them put together, it follows that the 
rtion derived from each person in that generation is, as (7)".

from all his ancestors above the fiftieth degree, would be 
only one five-thousandth of his whole nature. 
I do not see why any serious difficulty should stand in 
the way of mathematicians, in framing a compact formula, 
based on the theory of Pangenesis, to express the composi- 
tion of organic beings in terms of their inherited and indi- 
vidual peculiarities, and to give us, after certain constants 
had been determined, the means of foretelling the 
ayerage distribution of characteristics among a large 
multitude of offspring whose parentage was known. The 
problem would have to be attacked on the following 
principle. 
The average proportion of gemmules, modified by indi- 
vidual variation under various conditions preceding birth, 
clearly admits of being determined by observation ; and the 
deviations from that average may be determined by the 
same theory in the law of chances, to which I have so often 
referred. Again, the proportion of the other gemmules 
which are transmitted in an unmodified form, would be simi- 
larly treated ; for the children would, on the average, inherit 
the gemmules in the same proportions that they existed in 
their parents ; but in each child there would be a deviation 
from that average. The table in page 30 is identical with 
the special case in which only two forms of gemmules had| 
to be considered, and in which they existed in equal num- 
bers in both parents. 
If the theory of Pangenesis be true, not only might th 
average qualities of the descendants of groups A and B 
A and C, A and D, and every other combination be pre 
dicted, but also the numbers of them who deviate in variou: 
proportions from those averages. Thus, the issue of F an 
A ought to result in so and so, for an average, and in suc 
and such numbers, per million, of A, B,C, D, E, F, G, &c. 
classes. The latent gemmules equally admit of being de 
termined from the patent characteristics of many previou 
generations, and the tendency to reversion into any ancien’ 
form ought also to admit of being calculated. In shori 
the theory of Pangenesis brings all the influences that beai 
on heredity into a form, that is appropriate for the gras; 
of mathematical analysis.

  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 359 
  
INDIVIDUALITY 
I will conclude by saying a few words upon what is to 
be understood by the phrase “individuality.” The artificial 
breeding of fish has been the subject of so many books, 
shows, and lectures, that every one has become more or less 
familiar with its processes, The milt taken from the male 
is allowed to fall upon the ova that have been deposited by 
the female, which thereupon rapidly change their appear- 
ance, and gradually, without any other agency, an embyro 
fish may be observed to develop itself inside each of them. 
The ova may have been separated for many days from the 
female, the milt for many hours from the male. They are, 
therefore, entirely detached portions of organized matter, 
leading their own separate organic existences; and at the 
instant or very shortly after they touch, the foundations 
are laid of an individual life. But where was that life 
during the long interval of separation of the milt and roe 
from the parent fish? If these substances were possessed 
of conscious lives in the interim, then two lives will have 
been merged into one “ individuality ” by the process; which 
is a direct contradiction interms. If neither had conscious 
lives, then consciousness was produced by an operation as 
much under human control as anything can be. It may 
not be said that the ovum was always alive, and the milt 
had merely an accessory influence, because the young fish 
inherits its character from its parents equally, and there is 
an abundance of other physiological data to disprove the 
idea. Therefore so far as fish are concerned, the creation 
of a new life is as unrestrictedly within the compass of 
human power, as the creation of any material product 
whatever, from the combination of given elements. 
Again, suppose the breeder of fish to have two kinds . 
lof milt, belonging to. salmon of different characters, each 
in a separate cup, A and B, and two. sorts of ova, each also 
in a separate cup, C and D. Then he can make at his 
ption the two sorts of fish AC and BD, or else the two 
orts of fish AD and BC. Therefore not only the creation 
f the lives of fish, in a general sense, but also the specific 
character of individual lives, within wide limits, is unre-
-P-A-G-E-390
  
  360 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  
strictedly under human control. The power of the director 
of an establishment for breeding fish is of exactly the same 
quality as that of a cook in her kitchen. Both director 
and cook require certain elements to work upon ; but, having 
got them, they can create a fish or a dinner, as the case 
may be, according to a predetermined pattern. 
Now, all generation is physiologically the same,! and 
therefore the reflections raised by what has been stated of 
fish are equally applicable to the life of man. The entire 
human race, or any one of its varieties, may indefinitely 
increase its numbers by a system of early marriages, or it 
may wholly annihilate itself by the observance of celibacy ; 
it may also introduce new human forms by means of the 
intermarriage of varieties and of achange in the conditions 
of life. It follows that the human race has a large control 
over its future forms of activity,—far more than any indi- 
vidual has over his own, since the freedom of individuals is 
narrowly restricted by the cost, in energy, of exercising 
their wills. Their state may be compared to that of cattle 
in an open pasture, each tethered closely to a peg by an 
elastic cord. These can graze in any direction, for short 
distances, with little effort, because the cord stretches 
easily at first ; but the further they range, the more power- 
fully does its elastic force pull backwards against them. 
The extreme limit of their several ranges must lie at that 
distance from the peg where the maximum supply of| 
nervous force which the chemical machinery of their bodies 
can evolve, is only just equivalent to the outflow required 
to resist the strain of the cord. Now, the freedom of 
humankind, considered as a whole, is far greater than 
this; for it can gradually modify its own nature, or, to 
keep to the previous metaphor, it can cause the pegs' 
themselves to be continually shifted. It can advance them 
from point to point, towards new and better pastures, over 
wide areas, whose bounds are as yet unknown, 
Nature teems with latent life, which man has large 
powers of evoking under the forms and to the extent 
which he desires. We must not permit ourselves to con- 
1 The Address of the President of the Royal Society, 1867, in presenting, 
the Copley medal to Von Baer.
-P-A-G-E-391
  _ GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 361 
  
sider each human or other personality as something super- 
naturally added to the stock of nature, but rather as a 
segregation of what already existed, under a new shape, 
and as a regular consequence of previous conditions. 
Neither must we be misled by the word “ individuality,” 
because it appears from the many facts and arguments in 
this book, that our personalities are not so independent 
as our self-consciousness leads us to believe. We may look 
upon each individual as something not wholly detached 
from its parent source,—as a wave that has been lifted and 
shaped by normal conditions in an unknown, illimitable 
ocean, There is decidedly a solidarity as well as a separ- 
ateness in all human, and probably in all lives whatsoever ; 
and this consideration goes far, as I think, to establish an 
opinion that the constitution of the living Universe is a 
pure theism, and that its form of activity is what may be 
described as co-operative, It points to the conclusion that 
all life is single in its essence, but various, ever varying, 
and inter-active in its manifestations, and that men and all 
other living animals are active workers and sharers in a 
vastly more extended system of cosmic action than any of 
ourselves, much less of them, can possibly comprehend, 
It also suggests that they may contribute, more or less un- 
consciously, to the manifestation of a far higher life than 
our own, somewhat as—I do not propose to push the 
metaphor too far—the individual cells of one of the more 
complex animals contribute to the manifestation of its 
higher order of personality.

THE deviations from an average are given in the following 
table of M. Quetelet as far as 80 grades ; they are intended 
to be reckoned on either side of the average, and therefore 
extend over a total range of 160 grades. The eightieth isa 
deviation so extreme, that the chances of its being exceeded 
(upwards or downwards, whichever of the two events we 
please to select) is only 99990092092. = yegdy-oyus or less than one in a million, That is to say, when firing 
at a target (see Diagram, p. 24) less than one out of a mil- 
lion shots, taking the average of many millions, will hit it 
at a greater height than 80 of Quetelet’s grades above the 
mean of all the shots; and an equally small number will 
hit it lower than the 80th grade below the same mean. 
Column M gives the chance of a shot falling into any 
given grade (80 x2 or) 160 in total number. Column N 
represents the chances from another point of view; it is 
derived directly from M, and shows the probability of a 
shot lying between any specified grade and the mean; each 
figure in N consisting of the sum of all the figures in M up 
to the grade in question, and inclusive. Thus, as we see 
by Column M, the chance against a shot falling into the 
1st grade (superior or inferior, whichever we please to select) 
is ‘025225 to 1, and 025124 to 1 against its falling into 
the 2d, and -024924 to 1 against its falling into the 3d; 
then the chance against its falling between the mean and 
the third grade, inclusive, is clearly the sum of these 3 
numbers, or ‘075273, which is the entry in Column N, 
opposite the grade 3. [

These columns may be used for two purposes. 
The one is to calculate a table like that in p. 30, where 
I have simply lumped 11 of Quetelet’s grades into 1, so 
that my classes A and a correspond to his grade 11 in 
column N, my classes B and 6 to the difference between 
his grades 22 and 11, my C and ¢ to that between his 
grades 33 and 22, and so on. 
The other is as a test, whether or no a group of events 
are due to the same general causes ; because, if they are, 
their classification will afford numbers that correspond with 
those in the table ; otherwise they will not. This test has 
been employed in pp. 26, 27,and 29. The method of con- 
ducting the comparison is easily to be understood by the 
following example, the figures of which I take from 
Quetelet. It seems that 487 observations of the Right 
Ascension of the Polar Star were made at Greenwich 
between 1836 and 1839, and are recorded in the publica- 
tions of the Observatory, after having been corrected for 
precession, nutation, &c., and subject only to errors of 
observation. If they are grouped into classes separated by 
grades of 0°5 sec. the numbers in each of these classes will 
be as shown in Column III. page 365. We raise them 
‘in the proportion of 1,000 to 487 in order to make the 
ratios decimal, and therefore comparable with the figures 
in Quetelet’s table, and then insert them in Column IV. 
These tell us that it has been found by a pretty large 
experience, that the chance of an observation falling within 
the class of — 0°5 sec. from the mean, is 150 to 1,000; of 
its falling within the class of — 1-0 sec. is 126 to 1,000; 
and so on, for the rest. This information is analogous to 
that given in Column M of Quetelet’s table, and we shall 
now proceed to calculate from IV. the Column V. which is 
analogous to Quetelet’s N. The method of doing so is, 
however, different. N was formed by adding the entries in 
M from the average outwards ; we must set to work in the 
converse way, of working from the outside inwards, because 
the exact mean is not supposed to have been ascertained, 
and also because this method of working would be 
more convenient, even if we had ascertained the mean. 
Now, wherever the mean may lie in a symmetrical series,

the chance is 500 to 1,000 against an observation being on 
one specified side of it—say the minus side. Therefore 
Column IV. by showing that no observation lies outside 
the class — 3°5 sec. tacitly states that it is 500 to 1,000 
(or 500 to 1:00) that any observation will lie between 
— 35 sec. and the mean; °500 is therefore written in 
Column V. opposite — 3°5 sec. Again, as according to IV. 
there are only 2 cases in the class — 3'5 sec. it is (500 — 
2=) 498 to 1,000 that any observation will lie between 
class — 3:0 sec. and the average, and 498 is written in 
Column V. opposite to— 3:0 sec. Similarly (498 — 12 
=) ‘486 is written opposite to — 2°5 sec. and we proceed in 
this way until we fall within the observations that form 
part of the group of the mean, 168 in number. Our 
remainder is 68 ; it ought, strictly speaking, to be equal to 
one half of 168, or 84; we therefore may conclude that 
the mean has been taken a trifle too high. | 
A calculation made in exactly the same way, from + 
3°5 sec. inwards to the mean, will take in the other portion 
of the mean group, namely, 100. Now we compare our 
results with Quetelet’s Column N, and see to which of his 
grades the numbers in our Column V. are severally equal ; 
the grades in question are written in Column VI. In 
proportion as these observations are strictly accordant with 
the law of deviation from a mean, so the intervals between 
the grades in Column VI. will approach to equality. What 
they actually are, is shown in Column VII. We cannot 
expect the two extreme terms to give results of much 
value, because the numbers of observations are too few; 
but taking only the remainder into consideration, we find 
that the average interval of 6°5 is very generally adhered to. 
Now, then, let us see what the numbers in the classes 
would have been by theory if, starting either from 2°5 (a 
little lower than 2'6, as we agreed it ought to be) above 
the average, or from 4, below it, we construct a series o: 
classes, according to Quetelet’s grades, having a common 
interval of 6:5. Column VIII. shows what these classes| 
would be; Column IX. shows the corresponding figures| 
taken directly from Quetelet’s N, and Column X. gives the 
difference between these figures, which are so closel

accordant with the entries in Column IV., as to place it’ 
beyond all doubt that the errors in the Greenwich observa- 
tions are strictly governed by the law of a deviation from 
an average. 
It remains that I should say a very few words on the 
principle of the law of deviation from an average, or, as 
it is commonly called, the law of Errors of Observations, 
due to La Place. Every variable event depends on a 
number of variable causes, and each of these, owing to. 
the very fact of its variability, depends upon other vari- 
ables, and so on step after step, till one knows not where 
to stop. Also, by the very fact of each of these causes 
being a variable event, it has a mean value, and, therefore, 
it is (I am merely altering the phrase), an even chance in 
any case, that the event should be greater or less than the 
mean. Now, it is asserted to be a matter of secondary 
moment to busy ourselves in respect to these minute 
causes, further than as to the probability of their exceeding 
or falling short of their several mean values, and the 
chance of a larger or smaller number of them doing so, in 
any given case, resembles the chance, well known to cal- 
culators, of the results that would be met with when 
making a draw out of an urn containing an equal quantity 
of black and white balls in enormous numbers. Each ball 
that is drawn out has an equal chance of being black or 
white, just as each subordinate event has an equal chance 
of exceeding or falling short of its mean value. I cannot 
enter further here into the philosophy of this view; it 
has been discussed by many writers, and the subject is 
still inexhausted. 
A table, made on the above hypothesis, has been con- 
structed by Cournot, and will be found in the Appendix, 
p. 267, of Quetelet’s “ Letters on Probabilities” (translated 
by Downes ; Layton & Oo., 1849), but it does not extend 
nearly so far as that of M. Quetelet. The latter is cal- 
culated on a very simple principle, being the results of 
drawing 999 balls out of an urn, containing white and 
black balls in equal quantities and in enormous numbers. 
His grade No. 1 is the case of drawing 499 white and 500 
black, his 2 in 498 white and 501 black, and so on, the
-P-A-G-E-398
  368 APPENDIX 
  
80" being 420 white and 579 black. It makes no sensible 
difference in the general form of the results, when these 
large numbers are taken, what their actual amount may be. 
The value of a grade will of course be very different, but 
almost exactly the same quality of curve would be obtained 
if the figures in Quetelet’s or in Cournot’s tables were 
protracted. All this is shown by Quetelet in his com- 
parison of the two tables.

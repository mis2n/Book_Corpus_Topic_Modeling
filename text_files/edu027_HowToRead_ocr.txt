  “5 HOW TO READ Se 
CHAPTER I 
LEARNING TO READ 
I 
A Few months ago I happened to be present 
at a dinner where a chance question led to an 
interesting talk. Some phase of primary edu- 
cation was under discussion; and in the course 
of it the host, turning to one of the guests, 
asked, ‘When did you learn to read?” 
“At three,” was the prompt reply, given 
with a touch of pride. 
“ And you?” said the host to the next guest. 
“Oh, I don’t know. About five, I suppose.” 
“And you?” to a lady beyond. 
There was a moment’s embarrassed hesita- 
tion. And then, with something about scarlet 
fever, came the confession that she had not 
learned her letters till she was nine. 
And thus it went, halfway round the table. 
I

Now these replies were direct and perti- 
nent. They were categorical answers to a 
technical question. Taken separately, they 
gave the exact information asked for. 
And yet, as they piled up, one after the 
other, there seemed to be something about 
them that I found myself vaguely resenting. 
It was not what they said. It was, rather, a 
discernible common denominator of implica- 
tion in their manner of saying it. 
It seemed as though these people were 
leaving out of account all the other-than- 
technical meanings of the phrase with which 
they dealt, not because they were consciously 
excluding these deeper meanings for the mo- 
ment, but because they unconsciously ignored 
them at all times. 
There was a cumulative inflection of finality 
in their declarations. It almost sounded as 
though, in dealing with the primary-school 
meaning of “learning to read,” they felt that 
they had-dealt with the whole meaning of that 
expression. And while it never entered my 
head at the moment that this was really true, 
the fact that it was somehow being made to 
appear true struck me as amusing. It struck 
2
-P-A-G-E-11
  
  LEARNING TO READ 
me as amusing enough to call attention to. 
And so, presently, when the host asked me 
when J had learned to read, I answered with a 
smile that I was still learning. 
And to my utter astonishment it developed, 
in the chaffing and talk that followed, that no 
single member of that largely literary and 
more or less intellectual company had ever 
thought of the expression “learning to read” 
as having any other meaning than the tech- 
nical, primary-school meaning; that, namely, 
of learning the alphabet, learning to recog- 
nize words made out of the alphabet, learning 
the dictionary meanings of more, and more, 
and still more words, and thus learning to 
receive messages sent by print or handwriting. 
No one of them, it turned out, had ever 
asked himself what it is, exactly, that we do 
when we read. No one of them had ever 
watched himself in the act of reading. And 
all of them, in consequence, had retained in- 
tact the careless assumption that reading is 
essentially a receptive process. They all looked 
upon it, let us say, as though print were a 
sort of silent telephone, into one end of which 
an author delivers a message, and from the 
3  
-P-A-G-E-12
  HOW TO READ 
other end of which (by simply “knowing how 
to read’’) his audience receives it. 
Now, as a matter of fact, and as we shall see 
presently, this is not true at all. It is not even 
an inadequate statement of the facts; it is 
a misstatement of them. And when I had 
pointed out something of this, — when I had, 
hurriedly, and to the poor best of my sur- 
prised unpreparedness, mobilized a few argu- 
ments and illustrations in defense of what I 
had regarded as a neutralized axiom, — we 
began, in the course of the give-and-take of the 
talk that followed, to make discoveries. And 
we continued, excitedly and joyously, to make 
them until 1 a.m. 
We discovered that the common-school 
definition of “learning to read” is so univer- 
sally accepted as the whole definition, that, 
while almost every newspaper and magazine 
publishes regular articles on what to read, 
none of them, so far as any of us knew, ever 
publishes articles on how to read. We discov- 
ered that, while there is a whole literature of 
books about books, — about what books it 
behooves us to read, and why it behooves us 
to read them, and what (according to the 
4
-P-A-G-E-13
  
LEARNING TO READ 
author) it behooves us to read into them, — 
there is little or nothing in the whole literature 
about literature that tells us anything at all 
about how we have to read books and what it 
is that we have to read into them. We discov- 
ered — But, enough! What we are here con- 
cerned with is thelast discovery that we made; 
the discovery upon which, so to say, the in- 
quiry culminated and broke up; the discovery 
that I have tried to summarize in a sentence 
on the title-page of this book. 
We discovered that reading, so far from 
being a merely receptive act, is a creative proc- 
ess. That it is “creative,” not simply in the 
more or less cant-sodden “artistic” sense, but 
in a biologic sense as well. That it is an active, 
largely automatic, purely personal, construc- 
tive functioning. That it is, indeed, a species 
of anabolism. In short, that it is a form of liv- 
ing. And as this last expression will be found, 
as we proceed, progressively to absorb and 
adequately to sum up the essence of our suc- 
cessive conclusions, I will put it that it is this 
last “discovery”? —the discovery of reading as 
a form of living — that I propose to examine 
and hope to elucidate in the following pages.

  HOW TO READ 
And now, having said this much by way of 
introduction; having, as it were, established 
a mental take-off; let us, like sensible swim- 
mers, dive at once into the deepest pool that 
our preliminary subject affords. 
It 
Until ten or twelve years ago, no man who 
ever lived could tell another man a story. 
Tam sorry to begin by making so obviously 
idiotic a statement. But I have two excuses 
for doing so. One (which I merely mention in 
passing) is that the statement is literally true. 
The other (upon which I want to lay all pos- 
sible emphasis) is that the trueness of this 
truth is of the essence of our inquiry. 
Allow me, therefore, to repeat the state- 
ment. 
From the beginning of time, right down 
until about ten years ago, no man ever lived 
who could tell another man a story. Moses 
could n’t. Homer could n’t. Chaucer could 
n’t. The minstrels and minnesingers could n’t. 
Dante could n’t. Dickens could n’t. Even 
Conan Doyle could n’t. 
The best that the very best of them ever 
6 
   
-P-A-G-E-15
LEARNING TO READ 
succeeded in doing was to trick, or to coax, or 
to compel their readers or their hearers into 
telling stories to themselves. 
“Pshaw!” you are very likely going to ex- 
claim at this point. “Here is a man pretend- 
ing to explain one idiotic statement by making 
another.” And perhaps it does look that way. 
But, before we continue the discussion, let us 
take a few minutes off and go to the movies. 
It 
That stirring photo-play, “The Two Rat- 
tlesnakes,” is on the bill. 
We scuttle down the darkened aisle and 
slip into some vacant seats near the front. 
There is a little hissing splutter overhead. 
A flickering green frame, with “Jim MEETS A 
RatTLER” inside it, springs into view on the 
dim curtain. And a moment later the entire 
audience, and we with them, have settled 
down into an eager, yet perfectly passive, re- 
ceptivity, and are looking (through a hole in 
the darkness) at the arid slope of an Arizona 
sheep-ranch, where a cowboy with a lamb in 
his arms and an old ewe at his heels is picking 
his way down the rocky and cactus-grown 
7

hillside. On he comes, twisting and turning; 
near enough now for us to see the litheness of 
his limbs and his cheery eyes. Then, suddenly, 
there is a blur of motion at his feet. Asnaky 
something launches its length and strikes for 
a second at his knee. Bewilderment, horror, 
realization, chase each other across his face. 
We see him drop the lamb; snatch out a knife; 
rip away the cloth; slash the naked flesh; bend 
to suck the poison from the wound. We 
watch him make a tortion bandage from the 
kerchief at his neck. We watch him start, 
limping, down the hill. We watch him waver, 
and stumble, and stop to rest with his hand on 
a boulder. We watch him press on; and fall; 
and get up; and struggle on again. We see 
him fall, and fail to rise. We see him, with a 
last spurt of strength, pull his six-shooter 
from its holster; fire three slow shots in the 
air; and drop back into unconsciousness. And 
we see a little cloud of distant dust turn into 
the mounted figures of his friends; see them 
ride furiously up; leap to the ground; gather 
round him; examine his hurt; lift his inert 
body to a horse’s back, and ride away — just 
as the hole in the darkness disappears and 
8

we find ourselves back again in the dim-lit, 
crowded hall. 
Now it would be nice to sit out the show. 
To see how “Mote certs THE News” — 
Mollie in her Harlem flat; with her sleeves 
rolled up above her plump forearms; inter- 
rupted in the act of touching a moist finger to 
a hot iron by the coming of a telegram — 
Jim bitten by a*rattler. Come at once.” To 
see her drag a chair to the corner cupboard; 
take down the old teapot; empty its contents 
on the ironing-board; stuff the money into 
her purse; put on her wraps and go. To see 
her, in the next reel, poring over time-tables 
in an emigrant sleeper; while the other rattle- 
snake —a human one— watches her from 
across the aisle. To see him scrape acquaint- 
ance with her; learn her story; get out maps; 
offer suggestions; finally send a telegram of 
his own— ‘“‘Meet me at Dry Gulch with the 
buckboard.” To see her whisked behind fast 
horses to the cattle-thieves’ camp. To see 
the cowboy raid; the timely rescue; the ride 
to the ranch; the reunited lovers. To see the 
human rattler tied hand and foot and tossed 
(on the same hillside that Jim came down 
9

  HOW TO READ 
in the beginning) into the center of a grim- 
faced circle and within reach of a coiled 
something that writhes, and springs, and 
dashes obscene fangs against his contorted 
face. 
But we have n’t time for that. We must 
get back to our discussion. Let us slip out 
quietly while the hall is dark. 
Iv 
Do you happen to know how the movies are 
made? : 
They begin, like any other piece of fiction, 
in the mind of a man who has told himself a 
story. Having done so, he undertakes, by 
means of a short piece of descriptive writing 
(called a scenario) to guide the imagination of 
his readers along the road his own imagina- 
tion has followed. And this scenario is sub- 
mitted to a movie-manager, who, if he likes 
it, buys it and turns it over to his producing 
department. 
Now the producing department of a moy- 
ing-picture concern is a remarkable establish- 
ment. It has a long list of actors at its beck 
and call. It has storehouses full of stage prop- 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  LEARNING, TO READ 
erties. It has clothes-presses full of costumes. 
It has a card index of “likely places.” It has 
a corps of mechanics to do its bidding. And 
when the scenario of an author’s story is 
turned over to the directing intelligence of 
this establishment, he chooses actors for it 
from his troupe. He supplies them with cos- 
tumes from his cupboards. He draws stage 
properties from his stores. He selects scenes 
from his card index. He has his mechanics 
‘provide effects that are not in stock. And 
finally, before the recording eye of the camera, 
he proceeds — well or ill according to his 
ability and his resources — to re-tell the au- 
thor’s story in the concrete terms of his own 
equipment. ; 
And for us who sit in the audience his re- 
telling — his reading of the story — is final. 
You may know a hillside far more picturesque 
than the one Jim comes down. But you can- 
not substitute it, in your mind, for the movie- 
man’s hillside. J may know a girl a dozen 
times more Molly-ish than the Mollie of the 
film. But I cannot cast her for Mollie’s part 
in “The Two Rattlesnakes.” The movie- 
man is reading the author’s story, not we.

For the moment he stands, like St. Peter, at 
the gates of our imaginations. What he 
chooses is chosen. What he puts in is in. 
What he leaves out is out. 
He is the first man who has told another 
man a story since the world began. 
“But,” you are perhaps exclaiming, “how 
then about the others? How about Virgil? 
And Cervantes? And Balzac? And — Marie 
Corelli?” 3 
Every one of them, from the least to the 
greatest, has but written for the movies. 
Not for the movies of the photo-theater, but 
for the movies of our minds. 
For a novel is nothing but an elaborate 
scenario. And each of us is a moving-picture 
concern. 
When we examine a book at a bookstore; 
when we look at the opening sentences, and 
read a snatch of conversation on page 247, 
and turn back to the last page to see how it 
all ends, —a scenario has been submitted 
to the manager. When we pay down our 
$1.35, or present our library card to be 
stamped,— we have purchased the local 
rights in it. And when we switch on our 
12
-P-A-G-E-21
  LEARNING TO READ 
electric reading-lamp, and stretch out in our 
favorite chair, and open the book at the first 
chapter, — we turn the tale over to our pro- 
ducing department. 
And the producing department of a human 
moving-picture concern is also a remarkable 
establishment. : 
All the people we have ever known, plus 
thousands we have spoken to, or crossed eyes 
with in a crowd, or watched in public places, 
or merely glimpsed in passing, are actors at 
its beck and call. And it can, moreover, pick 
and choose, not only among these actors, but 
among their attributes. It can, and that in 
the twinkling of an eye, take a chance ex- 
pression on the face of one’s best friend, the 
body of a blacksmith seen years since at a 
country crossroad, the mustache of yester- 
day’s organ-grinder, and the eyes of last 
year’s cotillion leader, and cast the composite 
of them (together with the composite sug- 
gestion of personality that results) as the 
villain of a piece. 
It, too, has memory storehouses full of 
stage properties; mental cupboards crammed 
with costumes; a brain-cell index of likely 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  HOW TO READ 
places. It, too, has a marvelous mechanic, 
called Imagination, that contrives effects that 
are not in stock out of odds and ends of raw 
material. 
And when a story-teller’s scenario is sub- 
mitted to it, the directing mind of this estab- 
lishment — contriving, as they are needed, 
actors from this troupe; stage properties from 
these stores; costumes from these cupboards; 
scenes from this cell catalogue — proceeds, 
paragraph by paragraph and page by page, 
before the estimating eye of our intelligence, 
and well or ill according to its ability and 
its resources, to re-tell the author’s story in the 
recollective and imaginative and emotional terms 
of its own equipment. 
v 
Do you, by any chance, doubt this? 
If so, I have a confession to make. I have, 
deliberately and with malice aforethought, 
deceived you. The photo-play performance 
of “The Two Rattlesnakes” never took 
place. There never has been such a photo-play. 
I made that all up “as I went along,” as 
the children say. And I placed before you, 
14
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  LEARNING TO READ 
not a story, but only the skeleton of a story — 
the merest dry bones of a half-finished sce- 
nario. 
Yet I’ll warrant that in reading it you 
pictured to yourself a Jim of your own fancy- 
ing, walking down a hillside of your own in- 
vention. That you contrived a Mollie to your 
own liking and placed her in a flat of your 
own furnishing. That at the last you in- 
vested the horrid death of the villain with 
emotions dictated by your own temperament. 
That you either exulted in a punishment that 
so poetically fitted the crime, or shuddered to 
see men, made in God’s image, capable of such 
horrors. 
Is it not so? 
Moreover, when you stop to consider it, 
you will see that this cannot be otherwise. 
The terms of one’s own equipment are the 
only terms in which a story can reach us. 
For the heroine that the author imagined is 
forever invisible to us, no matter how mi- 
nutely he describes her. And though his scene 
for the moment be Chicago, and though we 
chance to live there, it is in owr Chicago, and 
not in his, that we stage that chapter of his 
15  
-P-A-G-E-24
  HOW TO READ 
tale. Indeed, if he describes a character too 
minutely, — if he keeps our minds too long 
from imagining their own protagonists in the 
effort to imagine his, — our minds end by 
shrugging their shoulders, going on strike, 
and refusing to imagine any. And it is for the 
same reason that we so often skip elaboratt 
descriptions of scenery, and that meticulously 
word-painted landscapes commonly prove in- 
visible to the eyes of our imaginations. 
Nor is it alone to the things of the senses 
that this inexorable law applies. It is the 
same with less tangible stage properties. 
When we are called upon to “register” hor- 
ror, we have only our own brands of that 
emotion to register. When a mental attitude 
is asked of us, we can but place our own 
minds, like lay figures, in, or somewhere near, 
the posture demanded. And if the specifica- 
tions of our author’s scenario include a spirit- 
ual reaction, we must either supply it, or a 
substitute for it, from the laboratory of our 
own spirit, or else pass on, saying in effect (as 
the motion-picture man would say in the 
vernacular), “Kill that soul stuff!”

But let us go back for a moment to that be- 
ginning which we have skipped. Let us go 
back to the nursery and to our own “learning 
to read.” 
Let us suppose that you have just mastered 
your letters (or, if you happen to belong to 
the later order, that you have not mastered 
them) and that you are about to receive your 
first lesson in reading. 
A book is placed before you, open at the 
first page. 
On this page is the woodcut of an animal. 
And below that are the mystic hieroglyphics, 
SEE THE Cat. 
Do you see what has happened? 
Do you perceive the significance — the 
practical symbolism — of this performance? 
Do you see that at the very threshold of 
“learning to read,” even in the restricted, 
common-school sense of learning to interpret 
an arbitrary code of black marks on white 
paper, there has been placed before you, as a 
symbol of what you are to do, the moving pic- 
ture reduced to its simplest form? Do you see 
17  
-P-A-G-E-26
  HOW TO READ 
that in effect, and by the silent pantomime 
of that juxtaposition, they are saying to you, 
“Visualize, darn you!”? 
But perhaps you will balk at this interpre- 
tation. 
Let us, therefore, suppose again. 
Let us suppose that there is no house cat in 
your home. 
Let us suppose that the weeks have gone by 
and that you have learned to read many pages 
in your picture primer; and that one fine 
morning, on a pictureless page in another 
book, you come across again those now famil- 
iar characters, SEE THE Cat. 
What happens now? 
Why, instantly and inevitably you visualize 
the woodcut. 
Why? Because it is the only cat you have 
in stock; and so, willy-nilly, you cast it for the 
hero of the sentence. You have, in short, on a 
ridiculously inadequate capital, begun your 
own career as a moving-picture concern. 
Let us pursue the inquiry. 
Let us suppose that you go for a few weeks’ 
visit to some cousins in the country, and that 
one of them has a Maltese kitten. 
18
-P-A-G-E-27
LEARNING TO READ 
And let us suppose that on your return, 
fearing perhaps that you had forgotten your 
lessons, they put that old primer in your 
hand, open at the first page. 
What happens this time? 
Do you accept the woodcut? 
Not you. As you take in the words Srr THE 
Car, your mind presents you, unasked, the 
picture of a blue-gray kitten, the extreme tip 
of its tail twitching back and forth above the 
grass, and one curved paw tapping a red apple 
just fallen in the orchard. And with this pic- 
ture comes a swift sense of soft winds; and 
just a taste of cider. 
You have, you see, increased the capital of 
your moving-picture establishment and are 
already exercising your prerogatives as a 
producing manager. You have just rejected 
with scorn the illustrator’s offer to supply 
your equipment. You are telling the author’s 
story yourself. 
VII 
And now I think that we are ready to sum 
p- 
Or, shall we put it that we have now 
19  
-P-A-G-E-28
    
HOW TO READ 
acquired the equipment necessary to read 
what follows? For that, after all, is what we 
really mean. 
We read, then, quite literally, with our own 
experience. We read with what we have seen 
and heard and smelled and tasted and felt. 
We read with the emotions we have had — 
with the love we have loved, the fear we have 
feared, the hate we have hated. We read with 
the observations we have made and the de- 
ductions we have drawn from them; with 
the ideas we have evolved and the ideals we 
have built into them; with the sympathies we 
have developed and the prejudices we have 
failed to rid ourselves of. 
“Learning to read” in the common-school 
sense — learning, let us put it, to read print 
and learning to read handwriting — has ex- 
actly as much (and exactly as little) to do 
with our reading of a novel as it has with 
Forbes-Robertson’s “‘reading” of Shake- 
speare. | 
Learning to read, in the real sense, means 
enlarging our equipment, and learning, cre- 
atively, to use it. ‘ 
We receive in reading; but we receive, not 
20
-P-A-G-E-29
    LEARNING TO READ 
directly by what the author tells us, but in- 
directly, by the new uses that he stimulates 
_ gs into putting our experience to. 
For reading consists of our making — with 
the aid of the pattern and the hints supplied 
by the author, but out of owr mental stock, 
which we have produced by living — some- 
thing that never existed before; something 
that only exists at all in so far as we make it; 
something that can never be duplicated by 
any other reader; something that we ourselves 
can never wholly reproduce. 
Reading is a copartnership. What we re- 
ceive from it is in the nature of dividends on a VY 
joint investment.

“Yes,” I seem to hear some one saying, 
“this is very interesting and quite true — 
about fiction. But how about a philosophic 
treatise? How about an abstract sociological 
argument? How about a discussion of scien- 
tific principles?” 
It is all quite as true of these kinds of read- 
ing as it is of a novel, or of a magazine story, 
or of a newspaper account of a fire. 
21
-P-A-G-E-30
  HOW TO READ 
You can no more put a new idea into a 
person’s head than you can tell him a story. 
All that you can do is to stimulate him into 
making new combinations out of the ideas 
already there. 
“But how, then,” I seem to hear the same 
objector saying, “do new ideas get into peo- 
ple’s heads, if you cannot put them there?” 
The answer to this is Topsy’s: They grow. 
I recall the tale of a servant who was a 
most dependable agent for doing anything 
that she had once been shown how to do, but 
who (or so her bachelor employer thought) 
had never had an original idea in her head 
since she was born. But it happened that one 
of her acquired accomplishments was the 
making of ice-cream. And one hot day in 
summer, when a thunderstorm had unex- 
pectedly sent the mercury tumbling down 
into the sixties, he was suddenly confronted, 
not only with a squat figure standing in his 
study door, but with the complete destruction 
of his theory. 
“Say!” his servant was saying, “if I turn 
the handle backward will it unfreeze the 
cream?”

The truth is that our heads house other in- 
dustries beside that of moving-picture making 
And one of these is a distillery. 
Here the raw materials of crude experience 
— like, say, the jerking of a burned finger out 
of the flame — are treated by a secret process 
and “ideas” — like the idea that fire is hot — 
are extracted from them. You cannot, as most 
of us know from experience, put the idea that 
fire is hot into a child’s head. The best that you 
can do is to supervise the delivery of the raw ex- 
perience at the gate of the distillery. 
But we are more than distillers of low-grade 
ideas — of these comparatively crude, first- 
hand realizations. 
We are blenders and rectifiers of these as 
well. 
We combine two or more of them and from 
the mixture we distill a sublimated extract— 
the idea, say, of a resemblance. We combine 
a number of these ideas of resemblance and

made products of our distillery — becomes a 
permanent item of our stock in trade. Each of 
them is, so to say, stored away in its own bot- 
tle, ready for use in our further experiments. 
And these further experiments — these 
combinings of ideas that we have in stock — 
are by no means always made on our own 
initiative. They are often—more often than 
otherwise — made on order, or by suggestion. 
Smith meets Jones in the subway and they 
have a little chat. 
Later, Smith says to his wife, ‘Keen chap, 
that Jones. He gave me a new idea to-day.” 
But of course he did n’t. 
What Jones gave him was a formula. 
He suggested that if Smith would take 
some of the Idea in Bottle 68, and some of the 
Idea in Bottle 7042, and mix them, he’d get 
such and such a result. And Smith did. And 
he got it. 
But, suppose Smith had n’t had the ingredi- : 
ents in stock? 
x 
Let us take our own case. 
When you began this chapter, you quite 
24
-P-A-G-E-33
  LEARNING TO READ 
definitely did n’t have in your head several 
ideas that are now there. 
You did n’t, for instance, have in your head 
the idea that authors do not tell us stories; 
that they only issue instructions to us for 
telling ourselves stories; that they only write 
“scenarios” for us to “produce.” 
How, then, did this idea get into your head? 
Not, certainly, by my putting it there. 
If you are inclined, for the moment, to 
think that I did this, you have only to turn 
back to section 11 of this chapter in order to 
see how you felt toward it, and what you 
thought of me, when I pretended to think that 
I could put this idea into your head. 
No. I did n’t put it there. I could n’t. 
All that I could do was to furnish you, in 
the proper order, the various formule needed 
for distilling it; to see that you were supplied, 
on occasion, with certain necessary raw ma~- 
terials; and to stimulate you, from time to 
time, to make certain combinations out of 
these ingredients. 
I knew, for instance, that you were going 
to need the idea that there were two meanings 
to the expression “learning to read”; and I 
25
-P-A-G-E-34
  HOW TO READ 
was afraid that you might not have this idea 
in stock. So I suggested that you take a 
number of ideas that I knew you could supply 
from stock —the ideas of an inquisitorial 
host; of a series of guests, each of whom 
thought in his own way that he had learned 
to read, once for all, when he was a child; and 
of one guest who thought that he had n’t — 
I suggested that you take these simple ideas 
and mix them in a certain way. And you did 
as I suggested and got the desired result — 
the more complex idea. 
And I took pains to “stimulate you into 
making this new combination of ideas that 
were already on hand.” 
That was a part of my job as author. 
I did it, in this case, by inducing you to 
dramatize the ideas; by inducing you to im- 
agine people holding these ideas, or enacting 
them. In fine, I did it by inventing this din- 
ner party; which, like the photo-play of “The 
Two Rattlesnakes,” never took place. 
But the dinner party and the photo-play 
were invented for entirely different reasons. 
In the latter case I knew that you were going 
to need the idea that we read in terms of our 
26 “

LEARNING TO READ 
own equipment and not in terms of the author's 
equipment; and I was also afraid that you did 
not have this idea in stock. 
But this is an idea that is not easily derivable 
from the mixing of other, simpler ideas. This 
is an idea that we get best first-hand, from 
experience — by actually doing the thing 
and watching ourselves doit. It is practically 
one of those realization-ideas, like the idea 
that fire is hot. Its extreme complexity is due 
to the extreme complexity of the experience 
itself. 
So I took measures to supply you with the 
experience. 
I wrote a scenario and I tricked you into 
“producing” it. 
And then, while the experience was fresh in 
your mind, I called your attention to what 
you had done. 
xI 
Philosophy or fiction, then, it is all one. 
Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason” is as 
much a scenario as is Stevenson’s “Treasure 
Island.” They merely call for different equip- 
ments to “produce” them.

Reading either of them is a partnership 
transaction between the author and ourselves. 
And in either case our dividends will depend 
upon (1) the amount of our contributed capi- 
tal; and (2) upon the number and the nature 
of the “turn-overs” we are stimulated into 
making with it.

Looxine up at my calendar as I begin this _

to-night. I am going to the theater. 
L also notice that it is the first of April. And 
I wonder, in passing, whether this is a coinci-

guides our beginnings, rough-hew them as we 
will. At any rate, the day is well lit upon. To 
talk of the dictionary on April Fools’ Day is 
as appropriate as to wear green on the seven- 
teenth of March. 
However, let us get back to my engage-

The play we are going to see has made a 
great hit. We had to get tickets weeks in ad- 
vance. The house will be packed to the roof. 
Suppose I jump up on my seat in the mid-

What does your imagination suggest as the 
result?

and a few still bodies. sprawled in the empty 
aisles? 
Probably. 
And what would have been responsible for 
all this? 
Terror. Instant, unreasoned, irresistible 
terror. 
And what would have caused this terror? 
An idea. 
And what would have detonated this idea, 
like a bomb, in five hundred minds at once? 
A shouted word. 
Surely, this must be a very terrible word? 
A word with a most immemorial, definite,

II 
But hold on a minute. 
It happens that Jim Sedgworth dined with 
me last night. 
30 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  
  MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
You don’t know Jim. But he is one of those 
big, blue-eyed, absent-minded, intensely-in- 
earnest fellows, whose greatest joy in life is to 
pounce on an idea and worry it. Jim treats an 
idea exactly as though he were a bull pup and 
it were the corner of a sofa cushion. 
Well, when we’d finished dinner, and I had 
given Jim a cigar, and he’d cut the end off of 
it; I saw, by the way he searched his pockets, 
and by the puzzled frown between his eyes as 
“he talked (he had just gotten an idea by the 
ear and was beginning to growl at it), that he 
had left his matches at home. So I caught the 
butler’s eye; and he, presently, brought a little 
alcohol lamp and stood at Jim’s side with it. 
But Jim had his idea by the throat by then 
and did n’t notice. 
“Fire, Sir,” said the man. 
Jim paid no attention. And yet, curiously 
enough, I noticed that his hand stopped grop- 
ing in his pockets. 
“Fire, Sir,” said the butler, again, a little 
louder. 
Jim did n’t seem to notice, even yet. He 
did n’t start. He did n’t look round and say, 
“Oh — yes — thank you.” He went right on 
31
-P-A-G-E-40

talking. He gave his idea a final shake. He 
disdainfully tossed the carcass of it on to the 
table between us, as who should say, “Re- 
suscitate that if you can.” And then, his eyes 
fixed on mine, he leaned a little sideways to- 
ward the lamp. The frown disappeared from 
his forehead. With his eyes still on mine, he 
stuck the end of his cigar into the little blue 
flame. And he puffed. 
Now what caused Jim to stop groping for 
matches? 
What gradually wiped the perplexed frown 
from his face? 
What caused him, while his real attention 
was fixed on his argument and his eyes on me, 
to avail himself of the proffered lamp? 
Let us put it that these things were the re- 
sult of a slowly dawning sense of a need about 
to be supplied. 
And what caused this sense of approaching 
satisfaction? 
The gradual taking form of a vague idea in 
the back of his mind. * 
And what was it that prompted the slow 
generation of this idea in his half-conscious~ 
ness?

IV 
On second thought, however, and while the 
dictionary is being gotten down from the 
shelf for us, let me tell you what it is that I 
want to show you. 
We made, in the last chapter, some rather 
startling discoveries. 
We discovered, for instance, that authors 
do not, because they cannot, tell us stories or 
put new ideas into our heads. That they 
merely guide and prompt us, with varying 
33  
-P-A-G-E-42
  HOW TO READ. 
skill and effectiveness, in telling stories, and in 
building up ideas, for ourselves. 
* We discovered that books are, in reality, 
nothing but more-or-less elaborate scenarios 
— descriptions of the stories or syntheses that 
their authors want us to stage in our minds; 
and that the only material we have to draw 
upon for the “producing” of these scenarios 
is our own experience — the stored products 
of the living we have done. 
In fact, we discovered that reading, instead 
of being the comparatively passive and es- 
sentially receptive process that we are in the 
habit of considering it, is in reality an in- 
tensely personal and creative activity. 
We are, we found, astonishingly “on our 
own” when we read a book. 
But we have not, even yet, pushed our in- 
vestigations in this regard quite home. 
We have not, even yet, discovered how 
much “on our own” we really are when we 
read. 
For story scenarios are written in words. 
And while we have discovered where we get 
our stories, we have yet to discover where we 
get our word-meanings. 
34

MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
We have discovered that no man can tell us 
a story. 
We have yet to realize that no man can tell 
us the meaning of a word.

“What!” you are, of course, going to ex- 
claim at this point, “and how, then, about 
the dictionary?” 
Allow me to be as shocking as possible. The 
dictionary is the very Last place in which you 
will find this information. 
However, don’t think for a moment that I 
expect you to take my word for this. I quite 
realize that you do not believe me. But fortu- 
nately, and just in the nick of time, here 
comes the dictionary to speak for itself. 
Here is Funx anp Wacnatu’s New Stanp- 
arp Dicrionary oF THE Enciiso Lan- 
cuace. Let us resume our interrupted in- 
vestigation by seeing what it has to tell us. 
VI 
We were wanting to know whether the 
word “fire” as supposedly shouted in the 
theater, and the word “fire” as spoken to Jim 
35  
-P-A-G-E-44
  
HOW TO READ 
Sedgworth by the butler, were perhaps two 
different words that happened to be spelled 
alike. 
The dictionary tells us that the word “fire” 
only occurs twice in English; once as a verb, 
and once as a noun. And as both of these 
words, as used, are nouns, they must necessa- 
rily be the same word, used in different senses. 
At least one would suppose so. * 
Let us see, however, what the dictionary 
has to say. 
The dictionary gives fourteen or fifteen dif- 
ferent meanings for the noun “fire” and di- 
vides these into six groups. Here they are:— 
Firg. (1) The evolution of heat and light by 
combustion; also, the combustion 
thus manifested, especially the flame, 
or the fuel as burning. 
(2) The discharge of firearms; firing. 
(3) One or more sparks, especially as 
emitted by iron or stone when struck 
by a substance hard enough to tear it. 
(4) Any light, luster, or flash resembling 
fire. 
(5) Liveliness or intensity of thought, feel- 
ing, or action; ardor; passion; vivacity. 
(6) Any raging evil; a severe affliction; 
sore trial; as, the fires of persecution. 
36
-P-A-G-E-45
  
MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
Well? 
This does n’t seem to help us much, 
does it? 
There is manifestly but one of these mean- 
ings — but one of these fourteen or fifteen 
meanings divided into six groups — that in 
any remotest degree connects itself with my 
supposed cry in the theater. 
This is the last meaning in the first group: — 
the combustion thus manifested, especially 
the flame, or the fuel as burning. 
And there is but one of these meanings — 
but one of these fourteen or fifteen meanings 
divided into six groups — that in any remot- 
est degree connects itself with the butler’s 
proffer of the cigar-lighter. 
Namely, the last meaning in the first 
group :— 
the combustion thus manifested, especially 
the flame, or the fuel as burning. 
But, these are not different meanings! 
THESE ARE THE SAME MEANING! 
And not only that. 
This “dictionary meaning” does not, in 
either case, indicate in the remotest degree 
37
-P-A-G-E-46
  HOW TO READ 
the meaning actually conveyed by the word 
as used. 
Jim Sedgworth certainly could n’t have got- 
ten his meaning of the word as used by the 
butler from the dictionary. 
The theater audience to-night, should I 
shout that word from my seat during the 
third act, certainly would n’t get its meaning 
of it from the dictionary. 
Evidently, if we have nowhere to go for our 
word-meanings except to the dictionary, we 
are up a tree. 
vil 
As a matter of fact, however, we are merely 
up against two very interesting questions: — 
(1) Where do we get the meanings of words? 
(2) What is the function of the dictionary? 
Let us tackle the latter question first. And, 
to that end, let us begin by setting down, as 
clearly as we can, the meanings actually con- 
veyed by the word “fire” as used in these two 
cases. 
Let us put it that the meaning conveyed ta 
an audience by the word “Fire!” shouted in 
a theater would be something like this: — 
38 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
The frightful Theater-fire-death is upon us! We 
are trapped! Every man for himself! 
And let us put it that the meaning actually 
conveyed to Jim Sedgworth by “Fire, Sir,” 
as spoken by the butler, was something like 
this: — 
Sir, give over groping and frowning; the slight 
fire-service that you require is here at your 
elbow. 
If, now that we have them before us, we 
compare these two meanings; if we examine 
them carefully, but with an eye to-resem- 
blances rather than to differences; we shall 
find that they have one, and only one, ele- 
ment in common. In each the fire-notion is 
present. 
And if we now turn back to that vague 
“dictionary meaning” of the noun “fire,” 
which, of all the “dictionary meanings” 
given, we found to be the only one remotely 
connectible with either of these cases, and 
equally connectible with each of them; 
namely, — 
the combustion thus manifested, especially 
the flame, or the fuel as burning, — 
39 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  HOW TO READ 
we shall discover that it is, in reality, nothing 
but a definition of this fire-notion. 
Suppose, now, with this discovery in our 
minds, we reéxamine the six groups of mean- 
ings given by the dictionary for the noun 
“fire.” 
We shall find that they can be described, 
and summed up, as follows: — 
(1) The evolution of heat and Definitions of 
light by combustion; also the general

(6) Any raging evil; a severe Definitions of

In fine, we have hit upon the function of 
the dictionary; which is, not to give us the 
definite meanings of words as used, but to de- 
jine the root-ideas; the type-notions; the lowest 
common denominators of grouped meanings; 
for which words, by long usage and slow develop- 
ment, have come to stand. 
And this, as we shall see more clearly in a 
few moments, cannot, in the nature of things, 
be otherwise. For words, in themselves, — 
words, that is to say, without context, — do 
not possess definite meanings. They merely 
stand for generalized ideas. They are magic 
formulze— rubbed lamps— “Open Sesames!” 
— by which we command the presence of 
“notions” in one another’s minds.

It is possible that at first blush you doubt 
my soundness in making this statement. If 
so, I can refer you to the dictionary itself. 
For the dictionary knows this fact perfectly, 
— or, rather, partially, — but, for reasons of 
its own, does n’t force it on our notice. It 
prints it, in very small type, in a dark corner 
where you will be unlikely to come across it; 
but where, if accused of not knowing its own 
business, it could triumphantly point it out. 
On page 2730 of the New Standard Diction- 
ary, tucked away among some other com- 
ments on the word “word,” appears the fol- 
lowing: — 
In human language, all words, except proper 
names and some exclamations, are signs of gener- 
alized ideas, called notions. 
Please bear this statement of the diction- 
ary’s in mind. We will have occasion to refer 
to it later on. 
Ix 
And now for our other question: where do 
we get the meanings of words as actually 
used? 
42
-P-A-G-E-51
ce MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
We have already, as it happens, stumbled 
on the answer to this question also. We get 
the meanings of words, as actually used, from 
the context. 
The matter, however, is not quite so simple 
as this sounds. Let us look at it a bit more 
closely. 2 
Suppose I say to you, “I am going down 
town to get a down pillow.” 
My meaning, because of ‘the context, is 
perfectly clear to you in spite of the two 
“downs.” ; : 
Or you would probably say so. 
, But, is it? 
Do you, as a matter of fact, know what 
“down town” means to me? DoI know what 
it means to you? Do we understand the same 
thing, all the way through, by “down pil- 
low”? Or does “down pillow,” possibly, 
mean to you an aid to luxurious ease? To me, 
as it happens, it means a squashy nuisance 
that is forever shedding white fuzz on the 
back of my coat. 
In short, are the other words the whole of the 
context ? - 
Let us-see for ourselves. 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  ‘HOW TO READ 
Let us return for a moment to the crowded 
theater. 
Here we had a single word, shouted by it- 
self. Whence do these five hundred people 
get, at the same instant, the same meaning 
from this word? Not from the verbal context, 
since there is none. They get it from the ma- 
terial context:— from the big, crowded house, 
and the small, distant exits; from their com- 
mon knowledge of the horrors of theater fires; 
from the context, in short, of the shared situa- 
tion. 
But even this is not all. 
Up to a certain point — to the exact point 
up to which the situation is really shared — 
these people get a practically identical mean- 
ing from the shouted word. But each of them 
gets, also, a more definite meaning yet; a per- 
sonal meaning. - 
The little lady in G 34 gets the meaning 
that two babies at home will be motherless if 
she does n’t somehow get out before the rush. 
The big man in B, next seat but one to the 
aisle, gets the meaning that he must manhan- 
dle the flabby fellow at his right in order to 
get started while the going is good. 
44
-P-A-G-E-53
  MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
The fireman near the main exit gets the 
meaning that now at last he is “on duty” in 
deadly earnest. 
And so on, and so forth, through five hun- 
dred variations. 
In fact, the personal character and the 
private concerns of every man and woman in 
that theater are, for him or her self but for no 
one else, a part of the context. 
We ourselves, our endowments and deriva- 
tions, our past performances and present en- 
tanglements, in fine, the sum total of living 
that we have stored in us, are always and al- 
ways, forever and ever, a part of the context 
from which we derive the meaning of every 
word that we hear spoken or read in print. 
x 
“Learning to read,”*therefore, does not 
only mean increasing our stored experience, 
physical, mental, and spiritual; and learning 
to draw on these stores more and more skill- 
fully for the “producing” of our authors’ 
scenarios. It means, also, enlarging our “per- 
sonal contexts”; developing our responsive- 
ness to “verbal contexts”; and learning to 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  HOW TO READ 
draw more and more discriminatingly on 
these two sources for the word-meanings in 
which we interpret the directions that our succes- 
sive partners, the authors, issue to us. 
xI 
This, dramatically considered, would ap- 
pear to be the proper place to ring down the 
curtain on this chapter. But before doing this 
I want to be certain that you realize the ab- 
solute universality of the explanation above 
set forth. 
I chose the word “fire” to use as an illus- 
tration because it seemed convenient. But 
I might have chosen any one of the 349,999 
other words in the New Standard Dictionary. 
For they all, without exception, stand, in 
their respective degrees, for “generalized 
ideas called notions”; and it is invariably 
from the contexts — verbal, situational, per- 
sonal — that we derive the specific meanings 
which, in actual use, we individually assign to 
them. 
But I have more than a suspicion that you 
are still inclined to question this. You are, I 
dare swear, bursting at this very moment 
46
-P-A-G-E-55
  MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
with suggested exceptions. You are, I am 
certain, feeling around with the fingers of 
your mind for words — words that you know 
must exist — whose meanings are singular 
and absolute. 
Well, there are no such words. 
Not in practice at any rate. 
I defy you to find one, inside the dictionary 
or out. 
For they exist only in theory. And, even 
there, they are hard birds to get hold of. The 
only way to catch one is to put salt on its tail 
— the intellectual salt called metaphysics. 
xi 
“But,” you are doubtless wanting to remind 
me, “the dictionary itself expressly says that 
‘In human language, all words, except proper 
names and some exclamations, are signs of gen- 
eralized ideas called notions.’” 
Exactly. But, let me remind you in turn, 
we are engaged in muckraking the dictionary. 
And the dictionary is either less practically 
perspicacious than it thinks itself, or less in- 
tellectually honest than it pretends to be, in 
making this statement.

It either fails to realize that it is talking 
common sense in the unitalicized portion of 
the quoted sentence, and metaphysics in the 
italicized portion; or else it deliberately aban- 
dons, in practice, the double standard that it 
sets up in theory. For no one can detect the 
alleged difference of status between these 
classes of words by examining the text of the 
dictionary. 
Let us try for ourselves. 
Let us look up a proper name in the New 
Standard Dictionary (where proper names 
are listed, in ordinary alphabetical order, in 
the text); and then take the next, ordinary, 
word in the column; and compare the two. 
Suppose we take “Aristotle.” The next word 
after “Aristotle” is “aristotype.” Here is 
what the dictionary says about them: — 
Aristotle. A Greek philosopher (384-322 B.c.); 
pupil of Plato; teacher of Alexander the 
Great. 
Aristotype. Phot. A print made on paper treated 
as with mixed collodion and gelatin, 
capable of receiving a high polish. 
Well? How about it? Now that you have 
read what the dictionary has to say, is “aris- 
48
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  MUCKRAKING THE DICTIONARY 
totype” a “notion” to you and “Aristotle” 
not? 
Or, as a matter of cold, practical fact, is 
not your notion of “Aristotle” just as general- 
ized as it was before consulting the diction- 
ary, while your notion of “‘aristotype” has 
become a trifle more specific than formerly? 
xu 
But perhaps you think that Aristotle is not 
a fair selection. He has been dead such a long 
time that our notions of him are naturally 
hazy. 
Let us get into the twentieth century: into 
the lime-light. 
Let us put it that proper names run all the 
way from “John Doe,” which stands, by defi-

Roosevelt,” which stands, let us say, for 
A type of human being of which, “more’s the 
pity,” or “thank God!” (according to our per- 
sonal contexts) there happens to be but one.

years ago, that “night air” was the only kind 
of air we have to breathe—at night. I

would respectfully point out that a general- 
ized idea is the only idea we have, either of 
Mr. Aristotle or Mr. Roosevelt, and that 
“Aristotle” and ‘Teddy Roosevelt” stand 
for them. 
Words, after all, are but push-buttons. 
When we press them, they call up notions in 
other minds. When I push the button 
“Teddy,” it calls up a notion of Teddy in 
your mind. It does n’t call up my notion of 
him. It does n’t call up his notion of himself. 
It calls up that generalization which, at the 
moment, stands for your notion of him.

So much, then, for proper names. As for 
‘some exclamations,” the dictionary defines 
“OQ” as “an exclamation of lamentation.” 
It defines “‘Oh” as “a natural ejaculation 
evoked by sudden surprise.” 
It defines “Ah” as “‘an exclamation ex- 
pressing various emotions according” — in 
short, according to the context. 
And so on through the list. In short, it de- 
fines these words as standing for ideas that 
are merely a little more generalized than the

others. One can, for instance, imagine a fat 
and very self-satisfied dictionary exclaiming, 
“O!” or “Oh!!” or “Pshaw!” or even 
“Quch!” as these little mistakes are pointed 
out to it. 
You will find it an amusing game and a 
helpful exercise to take a list of words, — any 
words, like “spirituality,” “toward,” “hum- 
ble,” “angrily,” “diphthong,” “potato,” 
“Aristophanes,” “Humph!” —and satisfy 
yourself in each case of the relevancy of the 
facts set forth. 
You will find that they are all— nouns, 
verbs, adjectives, adverbs, proper names, ex- 
clamations, what-not — you will find that 
they are all “signs” alike; all signals, rubbed 
lamps, mental push-buttons. 
You will find that, as any one of them is | 
presented to you, a “notion” springs up in | 
your mind. | 
You will find that, while these notions dif- | 
fer in degree of vagueness (your “Humph!” 
notion will be vaguer than your “Aristoph- 
anes” notion, which, in turn, will be vaguer | 
than your “potato” notion), each of them

will prove, on examination, to be a “general- 
ized idea.” 
And you will find, finally, that each of these 
ideas is a generalization made from your own 
stored-up experience.

  CHAPTER III 
WATCHING THE WHEELS GO ROUND 
I 
Tr is not customary for authors to print their 
prefatory remarks at the beginning of the 
third chapter. But this, for reasons that will 
presently appear, is what I am about to do. 
The object of this book, briefly stated, is 
to help its readers to a more intelligent em- 
ployment of reading for their own individual 
ends — whatever those may be. 
But since this object, thus summarized, 
will seem to many to imply the setting forth 
of some definitely formulated technique, — 
of a specific formula that needs only to be fol- 
lowed, — there are no doubt those who are 
already looking to see this book’s instructions 
summed up for them in a set of cut-out-able, 
pin-up-able, memorizable, and try-it-on-a- 
dog-able rules. They are looking, let us say, 
for something analogous to those lists of in- 
structions commonly furnished us in treatises 
on “How to Grow Thin”: — so many of such 
53
-P-A-G-E-62
    
HOW TO READ 
and such stoopings and flexings before the 
morning tub; so many miles at a brisk walk 
after breakfast; so and so many tens and 
twenties and fifties of such and such rollings 
and toe-touchings before getting into bed; 
supplemented by carefully worked-out menus 
of what we may, and carefully compiled lists 
of what we may not, eat. 
If, however (from the personal contexts of 
your own preconceptions and desires), you 
have read any such expectation out of the 
title of this volume, it is only right that I 
should, in advance, disabuse your mind of the 
false hope. ; 
I do not propose to tell you that you must 
always, in reading, let the light fall on your 
book from behind, over your shoulder; that 
you should avoid stories of thrilling adventure 
and should pick out theological essays when 
you are trying to read yourself to sleep 0” 
nights: that half an hour, morning and eve- 
ning, is all that you ought to devote to the daily 
papers; and that you should keep a small edi- 
tion of the classics in your coat pocket to read 
while you are waiting in line at the box office 
of the movie-theater. I am not even going 
54
-P-A-G-E-63
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
to divulge to you that legendary secret of 
the professional “reader,” — that sea serpent 
among trade tricks, — by which it is said that 
the initiated are enabled to take in whole 
paragraphs and even whole pages of print at a 
glance; instead of plodding along, sentence by 
sentence, after the manner of the untaught. 
This volume, in short, contains no royal 
road to learning — not even learning to read. 
It contains a scenario which you, as my partner 
of the moment, are invited to “produce”? — the 
scenario of an inquiry, leading to conclusions. 
If you are inclined to protest that such a 
scenario must necessarily be lacking in ex- 
citement and essentially undramatic, I can 
only assure you that you are wrong. An in- 
quiry is first cousin to a detective story. A 
conclusion may be the most thrilling of dé- 
nouements. And no scenario of exploration, 
not even one that leads us to the sources of 
the Orinoco or lands us in the heart of Thibet, 
can be fuller of adventure, and more fraught 
with surprises and flavored with the wine of 
astonishment, than a voyage of investigation 
in that hermit kingdom — one’s own mind. 
If you protest further that you prefer 
55  
-P-A-G-E-64
  
HOW TO READ 
Romance, that you like to have your villains 
come up with and all the nice people married 
off in the last chapter, I can only assure you 
that in every chapter of this book one of 
the most tricky and treacherous villains — a 
false Notion — will be pursued and cornered 
and run through the vitals; that two Ideas of 
romantic proclivities (and of thoroughly eu- 
genic antecedents), which have been kept 
from mating by this villain aforesaid, will be 
led to the altar; and that the happiness-ever- 
after of these successive couples will be 
proved by the fact that the next chapter will 
deal with their children. 
If you still shrug your shoulders and say that 
this would appear to be a scenario for high- 
brows, I can only assure you that — quite on 
the contrary — it is a scenario for human be- 
ings; that it is for — because it is about — 
you and me and the man next door. 
Moreover, the plan of this scenario is very 
simple. First, it proposes to induce you (not 
through my eyes, but through your own) to 
see just how, whether we ever analyze the 
process or not, we all must and all do read. 
Next, it proposes to induce you, in similar 
56
-P-A-G-E-65
  
WATCHING THE WHEELS 
manner, to see just why, whether we are con- 
scious of the reasons or not, we any of us ever 
read at all. And finally, having led you to 
recognize for yourself the inherent limitations 
of this universal method of reading, and the 
latent possibilities that hide for each of us be- 
hind this universal desire to read, it proposes 
to induce you (out of your understanding, not 
out of mine) to formulate for yourself that at- 
titude toward reading that alone will enable 
you intelligently and consciously to adapt 
the means at hand to the development and 
furthering of your personal purposes. 
II 
We have already, in the preceding chap- 
ters, seen something of the unsuspected proc- 
esses by which we actually do read. We 
have located and identified the sources we 
draw upon for the scenery, the animals, the 
human characters, and the intellectual con- 
ceptions, in terms of which we “produce” an 
author’s scenario for ourselves. And we have 
located and identified the sources we draw 
upon for the meanings of the words in which 
these scenarios are written. 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  HOW TO READ 
But as yet, in spite of our assumptions to 
the contrary, we would appear to be mere 
creatures of chance, helplessly dependent (for 
material to read with) upon the first memory- 
picture, or the first word-meaning that our 
minds get hold of when they reach into the 
grab-bag of our past experience. 
And to a certain extent we are. 
If I suddenly present for your interpreta- 
tion the words 
A green tree 
not only do I not know what picture your 
mind will present you with, but you are as 
ignorant, before the event, as I am, and as 
powerless to control the choice. Your mind 
simply reaches down into the “green tree” 
compartment of your stored experience and 
fetches up whatever comes handy: — a “gen- 
eralized notion,” or the elm tree in front of 
your childhood home, or a banyan monster in 
Madras, or what-not. 
And yet, in the last chapter, we summed up 
our inquiry, as far as prosecuted, in the con- 
clusion (and I assume that you acquiesced in 
it at the time) that learning to read did not 
58
-P-A-G-E-67
    
WATCHING THE WHEELS 
merely mean learning to draw “more and 
more skillfully” on our stored experience for 
scenario producing purposes, but also involved 
enlarging our “personal contexts,” develop-~ 
ing our responsiveness to verbal contexts, and 
“learning to draw more and more discriminat- 
ingly on these two sources for the word-mean- 
ings in which we interpret the directions that 
our successive partners, the authors, issue to 
us.” 
It is now necessary for us to discover how 
— by what actually employed process or pro- 
cedure — we achieve and exercise this critical 
selection. 
I assume that, in reading the last chapter, 
you personally acquiesced in its conclusions, 
Yet I can imagine you, after a little reflection, 
addressing me somewhat as follows: “That 
first chapter on ‘Learning to Read’ was fine. 
All it said about our minds being moving- 
picture concerns; about printed stories being 
nothing but scenarios; about our only mate- 
rial for their ‘producing’ being our own ex- 
perience; — all this is not only astonishingly 
plain, once it has been pointed out, but it in- » 
stantly gives to the whole idea of reading a 
59  
-P-A-G-E-68
  HOW TO READ 
jort of exciting interest. And the second chap- 
ter, too, taken by itself, is convincing. In- 
deed, I’ve tried the thing out on myself and it 
works. The ‘dictionary meanings’ of words 
are only definitions of generalized notions. I 
do get the meanings of used words from the 
contexts, verbal and ‘personal.’ And yet I 
can’t, for the life of me, make these two chap- 
ters hitch up. I don’t see how I can be ex- 
pected to make ‘nicely discriminated’ word- 
meanings for myself unless I superintend the 
process as I go along. But if I stop to examine 
the meanings I am giving to words as I read 
them, then I find that I can’t ‘read.’ Instead 
of a ‘mental movie,’ or anything resembling 
one, I get nothing but a jumble of unrelated 
meanings, memories, associations, and ideas. 
Are you sure you are right? Or have I some- 
how gotten off the track?” 
Ill 
Suppose we examine the mental mechanics 
of reading a little more closely — watch the 
wheels go round a bit — and see if we cannot 
clear these matters up. It is n’t a difficult job 
if we go about it right. And these questions — 
60
-P-A-G-E-69
  
WATCHING THE WHEELS 
(1) Why is it impracticable to “examine the mean- 
ings we are giving to words as we read them?” 
(2) Why is it impossible to “read” if we do stop to 
examine the meanings we are giving to individ- 
ual words? 
(3) What is the actual way in which we do controt 
our word interpretations? 
—are of greater importance than appears on 
the surface. They strike, as it happens, to the 
very root of our inquiry. Indeed, the answer 
to the third of them is the root of our inquiry; 
and is going, therefore, to acquire far-reaching 
significance for us. 
Iv 
Let us glance back for a moment at the 
cinematograph. 
You know, of course, that a motion-picture 
film is made up of a great number of individ- 
ual photographs. That these were originally 
taken separately, but in rapid succession. 
That they are thrown on the screen, also 
separately, and in the original order, and at 
the original rapid rate — as a matter of fact, 
at the rate of about twenty per second. And 
you quite understand (although you cannot 
61
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  HOW TO READ 
detect the fact for yourselves by observation) 
that it is precisely because each of these sepa~ 
rate pictures is actually there, stationary, on 
the screen, long enough for us to perceive it, 
yet is always succeeded by another picture 
(ever so slightly different) too quickly for us 
to differentiate the impressions we receive 
from them, that the series merges, to our 
minds, into a “moving picture.” 
Now the significant fact that I wish to 
point out to you — the fact that is going to 
enable us to “hitch up” our previous discov- 
eries to the facts of actual reading practice 
—is this: that the separate words on a page 
of print correspond Exact ty to the separate 
pictures of a movie film. 
It is not merely true in a sort of meta- 
phorical sense that “reading” results in “men- 
tal movies.” 
It is literally true that the mental mechan- 
ics of the two processes are identical. 
Let us examine them. 
The cinematograph is operated at the rate 
of about twenty pictures per second. In other 
words, in one minute of the movies something 
like twelve hundred pictures, one after the 
62
-P-A-G-E-71
  
WATCHING THE WHEELS 
other, twenty to the second, are thrown on 
the screen before our eyes. 
On the other hand, an ordinary reader 
takes about a minute to read an average 
page of the usual novel. Such a page con- 
tains in the neighborhood of three hundred 
words. Which is to say that in one minute of 
“reading” something like three hundred 
words, one after the other, five to the sec- 
ond, are flashed onto the sensitized screen of 
the mind. 
And, in this case as in the other, it is pre- 
cisely because each of theseswords is there, 
stationary, before our moving eyes, just long 
enough for us to feel the flavor of its signifi- 
cance, but is always — before we have time to 
differentiate the impressions made on us — 
abandoned for another word, different, yet 
either qualifying or qualified by the first one, 
that the series merges in our minds into the 
living flux of “representation” or “under- 
standing” that we call “reading,” and that 
we have elected to describe as a “mental 
movie.” 
Here, then, are our first two points already 
clear to us: — 
63  
-P-A-G-E-72
  
HOW TO READ’ 
(x) At five words to the second, it is obviously im- 
possible to “examine the meanings we are giv- 
ing to the words as we read them.” 
(2) Yet if, in order to make such an examination 
possible, we slow down to, say, ten words to the 
minute, we instantly destroy the cinemato- 
graphic effect of the merged series. Instead 
of a “mental movie” we get a “jumble of un- 
related meanings, memories, associations and 
ideas.” 
In exactly the same way, if we slow a movie 
film down until each picture remains on the 
screen for two whole seconds, and is then, 
after an interval of darkness, succeeded, for 
two whole seconds more, by the next picture, 
we instantly turn a “moving picture” into a 
procession of meaningless monotony. 
In both cases we have a watched pot that 
never boils. 
Vv 
Of course this seems to land us in a vicious 
circle —in a sort of mouse-trap cylinder in 
which we go round and round without ever 
getting any forwarder. 
Fortunately, however, there is a way out. 
There is a door to the trap. There is a very 
64 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
practical way in which we not only can, but in 
actual practice frequently do, examine and 
control the meanings we give to the words we 
read. 
This method is so simple, so natural, so 
unnotedly habitual to us, that you will laugh 
when I point it out. You use it constantly. 
But you use it so instinctively, so thought- 
lessly, and with so little realization of funda- 
mental relationship, not only to what we are 
now discussing, but to all living, that I am 
sure you do not know what it is. Nor, for 
the moment, am I going to tell you. There 
is, as it happens, a small matter of detail that 
we must master first. 
VI 
We now understand (although we cannot 
detect the matter for ourselves by observa- 
tion) that we “read” by carrying a “flavor of 
significance” forward from each printed word 
and blending it with the “flavors of signifi- 
cance” we take from the words that follow. 
The things that we are wanting a means of 
controlling, therefore, are really “flavors of 
significance.” 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  HOW TO READ 
But what, in the name of all that is practical 
and thinkable, may such a thing as a “flavor 
of significance” look like? 
What, as a matter of cold fact, is a “flavor 
of significance?” 
Let us see if we can find out. 
VII 
Suppose, in actual conversation, I were to 
ask you the meaning of the word “good.” 
You would instantly feel that you knew. 
But you would find considerable difficulty in 
framing a reply that either of us considered 
satisfactory. And this (although the inabil- 
ity would doubtless embarrass you) is really 
quite as it should be. You are a human being, 
not a dictionary. It is your regular business 
to feel the notions called up in your mind by 
code-signals like “good.” It is not your regu- 
lar business to frame adequate definitions of 
those notions in other code-signals. 
But, even in the matter of feeling mean- 
ings to yourself, a time element enters. You 
do not, instantly, feel the full meaning, to 
you, of the word “good.” To do this would 
take time. Not much time, but some. Time 
66  
-P-A-G-E-75
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
enough, let us say, to feel all the way round the 
word. 
It does n’t take you long to feel round a 
concrete word like “hairbrush.” It takes you 
some time to feel round an abstract word like 
“unrighteousness.” 
Try it and see. 
Your mind goes round “hairbrush” like a 
squirrel round a tree. A frisk of its tail and — 
it’s looking at you from the other side. But 
your mind feels its way round “‘unrighteous- 
ness” like a blindfolded man using his hands 
for eyes. It may be ten seconds before it comes 
out with a full report. 
Let us say, then, that it takes us, on the 
average, two seconds to feel the full meaning, 
to us, of a word. 
It follows, does it not, that in reading at 
the rate of five words to the second, we have, 
on the average, and as the equivalent of our 
“flavor of significance,” about one tenth of a 
fully realized meaning to carry forward from 
each word we read. 
Let us see, now, if we can find a magnifying 
glass that will enable us to see, not a tenth of a 
fully realized meaning, — that would require a 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  HOW TO READ 
microscope, — but, say, a quarter or a fifth of 
such a meaning. 
VIII 
Suppose, instead of asking you the meaning 
of a word, I were to ask you to play a game 
with me. 
Suppose I were to ask you to speak out to 
me, frankly, immediately, and automatically, 
— that is, without thinking the matter over 
at all, — the very first thing that popped into 
your head as each of a series of words was 
spoken to you, slowly, one after the other. 
Thus, if I were to give you the word “cow,” 
you would answer “red,” or “calf,” or “Jer- 
sey,” or “milk,” or whatever notion came up 
automatically to your mind at the instant of 
hearing the word. 
As a matter of actual fact, if you are of av- 
erage quickness in your mental reactions, you 
could, for ordinary words, and after a little 
practice, give me my answers in from seven to 
nine tenths of a second. That is to say, you 
could, on the average, answer me in eight 
tenths of a second. And as at least half of 
this time would be taken up in making your 
68 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
reply, each answer would, roughly speaking, 
represent two fifths of a second’s realization of 
that word’s full meaning to you, or (since it 
takes two seconds, on the average, to attain 
such a realization complete) one fifth of a fully 
realized meaning. 
Now, suppose that I were to select six words 
at random. And suppose that I were to pro- 
pound them, in this fashion, first to one, and 
then to another of you;and in each case were to 
write down the answers. The record of words 
and answers would read somewhat as follows: 
First Player’s Second Player's 
Word Answer Answer 
Water Wet Wash 
Knife Sharp Carve 
Good Mother Pie 
Pepper Salt Hot 
Blond Hair Charlie 
Bond Coupon Break 
Here, then, — crudely exaggerated by the 
action of a rough magnifying medium, and 
thus rendered, as it were, visible to the actual 
eye, — are some fractions of realized mean- 
ings; some “flavors of significance,” coarser 
than those we read with, but yet akin to them. 
We have only to examine them, for in- 
69  
-P-A-G-E-78
  
HOW TO READ 
stance, to see that player number one would, 
at the moment of the test, have been likely 
to carry forward from the word “good” 
a “mother-goodness” flavor of significance; 
and player number two a “pie-goodness” 
flavor of significance. 
Perhaps, if we try, we can make this list 
give us an answer to our third question. 
Ix 
We see that to player number one, at the 
moment of the test, the word “bond” sug- 
gested investments; while to player number 
two it suggested a desire for freedom. We 
can, therefore, conceive that, had they been 
reading, player number one would have car- 
ried forward from the word “‘bond” a money- 
satisfaction flavor, and player number two a 
dissatisfaction-with-slavery flavor. 
But these would scarcely prove suitable 
flavors of significance for the same word in 
the same sentence. One of them — possibly 
even both of them — would need to be criti- 
cized and “controlled.” 
How, in actual reading, would these two 
players accomplish the adjustment? 
7° 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
    
WATCHING THE WHEELS 
Let us suppose a case. 
Let us suppose that the sentence they 
were reading began — 
The bond that held them together — 
By the time that they had read thus far, 
player number one would be carrying for- 
ward a sort of “comfortable-circumstances” 
attitude toward the union. And player number 
two would be carrying forward a sort of 
“readiness-for-divorce” attitude toward it. 
And now suppose that the balance of the 
sentence ran — 
was thus a spiritual tie. 
Instantly, both readers would find themselves 
“in wrong.” 
And instantly, by a mental gesture, —a 
mere motion of the mind, — so familiar and 
instinctive as to be all but unconscious, each 
would make his or her own personal correc- 
tion. 
x 
Here, then, we have our third question 
cleared up for us. 
We control our “flavors of significance” by 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  
HOW TO READ 
hindsight, not by foresight. We do not cut 
them to measure. We get them ready-made, and 
refit them when necessary. 
And for the most part no readjustments are 
needed. For, after all, word-meanings are by 
no means haphazard hand-me-downs. Each 
of us has, as a matter of fact, and for every 
word really contained in his vocabulary,a more 
or less richly composite meaning-notion of his 
own, — a personal generalization, — built up 
by slow degrees and repeated usings. And it 
is into these composites, as into grab-bags, 
that we really reach — reach at the rate of 
five times per second — for personal “flavors 
of significance” that shall fit the verbal con- 
text. 
It is n’t often, therefore, that our minds 
bring up for us such incongruous and un- 
usable flavors of meaning as those just ex- 
amined in the case of the word “bond.” 
In an overwhelming majority of cases, the 
“meanings” we pull out are adequate. And 
even in the other cases, the needed readjust- 
ments are usually slight and are made in- 
stinctively, without conscious thought, and 
almost instantly forgotten. 
72
-P-A-G-E-81
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
But the more alert the reader is (and es- 
pecially the more alert he is on this basis of 
right understanding of the nature of our read- 
ing processes), the more frequently will he 
detect these errors and inadequacies, and 
the more often will he make these mental 
gestures of correction. And each time that he 
does so he increases the suppleness of his 
mind, betters his technical skill of interpreta- 
tion, adds permanently to the richness of that 
particular word-meaning composite, and, in 
all these ways, strengthens the foundations of 
efficiency for his future reading. 
xI 
Alertness, then, is the first requisite for the 
reader. And by “alertness” I mean, here, 
expectant interest, focused attention, and a 
mental readiness to act. 
XII 
But before I go on to point out the particu- 
lar character and type of alertness demanded 
of the reader by the reading-facts we have es- 
tablished thus far in our inquiry, I want to 
clear your mind of a misconception that we 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  
  HOW TO READ 
are forever entertaining, like a bad angel, un, 
awares. 
We are all of us given to thinking of “read- 
ing” as of a comparatively recent human 
attainment, based upon the invention of 
graphic signs. 
In reality, however, reading is not an at- 
tainment, but a natural function and inborn 
aptitude of the mind. 
A thousand centuries before alphabets 
were, reading was. 
Semi-human hunters read the incised records 
of the game trails before they had even learned 
to cook the flesh of their quarry. Immemori- 
ally forgotten savages read the faces of their 
friends and the minds of their enemies before 
the stone age was dreamed of. Prehistoric 
precursors of the prophets read the signs of 
the weatherin the skies, and their still pre- 
historic successors became priests and read 
the Will of God in their own hearts, untold 
ages before the first cuneiform inscription was 
impressed on the first brick in Babylonia. 
Nor are these expressions mere figures of 
speech. It is a “simile” only by inversion to 
call ‘‘reading the signs of the times” a simile. 
74
-P-A-G-E-83
    
WATCHING THE WHEELS 
The real simile lies rather in speaking of 
“readinga book.” Forthe word “read” (to go 
no further back than its immediate parent) is 
an Anglo-Saxon word meaning to “take coun- 
sel.” And its linguistic first cousin is that 
other ancient expression, “to red up,” — to 
“red” meaning to tidy, to put in order; and 
hence to clear up and explain. “Reading,” 
then, is a form of “redding,” — to take coun- 
sel by putting things inorder. And you can no 
more (without smothering it to death) keep 
the human mind from “reading” than you 
can keep the human body from breathing. 
And you will note that for all forms of reading 
— for that of the semi-human hunter no less 
than for that to which this book is intended 
to guide you—alertness (meaning expect- 
ant interest, focused attention, and a mental 
readiness to act) is the first requisite.

In this volume we are dealing with reading 
in its everyday sense of reading letters, news- 
papers, magazines, and books— written and 
printed language in general. And even in this 
sense it is practically permissible to-day to

  HOW TO READ | 
say that “everybody reads.” It is also a“ 
that whatever actual reading any of us do is 
accomplished by the exercise of some alertness. 
For one no more reads a page of print by 
mechanically passing one’s eyes across and 
across its lines, and perhaps silently forming 
the words with one’s lips, while one’s mind is 
playing hide and seek elsewhere, than one 
reads a game trail by following it, eyes on the 
ground ticking off deer tracks, but mind and 
imagination walking up Broadway. 7 
Let us be clear about this. 
It happens to all of us, at times, to discover 
that, while we’ve imagined we were reading, 
we really were n’t; to find, on turning over a 
page, that we’ve no idea as to what was on it. 
Generally, in such cases, if we take the trode 
to examine our own minds, we find that while 
we were automatically going through the 
mental and physical motions of reading, we 
were really being lazily and undirectedly 
alert about something else — going over the 
month’s accounts, or wondering why some 
friend acted so offish when we last met. 
Again, it sometimes happens to all of us to 
realize, on turning over a page, that a single 
76
-P-A-G-E-85
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
sentence on it, say three quarters of the way 
up from the bottom, is the only thing on it 
that we seem really to have taken in. If we 
turn back and read the sentence over again, 
we can generally discover exactly what it was 
that caused our minds to stop wool-gathering 
for an instant and roused us to a half-hearted 
and momentary alertness. 
XIV 
For right reading, however, it is not enough 
to be alert. 
The alertness must be both informed and 
disciplined. It must be based on understand- 
ing and trained to the point of unconscious 
performance. 
Let me illustrate this last statement. 
I said, a while back, that the mind “reads” 
as naturally as the body breathes. Yet the 
first thing that a would-be opera singer has to 
learn is how to breathe. It is n’t enough that 
she breathe naturally. Her breathing must be 
both informed and disciplined. She must 
understand both the mechanism at her dis- 
posal and the purposes of its employment. 
And she must so train herself in the technique 
77  
-P-A-G-E-86
    HOW TO READ 
of performance that her lungs function with- 
out conscious thought for the adequate 
achievement of her changing personal aims. 
XV 
Or, let us take a cruder analogy. 
Alertness is a prerequisite in driving an 
automobile. But it is not enough to be alert. 
Here, too, the alertness must be both informed 
and disciplined: based on understanding and 
trained to the point of unconscious perform- 
ance. 
The kind of alertness that grasps the steer- 
ing wheel so tightly as to breed cramps in the 
wrists is more of a handicap than a help. Yet 
this stage — the stage of exaggeratedly con- 
scious alertness — has to be passed through. 
The kind of alertness that is so preoccupied 
with technique that it keeps telling itself 
which pedal to push in an emergency is also 
more of a handicap than a help. But this 
stage — the stage of reducing conscious per- 
formance to a subconscious habit — must 
also be passed through. 
The driver who is ignorant of the mechan- 
ism of his engine keeps going by the grace of 
78
-P-A-G-E-87
    WATCHING THE WHEELS 
God — or of some man in Detroit, Michigan. 
But the driver whose mind is busy with his 
engine when he is threading the intricacies of 
traffic is likely to get into trouble with the 
police. 
No one is master of the automobile — no 
one is capable of driving one entirely “‘on his 
own,” anywhere that it will go for the ac- 
complishment of his own ends, to the full of 
its inherent possibilities and to the limit of his 
own capacity — until he has gradually built 
up, on a constantly broadening basis of un- 
derstanding, — understanding of the working 
of internal-combustion engines in general, of 
the idiosyncracies of his own machine in 
particular, of the rules of the road, of the 
psychology of other drivers and of himself, 
and of the character of his own pursuit, — an 
alertness that is seldom conscious of itself, yet 
always many-sidedly operative, and that is 
usually able, by becoming conscious of itself, 
to detect the causes of its own shortcomings, 
and by correcting these to add to its own ef- 
ficiency. 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  HOW TO READ 
XVI 
And it is no otherwise with reading. 
It is only by thus building up, on a con- 
stantly broadening basis of understanding, 
an informed and disciplined alertness, that 
we learn to drive that other internal-combus- 
tion engine, our own mind, along the roads of 
print toward our chosen objective —be this 
an afternoon’s enjoyment or an intellectual 
goal. 
XVII 
Do not, however, mistake me. The most 
ordinary reader exercises alertness. He has to 
in order to read. Some measure of expectant 
interest, no matter how slight; some degree of 
focused attention, no matter how vague; 
some mental readiness to act, no matter how 
sluggish, he must bring to the task. Else the 
very act of reading ceases to take place. 
But the ordinary reader, because he mis- 
understands the nature of reading, misdirects 
these elements of alertness; if, indeed, he 
directs them at all. 
The ordinary reader thinks of a story as a 
80
-P-A-G-E-89
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
concrete thing contained in a book, just as he 
thinks of a lemonade as a concrete thing con- 
tained in a glass. And he assumes that, just 
as he sucks the one in, ready-mixed, through a 
straw, so he drinks the other in, ready-made, 
through his eyes. 
Naturally, his expectant interest is centered 
on “what the author has to say.” His at- 
tention is focused outside himself. His mental 
readiness to act is largely reduced to a readi- 
ness to suck faster if he likes it and to suck 
slower if he does n’t. 
And —JI want to underscore this fact — 
the thing works. It does n’t work the way he 
supposes, but it arrives — after a fashion. He 
reads, not because he understands what he is 
doing, but because he is built that way. He 
keeps going, as we said of the auto-driver, by 
the grace of God. If it were really true, as the 
proverb seems to imply, that God helps only 
those who help themselves, we should most 
of us be stalled motors by the wayside. 
XVIII 
But really “learning to read” is another 
matter. 
81 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  ‘HOW TO READ 
And the reader who has once grasped in 
outline the true nature of reading, and who 
wishes to build up for himself on that founda- 
tion a better and more personally remunera- 
tive technique, should begin by altering the 
character of his alertness. 
He knows that the words the author prints 
are but signals to his mind— but push- 
buttons that his eyes press as they pass over 
them. He knows that the flux of “notions” 
they call up, the associative memories, and 
mental pictures, and character conceptions, 
and idea complexes, that these form them- 
selves into, are his word-notions, his memo- 
ries, his mind pictures, his character con- 
ceptions, his idea constructions. And he 
will, therefore, practice centering his expect- 
ant interest, not on “what the author is say- 
ing,” but on “what the author is saying to 
him.” 
He knows, moreover, that whatever happens 
when we read happens inside ourselves. And 
he will, therefore, practice keeping his real 
attention turned inward. 
And he knows that he, and he alone, is the 
one who can, when occasion arises, stages 
82
-P-A-G-E-91
  
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
manage and control this internal upwelling 
of notions and memories, pictures and ideas. 
And he will, therefore, practice the develop- 
ment of a mental readiness to act that con- 
Bists in readiness to act as stage manager on 
his own initiative; adjusting himself as well as 
he may to the author’s mood, and producing 
to the best of his equipment the author’s 
scenario. 
xIX 
This, then, is the root of our inquiry: — this 
fact that, in reading, we deliberately and of 
our own choice expose ourselves to suggestion; 
respond automatically and personally to the 
successive stimuli of words and word-groups; 
and then consciously or unconsciously criticize 
and control our automatic responses. 
This (although he does n’t know it) is 
what the tramp on a park bench, scanning 
the draggled pages of last week’s paper, is 
doing. 
And this is all that the keenest mind in 
Christendom does when it reads. 
The road between the two, as far as mere 
technique goes, lies along the line of teaching 
83
-P-A-G-E-92
  HOW TO READ 
one’s self little by little to do this common act 
of reading with an informed and disciplined 
alertness; an alertness based on a constantly 
broadening understanding of one’s own mind- 
workings and of one’s own aims, and trained 
to a greater and greater suppleness of uncon- 
scious performance. 
xx 
Before closing this chapter, however, I want 
to point out the importance, in connection 
with all that follows in this volume, that this 
discovered method of our “control” of word- 
meanings is going to assume for us. 
It looks an insignificant little discovery — 
this fact that we first react automatically to 
words and then criticize the reaction, and that 
this is absolutely the only method we have, 
either of getting at our word-meanings (which 
are, so to say, the molecules of our thought) 
or of controlling them. And yet, in reality, 
it is the root of self-knowledge and the key 
to all that has any right to be called cul- 
ture. 
Talkers of cant tell us, in effect if not in 
words, that culture is something that we can 
84  
-P-A-G-E-93
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
receive from without; something that exists, 
independently of its possessors; something 
that can be imparted, and accepted, and 
built into our consciousness and our person- 
alities like bricks into a wall. They would 
have us believe that culture is a sort of 
censored and sublimated sophistication — a 
knowing (through an eager submission of our- 
selves to the best authorities) of what to feel 
and what not to; what to like and what not to; 
what to admire and what not to; what to 
think and what not to. 
Do not believe them. Culture is always 
unique, for it is an individual achievement — 
a by-product of personal living. 
Its essential entity is an “attitude toward 
the cosmos.” Its component elements — the 
things from which it is built up — are recog- 
nized relationships between the life inside us 
and the world without. And the ultimate 
atoms out of which these component elements 
are constructed are neither more nor less than 
“controlled meanings’? — spontaneous per- 
sonal feelings, subsequently criticized. 
Culture is a gradually codrdinated accumu- 
lation of criticized reactions — of the “‘con«

-P-A-G-E-94
  
  HOW TO READ 
trolled meanings” that we ourselves have 
given to hunger and thirst and satiety; to 
love and friendship and hate; to hope and 
fear and indifference; to words and sentences 
and books; to art and philosophy and religion; 
— in a word, to life. 
Much fun has been made of those who say, 
“I don’t know anything about art, but I 
know what I like.” The fun-makers are in- 
tellectual snobs, if, indeed, they are not shal- 
low-pated fools. For, granted that they them- 
selves know anything about art (and not 
merely about what they think they ought to 
think about it), they started from that identi- 
cal beginning — the beginning of “knowing 
what they liked” and nothing more. 
To “know what we like” is nearer to cul- 
ture than to know what we ought to like. For 
to know the latter, beforehand, is often to be 
prevented from ever knowing whether we 
really like it or not. But to like a thing, or to 
dislike it, is to have reacted to it; to have 
lived with regard to it; to have given it a 
meaning. When we have criticized this mean- 
ing, — when we have learned how and why 
we like it or dislike it, and have approved or 
86
-P-A-G-E-95
  
  WATCHING THE WHEELS 
disapproved of our spontaneous feeling, — 
we have taken a step toward culture. 
And the only reason that culture is in any 
way derivable from books is that reading is a 
form of living.

CHAPTER IV 
WHAT’S THE USE? 
I 
WE have now completed the first portion of 
our inquiry. We have found out what reading 
really is. We have found out how we do it. 
And from this knowledge we have drawn our 
preliminary conclusions as to the true nature 
of “learning to read” and as to the first steps 
necessary for setting about this endlessly in- 
teresting self-enhancement. 
We have satisfied ourselves that this learn- 
ing is not a dull, two-year task in a primary 
school, as usually assumed. We know, in- 
deed, that it is no once-for-all acquirement 
(like learning the Greek alphabet or learning 
to extract cube roots) in any educational cur- 
riculum. We see, on the contrary, that it is a 
till-death-us-do-part sort of learning. For we 
see that it consists in a lifelong, year-by-year, 
progressive learning to put the constantly ac- 
cumulating store of our own personal experi- 
ence into fuller and fuller order, by using it 
for the “producing,” on the stage of our own 
88
-P-A-G-E-97
  WHAT’S THE USE? 
consciousness, of the reported actions, the 
suggested emotions, and the outlined thoughts 
of others. 
And from the vantage-point of this knowl- 
edge we begin to see, opening out at the feet 
of our clarified understanding, a deepening 
perspective of possibilities. We begin, in fact, 
to realize that learning to read is an adventure. 
if. 
And of course the first result of this realiza- 
tion is a thrill. 
We feel the romance, the allure, of the un- 
dertaking. The vitally personal nature of it 
appeals to us. The very fact that we must 
set out upon it, like pioneers, dependent upon 
our own original equipment and upon the 
subsequent, day-by-day results of our own re- 
sourcefulness, stimulates us. The realization 
that we shall be setting out for an individual 
exploring of two mysterious, little-known, 
and infinitely exciting worlds —the world 
outside us and the world within — fires our 
imagination. 
At first blush we are all enthusiasm for the 
start. 
89  
-P-A-G-E-98
  
  HOW TO READ 
Ill 
But, on further thought, there is sure to 
come a reaction. 
We are going, in this very chapter, to see 
that two alternating impulses — the impulse 
to do, and the impulse to shrink from doing 
— lie at the very heart of all our living; are, 
as it were, the beating of that heart. And the 
strong impulse-to-action that is born of our 
realization of the fine, adventurous possibili- 
ties of thus learning to read is sure to be suc- 
ceeded by a counter-impulse— an impulse- 
to-inaction. 
We see that this adventure will be very 
long, and very slow, and very likely arduous; 
and so we ask ourselves why we should bother. 
We see that, properly prosecuted, it would 
inevitably call for other, less easy, things 
than mere enthusiasm: for patience and perti- 
nacity; for the honesty of humbleness; for the 
courage of self-reliance; for grace as well as 
grit; and we pause and ask ourselves if the 
game is worth the candle. 
“This world,” we say to ourselves, “is a 
busy place.’ We are not specialists, we are 
go
-P-A-G-E-99
    
WHAT’S THE USE? 
‘general practitioners’ in life. Is not the pur- 
suit of special knowledge, the attainment of 
special skill, even in so useful and universal& 
thing as reading, the concern of the special- 
aati? 
And so we shrug our shoulders and ask our- 
selves, “‘What’s the use?” 
Iv 
Very good. This is a legitimate question, 
although, as we shall see in a moment, it 
probes very deep. For, since reading is a form 
of living, this question, applied to it, is but a 
form of saying, “What’s the use — ever?” 
Perhaps, however, in answering the reading 
form of this question we shall find that we 
have answered the general form also. 
This much at least is evident to start with: 
we cannot hope to answer this reading-ques- 
tion reasonably until we have uncovered for 
ourselves our real reasons for reading. And 
thus we are led directly to the second item of 
our projected investigation — the inquiry 
into why we read. 
Suppose, like good gardeners, we now dig 
straight down to the real root of this matter. 
gI
-P-A-G-E-100
  HOW TO READ 
Vv 
There are, at bottom, two reasons, and only 
two reasons in the world, why any of us ever 
read anything. 
We are seldom conscious of these reasons, 
yet we are always, when we read, actuated by 
one or other of them. It makes no difference 
who we are or what we are; these reasons and 
no others hold good for us. They hold good 
for Hapsburgs and for hoboes. They are all 
the philosopher has, and Fluffy Ruffles has 
them. 
Nor does the nature of the thing read make 
any difference. 
This may be a sky-sign on Broadway, or a 
signpost at a country crossroads. It may be 
the account of a murder trial in the morning 
paper, or a bargain-sale notice delivered in the 
afternoon mail. It may be a love scene in 
“Hearts Aflutter” (sixty thousand sold be- 
fore publication), or the chapter on the Cate- 
gorical Imperative in Kant’s “Critique of 
Pure Reason” (copyright expired). It makes 
no difference. 
Consciously or unconsciously, wittingly or 
gz
-P-A-G-E-101
  WHAT’S THE USE? 
unwittingly, we all read everything that we 
do read (not according to its nature, but ac- 
cording to our need) either 
(1) To get away from ourselves; 
or, 
(2) To find ourselves. 
vI 
Yes, I know. You are nodding your head 
(meaning “aye, aye, sir”) over the first of 
these statements. And, deep down inside, 
you are thinking that I am talking highbrow 
in making the second. 
But you are wrong. 
The significance of these expressions is 
equally simple, and the experiences to which 
they relate are equally common to us all. 
Wanting to “get away from one’s self” 
merely expresses the recurrent need, experi- 
enced by each one of us, of forgetting for a 
while the tangle of contradictory impulses, 
mixed motives, cross-purposes, and conflict- 
ing emotions that is one’s self; and which, 
when too intimately realized, or too continu- 
ously envisaged, becomes unbearable. 
Wanting to “find one’s self” merely ex- 
93
-P-A-G-E-102
    HOW TO READ 
presses the equally recurrent craving, equally 
experienced by us all, actively to achieve 
some measure of order, no matter how fleeting 
or how restricted, in the ever-flexing meshes 
of this same internal tangle. 
However, this is a stuffy subject. Let us 
get out into the open air. 
VII 
Just below my window as I write there is a 
strip of park that runs — like the Gadarene 
swine — down a steep hill to the Hudson. It 
is some miles in length, this strip. But in 
width it only varies between a perpendicular 
hundred yards and a shelving quarter-mile. 
Yet big shade trees beautify it. And long 
paths parallel the river through it, rising and 
sinking, on the swells of its slopes like the 
wakes of little boats. And there are benches 
in it— benches that face the water across 
squirrel-dotted sweeps of grass. And there 
are people on the benches. People with ba- 
bies. People with books. People with spent 
hands folded in dejected laps. People with 
high hopes new-kindling in far-focused eyes. 
Let us suppose a desperate morning: a 
94
-P-A-G-E-103
WHAT’S THE USE? 
  morning when the milkman has n’t come (or 
the blue-ribbon chef has given notice); when 
the baby cannot somehow seem to cut its 
tooth (or the limousine to use its carburettor); 
when Himself has gotten out of bed on the 
wrong side; when the people next door keep 
playing the victrola; when, in short, the cos- 
mic Doll is just generally leaking sawdust at 
every joint. 
Let us suppose that on such a morning a 
woman — yourself or another — flees to this 
strip of park and sits down on one of its green 
benches: on a bench that looks across a stretch 
of level lawn; past a rosily budding oak; past 
a white signboard nailed to a driven stake; 
out to the restful river, where the big ships 
lie at anchor and the little shallops come and 
go. 
For a time, her need — the need of escap- 
ing from herself —is ministered to by the 
sheer sensed beauty of the scene. She lies 
back on its loveliness. She loses herself in it. 
She floats on it like a grateful swimmer in a 
summer sea. 
But not, alas, for long. 
Little meddlesome messages from home — 
95 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
HOW TO READ 
like Marconigrams in mid-Atlantic — begin 
to reach her. 
The river view blurs. 
The butcher’s bill reasserts itself. 
With a little shudder of impatience she 
turns away and looks for a new, a nearer, a 
more insistent interest. 
She watches the nursemaid on the next 
bench who is industriously upturning a baby 
in the vain hope of emptying it of yells. 
She follows with a speculative eye a wistful 
couple that come strolling past with finger 
tips surreptitiously touching. 
She notes the growing glory of the budding 
oak and for a moment fills her mind with that. 
And each of these things in turn serves her 
need for a time, and then loses its efficacy. 
Finally, her glance lights on the white sign- 
board; but at first she only takes it in as a 
noticeable spot — a white rectangle against a 
green background. As that she toys with it. 
She moves it (in her mind) to the right and 
left; fits it in, picture-puzzle fashion, at the 
foot of the oak — plays an idle, esthetic game 
with it. 
At last, she tires of this in its turn. She 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
    
WHAT’S THE USE? 
sees that it is a notice board. She realizes 
that there is printing on it. She gets desper- 
ately up. She walks slowly over to it. She 
reads it. 
VIII 
And what, you ask, does it say? 
What, I answer, does it matter? 
Perhaps it says, “‘KEEP OFF THE GRASS.” 
Perhaps it says, “To 96TH STREET AND THE 
GATE.” 
What does matter, here, is her reason for 
reading it. For here, in its simplest form, ab- 
solutely unadulterated, “chemically pure,” 
we have the first of our two impulses toward 
reading. This woman read the signboard to 
get away from herself. 
Ix 
But she need not have. 
Suppose that by ever so little we change 
our supposition. 
Suppose that the sudden peace, the far 
view, the spring air, the muted sounds of 
busy life rising from the river, prove healing 
to this woman’s hurt. 
FF 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  
HOW TO READ 
Suppose that in consequence, and without 
her conscious knowledge, the tide of her cour- 
age and energy that had, like the tide in the 
river, been running out, turns and begins to 
“make.” 
Suppose, in further consequence, that the 
victrola and the milkman, the baby’s tooth 
and the family grouches, the little puzzles and 
big problems in the stream of her life, begin, 
like the anchored barges and battleships on 
the river, to swing at their moorings and to 
face the other way. So that when, at last, the 
Marconigrams begin to come through, they 
are no longer S.O.S’s of desperation, but 
urgings to action. 
“Good Heavens!” she says, suddenly, “I 
never dreamed that it was that late!” 
She draws a long, invigorated breath. She 
straightens her shoulders and looks about her. 
She wonders which is her nearest way out of 
the park; sees the signboard; gets alertly up; 
_7boes over to it; reads it. 
x 
And what, you ask, does it say? 
What, I repeat, does it matter? 
98
-P-A-G-E-107
  WHAT’S THE USE? 
Perhaps it says, “To 96TH STREET AND THE 
GATE.” 
Perhaps it says, “NO DOGS ALLOWED AT 
LARGE.” 
What matters, here, is again her reason for 
reading it. For here, in its simplest form, 
isolated, unadulterated, “chemically pure,” 
we have the second of our impulses toward 
reading. This time the woman read the sign 
to find herself. 
xI 
And this woman in the park is typical of us 
all. Just so— not according to its nature, but 
according to our need; impelled, first by one 
and then by the other of these two prompt- 
ings — it is possible for us to read anything; 
from the “HELP WANTED, FEMALE” column — 
which we may read (1) because we have read 
everything else in the paper and still wish to 
“keep from thinking,” or (2) because we want 
a job — to Fox’s “Book of Martyrs,” which 
we may read (r1) to kill time or (2) to prepare 
for eternity. 
Nor does it cover the ground to say that in 
either one of these two modes we may read 
99
-P-A-G-E-108
  HOW TO READ 
anything. It is necessary to add that in al- 
ternation between these two moods we must 
read everything. 
Are you inclined to doubt this last? 
Let us glance, for a moment, beyond the 
scope of our immediate inquiry. 
Not alone our reading, but our lives, alter- 
nate between these two moods; are conducted 
in these two modes; are governed by these 
two appetites, urges, — call them what you 
will, — this desire to do, and this desire to 
shrink from doing; this recurrent keenness 
personally to master reality, and this recurrent 
craving personally to escape from the conscious- 
ness of its tyranny; this longing to “find our- 
selves,” and this longing to “get away from 
ourselves.” 
If you doubt this, look into your own heart. 
You will see (as your eyes get used to the 
dusk) that it is multiformly true. These two 
urges are, so to say, the legs of our inner being. 
We move, from day to day, from hour to 
hour, sometimes from moment to moment, by 
advancing first one and then the other of them. 
For we are built that way. We are spiritual 
bipeds.

But, as I have already said, we are seldom 
conscious of these reasons. 
No one, unless he be an unconscionable 
prig, thinks, say, of the looking-up of a sub- 
ject in an encyclopedia, as an effort to “find 
himself”; nor, unless he is very low in his 
mind, of the reading, say, of a detective story 
on a journey as an effort to “get away from 
himself.” 
Let us therefore briefly bridge the gap be- 
tween what analysis has shown us to be the 
fundamental character of our reading im- 
pulses and the more familiar forms in which 
these impulses habitually manifest themselves 
to us in daily life. 
What are the simplest terms of everyday 
speech in which we can adequately summarize 
our conscious impulses toward reading? 
Let us put it that all these conscious im- 
pulses fall under one or other of the follow- 
ing heads: — 
Some form of wanting to know. 
Some form of wanting to play. 
Some form of wanting to forget.

Here, however, instead of two divisions, we 
have three. And while the first and last of 
these are obvious translations of the two ex- 
pressions we have been using, the relation 
that the second bears to these expressions is 
not so clear. “Some form of wanting to play” 
describes a class of reading-impulses familiar 
to us all. But how does it fit into our recent 
analysis, if, indeed, it does fit into it? 
Let us examine the play-impulse a bit more 
closely. 
XIII 
Our old friend the New Standard Diction- 
ary defines “play” as “action without special 
aim, or for amusement; opposed to work or 
earnest.” And from time immemorial poets, 
puritans, and push-aheads— looking on, 
from their respective temperamental angles, 
at the apparent frivolities of kids, kittens, 
cubs, and young children — have been at one 
in accepting this definition at its surface value. 
But a new spirit of wanting to know — the 
spirit of redding things up by a more intelli- 
gent reading of the book of Nature, the scien- 
tific spirit — has recently come into the world, 
102
-P-A-G-E-111
    
WHAT'S THE USE? 
And all kinds of men, singly and in groups, 
have been looking with freshly focused minds 
at all sorts of supposedly unimportant hap- 
penings; even at the gambols of kittens and 
at the games of children. And (since science, 
like charity, begins at home) one of the first 
things that these latter observers discovered 
was the fact that no kitten ever plays at any- 
thing except at being a cat, and that no puppy 
ever plays at anything except at being a dog. 
At first this seemed interesting, but not 
especially important. But, as the observa~ 
tions were extended, it developed that the 
lower one goes in the scale of life, the more 
meager and short-lived become the play-im- 
pulses of the young; while the higher one goes 
in the scale, the more complex and long-con- 
tinued they are. And when the facts had been 
sufficiently studied and compared, it became 
clear that the play of young animals, far 
from being a mere meaningless spending of 
surplus energy, is really in the nature of a 
preparation — a dramatization of their develop- 
ing instincts. And when, gradually, a great 
many men and groups of men, working along 
separate lines and ultimately comparing notes 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  HOW TO READ 
and sharing discoveries, had built up the sci- 
ences of biology and comparative psychology, 
it became evident at last that the same is true 
of children. 
Of course, at first, it did n’t look (to take a 
crude example) as though the small son of 
highly civilized parents was “playing at being 
a man” when he used the first stick he got 
hold of to beat the cat with. But no sooner 
had biology discovered that the life of every 
creature, from conception to maturity, is a 
condensed recapitulation of the evolution of 
its race, than the matter became clear. The 
three-year-old club-wielder is not yet playing 
at being a civilized man like his father, but is 
still playing at being a club-wielding wild man 
like his prehistoric forbears. He is, in fact, 
dramatizing the instincts of that phase of de- 
velopment through which he is then passing. 
Later on he and his fellows will dramatize 
the instincts of savage tribesmen by forming 
“gangs” and by the building (quite without 
“special aim,” as the dictionary would say) 
of bonfires — at the same period developing 
the savage’s thoughtless cruelty and the fire- 
defended nomad’s fear of the dark. 
104
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  WHAT’S THE USE? 
Nor, while all this is going on, is the child 
neglecting to dramatize that other instinct — 
the instinct of imitativeness. He does this 
by playing at driving tandem, playing at 
keeping store, playing at keeping house. And 
he constantly mixes the two. As when he 
dramatizes the ancestral instinct of pugnacity 
in elaborate snowball fights, and organizes 
the defenses and the attacks on the supposed 
ground-plan of Verdun. 
XIV 
In short, play, in the young, is a form of 
practice; an embodying in action of develop- 
ing instincts. 
And the same thing, with a slight differ- 
ence, is true of grown-ups. 
Even grown-up animals play. 
The wise old dog, chasing the chicken that 
he takes very good care not to catch, is play- 
ing; and is dramatizing an instinct that life, 
as he is living it, forbids him to indulge in 
earnest. 
And the grown-up man, with a thousand 
instincts suppressed by life as he is living it, 
and by the need of concentration on the indi- 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  HOW TO READ 
vidual tasks that this life imposes, takes his 
recreation by playing; and plays by drama- 
tizing one or more of these otherwise inopera- 
tive urges. 
He may do this quite simply and directly 
— dramatize his instinct for the chase by 
going after big game, or by shooting squirrels, 
or by firing at clay pipes at the county fair. 
Or he may do it vicariously — dramatize his 
fighting instinct by watching a boxing-match. 
Or he may do it obliquely — dramatize his 
acquisitive instinct by collecting postage 
stamps. Or he may do it symbolically — 
dramatize his your-money-or-your-life in- 
stinct by pointing four aces at an opponent’s 
head and relieving him of his “pile” at penny- 
ante. 
XV 
But there is another form of play; another 
method of dramatizing suppressed instincts 
—the most universally applicable, indeed, 
and most minutely adjustable of all methods 
to all needs. 
A man may dramatize any instinct that 
he has by taking the right book down from 
106
-P-A-G-E-115
    
WHAT’S THE USE? 
the right shelf and by then identifying him- 
self in imagination with the instinct’s pictured 
fulfillment. : 
And this is precisely what we are seeking to 
do when we read from any impulse recogniz- 
able as “some form of wanting to play.” 
We are seeking relaxation by dramatizing 
some side of ourselves that is not usually free 
to function. We are, indeed, trying for re- 
freshment by “finding ourselves” afresh. 
XVI 
Let us get back to our muttons. 
These being our reasons for reading, what 
is the use of taking more than ordinary trouble 
in learning to read? 
The answer goes into a nutshell. 
We live, as it happens, in a world where all 
mental highways are partly paved with ink. 
We live in a world where the avenues of ap- 
proach to “ourselves” and many of the most 
direct avenues of escape from “‘ourselves”” — 
the alternating roads of our constant needs — 
are, at least in part and by inescapable neces- 
sity, roads of reading. 
How effectively — and how far — we are 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  - HOW TO READ 
able to go along these roads depends upon our 
means of locomotion. 
“Learning to read,” in the common-school 
fashion, is but “learning to walk” in the 
nursery sense. The rest is up to us. 
We live, as it were, alone, in the country. 
We can, if we choose, keep no horse in the 
stable except “shank’s mare.” We can con- 
fine ourselves to the meager utilitarianism of 
“hoofing it,’”’ and to the modest relaxation of 
“walks.” 
Or we can ride a bike. 
Or own a Ford. 
Or drive an eight-cylinder car. 
XVII 
This is the answer. 
Of course, as you may perhaps be moved to 
point out to me, it is not an ultimate answer. 
But there are no ultimate answers. 
And for this particular answer this much at 
least may be said: The question — “‘What’s 
the use?” — is a query that, like a recurrent 
decimal, may go on repeating itself forever. 
And this answer is a recurrent answer. 
Pose this question from any angle you 
108
-P-A-G-E-117
  
WHAT’S THE USE? 
choose, couch your reply in any terms you 
elect, — theological or biological, metaphysi- 
cal or physical, mystical or plain practical, — 
and this answer can be shown to be the gist 
of your reply. 
It is, indeed, the ultimate essence of the 
only answer there is. 
XVIII 
And now, in closing this chapter, and while 
we have our reasons for reading thus recog- 
nizably before us, I want to say a further word 
about them in connection with the special 
purposes of our inquiry — the acquirement, 
namely, of a more intelligent use of reading 
for our own ends. 
We have seen that our reasons for reading 
may be summed up as follows: — 
Some urge toward wanting to know, and some 
urge toward wanting to play; both being forms of 
the desire to “find ourselves”; and some urge to- 
ward wanting to forget, the same being an impulse 
to escape from the consciousness of a side of our- 
selves that is weary, or baffled, or discouraged. 
Please note, then, that the last of these 
reasons can justify itself by fulfillment only 
109
-P-A-G-E-118
  
  HOW TO READ 
through the development, in us, of one or 
other of the other two urges. 
We cannot forget, through reading, except 
by becoming interested in what we read. And 
we cannot become interested in what we read 
except by beginning to “want to know” or by 
beginning to “play.” 
We cannot, in short, escape from one side 
of ourselves except by beginning to formulate 
another. 
We are like a man, standing. If he wearies 
of standing on one foot, he can stand on the 
other. And if he wearies of standing on that, 
he can shift back. Only, mentally, we are 
centipedes. We have a hundred shifts. 
We are many-sided. And there are three 
ways of ministering to, and of being served by, 
— each of them through reading. “Wanting 
to know” is an active side of us, reaching out 
for its own. “Wanting to play” is a smothered 
side of us, asking to be allowed to breathe. 
“Wanting to forget” is a wearied side of us, 
asking to be relieved from duty. An intelli- 
gent use of reading for our own ends, there- 
fore, involves an intelligent selection of what 
we will elect to know, of how we will elect to 
IIo
-P-A-G-E-119
  
  WHAT’S THE USE? 
play, and of what forms of these activities we 
will elect to employ for purposes of relief and 
relaxation. 
Later on, in the chapter on “A Sense of 
Direction,” we shall return to this matter of 
intelligent choice. But before doing this it is 
necessary for us to gain, at first-hand, a more 
vivid realization and a more intimate under- 
standing of the many-sidedness that we have 
above referred to. We must find out exactly 
what we mean by calling reading an explora- 
tion of two worlds — the world outside us 
and the world within. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  CHAPTER V 
A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
I 
We have all heard of the Frenchman who, at 
about forty, discovered, quite by accident 
and to his great surprise, that in keeping his 
diary and answering his correspondence and 
making his business reports and other taken- 
for-granted uses of pen and paper, he had all 
his life been writing prose without knowing it. 
We have now reached a point in our in- 
quiry where a somewhat similar realization 
should be ours. All our lives we have been 
doing the intricate things set forth in the pre- 
ceding chapters, and have been doing them 
for the specific reasons therein explained, and 
yet have never suspected either fact. 
It is not true, therefore, as it may possibly 
appear to some of you, that I am recommend- 
ing you to learn an unfamiliar game, or to 
acquire a new and heretofore unpracticed 
technique. Far from it. The game that I am 
recommending to you we all began to play, 
112
-P-A-G-E-121
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
untaught, in the nursery. And the technique 
that I am urging you to perfect is the same 
technique that, from inborn necessity, we 
have all developed and which, in a catch- 
as-catch-can way, we all employ in our 
most casual scanning of the most ephemeral 
print. 
All that I am suggesting that you should 
do is to play this game with a more con- 
scious knowledge of its nature and possibili- 
ties; and develop this technique with a more 
purposeful and personal realization of its re- 
quirements. 
II 
Nor does this mean that I am urging you to 
become self-conscious in your reading. 
I happened, just now, to speak of reading as 
a game. Let us consider for a moment the re- 
lationship that self-consciousness bears to our 
performance in those more outward and ob- 
jective games — games where physical skill 
as well as mental supervision is involved — 
such as tennis, golf, billiards. 
Many people play tennis, or billiards, or 
golf, very much as most of us read — by the 
113
-P-A-G-E-122
  HOW TO READ 
spontaneous, unanalyzed, and all but undi- 
rected exercise of their natural aptitudes. 
They learn the rules. They flounder round 
for a time while their hands and eyes are get- 
ting the hang of the tools and their tricks. 
And then they go ahead, hit-or-missedly in- 
creasing their speed and accuracy and general- 
ship by the catch-as-catch-can, experimental 
route of personal practice. And in this sort of 
play, once the initial awkwardnesses are over- 
come and so long as one is pitted against play- 
ers of one’s own caliber, self-consciousness 
seldom figures. But once let such a player de- 
termine to “learn the game”; once let him 
place himself under the guidance of a teacher; 
and instantly self-consciousness becomes a 
prime factor to be taken into account — at 
once the subtlest means, and the deadliest 
foe, to progress. 
At first it is crassly and exaggeratedly pres- 
ent in all the student’s efforts. There are so 
many things that he has to do (things that he 
has been doing pretty well without knowing 
it, but now has to do better; things that he 
has been doing wrong, and now has to make 
himself do properly; things that he has not 
114
-P-A-G-E-123
A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
  been doing at all, and now has to take inte 
account) that for a time he feels as though 
he were driving sixteen horses abreast, while 
balancing himself on the bare back of one of 
them. 
But let us skip this phase of his training. It 
is to a later adjustment that I wish to call 
your attention. And, moreover, we have al- 
ready dealt with these initial problems of 
coérdination in comparing the developing of 
an auto-driver’s “‘unconscious alertness” to 
that required of the skillful reader. 
There comes a time, then, when this learner 
of a game of skill is dealing with such deli- 
cately mixed matters of muscular training 
and mental control as those involved in a 
billiard-player’s “stroke,” or a tennis-play- 
er’s “delivery” of a fast serve, or a golfer’s 
“follow-through.” He now understands the 
laws that govern the material objects he is 
manipulating. He knows definitely what it 
is that he is striving to accomplish. And he 
has acquired at least an occasional semi-per- 
fection of unconscious performance. But he 
wants to correct a fault, or to add a cubit to 
his efficiency, or to turn “occasional semi- 
115
-P-A-G-E-124
HOW TO READ 
    perfection” into a more constant and reliable 
asset of his technical equipment. And either 
under the direct guidance of a coach, or in 
self-supervised practice, he is endeavoring to 
attain this improved status. 
Almost every one of us has struggled, in 
some form of psycho-physical self-training, 
with this curiously baffling problem. And al- 
most every one of us has discovered in con- 
sequence that a deliberate, self-conscious de- 
termining of what it is that we wish to do, 
and of how it is that we propose to do it, is 
necessary before the undertaking of the act; but 
that the act itself must, if it is going to “get 
over” in any way worth mentioning, be per- 
formed with the free, untrammeled, unlooked- 
at play of physical spontaneity. 
Let us put it that the only way in which 
these niceties of skill can possibly be attained 
is by Self-Consciousness playing teacher to 
our muscles; by its going over and over for 
them the things they are to do and to leave 
undone; and by its then, at the crucial instant 
of execution, turning its back on them with a 
nice and considerate delicacy and saying,“‘Go 
ahead now, I’m not looking.” 
116
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
IIL 
And the same thing, precisely, is true of 
the subtler mind-training involved in improv- 
ing one’s reading skill. I am therefore so far 
from wishing to urge you to self-conscious- 
ness in reading that, on the contrary, I would 
urge you to a more and ever more zestful and 
complete yielding of yourself, in the actual act 
of reading, to the full, free, untrammeled play 
of your natural faculties. But I would have 
you train these faculties to a suppler and more 
efficient performance of their unconscious 
tasks, through a knowledge of the real nature 
of reading, and through an alert readiness 
personally to supervise the process on occa- 
sion. I would have you gradually develop a 
growingly intelligent system of individual ex- 
perimentation in the choice of what you read, 
based upon your growing understanding of 
our common and self-serving reasons for 
reading. And I would have you gradually 
learn to serve your personal ends more and 
more fully by concentrating your atten- 
tion and your interest and your subsequent 
criticism on what actually happens inside 
117
-P-A-G-E-126
  HOW TO READ 
of you when you read the things you have 
chosen. 
Iv 
We have already considered in some detail 
the question of personally supervising our 
reading processes as occasion demands and 
shall deal with other aspects of the matter 
later. 
In the present chapter we are going to seek 
out, from our actual experience in reading, a 
sound basis for a system of individual experi- 
ment in the choice of what we read. 
And afterward we shall examine more care- 
fully the true character and real importance 
of what actually happens in us in reading. 
But even for our present purpose it is im- 
portant that we have at least a general idea 
of the fact that “the things that actually 
happen in us when we read” form the sole 
value-basis that reading has for us, as well as 
the one basic test of all our judgments of its 
worth for us. 
And the proof of this is simple. 
Nothing whatever does happen when we 
read except what happens inside ourselves. 
118
-P-A-G-E-127
A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
And since we read wholly in terms of our past 
experience, these happenings all consist either 
of revivifyings of simple items of that experi- 
ence (revisualized seeings, reawakened emo- 
tions, and the like), or of new, never-before- 
achieved combinings of old experience into 
new awarenesses, new understandings, new 
sympathies and prejudices, new thoughts — 
in fine, into new experiences. 
But to know pleasure and pain, to feel de- 
light and disgust, to be moved to sympathy, 
resentment, pity, and hate, to observe human 
conduct and approve or deplore it, to judge it 
by our own and to estimate our own by it, to 
be stirred to active, self-defining acquiescence 
in the views of our fellows, or to be roused 
to an active, self-revealing formulation of 
our disagreement with them, — are not such 
things as these of the very essence of being 
alive? Are they not, indeed, the coefficients 
of living? And are not such things as these 
the precise sort of things, and the sole sort of 
things that happen in us when we read? 
But suppose none of them happen? 
Our proposition is proved by the absurdity 
of its converse. What possible value can any 
11g 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
HOW TO READ 
reading matter have for us, or what hand- 
hold for an estimate of it can we possess, if 
nothing whatever of all this happens in us 
when we read it? 
Vv 
Reading, then, is a form of living because of 
the things that happen in us when we read. 
And since our mothers sang lullabies to us in 
our cradles, and repeated Mother Goose to us 
in the nursery, and read us fairy tales before 
the fire, and told us stories at bedtime, we 
began to practice this form of living (we be- 
gan, let us say, to read by proxy) long before 
we learned our letters. 
Here, by the way, is another chance to dis- 
tinguish between the two kinds of “knowing 
how to read” — the kind that we are con- 
sidering in this book, and the kind that the 
United States census and the dictionary and 
the primary school have in mind. In the latter 
sense, you and I know how to read with our 
eyes; and a blind man knows how to read with 
his fingers; and a blind man with both arms 
amputated cannot know how to read at all. 
But suppose you were private secretary to an 
120
-P-A-G-E-129
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
armless blind man. And suppose that you 
_ (with your eyes and your vocal chords doing 
their humdrum tasks, but with your mind and 
your imagination busy elsewhere) were to 
read “David Copperfield” aloud to your in- 
tensely attentive employer. Which one of 
you, in the sense of our present inquiry, would 
you say had read the novel? 
VI 
We began, then, to live and (with the aid of 
a private secretary) we began to read, in the 
nursery. And we have been reading, as well as 
living, ever since. We read baby books in 
words of one syllable when we were toddlers. 
We read childrens’ stories in words of two 
syllables when we were children. As we grew 
older we read school primers and textbooks. 
We read “Alice in Wonderland” and “St. 
Nicholas.”” We read Sunday-school scenarios, 
and the “Youth’s Companion,” and penny- 
dreadfuls, and “Treasure Island,” and “Little 
Women,” and “The Golden Treasury,” and 
so on and so forth; up and out into maturity. 
Has there not, perhaps, without our realiz- 
ing it or thinking anything about it, been a 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
HOW TO READ 
definite and decipherable relationship between 
our developing selves and this progressive 
reading? A linked, organic, vital parallelism 
between them? Is it not possible that these 
two forms of living have marched, hand in 
hand, helping each other along, on an un- 
charted road that both followed, yet that 
neither took note of? 
And if this should prove true, what better 
way could we have of obtaining what we are 
seeking — a sense of direction in our reading 
— than that of diagraming this past relation- 
ship, mapping that part of this road that lies 
behind us, and then sighting ahead along these 
established lines ? 
Let us see if we cannot, somehow, find a 
point of vantage—a mental steeple, or 
mountain-top, or captive balloon — from 
which we can get a bird’s-eye view of the way 
we have come. 
vir 
J. Henri Fabre, that lovable old French 
savant with the soul of a poet, the attain- 
ments of a scientist, and the attitude of a 
philosopher, tells us, in one of his wonderful 
122 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
chapters on the life of the spider, how the 
young of the Banded Epira get their start in 
the world. 
The Banded Epira do not weave webs to 
snare their prey. They stalk their quarry, 
tiger-like, on foot; or lie in wait behind the 
petals of a rose and leap, like micro-jaguars, 
on the backs of bees that come to drink. But 
each one of them, none the less, has a silk 
mill in its abdomen. And it is upon the spin- 
nerets of this factory that the mother spider 
draws when she weaves the fleece-lined pouch 
in which she lays her eggs — the cocoon-like 
pellicule that she fastens beneath a twig at the 
foot of some spindling bush, and from which, 
later on, the heat of mid-July calls forth some 
six hundred pin-points of new-hatched life. 
And it is with the initial contents of these 
same spinnerets as their sole capital that 
these newborn mites start in on the business 
of living. 
No sooner have the six hundred emerged 
than they set out, en masse, to climb the bush. 
And as this, for such teeny climbers, proves a 
several days’ journey, the tribe, at each day’s 
end, spins itself a shelter which it occupies for

the night and abandons in the morning. And 
thus, alternately climbing and camping, at last 
they reach the top. And there, with feverish 
industry, they build a platform of interwoven 
strands. And upon this for a time they come 
and go, busily engaged in some work of prep- 
aration. And then — mystery or miracle 
for all the world like tiny witches traveling 
on broomsticks — they are seen, one by one, 
serenely to depart, floating on nothing through 
the summer air.

ingenious experiments conducted in his study, 
he at last discovered the simple secret of this. 
aerial dispersion — filaments of silk, so fine as 
to be invisible to the human eye, paid out to 
the breeze by each tiny spider until buoyant 
enough to support him; and then embarked 
upon, air-ship fashion, for the great adventure. 
And I have retold the story here because it 
is upon just such an embarkation that I am 
now asking you to join me. Like these spider- 
lets we have journeyed together, camping by 
the way, from the bottom of our bush. Like 
them we have built a sort of platform at the 
top. And now, like them, we are about to set

forth, supported, to the eye of the uninitiated, 
upon nothing, but really borne securely aloft 
upon two fine filaments of understanding that 
we have spun. 
Let us examine this air-craft. 
The first filament is the knowledge that we 
are makers when we read. That things read 
are not taken into the mind bodily from with- 
out, — sucked in through the eye like soda 
through a straw, — but are built up, brand- 
new, within us. That we do this building with 
assorted fragments of our own experience just 
as literally as a child builds castles with its 
wooden blocks. And that, just as the child’s 
block-architecture is conditioned by the 
quantity and variety of its supply, so the 
scope of our reading capacity depends upon 
the amount and variousness of living — of 
physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual 
living — that we have done. 
The second filament is the knowledge that 
no matter what we read or when, no matter 
whether we are conscious of it or not, we al- 
ways read either to “find ourselves” or to 
““get away from ourselves.” Either from the 
calculated desire, or from the playful joy, of

establishing some new order in our individual 
chaos; or for the comfort of forgetting the dis- 
order that has baffled us by turning to some 
fresh order-making. 
These are the wings of our bi-plane. 
VIII 
As we look down and back, between these 
buoyant bits of understanding about the way 
we read and our reasons for reading, we shall 
see the past, like a landscape, begin to open 
out beneath us. We shall see supposedly hap- 
hazard choices in our early reading fall into 
significant relationship to one another. We 
shall see method emerge from the mix-up. We 
shall see, finally, that the way we have come 
stretches, like a straight ribbon of road, visible 
and comprehensible before our eyes. 
Ix 
We see, for example, why, as little children, 
we liked to read Mother Goose. 
For the youngest child, no less than the 
wisest savant, reads with its own experience 
for building-blocks. But the child’s experi- 
126
-P-A-G-E-135
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
ence is very fragmentary. And, what is more, 
the fragments are as yet unassorted. 
Its mind is like a cupboard without parti- 
tions, into which all that it finds with its five 
senses — the pap-spoon and the puppy-dog, 
the taste of milk and the feel of stomach-ache, 
the sound of the cat’s miaow and the appear- 
ance of the moon’s disk— are all stowed away, 
helter-skelter, like loot gathered for a rum- 
mage sale. 
But though its experience is a jumble, yet 
already in this jumble the child “knows 
what it likes.” And, moreover, since it lives 
in a world where there is already “rhyme,” 
though not yet “reason,” it already, without 
knowing it, senses something about “art.” 
It is not yet equipped to read “Hamlet.” 
It is not even, as yet, equipped to read “ Puss 
in Boots.” But it is equipped to “produce” 
on the stage of its own consciousness — and 
it does take genuine joy in there “producing” 
— that famous scenario — 
“Hey diddle diddle! 
The cat and the fiddle; 
The cow jumped over the moon. 
The little dog laughed to see such sport 
And the dish ran away with the spoon.” 
127
-P-A-G-E-136
  HOW TO READ 
And while it is “producing” it, it laughs 
and claps its hands. For it is establishing a 
rhythmic order in the jumble of its experience. 
It is “making new combinations out of its 
stock in trade,” and is thus, according to 
its infant mood, either “finding itself” amid 
its chaotic environment, or — forgetting the 
colic. 
x 
We see, again, why it is that the same 
child, a bit later, reads fairy tales with such 
gusto. 
It has, by now, greatly multiplied its ex- 
periences. It has, moreover, begun to discover 
in others like traits to its own. It has begun 
to feel pity for others’ pain through imagining 
itself hurt. It has begun to take pleasure in 
others’ joy through imagining itself rejoiced. 
It has established a tentative (although a 
largely arbitrary and unwarranted) order in 
the jumble of its experience. It has grasped 
the crude principle (although it has not yet 
learned the hard-and-fast rules) of cause and 
effect. It has begun to distil ideas, and has 
developed its instinctive responsiveness to 
128
-P-A-G-E-137
  A.SENSE OF DIRECTION 
“rhyme” into a budding passion for “poetic 
justice.” And it is, without knowing it, eager 
for any opportunity or guidance that will en- 
able it to invest this capital; to arrange and 
rearrange it in explanatory sequences and 
satisfying symmetry. It is like a housewifr 
with a kettle of simmering jelly, looking round 
for moulds to pour it into. 
And as such scenarios as “‘Cinderella” and 
“The Sleeping Princess” are exactly the 
moulds it needs, it seizes upon them with 
avidity and pours its accumulated capital into 
them with a realism of mental stage manag- 
ership equal to Belasco’s. It lives them — 
quite literally — with round-eyed wonder and 
palpitant delight; and in the act it is con- 
structively “finding itself” through self-as- 
sertion even when we think that it is only for~ 
getting hurt feelings or a burned finger in the 
fascination of the inner ‘‘movies.” 
XI 
Let us glance in passing at boyhood. 
Some of you, I know, have before now asked 
yourselves why your growing boy, leaving the 
orthodox reading you had so carefully pro- 
129
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  HOW TO READ 
vided for him in the library, has stolen out to 
the lean-to behind the woodshed and buried 
himself in “Tomahawk Bill, the Terror of the 
Tetons.” Doubtless you felt that evil com- 
munications had corrupted his native man- 
ners. But you were wrong. If you will look 
down from our air-craft you will see that he 
did it, not from acaeine perversity, but from 
an inner urge. 
He did it for the same reas that the 
guinea hen “steals her nest” in the woodlot 
behind the barn. 
The guinea hen is half domesticated and 
half wild. When she “‘steals her nest” she is 
dramatizing her wild instincts. The boy is 
half civilized and half a savage. He reads 
dime novels to dramatize the imagining that 
the savage in him has done, or — to forget 
the “‘civilizing” that is being done to him. 
XII 
And now let us ask ourselves a subtler 
question. Let us ask why it is that adoles- 
cence — youth ripening toward maturity — 
reads with such glowing sympathy the visions 
of the poets, and produces with such zest the 
130
-P-A-G-E-139
A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
lighter scenarios of idealism and romance; 
while only a little later, the same individuals 
— new-fledged grown-ups now — are so often 
found demanding plots of stripped action and 
tales in which, to use their own expression, 
there is “something doing.” 
This, too, viewed from our altitude, is 
simple. 
Youth ripening toward maturity sees itself 
as the heir to the ages. It conceives the sum 
of its experience as a completed course of prep- 
aration. It is like a hound straining at the 
leash, or a runner tensed for the start. Its 
motto is “Just you wait!” 
It scorns to use its building-blocks of ex- 
perience, — the piled-up raw material of its 
preparedness, — except to build tall towers of 
what it means to do. It reads romance alter- 
nately to dramatize its own intentions, and to 
forget the tedium of enforced delay. 
But it is quite otherwise with new-fledged 
grown-ups. 
From strutting seniors in the University of 
Youth these have become yelled-at office boys 
in the department store of Life. From being 
the “leading citizens” in a land of dreams, 
131
-P-A-G-E-140
  
  HOW TO READ 
they have become tenderfeet on the frontier 
of Reality. 
It is, indeed, almost permissible to say that 
they have been born again. 
For if the boy (a creature physically active 
in a world of the imagination) is indeed “father 
to the man” (the average young man being a 
creature mentally alert in a world of physical 
endeavor) — then your newborn adult is a 
baby. And for a time he reads like a child. 
“Stories of action” are the Mother Goose 
rhymes of young maturity. The cows in them 
make magnificent leaps. The pussy-cats in 
them face the music. All the young dogs are 
elated. And in the end the dish always elopes 
with the spoon. In short, they are scenarios 
in which the unassorted fragments of a new, 
chaotic, “practical” experience are arranged 
in a rhythm of accomplishment. 
XIII 
So much, then, for what lies definitely be- 
hind us. Let us descend from our flight of ob- 
servation and take stock of our discoveries. 
We have seen that the roads of living and 
of reading do indeed parallel each other. And 
132
-P-A-G-E-141
    
A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
that in this parallelism they maintain an ac- 
tive, vital, organic relationship. And that, 
in the past at least, their joint direction has 
been the direction of our developing lives. 
We have seen, moreover that in traveling 
these linked roads it behooves us not only to 
live, but to owt-live. 
Do you, by any chance, doubt this last? 
I know a woman of forty-two who still plays 
at paper dolls, and who still responds with 
evidently pleasurable shudders to the reading 
of that earliest of our remembered tragedies, — 
“Hickory, dickory, dock! 
The mouse ran up the clock.” 
But, “Ah!” you are perhaps saying, “this 
is an extreme example.” 
So be it. Yet you all know, I am sure, men 
and women of an age approximate to hers 
who, having been safely born into maturity, 
went no further; and who still continue to 
ask, both of life and of letters, merely that 
“something shall happen on every page.” 
Do you not see what has overtaken them? 
They have let life cease to be a develop- 
ment and become a treadmill. They have let 
living cease to be an adventure and become a 
133
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  HOW TO READ 
habit. And their reading has, of necessity, 
followed suit. 
For although our reading ranges, appar- 
ently, much further afield than our lives, the 
moving centers of their activities coincide. 
Our living and our reading are like a man and 
his dog. The man walks along his chosen or 
his given way. The dog puts rings around him 
as he moves. Now the dog is ahead, nosing 
the path. Now it is far behind, re-sniffing the 
back trail. Now it is off to the right, announc- 
ing a treed squirrel. Now it is digging franti- 
cally for a ground-hog on the left. But always 
the center of the dog’s activities is the man’s 
moving footsteps. And if the man lies down 
by the side of the road and falls asleep, sooner 
or later the dog will come and stretch out 
beside him. 
XIV 
And now, having traced the course of these 
joint roads behind us, let us see if we cannot, 
on the same lines, prefigure their course ahead. 
Let us see if we cannot forecast the general 
direction of maturity’s living-and-reading de- 
velopment. 
134  
-P-A-G-E-143
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
Physical activity is, after all, only the basis 
of living; only the foundation — the root, if 
you prefer — of our emotional, our intellec- 
tual, our spiritual development. And it is 
along this line — it is in this direction if at all 
— that our development takes place and that 
our experiences pile up. And it is in circles 
round our progress along this line that that 
sheep-dog of our experiences, our reading, 
moves. 
For a time, as we have seen, scenarios of 
action engross us. But variety of action is 
circumscribed. The situations of physical ac- 
complishment, juggle them as we may, are 
limited in number. The meaning of life, we 
gradually discover, develops for us less through 
what happens tous from without than through 
what, as a direct consequence of this, happens 
to us from within. Our physical activities 
become ordered. Our emotional experiences 
accumulate. Sooner or later, therefore, we 
take to using these building-blocks of ex- 
perienced emotion in reading books of an 
emotional appeal. 
But the reading of love-stories may also 
cease to be an adventure and become a habit. 
135

HOW TO READ 
For the situations of emotion are also, both 
in life and in literature, limited in number. 
The real variousness of our common human- 
ity lies, not in the differences of our emotions, 
but in the infinite variety and conjugation of 
our personal reactions to emotion. Little by 
little, therefore, as our experienced realiza- 
tion of differences accumulates, we reach out 
toward the reading of books that marshal 
these differences — books of an intellectual 
appeal. Perhaps we begin with genre studies _ 
and move on to tales of character devel- 
opment. Perhaps we begin with local color 
effects and move on through parochial litera- 
ture and books of travel to memoirs, autobi- 
ographies, and treatises on historical periods. 
Perhaps we begin with handbooks of science 
and move on, through the rudiments of ab- 
normal psychology and the outlines of alien 
theologies, to the beginnings of speculative 
philosophy. Or perhaps we pick and choose, 
push out now on this side now on that — read 
anything and everything, in short, that, over- 
lapping in some measure our familiar lives and 
extending a bit beyond into the unknown, 
enables us to orient ourselves a little in an in- 
136

SS kaa a

finitely interesting world, or to forget, by con- 
structing these oases of deciphered orderliness, 
the immediate disorder that baffles us nearer 
home. 
And here, at first glance, it would seem 
that we are come to the parting of the ways. 
Thus far, we will have jogged along to- 
gether on a common road. But now that the 
highway breaks up into a maze of cart tracks, 
now that one of us may take the trail of sci- 
ence, another that of sociology, another that 
of fiction, or of esthetics, or of history, or of 
philosophy, it may seem that we shall never 
meet again. 
But this need not be so. 
To discover this it is only necessary for us 
to go on, each in his own way, with the twin 
adventures of living and reading. 
For, choose what by-ways you will, pursue 
as many of them as you can, you will find at 
last that they all give over their fanlike dis- 
persing and begin to bend inward toward 
reunion —a reunion hidden beneath the ho- 
rizon, but ever more and more definable in 
location by the simple geometry of this con- 
vergence. 
137 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  HOW TO READ 
For the ultimate meaning of life inheres, not 
in the multiplicity of differences that super- 
ficially distinguish us, but in the deeper one- 
ness of the common humanity that we share 
and into which these differences coalesce. And 
the final miracle of existence lies, not in the 
swarming diversity of living forms, and in the 
diverse laws of their separate being, but in 
the final unity of their relationship to the in- 
soluble Purpose of their common Source. 
Sooner or later, therefore, the persistent ex- 
plorers of the by-ways learn to use their ac- 
cumulated building-blocks of experienced di- 
versity for the reading of books dealing with 
unifying relationships — books not of anal- 
ysis, but of synthesis — books which, in a 
human instead of a theological sense, we 
must call books of a spiritual appeal: — the 
great novel scenarios of the deep-seeing, the 
great philosophic card-castles of the thinkers, 
the great poetic prophecies of the seers, the 
many-sided gospels of the elect. 
XV 
Here, then, is the sense of direction that 
we have been seeking. 
138
-P-A-G-E-147
  
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
But it is more than a sense of direction. It 
is the road itself. It is the inclusive highway 
of all our individual adventures. For it is the 
unbuoyed but inevitable channel of the mind. 
Along it, if we are to move at all, we must 
make our way. And while it is wide enough 
to accommodate us all, and deep enough to 
float genius itself, yet no flat-bottomed skiff 
of human intelligence is of such light draught 
that it will not ground on the mud flats at the 
channel’s edge if the course be lost. 
The woman referred to some pages back, 
the one of forty-odd who still plays at paper 
dolls and chortles over nursery rhymes, is 
hard aground at the very entrance to the fair- 
way — the machinery of her mind, poor soul, 
disabled in a collision between her head and 
the carriage-block when the nurse dropped 
her at the age of two. 
But there are more kinds of arrested devel- 
opment than are diagnosed by the doctors. 
Those other women — there are thousands 
of them — who never read anything but love- 
stories — the same old love-stories with the 
same old plots and the same old situations, 
everlastingly ripped and turned and sponged 
139
-P-A-G-E-148
  HOW TO READ 
and pressed and refurbished and retrimmed, 
but always modeled on the same adolescent 
dream and the same sixteen-year-old idealism 
— they too are hard aground a few years up 
the course. 
And those men— there are thousands of 
them — who vary the breakfast business- 
beer-garden-bed treadmill by reading endless 
successions of adventure tales and detective 
yarns and pipe-dreams of exotic action—“‘ be- 
cause they help to pass the time””— they too 
are keel-fast: grounded on the bar between 
an over-ripe adolescence and an undeveloped 
maturity. They are like mathematicians who 
spend their skill counting sheep to put them- 
selves to sleep. 
XVI 
But it is neither the nursery rhymes, nor 
the love-stories, nor the adventure scenarios 
that are at fault. 
All these things “belong.” 
No illusion or delusion, no dream or desire, 
no crude instinct or unfolding impulse or con- 
scious ideal that is native to humanity, is out- 
side the legitimate field of our realization and 
140
-P-A-G-E-149
A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
re-realization through reading — of our re- 
peated “redding up” and of our progressive 
formulation for ourselves in the constantly 
accumulating terms of our own experience. 
The only fault, the fatal fault, is stagnation 
— arrested development. 
Nor does this mean that we should leave 
nursery rhymes behind, and love-stories, and 
adventure tales. We shouldn’t. Not any 
more than we should kill the “child” in us, 
or the lover, or the sense of adventure. We 
should carry these things with us and de- 
velop them as we develop. There are nurs- 
ery rhymes for every mile of the way. There 
are love-stories for every stage of growth. 
There are adventures for every enlarge- 
ment of our consciousness and our under- 
standing. 
XVII 
But perhaps you will be asking why I have 
called this channel “unbuoyed” when there 
are so many guide-marks set up by earlier 
voyagers, so many charts of the best reading, 
so many pilot-critics ready to come aboard 
and steer for us. 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  HOW TO READ 
Tam not for a moment suggesting that you 
should discard any of these aids to navigation. 
But if you will recall our discovery as to how 
we get our meanings for words — by react- 
ing spontaneously to them and subsequently 
criticizing the reactions; and if you will re- 
member our noting the similar source of 
all life’s meanings for us — the subsequent 
weighing and valuing of our actual, spontane- 
ous, personal responses to life’s stimuli; and if 
you will remember our final conclusion that 
“culture” in any form is only derivable from 
books at all because reading is a form of living 
in that things actually happen in us when we 
read, — you will see why I used this word. 
All these buoyed courses of reading, all 
these charts of other voyagings, all these au- 
thorities on the shortest routes to selected 
destinations, invaluable as they are and most 
needful to be used by us to the fullest of their 
real power to serve us, are, and can only be, 
aids to intelligent experimentation on our in- 
dividual parts. 
For what actually happens in us when we 
read, and the way we combine these actual 
happenings with all that has previously hap- 
142
-P-A-G-E-151
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
pened in us both in living and reading — this 
is the sole, the determining, the final reality 
for each of us. And when we have studied all 
the charts there are, when we have listened to 
all the advice that is offered to us, all actual 
progress toward our ultimate destination 
(whatever that may be) is made by our push- 
ing ahead, up channel, and taking soundings 
as we go. 
XVIII 
It is no part of the purpose of this book to 
influence your choice of a goal. 
We all start from the same port and none of 
us are “bound through” — for the channel is 
longer than our individual lives and lengthens 
with the life of the race. But we sail, under 
sealed orders, bound for many havens. No 
two of us have the same equipment, the same 
driving power, the same draught, or the same 
radius of possible attainment. We are all born 
with a multitude of latent tendencies. We 
develop, or fail to develop, these in different 
orders and in different degrees as we go. And 
as we variously increase this development, 
we variously enlarge our outlooks and alter 
143 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  HOW TO READ 
our conscious objectives. And there are as 
many resultant routes as there are points 
of destination and people moving toward 
them. 
But it is all the same from the standpoint 
of our present inquiry. 
Our aim in reading may be the most aim- 
less pursuit of pleasure. Or it may be the 
most concentrated utilitarian seeking for 
knowledge. Or it may be the most many- 
sided desire for self-enhancement through 
coérdinated understanding. It may all be 
done through “wanting to forget,” or through 
“wanting to play,” or through “wanting to 
know,” or through such alternations or com- 
binations of these reasons as develop with 
our development. It makes no difference to 
our present inquiry. For the force behind 
any one of these urges, or the force behind 
any possible combination of them, can only 
expend itself either in driving us along some 
personal line of development in the direction 
that we have just determined and have called 
the inevitable channel of the mind, or in driv- 
ing us rudderlessly round and round some 
vicious circle of stagnation.

xIX 
Fortunately we now hold in our hands two 
mariners’ instruments of precision to help us 
in navigating this channel —a sextant with 
which to locate our position on the course, 
and a compass to tell us when we are headed 
right. 
Standing at noon with a sextant to his eye, 
the sailor, by measuring the height of the sun 
above the ocean’s rim, can figure his latitude 
in mid-Atlantic. And any one of us who will 
measure, with the glass of honest self-scrutiny, 
the height of his interest in life above the mean 
level of new-fledged grown-up-ism, can locate 
his position on the chart and stick a pin in it. 
As for the compass, it is a delicate instru- 
ment, but very simple. In reading, as we are 
now aware, we know but two urges to action. 
The first of these, the impulse to “find our- 
selves,” no matter how casual or how con- 
centrated its manifesting may be, is always in 
some shape a seeking for truth. To the second, 
the impulse to “‘escape from ourselves,” two 
courses are open. It may turn from a truth- 
quest that has tired us to a truth-quest that 
145 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
HOW TO READ 
stimulates, amuses, or allures — may seek a 
change of truth, like a city-dweller seeking the 
sea, or a hillsman descending to the plains. 
Or it may turn from the discouragement of 
living to the anodyne of reading lies about 
life. 
And the arrow of this interest impulse, for- 
ever oscillating on the pivot of our mood, is 
the needle of the compass. When, and only 
when, it swings toward truth, it points the 
channel. 
And “truth”? 
Inevitably at this point the Pontius Pilate in 
us — the finite in us, saving its face before the 
infinite — shrugs its shoulders and asks the 
unanswerable question, “What is Truth?” 
But let us not drag this metaphysical anise- 
seed bag across the trail of our inquiry. 
A human philosopher, trying to take in 
Truth with a capital T in order to define it, is 
like a Spanish mackerel, trying to swallow 
the ocean in which it swims in order to com~ 
prehend it. Many fishes have drowned and 
many philosophers gone mad in the frantic 
gluttony of these ambitions. So let us be at 
once more moderate and more practical. Let 
146 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  A SENSE OF DIRECTION 
us write “truth” with the lower case ¢ of our 
mortal limitations and define it in terms of 
the only pursuit of it that is open to us —a 
seeking-out of the discoverable relationships 
between the world inside us and the world 
without. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  CHAPTER VI 
THE WORLD OUTSIDE US AND THE 
WORLD WITHIN 
I 
Tue pursuit of truth as we have just defined 
it— the searching-out of discoverable rela- 
tionships between the life within us and the 
life without — is not a new or a specialized 
activity that is here being presented as worthy 
of your attention. On the contrary, it is an- 
other of those things that we have all been 
doing — another of those basic, inevitable, 
and universal activities that we have all been 
engaged in, sometimes consciously, but far 
more often without realizing it, in every hour 
of our lives and in every paragraph of our 
reading. 
And it is the purpose of the present chapter 
to do three things: (1) To bring home to each 
of us, in the familiar and recognizable terms 
of our common knowledge and experience, the 
fact that the searching-out of these relation- 
ships is, quite simply and literally, the essen- 
148
-P-A-G-E-157
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
tial reality of what we are actually and con- 
stantly doing when we read. (2) To show the 
immense advantage we can gain for ourselves 
by reading with this understanding as an op- 
erative part of our equipment. And (3) to 
point out a few practical ways of applying the 
lever of this advantage in our actual practice. 
II 
We all realize at once that the investiga- 
tions and experiments of a Pasteur are search- 
ings for relationships between the life inside 
us and the life outside. 
We see at a glance that the physician, and 
the bacteriologist, and the organic chemist, 
and the comparative psychologist, and the 
philosopher, and the theologian, are all, quite 
literally, pursuing truth in these terms. 
But we do not, as a rule, realize that every 
man and woman who reads in the morning 
paper a paragraph describing a tenement fire, 
or a society ball, or a murder in the slums, is 
doing the same thing. Indeed, if we happen 
never to have thought of the matter from this 
angle, this statement of it appears wholly 
absurd to us. The idea involved is one that 
149  
-P-A-G-E-158
  HOW TO READ 
we have never “distilled” and have n’t in 
stock. It is an idea that cannot, by being 
stated, be put into our heads. But it happens 
to be a realization the necessary ingredients 
of which we now have on hand and can there- 
fore proceed to compound. 
Tir 
If there is one fact that we have grown 
thoroughly to understand and accept, it is the 
fact that we have nothing to read with except 
our own experience — the seeing and hearing 
and smelling and tasting and touching that 
we have done; the fearing and hoping and 
hating and loving that has happened in us; 
the intellectual and spiritual reactions that 
have resulted; and the assumptions, under- 
standings, prides, prejudices, hypocrisies, fer- 
vors, foolishnesses, finenesses, and faiths that 
have thereby been precipitated in us like 
crystals in a chemist’s tube. 
Weare all, therefore, quite ready to nod our 
heads in agreement over the statement that 
we read in terms of mental conceptions made 
out of this accumulated experience, just as a 
child builds castles from its wooden blocks.

We are, in other words, agreed upon the 
character of our building-material. 
But we have not, as yet, turned the spot- 
light of our inquiry upon the character of 
these buildings themselves. We have not yet, 
except by the vaguest of implications, de- 
termined what it is that these outwardly dis- 
similar structures, that we are forever build- 
ing up and tearing down again on the nursery 
floors of our imagination, really represent. 
And this is the question that we are now about 
to ask ourselves. 
When we rustle the pages of the “Morning 
Advertiser” or open the “Evening Howl”; 
when we read the current numbers of our 
favorite magazines; when we enter the lists 
with Ivanhoe or camp with Achilles before 
Troy; when we repeople the cave-man’s cave 
or fore-furnish the mansions of the blessed, — 
what is the real character of the castles we are 
rearing with our building-blocks of past ex- 
perience? 
Let us put the cart before the horse and 
face the answer before we pursue the inquiry: 
All these structures represent ourselves. 
Of course I know that in reading this sen-

tence you are setting me down as a cynic. 
You have an uncomfortable feeling that I am 
“knocking” human nature. You would like 
to think that you are a bit bruised in your 
idealism. But I have hopes of regaining your 
confidence. For, to begin with, it is not the es- 
sential you that is shocked by this statement; 
it is some of those “assumptions, prejudices, 
and hypocrisies that have been precipitated 
in you” that are shocked. The essential 
you makes an involuntary motion of recog- 
nition toward the statement and is shame- 
facedly ready, somehow, to rejoice in it. And, 
as we shall see presently, the essential you is 
eminently right. For it is ourselves — our- 
selves subdivided and reassembled, ourselves 
dressed up and disguised and commissioned to 
play a part, ourselves outfitted and sent forth 
on adventure-tours of investigation, and then 
recalled to make reports— that we read with. 
And in this complex and many-mannered 
reaching out and harking back it is ourselves 
that we are, in endless alternation, building 
into and building out of the world as we go. 
But let me introduce you to a young castle- 
builder that I met the other day.

Iv 
He was standing, straddle-legged, on River- 
side Drive, looking down to one of the jutting 
piers from which covered carts of ashes were 
being dumped into waiting scows. He was 
about five — dressed in a sort of tight-fitting 
union suit, hand-knitted out of white wool. 
And as I passed him I heard him announce 
to his nurse in tones of irrevocable deci- 
sion, “When I’m big I’m going to be an ash- 
man.” 
Now the chances are that before the news of 
his determination reaches you he will have 
changed his mind. He may even, meanwhile, 
have made and unmade other choices of pro- 
fession. And the odds are overwhelmingly in 
favor of his ultimately turning out something 
widely different from them all — say a stock- 
broker. But somewhere, deep down inside the 
bank president or bookkeeper that he and Life 
will some day compromise on his becoming, 
there will remain that ashman possibility — 
that undeveloped ashman-self — that I re- 
cently saw him in the act of realizing. There 
_ will remain, also, the policeman possibility, 
153 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
    HOW TO READ 
and the possibilities of the engine-driver, the 
plumber’s assistant, the recruiting sergeant, 
the drum major, and the sandwich man, each 
of which he will for a while have seen himself 
capable of being. And there will remain other 
deep-buried possibilities. Hundreds — thou- 
sands —of possibilities and of combinations of 
them. There will be possibilities that he will 
have glimpsed and forgotten. There will be 
possibilities that he will have developed a 
little and abandoned. There will be possibili- 
ties the existence of which he will never have 
so much as suspected. In short, there will be 
in him the more or less undeveloped germs of 
all the innumerable potential selves that life, 
as he will have lived it, will have given him no 
chance to be. 
And this, at the moment that you read 
these words, is true of you. It is true of me 
as I write them. It is true of us all. We are 
populous with unrealized selves: with might- 
have-been’s; with partially-were’s; with some- 
times-are’s; with may-yet-be’s. And the char- 
acter-structures that we rear when we are 
reading are working models of these potential 
selves.

When, a moment since, I spoke of “entering 
the lists with Ivanhoe,” I spoke inaccurately 
on purpose in order, now, to call your atten- 
tion to the truth. We do not “enter the lists 
with Ivanhoe.” We enter the lists as Ivanhoe. 
When we read Homer, we do not “camp with 
Achilles before Troy.” What really happens 
is this: Out of the experience-material at our 
command, — out of our visits to militia en- 
campments, perhaps, and to museums, out of our own tent experience on fishing trips or at 
garden parties, out of our memories of pic- 
tures and our realizations from other reading, 
— we contrive the Homeric encampment on the Trojan plain. We erect, more or less viv- 
idly and informedly according to our habit 
and our equipment, the hero’s tent with the 
shields hung upon its outer walls and the 
spears set up before its tight-closed door. And 
having done all this we install therein a work- 
ing model of Achilles made out of our own at- 
tributes. It is not Achilles who hides behind 
that imagined canvas. It is some quickly 
achieved amalgam of our touchy selves and 
155
-P-A-G-E-164
HOW TO READ 
  of the potential hero lurking in us, that sulks 
there while the armies wait. And it is the 
same when we read of a murder in the “ Even- 
ing Howl.” It is not the actual murderer who 
then reénacts his crime, or the actual victim 
who dies another death. It is the potential 
assassin in us who lifts a knife, and the po- 
tential victim in us who shudders as she drops. 
And yet, this is only half the truth. 
For having, out of our own potentialities, 
made an Ivanhoe to ride into the lists, we re- 
tire, as it were, to the side-lines and watch the 
Ivanhoe we have created and sent forth. Hav- 
ing contrived a personal and heroically sulky 
Achilles out of our own attributes, we straight- 
way scale the imagined walls of Troy and look 
down with new eyes upon the ancient world. 
Having made a murderer and a victim out of 
the might-have-been’s and the may-yet-be’s 
within us, we sit, as it were, in reserved seats 
at our own movies, and experience (in vary- 
ing degrees according to our natures and our 
moods at the moment) the passions of par- 
ticipants and the emotions of onlookers. 
In fine, having, at the instigation of the 
author, explored a new corner of the world 
156
-P-A-G-E-165
  
    WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
within us and made a new synthesis of what 
we found there, we proceed, in the person of 
the character thus created, to explore new 
aspects of the outer world. 
VI - 
Let us pause a moment, here, to draw a 
subtle yet highly important distinction. In 
every elaborate narrative, historical, fictional, 
or what-not, there are figures — men, women, 
and children—that we visualize, whose 
words we listen to, whose actions we vita- 
graph, whose very heft and bulk and, it may 
be, contact with ourselves, we vividly realize 
and are aware of; yet with whom we do not at 
all, in the sense above set forth, identify our- 
selves. And the fact that we do not, any more 
than if they were trees or houses or other in- 
animate portions of the external world, con- 
struct these figures as working models of our 
potential selves, may seem, at first glance, to 
vitiate the analysis and exposition above ar- 
rived at. 
But a moment’s consideration will suffice to 
give us the explanation. These figures are mere 
objects in the external world. ‘The fact that 
157 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  HOW TO READ 
they are animate objects — the fact that they 
are animate human objects even — does not 
in the least alter their relation of externality 
to the character or characters with whom for 
the moment we are ourselves identified. 
But mark the change that may, at any 
moment, take place in the equilibrium of our 
attitude. Let one of these figures cease to be 
a mere animated object in the story’s world, 
and become, for a page or a paragraph even, 
the experiencing subject of the story’s emotions, 
let one of them change, for so little as two 
minutes, from being a part of that outer- 
world-that-is-being-explored and become the 
explorer, and instantly we begin to “judge 
him by ourselves,” to “put ourselves in his 
place.” In the one case we construct these 
figures, exactly as we construct the trees and 
houses, the horses and cattle of the story’s 
requirements, from the stored observation 
and accumulated materialism of our past ex- 
perience. In the other we construct them, no 
matter how fleetingly and sketchily, as vicari- 
ous embodiments of our potential selves. In 
the one case we regard them as a part of that 
“world outside us” with which we are seeking 
158
-P-A-G-E-167
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
discoverable relationships. In the other case 
we regard them as a phase of the “world 
within us” momentarily dramatized and en- 
gaged in the search. 
VII 
And this brings us to a point where, as the 
children say, we are “very warm.” We are 
now so near to the idea that we have set out to 
grasp and make our own that we should only 
need, if we knew the way, to reach out the 
fingers of our minds and curl them round it. 
We have discovered the character of the 
buildings that we are constantly erecting, as 
we read, out of the building-blocks of our past 
living. We know now that all these structures 
represent, either phases of the world within 
us, or phases of the world without. And we 
know that in all our reading we are in some 
manner confronting some potentiality of our 
own with some conceivable situation. As yet, it 
is true, we have only demonstrated these facts 
with regard to fiction, history, epic poetry, or 
some form of narrative composition. But we 
shall shortly satisfy ourselves that the same 
conditions hold true in the reading of the 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
HOW TO READ 
  driest scientific treatise or of the most ab- 
stract philosophical speculation. 
It only remains, therefore, for us to con- 
vince ourselves — not on the authority of 
some one’s say-so, but from our own criticism 
of our own experience— that the actual rele- 
vancy to ourselves of these constantly varied 
confrontations, and the source of the enjoy- 
ment derived from making them, lies, as we 
have assumed, in their being seekings-out of 
discoverable relationships between the two 
worlds from which they are taken. 
Let us see if we can do this. 
You and I and almost every American of 
our generation have, at some flaming moment 
of realization, thanked God that he or she had 
not been handicapped as was Helen Keller; 
and have marveled at the triumph of her al- 
most incredible climbing out of the prison of 
herself into consciousness of the world and 
into communion with her fellow men. And 
it is even possible to ask ourselves whether, 
had Miss Keller not been vouchsafed the 
few months of sight and hearing that were 
hers in infancy, she could later on have been 
released from her solitary confinement.

But we are less likely to have realized that, 
at the instant of birth, every one of us is im- 
prisoned, incomunicado, in our undeveloped 
selves; and that it is not in initial situation, 
but in means at hand for escape from that 
situation, that we differ from a child borr 
into eternal darkness and unbreakable silence. 
For we, unlike such a misfortunate, are 
born into a world visibly peopled by our kind. 
From the first, the instructions of our instincts 
are supplemented by impulses of imitativeness 
derived from without. We see, with uncom- 
prehending eyes, long before we are con- 
sciously stirred to perception. We suck in ex- 
planations through our senses long before we 
know that we are to have need of them. But 
such a Helen Keller as we have imagined, 
having almost no way of recognizing the exist- 
ence of others, would have almost no way of 
picking the lock of her own meaning. It 
would not merely be that the things that 
touched her body would be non-existent to 
her except as contacts: the very things that 
she touched herself with — her own fingers and 
toes — would be inexplicable to her because 
she knew no others like them.

We have all, in our time, thrilled at the 
thought of Robinson Crusoe, discovering in 
the sand of his island beach a footprint that 
was not his own. But think of some Helen 
Keller, marooned before she was born on a far 
more isolate island, stretching out what she 
did not know was a human hand and finding 
in the void a face the facsimile of hers! 
That face we can think of as her first book. 
It would be printed in raised characters for 
the blind. Slowly, like one spelling out unfa- 
miliar words, we can imagine her reading its 
features in terms of her own. And then, in the 
two-edged moment of final realization, we 
can imagine her first conception of personal 
identity unfold into her first inkling of an 
ordered world. 
Vill 
But let me tell you of an actual experience 
of my own. 
Little by little, when I was a boy, I became 
conscious of the fact that in learning the al- 
phabet, and in learning to count, I had some- 
how involuntarily assigned positions in space 
to the letters and numerals of these series. 
162 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
    
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
Indeed I had built these letters and numer- 
als into definite and visualizable structures, 
which never changed, which were almost al- 
ways present at the back of my consciousness 
when I was dealing with letters or numbers, 
and upon which, as upon a scaffolding, I lo- 
cated say the letter P, or the number 45, when 
I had occasion to deal with either as a part 
of asystem. Thus the numerals from I to II 
were to me a set of steps that led up to a plat- 
form that was 12. Between this platform and 
another (which was 20) the teens, like a rope 
ladder, hung in a sagging curve. And from 20 
to 100 the figures climbed in a series of rigid 
scaling-ladders of nine rungs each, that were 
set up between platforms that receded as they 
rose. The alphabet, on the other hand, ran 
directly away from me, rising and falling like 
a one-track scenic railway. Even the Lord’s 
Prayer: was organized. It ran down, like a 
trail into some cafion, from ‘‘Our Father,” at 
the top in the sun, to a dark, deep bottom 
where “Amen” echoed in the gloom. 
And as I grew older, and no one in my hear- 
ing ever mentioned having such notions, I 
came to assume that no one had them. I be- 
163 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  HOW TO READ 
gan to fancy myself, in this respect, different 
from my kind— mentally deformed. The 
consciousness of the thing became a secret 
trouble of which I was ashamed; and there 
were even times when I wondered if it might 
not be the beginning of insanity. 
And then, on a happy evening, a young 
physician of my adolescent acquaintance 
happened in the course of conversation to 
mention this almost universal child-habit of 
contriving space-symbols for mind-sequences. 
He spoke of the fact that as we grow up we 
gradually cease to need them, and hence dis- 
card and forget them; so that many people in 
later life are quite unconscious of ever having 
had or used them. He asked me whether, by 
chance, I still remembered mine. 
Can you not imagine the eagerness with 
which I described to him my prayer-cafion, 
my numerical scaling-ladders, my alphabetical 
scenic railway? Can you not picture the in- 
terest with which I leaned over his shoulder 
while he took pencil and paper and drew for 
me diagrams of his own symbol-conceptions 
and of those of others? 
For myself, I shall never forget that even- 
164
-P-A-G-E-173
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
ing. For on it, like the Helen Keller we have 
imagined, I reached out into the dark and 
found a duplicate of myself. On it I got my 
first inkling of the truth I am here illustrating 
for you.

For it is only as members of a species that 
we are comprehensible to our own intelli- 
gence. 
It is only by our likeness to others that we 
understand ourselves. It is only by their like- 
ness to us that we understand others. And 
these two understandings are not independ- 
ent of each other and separate. They are 
complementary to each other and reciprocal 
—like the indrawing and exhaling of our 
breath. The life within us and the life with- 
out are halves of a whole. 
Of course it may occur to you to challenge 
the statement that we only arrive at an un- 
derstanding either of ourselves or of one 
another through our mutual resemblances; 
because, for each one of us, so large a part of 
these reciprocal understandings consists of 
estimated differences. But these differences, 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  
  HOW TO READ 
when we come to sift them, always turn out 
to be differences of degree and never differ- 
ences of kind. To you, a ruby lantern sus- 
pended in darkness may bea jewel and a joy; 
while a green lantern, similarly placed, may be 
almost a matter of indifference. And to me 
these conditions may be reversed. Yet if we 
compare notes we readily understand each 
other. But a man who was color blind, and to 
whom, in consequence, red and green were 
utterly and forever undistinguishable, could 
only make shift to understand our feelings in 
regard to them by telling himself that, what- 
ever they were, they must be of a nature an- 
alogous to his own feelings in regard to blue 
and orange. And a man born blind, although 
from repeated assurances he might have come 
to accept it as a fact that he was somehow 
different from us others, could never in the 
remotest sense conceive the nature of the 
difference. 
> 
And what we have thus come to realize as 
true in regard to the life we share with other 
humans, is equally true of the life we share in 
166
-P-A-G-E-175
    
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
a less complete manner with all that is ani- 
mate on earth. It is through their disclosed 
resemblances to ourselves, and by our conse- 
quent fragmentary ability to “put ourselves 
in their places,” that alone we are able to 
understand the impulses that move these 
other lives and to estimate the differences in 
degree that mark the gulfs between us. 
And I hope that at this point you will cry 
out in protest against my apparent neglect 
of our manifest ability to know the “facts” 
about an insect or an animal without in the 
least understanding it or caring to. For this 
brings us face to face with the last point nec- 
essary to be elucidated for the complete 
grasping of the idea that we are engaged in 
introducing ‘‘into our heads.” 
For the only means we have of “knowing 
the facts” about an insect or an animal, is the 
noting of the relationships that it bears to the 
material world—that is to say, to the environ- 
ment that we share in common with it. And 
our sole means of acquiring knowledge, under- 
standing, or mastery over this environment— 
over the world without us — or of instinc- 
tively and progressively adapting ourselves 
167 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  'HOW TO READ 
to its iron-clad requirements, is the conscious 
or unconscious seeking-out of its relation- 
ships to ourselves — to the world within us. 
For these two worlds are also halves of a 
whole. 
xI 
Just as it is true, then, that it is only as 
members of a species that we—or it—are 
comprehensible to our own intelligence; so it 
is true that it is only as members of the physi- 
cal universe that we as such members, or it as 
such a universe, are in any measure to be 
grasped by us. 
And exactly as we read a novel, or a history, 
or an epic, or any narrative of human activity, 
by confronting successive “characters,” — 
successive dramatized syntheses of our own 
inner selves, — with various aspects of the 
world and of life, so we read a work on mathe- 
matics, or a description of a mechanical de- 
vice, or a speculation in abstract science or 
philosophy, by confronting successive syntheses 
of our previously gathered perceptions and ideas 
on the subject with the successive new condi- 
tions proposed by the author. 
168
-P-A-G-E-177
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
We do not read this way because we have 
studied the matter out and have determined 
that it is a good way to do. We do it because 
we are built that way and have to. We read 
this way because, the world within us and the 
world without being related as they are, it is 
the only way we have of reading. And all of 
our reactions to reading — all our laughter 
and tears, all our elations and depressions, all 
our delights and disgusts, our acceptances and 
rejections, our understandings and percep- 
tions and acquiescences and disagreements — 
are the direct and sole result of supposedly 
discovered relationships between these two 
worlds, made in the course of these mental 
and imaginative confrontations. Thus laugh- 
ter is a reaction to relationships discovered 
where they were least expected, or to relation- 
ships appearing to exist, but suddenly dis- 
covered to be preposterous. 
XII 
And now, before we go on to consider the 
advantages we can gain by making this idea 
that we have now grasped an operative ele- 
ment in our actual reading, let us pause a 
169
-P-A-G-E-178
  HOW TO READ 
moment and look back, with this new under- 
standing in mind, at the separate steps of our 
earlier inquiry. We shall see that the facts 
that we have there successively established 
vpke sack to join hands in a ramifying 
network of significance, and that our previous 
conclusions are already establishing among 
Biethoolics cross-references of connection. 
When, for example, we recall the first chap- 
ter of this book, we see more many-sidedly 
than at first why it is only through the story 
that we tell ourselves that an author’s story 
gains meaning for us. 
hen we remember our examination into 
the function of the dictionary, we see fresh 
reasons why we have constantly to contrive 
new meanings of our own for the words of 
others. 
When we now look back at those vague and 
egotistical sounding phrases, “‘a desire to find 
ourselves” and a desire to “get away from 
ourselves,” we find that we have acquired 
a more complex but also a more ordered con- 
ception of the true meanings of these expres- 
sions; and that the sanctions that underlie 
them have become less questionable to us. 
170   
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
We see, also, more clearly and comprehend- 
ingly why it is that only those “meanings” 
(which is to say those ideas of relationship) 
that we have first internally felt and then 
objectively criticized (which is to say meas- 
ured up with other accepted meanings and 
relationships) can— whether they be the 
meanings of words or the meaning of the 
world — become a part of individual culture 
for us. 
We see new reasons why that sense of direc- 
tion which we defined for ourselves in the last 
chapter, and found to coincide with the line of 
development of the individual and the race, is 
not a matter of our arbitrary choice, but of 
inherent necessity — why it is that we must 
somehow move along it, or somewhere stag- 
nate on the way. 
We see, as we could not see at the beginning 
of the present chapter, that the living that we 
ourselves do is never really comprehended by 
us until (with or without the aid of books) we 
have read and re-read it into other lives; and 
that the infinitely various livingness of others 
is never really grasped by us until we have 
read and re-read it into as many as may be of 
171
-P-A-G-E-180
    HOW TO READ 
those potential selves that life has denied us 
the chance to be. 
And we see, finally, that “the adventure of 
learning to read,” that we spoke of on an 
earlier page, —the lifelong adventure of 
learning progressively to reémploy the living 
that we do for the further exploring of these 
two infinitely interesting worlds, — is not two 
adventures, but the inseparable halves of one 
adventure. 
XIII 
And now we come to the second point of 
our present discussion— the advantages that 
will acrue to us if we make deliberate use 
of this idea in our reading. 
We have seen that all our reactions to read- 
ing, no matter how momentary or how mo- 
mentous they may be, are in reality reactions 
to relationships consciously realized or uncon- 
sciously sensed as existing, either directly be- 
tween some aspect of our inner selves and 
some aspect of the outer world, or directly be- 
tween various aspects of the outer world, each 
of which bears its own relation to our inner 
selves. And what we are really asking our- 
172  
-P-A-G-E-181
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
selves is how (since we seem to achieve these 
reactions instinctively and spontaneously and 
without taking thought about them) it can 
possibly advantage us deliberately to note 
their nature and consciously to inquire from 
time to time into their hidden meanings. 
And the answer (which is twofold) is based 
on the fact that we are forced by the very con- 
ditions of our being either to read on into new 
realizations of relationship, or to read round 
and round in the worn circle of those we have. 
And the first half of this answer is that every 
road of reading, no matter what its character 
may be or what may be our purpose in follow- 
ing it, will sooner or later be blocked for us by 
unrealized relationships unless we learn little 
by little to deal recognizingly and inquiringly 
with relationships as they arise. And the sec- 
ond half of the answer is that every relation- 
ship thus consciously noted and more or less 
criticized and codrdinated with others of its 
kind, becomes a part of our reading capital — 
becomes a building-block in itself, employable 
at need either as a unit in future construc- 
tions, or as an entering wedge in future analy- 
ses. 
173 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  HOW TO READ 
XIV 
And this brings us to our third point — the 
problem of method. 
How are we to set about developing this 
seeking-out of relationships into an actively 
operative factor in our actual reading, with- 
out making a labor of what should be an en- 
grossing adventure and a zestful satisfying of 
our natural appetites? 
And before attempting to answer this ques- 
tion — before indicating a practicable ap- 
proach to a method whose later developments 
are always individual adaptations of personal 
means to personal ends — it will be well for us 
to place before ourselves, on the one hand, a 
reminder, and, on the other hand, a caution. 
Let us be careful to remember, then, that to 
speak of our inborn and instinctive craving 
for recognized relationships between our com- 
plex selves and our involved environment as 
a “natural appetite,” is by no means a figure 
of speech. For a natural appetite is exactly 
what this craving is. It is as basic and as 
actual an appetite as that for food. And just 
as we are guided to the seeking of food by 
174
-P-A-G-E-183
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
hunger, so we are guided to the seeking of re- 
lationships by curiosity. And just as we 
judge the food we find, primarily by our un- 
criticized likes and dislikes of its taste and 
smell, so we judge the relationships we dis- 
cover, primarily by our uncriticized likes 
and dislikes of their implications. And just 
as we alter our appreciations and modify our 
habits in regard to food, and are influenced 
in our later attitudes toward it by subtle 
matters of digestive results and gustatory 
education, so we gradually reorganize our 
standards of value and extend our range of 
enjoyment in the seeking of relationships, in- 
fluenced thereto by the accumulating under- 
standings that are the result of intellectual 
digestion. And this fact—this appetite-rela- 
tion that. curiosity bears to our reading —it 
will be well for us to keep in mind. 
The caution that we must remember, on 
the other hand, is that all development, along 
such lines and by such steps as we are about to 
examine, is a development and must be gone 
through stage by stage. The juggler who holds 
us fascinated by the easy dexterity with which 
he keeps eleven balls cascading in the air 
175
-P-A-G-E-184
re Oe er eer treme err a nae

above his hands, did not begin with eleven. 
He began with two— acquiring, so to say, 
a muscular familiarity with the relations be- 
tween them and his hands before adding a 
third ball and beginning to master the relation- 
ships thus complicated. How much more, 
then, is it necessary for us to be modest in our 
beginnings in acquiring control over these far 
more tricksy and more mutually interdepend- 
ent playthings, the relationships with which 
we are now dealing? 
xV 
The first rule, then, that it behooves us to 
observe for a gradual, unforced, yet effective 
approach to this better reading, is that we 
must learn to look upon our curiosity as the 
prompting of our mental hunger. We must, lit- 
tle by little, learn to value our curiosity just as 
we learn, little by little, to value “appetite.” 
And we must learn, little by little, to exercise 
something of the same common sense and 
common caution in the satisfying of the one 
that we do in the satisfying of the other. 
The French have a proverb which says that 
the man who does not understand his own 
176   
 
-P-A-G-E-185
    
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
stomach at thirty is a fool. Let us be honest 
enough to apply this aphorism to our minds 
also. 
XVI 
It should not, by now, be necessary, but it 
may none the less be wise, to point out that 
any reading that we do which is undertaken 
through some impulse of “wanting to know” 
is directly motivated by curiosity. And that 
any reading that we do which is undertaken 
through some impulse of “wanting to play” 
is motivated by that form of potential curios- 
ity that we call “keenness” and which is at 
the very least a readiness to be interested. And 
that no reading undertaken through any 
impulse of “wanting to forget” can really be- 
come effective of its object unless one or other 
of these forms of curiosity shall, like hunger 
aroused by eating, be stirred to life in us by 
the act of reading. 
Curiosity, then, is the only conscious stimu- 
lus we have to begin with; and it continues to 
be, throughout whatever reading develop- 
ment may come to us, the underlying motive- 
power back of all our seekings, all our find- 
177 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    HOW TO READ 
ings, and all our passings-on. And the inten- 
tion of our first rule is the practical applying 
of this knowledge, by gradually learning to 
regard as an appetite all curiosity or keen- 
ness that impels us toward reading, and to 
regard all the reading that we do as in some 
sort a satisfying of an appetite. 
But this being understood, it must be noted 
that overt curiosity and anticipatory keen- 
ness, and developing interest, are all, when we 
begin a book or a magazine article or what- 
not, apt to be of a general or “blanket” va- 
‘riety; and are apt, in the main, to develop 
cumulatively along some central and special- 
ized axis; as when, as we frequently say, we 
become “so interested in a story” that we can 
“hardly wait to see how it comes out.” And 
we shall have occasion later on to consider the 
guiding of our curiosity in regard both to the 
developing relationships involved in a story’s 
unfolding and to the criticizing of indicated 
conclusions involved in a story’s ending. But 
for the moment we must pass these larger 
matters by in order to examine certain minor 
manifestations of curiosity or interest that 
more immediately concern us. 
178
-P-A-G-E-187
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
Please note, then, that, even in reading the 
most engrossing story in the world, the swift 
surface of the main stream of our interest is 
constantly flecked by floating feelings of lik- 
ing and disliking; is constantly flawed by little 
upwelling bubbles of inquiry; is constantly 
dimpled by tiny whirlpools of subsidiary curi- 
osities, — curiosities as to why’s and where- 
fore’s and probabilities and fittingness, — all 
of which, as we now know, are instinctive 
sensings or half-conscious reachings-out after 
relationships. And this fact, so universally 
common in the experience of us all, yet so 
frequently regarded with impatience or in- 
difference, brings us to the formulation of our 
second rule. 
XVII 
For these floating flecks of liking and dis- 
liking, these momentary impulses of inquiry 
that appear for a second like bubbles on the 
surface of our attention, these little swirls of 
curiosity that form, and are lost again as we 
read on, are not only the actual, concrete em- 
bodiments of those spontaneous reactions to 
“meanings” that we discussed in an earlier 
179  
-P-A-G-E-188
    HOW TO READ 
chapter; but they constitute our natural 
promptings toward the kind of reading — the 
reading that is an adventurous seeking-out of 
relationships between our two worlds — that 
we are here discussing. 
Our second rule, therefore, is that we must 
learn to evaluate our subsidiary curiosities. 
How often has it not happened to each of 
us, in hurrying across some stone-paved 
station or down some mosaic-floored hallway, 
to hear a little tinkle as of metal on marble be- 
hind us, and to half-wonder for a second what 
it was, and then, the next day, perhaps, to 
miss some trinket that we valued and to say, 
“There! That must have been what dropped 
when I heard that noise!” 
The promptings of our subsidiary curiosi- 
ties as we read are the tinkling sounds of rela- 
tionships dropping in our paths. 
XVIII 
“But,” you may exclaim, “if I am to in- 
terrupt my reading every time that I am con- 
scious of a like or a dislike, every time I ex- 
perience a tendency toward inquiry, every 
time I am conscious of a blur of puzzlement 
180
-P-A-G-E-189
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
or twinge of curiosity, what is to become of 
the ‘merged series’ of my ‘mental movies’? I 
want to read my book. 1 don’t want to run an 
intellectual detective agency!” 
And this objection, if any such procedure 
were required of us, would be eminently well 
taken. But happily this is not the case. We 
must learn to value our subsidiary curiosities, 
but, as we shall presently see, there is a very 
simple and practical way of discriminating 
between them. Moreover, a large majority of 
these collateral stirrings of our interest and 
curiosity that are prompted by our reading, 
are actually dealt with by such instant and 
hardly noticed mental gestures as that de- 
scribed in the case of our reading of the sen- 
tence, “The bond that held them together 
was thus a spiritual tie.” 
You will now see, by the way, that the 
“meaning” problem involved in that sentence 
was, in reality, a relationship problem. 
It is true that the beginner, who is for the 
first time trying consciously to improve his 
methods of reading along these lines, will on 
occasion be rendered self-conscious by his new 
realization of the multiplicity of such prompt- 
181
-P-A-G-E-190
    HOW TO READ 
ings. But in practice he will soon find that 
most of these matters are being dealt with 
without, so to put it, his mind’s bothering 
him about them. For in all our activities, 
mental as well as physical, there is a constantly 
shifting focus of conscious attention, upborne 
by a whole sub-system of unconscious ade- 
quacy and action. And one of the first things 
that an observer learns about his mind action 
in reading is that, while the conscious focus of 
his intelligence is “reading his book,” another, 
half-conscious portion of his mental activity is 
engaged in correcting slight errors of under- 
standing, picking up dropped stitches of 
minor relationship, and generally “redding 
up” and keeping things decently shipshape 
behind him as he goes along. 
And as this rear-guard portion of one’s 
reading activity is quite as dependent as the 
other upon one’s reading capital of past ex- 
perience, of already realized relationships, 
and of previously cross-referenced under- 
standings, the longer one practices the better 
and more purposeful reading we are consider- 
ing, the more quick-witted and efficient and 
joyously industrious does this half-conscious 
182   
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
portion of our mind become in the prosecu- 
tion of its humble yet vastly important work. 
XIX 
Yet the fact remains that there are many 
promptings of our subsidiary curiosity with 
which this half-conscious and essentially co- 
operative portion of our minds is incapable of 
dealing. There are, indeed, many more of 
them than we have either time or need to deal 
with at all. And so we must discover some 
touchstone of discrimination. 
We do not, as a matter of fact, and because 
we have lost a few lockets and cigarette cases 
and knives and gold coins by neglecting the 
tinkle they made in falling, go about forever 
after investigating every sound we hear be- 
hind us, or eternally slapping all our pockets 
in turn to make sure that we are missing noth- 
ing. We learn, after a while, to discriminate 
between tinkles. And this discernment is the 
problem we are now facing. Moreover it in- 
volves, and brings down to the test of actual 
practice (as I hope you will see) some of those 
shrewd distinctions between conscious and 
unconscious performance that we have previ- 
183 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
eo ee ae 
HOW TO READ 
ously discussed, and some of the principles of 
deliberate criticism and control of spontaneous 
reactions to what we read that we have already 
inquired into. 
xx 
Here, then, is our third rule — a rule upon 
which, in the beginning, we can safely rely 
for a conservative yet valid discrimination 
and for a gradual but effective habit-form- 
ing: 
Never neglect any prompting of subsidiary 
curiosity that is, of itself, sharp enough to shift, 
though only for a few seconds, the conscious 
focus of your reading attention. 
Never, for instance, if you are moved to 
wonder whether or not you would, in his place, 
have acted as a character in your story is sup- 
posed to act, fail to weigh the query at least 
roughly in the scales of your own self-knowl- 
edge. Never fail, for example, to follow out, to 
the extent of your actually aroused interest, 
the side question of an action’s effect upon 
other characters of the tale or upon the tale 
itself. And if it is a scenario of ideas that you 
are producing, instead of a fiction scenario, or 
184 
   
-P-A-G-E-193
      
WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
if it is a story of mechanical or chemical rela- 
tionships that you are reading, instead of a 
story of human relationships, never fail to 
follow up, at least to the momentary sating of 
your aroused interest, any side issue of causal 
relationship or of logical sequence that simi- 
larly forces itself upon your previously other- 
wise-engaged attention. 
But understand that this advice is not for a 
moment intended to be taken as an urging to 
“‘make yourself do something” because you 
feel it to be “‘self-educative” or in any other 
sense “good discipline.” It is, on the con- 
trary, to be understood as an urging to let 
yourself do something that you have a natural 
prompting to do, but which other promptings, 
more habitually indulged, and thus grown into 
tyrannical spoiled-child promptings, are try- 
ing to keep you from doing. 
In other words, it is not for a moment a 
priggish, pedantic, bluestocking, high-brow 
attitude toward a natural and enjoyable oc- 
cupation that is demanded of us. We are not 
asked to keep poking ourselves to see if we 
are alive; or to keep self-consciously taking 
our mental temperatures to see if we are 
185
-P-A-G-E-194
  HOW TO READ 
functioning normally. The fact is just the 
opposite of this. For right reading, in the di- 
rection established in the last chapter, is the 
normal result of an intelligent following of 
our natural promptings; and wrong reading — 
that is to say, reading into some circle of stag- 
nation — is always the result of their willful 
or slack-minded suppression. 
Of course, however, it goes without saying 
that, as one cannot control a spoiled child 
without effort, so one cannot control a clam- 
orous, over-indulged, hurry-along-with-the- 
main-story curiosity without some exercise of 
will power. And unless this spoiled-child 
curiosity is controlled and made to behave, it 
is impossible for us to give play even to the 
. most immediately alluring and ultimately 
valuable of our subsidiary curiosities. This 
much of willing effort we must make, then; 
this much of “self-discipline” we must prac- 
tice, and must persevere in in spite of initial 
failures and forgettings, before we can learn to 
apply this most obvious and natural rule for 
getting started on the new road. 
186

And here, for the moment, we might leave 
the matter. For once a reader has learned 
something of the quickly accumulating read. 
ing capital that piles up in him through a fol- 
lowing of these basic rules, and begins to dis- 
cover the enhancement of his own enjoyment 
in reading (whatever the character of that 
enjoyment may be) that flows from that 
capital’s automatic reinvestment, he will in- 
evitably begin to develop his personal adapta- 
tions to the new method. And as soon as we 
reach this border-land of personal adaptation, 
we approach that country of individual likes 
and dislikes, of personal reachings-out and 
drawings-back, of temperamental tendencies, 
and intellectual affinities of affiliation, that 
can never (unless it be by some “psycho- 
analyst” dependent on our aid) be mapped 
out for us in advance by others. 
But there is one helpful suggestion that 
may be made before we go on to the consider- 
ation of other aspects of our inquiry. 
It is quite evident that in reading any arti- 
sle or essay or book that contains a developed 
187
-P-A-G-E-196
I ee ee eRe RE Re ak a ee 
HOW TO READ 
theme, — fictional, argumentative, demon- 
strational, or what-not,—the intelligent 
reader, no matter what his personal idiosyn- 
cracies of method may be, must maintain 
some sort of just balance between the mass of 
subsidiary interests we have been discussing, 
and the main interest of the theme itself. And, 
since, the more cross-referenced ideas of rela- 
tionship a reader possesses, the more numer 
ous will be his incidental promptings toward 
the indulging of subsidiary curiosities, it fol- 
lows that he must, more and more as he goes 
on, pick and choose between these prompt- 
ings. 
And we happen to be so built that our un- 
directed choice is almost certain to fall upon 
those curiosities that have to do with our re- 
actions of liking; while we are apt to set aside 
and suppress those curiosities (as to deriva- 
tions and results, as to “why’s” and “what- 
then’s”) that have to do with reactions of 
disliking. 
The suggestion that I have to make, then, 
is that you little by little form the deliberate 
habit of directing your choice toward the in- 
dulging of any curiosities as to thenature and 
188 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
    WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
meanings of instinctive dislikes that you may 
be lucky enough to have. 
And the reason for this is very simple. 
We have already seen that, sooner or later, 
any road of reading that we may elect to fol- 
low will be blocked for us by unrealized rela- 
tionships if we have not dealt recognizingly 
and inquiringly with earlier and underlying 
relationships as these presented themselves. 
And it so happens that the hidden relation- 
ships involved in our reactions of liking will, 
comparatively speaking and in the long run, 
take care of themselves. For when we experi- 
ence a reaction of liking, we welcome it. And 
when we reéxperience it we re-welcome it; and 
even savor the recognition and, as it were, 
roll it for an instant under the tongue of our 
intelligence. So that little by little we tend, 
without any other effort on our parts and by 
the unconscious chemic of our minds, to re- 
solve it into its component elements. 
But with a reaction of dislike it is very dif- 
ferent. The first few times that we experience 
it we may have a prompting of curiosity as to 
its nature and as to the relationships involved 
in our recoil from it. But if we continue to 
189
-P-A-G-E-198
    HOW TO READ 
ignore these, we soon form the habit of dodging 
the reaction. Instead of savoring it and rolling 
it under our tongue, we spit it out at the first 
taste. And in the end (since some kind of a 
“reason why” our minds must have to be 
happy) we are as like as not to substitute a 
prejudice for an understanding, and to accept 
some cant phrase of our own or of some one 
else’s in lieu of an explanation, and thus to es- 
tablish once for all an “unrealized relation- 
ship” that may block some future road for us 
with stagnating results. 
XXII 
We constantly and as a matter of common 
caution establish for ourselves in our every- 
day living such arbitrary reminders as this, of 
things that we know it would be well for us to 
do, but which we are prone to neglect. 
The “shifting focus of our attention,” even 
in such matters as going down town and com- 
ing back again, cannot safely be left to work 
out its own salvation. It is because of this — 
because each one of the two hundred hurrying 
humans who are crowding into a subway ex- 
press is consciously hurrying, or consciously 
190
-P-A-G-E-199
  WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
  keeping himself from being crushed, or con- 
sciously thinking out some left-over business 
problem, or consciously forecasting some evening 
pleasure, instead of consciously putting one foot 
in front of the other — that we keep a guard on 
the subway platform to call out to them, 
“watcH your step!” — “watch your step!” 
—“‘watcu — step!” And a device that we 
thus employ in the machinery of our daily 
lives may well be adapted for use in the ma- 
chinery of our daily reading. 
Suppose, then, that as a beginning you ac- 
custom yourself to regard any prompting of 
natural curiosity or interest you may have in 
regard to any feeling of distaste or disliking, 
as an official cry of “Watch your step!” Later 
on, you will find it easy and expedient to ar- 
range other signals of predetermined signif- 
icance and watch-dogs of helpful reminder to 
suit the individual adaptations that you will 
develop. “ 
And now, having repeatedly referred to the 
existence of something that we have called 
our “intellectual digestion,” let us take a 
closer look at this function of our mind and 
examine its relation to our reading. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    CHAPTER VII 
INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
I 
Some wise wag, hiding a parable in a parody, 
has said that “to eat is human; to digest, 
divine.” And when we come to think about 
it, we realize that it is exactly here— at 
the point indicated by the semicolon in this 
wag’s sentence— that we are accustomed 
(as though at some boundary posting-station 
where burdens are shifted to other horses and 
entrusted to new guides) to hand over our re- 
sponsibilities, quite casually and confidently, 
to the Unknown Mystery. Three times a day, 
as self-willed and selective human choosers, 
we “start something.” And three times a day, 
unless something goes wrong with the mysteri- 
ous machinery, we experience, with supreme 
content but with no other concern, the result- 
ant miracle of transubstantiation. 
And it is just the same with our minds. 
No matter how proud of —I had almost 
said how “stuck on” — our thinking, and our 
192  
-P-A-G-E-201
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
reasoning powers, and our deductive faculties 
we may be, it requires very little self-knowl- 
edge to realize that these more or less con- 
scious and mechanical forms of mental exer- 
cise are but the chewing of our mental food. 
The ultimate miracle of transubstantiation —- 
the involuntary processes of disintegration 
and transforming, of selection and rejection, 
of absorption and assimilation, by which the 
essentials of ideas and the outcomes of under- 
standings are finally incorporated in our per- 
sonalities — all this takes place on the further 
side of another (or is it the same?) semicolon. 
No less in our reading than in our eating, 
there is a point at which, quite casually and 
confidently, we entrust all further responsibil- 
ity to the Unknown Mystery within us. In 
short, if you happen to prefer the statement, 
there is a chemistry of the brain as well as of 
the body, whose fundamental mystery eludes 
us, but whose workings we may none the less 
study, and in the attainments of whose ends 
it is thus possible for us to codperate. 
And it is the purpose of this chapter (1) to 
txamine, in the light of our everyday experi- 
ence, the more obvious workings of this men- 
193 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
ee ee HOW TO READ 
tal chemistry; (2) to point out a misconcep- 
tion that we constantly labor under in our 
reading for want of this simple facing of fact; 
and (3) to indicate the practical relevancy of 
these matters to the further developing of the 
reading-methods we are discussing. 
Il 
Before, however, we go into the laboratory 
and prepare the simple experiment needed to 
demonstrate the actual character of the re- 
actions we are wanting to understand, it will 
be just as well to note a few general facts with 
regard to our habitual actions and attitude in 
the matter under discussion. For we are con- 
stantly taking the real state of things into ac- 
count, while failing specifically to recognize 
their character. 
Thus we frequently say to each other, “ Yes, 
I’m inclined to agree with you. But suppose 
we sleep on it.” We even have a proverb that 
says, “The night brings counsel.” And noth- 
ing is more common than for a person who has 
masticated an idea for an hour and then, so to 
say, swallowed it and forgotten it, to be re- 
minded of it the next day, or the next week, 
194 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
and, finding its appearance subtly altered and 
his attitude correspondingly changed toward 
it, to say, “No, I’ve been thinking that over, 
and I’ve changed my mind.” 
Of course the psychologists hasten to sup- 
ply us with highly interesting and, inciden- 
tally, conflicting theories about involuntary 
cerebration and the continuous activity of the 
subliminal consciousness. But for our present 
purpose it does n’t make a bit of difference 
what you call it. The fact remains that, in- 
tellectually speaking, we are ruminating ani- 
mals. The man just quoted had not, in any 
ordinary sense, been “thinking it over.” He 
had, quite involuntarily and without any con- 
trol either of the process or the result, been 
digesting the idea. His subsequent, conscious 
consideration of the result was to all intents 
and purposes a “‘chewing of his cud.” 
IIL 
Our first concern, then, is to see whether 
we cannot manage to surprise our minds in 
the actual act, while reading, of carrying out 
some of the coarser and less intricate transfor- 
mations of its chemic action — just as, with a 
195 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  HOW TO READ 
couple of glass tubes and a bunsen burner, a 
chemist will enable us to see Nature at her 
more obvious tricks of prestidigitation. 
And by way of preparing the laboratory for 
our experiment, I am going to ask you to re- 
member, all over again, that the printed mat- 
ter before your eyes — whether it be on a 
signboard, or on the front sheet of the morn- 
ing paper, or on a page of an exciting novel, or 
in the paragraph that you are now reading 
—jis never a thing in itself, but is always 
merely printed instructions, like sheet music. 
Somehow or other we do not seem to get 
mixed up about the nature of sheet music. 
Even musicians, who “read music” as 
fluently as you and I read print, do not seem, 
often, to get mixed up about it. 
Practically every one recognizes sheet music 
for what it actually is; namely, printed in- 
structions as to what to do with a tin whistle, 
or a flute, or a violin and a piano, or a quartette 
of stringed instruments, or a full orchestra 
with its choirs of strings and brasses and wood- 
winds and instruments of percussion, in order 
to make music. 
But, somehow, it is different with reading 
196 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
    
INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
matter. About the nature and the purpose of 
that we are constantly getting mixed. 
Suppose, then, that we begin by putting 
down the facts. 
(1) Reading matter, like sheet music, is 
just printed instructions. 
(z) It may be merely instructions as to 
what to do with a set of muscles and with a 
pair of eyes and a pair of ears; as in the rail- 
way-crossing sign, stop! Look! LIsTEN! 
Or (3) it may be trite instructions (like a 
tin-whistle tune) for stringing a few thread- 
bare memories together so as to form a mental 
image of a ‘“‘statement of fact”; as (I quote 
from this morning’s paper) “The bride was 
gowned in white satin and wore a tulle veil 
caught back with orange blossoms.” 
Or (4) it may (as in H. G. Wells’s novel, 
“The Research Magnificent”) be instruc- 
tions as to what to do with the full orchestra 
of one’s personal attainment, with all its bal- 
anced choirs of physical, emotional, mental, 
and spiritual experience and responsiveness, 
in order to make, inside one’s self, a sym- 
phonic, soul-stirring vision of the finenesses of 
human failure.

But we are constantly forgetting this. 
We are constantly settling down into the 
lazy assumption that the text of a story is 
the story itself; that the words of a poem are 
the poetry itself; and forgetting that they are 
only instructions as to what to do with our 
memories and our imaginations, our reason 
and our understanding, in order to create in- 
side ourselves the story or the poem. 
And the fact of which, at the present mo- 
ment, we need to remind ourselves is that, 
given a page or a volume of these instructions, 
the rest is “‘up to us”; just exactly as in the 
case of a musician with an instrument in his 
hand, or of a conductor with an orchestra un- 
der his baton, when one or other of them opens 
a volume of sheet music. 
Iv 
We all recognize that the sheet-music 
method of conveying instructions is a make- 
shift. 
Even the layman knows it for a system of 
signs, effective on the whole, but nevertheless 
clumsy. Even the outsider understands that 
this system of signs is amazingly definite as to 
198
-P-A-G-E-207
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
main issues, but is often hazy and sometimes 
wholly inarticulate as to subtleties — that it 
leaves (not from choice, but from necessity) 
many niceties of interpretation to the intelli- 
gence and the personal decision of the per- 
former. 
But we fail as a rule to see that the same 
thing, only more so, is true of our word-sys- 
tem of conveying instructions. Composers 
and performers alike, we are in the habit of 
assuming that our word-system, and especially 
our printed-word-system, not only equals the 
other in the definiteness of its main instruc- 
tions, but is capable of being made almost free 
from minor haziness. 
Yet the facts are quite the other way about. 
The instructions of reading matter have, 
when carefully examined, scarcely any abso- 
lute definiteness to them at all. 
They leave (and again not from choice but 
from necessity) not merely the niceties of in- 
terpretation, but the first-hand material of the 
composition itself, to the more or less invol- 
untary selection of the performer. 
Of course as an idea — as an intellectual 
realization — this fact has now become fa- 
199 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    HOW TO READ 
miliar to us. We have repeatedly proved it to 
our own satisfaction and to our consequent 
acceptation in the earlier stages of our in- 
quiry. But our present experiment requires 
something more than this theoretical convic- 
tion. And I am therefore going to contrive 
that you shall, in imagination at least, see the 
thing in operation with your own eyes. 
Vv 
The box adjoining that of the party I was 
with at a recent Kneisel concert was occupied 
by two well-known musicians. And I noticed 
with some curiosity that during the perform- 
ance of a Haydn quartette these two were 
sitting well forward in their seats, with a copy 
of the score held open on their knees, and were 
watching with the most intent interest the 
way in which the experts on the stage were 
following the instructions of the composer. 
Of course if the piece being played had been 
anew one, if, say, it had been one of Schoen- 
berg’s intricate and radical challenges of har- 
monic convention, this study of the score on 
the part of these specialists would not have 
attracted my attention. But the selection 
200
-P-A-G-E-209
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
being rendered was one of the loveliest of 
Haydn’s well-known works, and the men I 
was watching must have been familiar with 
it for years. And they were not only listening 
with all their ears to the music, but were fol- 
lowing the printed instructions closely and ex- 
changing from time to time quick glances of 
silent comment and appreciation. 
Now it is quite evident that they were not 
watching to see whether the performers struck 
the right notes. The definiteness of the instruc- 
tions on the one hand, and the well-known 
skill of the performers on the other, made 
that a foregone conclusion. It was, as we can 
see, the subtleties of this famous quartette’s 
individual interpretation that they were 
studying. 
But suppose that two of you were similarly 
to sit, with the pages of Kipling’s “The 
Brushwood Boy” open between you; and 
suppose that it were possible—by some 
miracle of mind-reading — for you similarly 
to watch (and to exchange glances about) the 
way in which I followed the author’s instruc- 
tions as I read that story to myself. 
Do you not see that here would be far 
201
-P-A-G-E-210
    HOW TO READ 
deeper differences than any of attack and of 
accent, of execution and inflection, of tempo 
and of temperament? Do you not see that, so 
far from my “striking the right notes” being 
a matter to be taken for granted, the very 
materials I worked with would be either for- 
eign to you or non-existent? That the memo- 
ries I assembled into scenes, and the features 
I built faces out of, would be unknown to you; 
and that the combinations I made of them 
would seem incongruous and inappropriate, 
since you would lack the associations that I 
unconsciously chose them for? 
Do you not see that my landscape of Kip- 
ling’s “Dream Country” would be alien to 
you, and that my cast of his chief characters 
— the potential myselves with which I peopled 
that mystic land — would be unrecognizable? 
Nay, more: do you not see that to no single 
important word in the entire text would I 
give your personal meaning; and that the 
words that were important to me — the words 
whose grouped meanings every now and then 
combined to “make things happen in me” — 
would often be words that you scarcely noticed? 
202

Of course you see all this. But then all this is merely an imaginative dramatization of what we have already discovered and dis- cussed. And I have contrived this dramatized 
presentation of the actual workings of a read- 
er’s mind, not primarily for its own sake, but as a demonstrator in chemistry will dispose 
the paraphernalia and contrive the operative conditions of an experiment in order that, when the preliminary steps have been taken, 
the ingredients mixed, the lamp lighted, and the reaction intended to be observed is about to take place, he may invite the onlookers to approach the table and keep a closer watch. 
And it is this final and closer look that I now ask you to take at my supposed reading of “The Brushwood Boy.” 
Do you not see that when my readings of certain groups of words “made things happen 
in me,” these happenings would at times con- sist of the minglings (like those of raindrops 
on a window pane) of bits of old feeling into spurts of new emotion? And do you not see that at other times these “ happenings” would 
203
-P-A-G-E-212
    HOW TO READ 
be subtler still; would consist of almost chem- 
tcal combinings of separate atoms of familiar 
understanding into the beginnings of new per- 
ceptions? And do you not, finally, see that 
these occurrences would be witerly personal to 
me, and that, since they would quite literally 
result in new growths of my personality, they 
would also be of supreme importance to me? 
vil 
But our object in examining a bit into the 
workings of these subtleties is by no means a_ 
desire to supervise or control their operation. 
The mere attempt to do this would instantly 
defeat its own end by stopping the machinery. 
Our object is to enable us, by understanding 
the sources of our reactions to reading, to ac- 
quire little by little a better criterion of values 
as to their output and to help us in gradually 
building up that attitude toward all reading 
that is to be the final object of our search. 
In the last chapter we examined the more 
or less concrete, conscious, and voluntary 
seekings-out of relationships from which the 
rewards of reading (be these restful diversion, 
pleasurable stimulation, or utilitarian “knowl- 
204,  
-P-A-G-E-213
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
edge”) are most immediately derived. And 
here we have managed for a moment to 
glimpse something of the manifold, minute, 
unconscious, and involuntary play of similar 
relationship-establishing that goes on, in the 
very act of reading, beneath the level of our 
ordinary attention and notice. And having 
once recognized the existence and glimpsed 
the nature of this unconscious mental activity, 
we can understand how, on the one hand, 
these quick-forming nuclei of emotion and 
perception rise, now and then, into conscious 
recognition (like the tips of coral reefs above 
the sea surface); and how, on the other hand, 
it must be through some slow, chemic-like 
continuance of the same activities that our 
“second thoughts,” our “having-slept-on-it” 
judgments, and all the constructive results of 
our unconscious “digestion” of ideas and 
proposals are derived. 
But our still more immediate object in ex- 
amining into our subconscious reactions to 
reading is the recognizing and getting rid of a 
misconception that we are all prone to enter- 
tain; namely, the notion that it is the amount 
that we read, and more especially yet the sun. 
205
-P-A-G-E-214
    HOW TO READ 
of what we remember out of what we read, that 
really matters. 
It is n’t. 
What really counts is the sum of what hap- 
pens in us through reading — the ultimate 
outcome of those “‘concrete” combinings and 
“chemical” transformations by which new 
tissues are added to our intelligence and new 
cells to our understanding. What counts is 
not the quantity of our intellectual food, but 
the products of our intellectual digestion. 
VIII 
I know a man — he is a contemporary and 
was once a classmate of my own — who has 
pushed this misconception to greater lengths 
than any one I know. Indeed, his mind is less 
like a digestive apparatus and more like a 
cold-storage warehouse than anything human 
I have ever encountered. For some decades 
now his mental floor-space has been practi- 
cally filled, so that he no longer adds anything 
bulky to his stores. But little that has gone 
into his warehouse has been lost; and nothing 
that has stayed in it has ever spoiled. 
I have watched him for years — watched 
206
-P-A-G-E-215
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
him with curiosity and amazement— watched 
him take out from those icily preservative 
depths and lay down, as it were on the counter 
of his conversation, supposedly perishable in- 
tellectual provender:— the plots of long- 
forgotten novels, the middle names of now 
deceased acquaintances, the outlines of old 
after-dinner arguments, the carcasses of ex- 
tinct theories, bunches of biographical dates, 
crates of infertile facts, historical happenings, 
chemical formule, literary quotations, — an 
endless variety, in short, of mental food that 
should have been consumed and digested 
years ago when it was fresh and in season, but 
which he has preserved, staling but intact, for 
a generation. 
Yet while some of these articles come out 
a trifle shriveled, —a little sicklied o’er with 
the cold-storage hue, — no one of them ever 
shows the slightest sign of having been at- 
tacked by the digestive juices of my friend’s 
mentality. And never — certainly never in 
the last twenty years or so — have I seen any 
reason to suspect that, by the normal proc- 
esses of intellectual digestion and assimila- 
tion, he has added a single cell to his respon- 
207
-P-A-G-E-216
    HOW TO READ 
siveness to life or revivified by a single red 
corpuscle the circulation of his outlook on the 
world. 
And yet, in certain lines, and in the ordinary 
acceptation of the term, he is “‘a great reader.” 
He is also, for our present purpose, a most 
useful specimen of a horrible example. For 
nothing ever happens in him when he reads. 
Nothing, that is, except the occasional storing 
away, in some still vacant cranny in his re- 
frigerated memory, of one more frozen fact 
or dead idea. 
Ix 
You will not — or I trust that you will not 
— imagine for a moment that I am impugning 
the value of a good memory. I am merely 
calling attention to the fact that the storing 
of one’s memory through reading is (or should 
be) a means to an end and not an end in itself. 
It is like the outfitting and provisioning of the 
ship of our adventure. Everything that goes 
into it that we can use later on is of value. 
Anything that, in the final test, we neither put 
to practical living use, or take out, like tinned 
food, and intellectually digest and live by, is a 
208
-P-A-G-E-217
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
waste of storage-room and a dead burden of 
superfluous cargo. 
The man we are talking about has a most 
remarkable memory. He has (to change the 
simile) coddled it and pampered it and “‘sac- 
rificed himself” in order to “give it every ad- 
vantage,” exactly like a doting mother with 
an only child. And the result is very similar. 
This “only child” of his always wants, when 
there is company, to monopolize the talk. It 
is as bad as a pet parrot. It fills in every 
pause with statements of irrelevant fact or of- 
ferings of superfluous information. Yet even 
so, we must not do my friend an injustice. 
His memory has a value both to himself and 
to those who know him. To himself I imagine 
it is like a miser’s strong box. When he is not 
engaged in adding to its contents, he takes 
out its unproductive treasures and hugs him- 
self in the joy of counting them. And to his 
acquaintances his memory is like a special sup- 
plement to the encyclopedia. One can often 
turn to it for information that one does not 
bother to carry round. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  HOW TO READ 
x 
There is, by the way, a question that it has 
been his habit to ask me, once a year or so, for 
a long time. He asks it unexpectedly — ap- 
parently when he thinks me off my guard or 
in an “easy” mood, and thus liable to be sur- 
prised into divulging a professional secret. 
“John,” he asks me, “how do you ever 
manage to remember all you read?” 
Now it is, of course, useless to attempt a 
direct answer to such a question from such a 
man. You might explain to him for an hour; 
but instead of trying to understand what you 
meant, he would be trying to remember what 
you said. So I take refuge in the Socratic 
method. I ask him a question myself. 
“George,” I say, “‘you eat three meals a day 
all the year round. How do you manage to 
hold all you eat?” 
But he fails to get it. 
I can see by the expression of his eyes — 
those windows to his warehouse — that he 
simply thinks that I have once more proved 
too alert to be caught napping and have once 
more guarded the secret that he so wants me 
210 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
    INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
to share with him. For he has noticed that I 
have “ideas” in stock that he has, somehow, 
failed to pick up. And he naturally assumes 
that, since I have them, I must somewhere 
have read them and remembered them. How 
else, on the cold-storage basis of accumulat- 
ing mental capital, can they have gotten into 
my refrigerator? What he is really asking for 
is my ammonia formula for preserving an 
even mental temperature of 36° Fahrenheit. 
And some day, on his tombstone, we shall find 
engraved, “Lord, keep my memory cold.” 
XI 
Let us each, at this point, do what George 
apparently never does, and ask ourselves a 
question. And let us each, before we go on 
with our discussion, try just for a second or 
two to find an honest answer. Here is the 
question: — 
“What did I have for dinner on the tenth of 
last April?” 
Doubtless we have all forgotten. 
Yet the mere effort to remember has set 
blood to flooding the arterial filaments in our 
brains. And itis quite likely that in this very 
211 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
    HOW TO READ 
blood (which has just failed to stir into action 
the memory cells charged with the details of 
that menu) there has flowed some transmuted 
essence of that unremembered meal. 
And it is no otherwise with reading. 
Two months from now you may remember, 
or you may have forgotten, the verbal exposi- 
tions of this chapter. But, asstmilated and 
built into the living tissues of your intelligence, 
transubstantiated and incorporated in the 
very thoughts you will be thinking with, there 
will be (if any thing at all “happens in you” as 
you read it, and if anything digestively hap- 
pens in you afterward) the essence of what 
you have extracted from this intellectual meal. 
XII 
And now we come to the practical point, — 
the point that may, as yet, seem very blind 
and unlikely to be practical, — namely, the 
relevancy of all this to our actual reading. 
For our memories, as we know, are appar- 
ently arbitrary, self-willed, and inconsistent. 
They are given to retaining, unasked, a host 
of things that we think we have no interest in 
or use for; while mislaying, or losing, things 
212 : 
   
-P-A-G-E-221
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
that we have begged them in vain to keep for 
us. Indeed, the best of them sometimes act 
like pockets with holes in them — letting 
five-dollar pocket-knives drop out, but retain- 
ing the crumpled seat-coupons of a vaudeville 
show. Yet in spite of this I would seem to be 
urging you to give over the training of your 
memories and to be counseling, instead, the 
centering of your attention upon minute mat- 
ters of mental activity which, in the long run, 
take care of themselves. 
But this is very far, indeed, from being the 
case. 
Let us examine for a moment the real work- 
ings of our memories. 
XIII 
Modern science is inclined to believe that 
those brain cells with which the function of 
memory is connected retain a record of every 
incident of our lives; that, physiologically 
speaking, we never forget anything, no matter 
how often, mentally speaking, we fail to re- 
member: in short that “remembering” is 
merely the successful sending-through, to the 
latent cells where the records are stored, of the 
213 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
    HOW TO READ 
stimulating impulses needed to arouse them. 
Thus our memories are like some micro-cos~ 
mic telephone system in which, the oftener 
we make a call, the more used do the opera- 
tors become in “getting the connection” for 
us. And the specialists assure us, moreover, 
that these paths of connection—the routings 
through local exchanges by which our calls are 
sent— are association paths; which (translated 
into the terms of our present inquiry) means 
paths of somehow recognized relationships. 
Of course these “recognized relationships” 
may be either warranted in fact or altogether 
arbitrary. And the quack mind-doctors, who 
undertake to train our memories by corre- 
spondence, are very fond of prescribing these 
arbitrarily established relationships as aids to 
memorizing. Thus, they will advise you, if 
you happen to be a follower of Izaak Walton 
and to have a second cousin living in a town 
on the Hudson that you can never recall the 
name of, to fix the town in your memory by 
the fact that your second cousin’s wife’s sister 
has a “fishy” eye and that Fishkill ought to 
be a good place to catch trout. However, we 
have progressed far enough in our study of the 
214
-P-A-G-E-223
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
value to us in our reading of the other kind 
of recognized relationships, to dismiss these 
pompous winnowers of mental chaff with a 
good-natured laugh. 
Nor, for our immediate purpose, is it nec- 
essary for us to go any deeper into the fascina- 
ting but complex subject of memory. We need, 
now, only to remind ourselves of a fact of 
which our experience furnishes us constant 
proof. 
XIV 
We know, for instance, that if we happen 
to meet an acquaintance on the street and to 
stop for a moment’s inconsequential chat 
with him, the chances are that in a week we 
shall have forgotten all that was said; and 
that in six months the incident itself may 
easily have slipped our minds. But suppose 
that the next morning another acquaintance 
stops us and says, “Tough about Judson’s 
shooting himself!” — Judson being the man 
we’d talked to the day before. That puts a 
new face on the matter; and we will then re- 
member for good and all that Judson, a few 
hours before he pulled the trigger, said to us 
215 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
HOW TO READ 
with a queer sort of casualness that this was 
‘fa bum world anyway” and that “we would 
probably be quite as well out of it as in it.” 
Yes, this is another “extreme case.” But I 
have chosen it that way on purpose; just as 
one makes a photographic enlargement of a 
bit of handwriting in order to examine it. Its 
extremeness enables us to see instantly that 
we should remember the character of our 
talk with Judson because our attention was re- 
directed to it promptly and because we then 
discovered a recognized relationship in it. 
And, having seen this, we can also see that 
if the complete records were open to us, we 
should no doubt find that these two factors 
had, in some fortuitous and forgotten way, 
been actively responsible for even those re- 
memberings, so often apparently haphazard 
and senseless, that persist in us from the days 
of childhood. 
XV 
And so, by another and more roundabout 
route, but in possession now of still other un- 
derstandings and of newly acquired senses of 
relationship, we come back to the further con- 
216 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
  sideration of those practical reasons, dealt 
with in the last chapter, for valuing and in- 
dulging (by slight exercises of deliberate will 
power when necessary) the lesser impulses 
of curiosity and the minor upwellings of in- 
terest that come to us during reading and 
after reading. 
Let us sum up our discoveries: — 
(1) We know now what these lesser curiosi- 
ties and these passing impulses of interest that 
intrude for a moment on our engrossment in 
“the story” really are. They are the con- 
structive and digestive activities of our un- 
conscious minds rising into consciousness. 
They are the top layer of what is happening in 
us as we read. 
(2) We know, too, that if we habitually and 
impatiently brush these incidents aside and 
hurry on, the chances of our “forgetting” 
them gradually increase toward certainty. 
Whereas even a moment’s turning of atten- 
tion to them, and a passing noting of their re- 
lationship to our present enjoyment, or to our 
past prejudices, or to our other reactions to 
what we are reading, tends to give them a num- 
ber in our mental ’phone book. 
217 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  HOW TO READ 
(3) We know now, moreover, that “what 
happens in us” through reading does n’t all 
happen while we read. It only begins to hap- 
pen then. Our intellectual digestion goes on 
working on a book for days and weeks; and 
periodically, during this process, we experi- 
ence other impulses of curiosity toward it and 
other upwellings of interest with regard to it 
—urgings, no less, from that “ruminating 
animal,” our intelligence, to help along in the 
process of assimilation by chewing the cud of 
its progressive reflections for it. 
(4) And we know now, too, that as far as 
“remembering what we read” goes, since 
memory is a matter of retracing paths of es- 
tablished relationship, our memories will, in 
the long run, take care of themselves if we take 
care of establishing the relationships. 
(5) And so we arrive at our practical realiza- 
tion of the relevancy of these minute matters 
to our reading. 
For even when reading is for us only a care- 
less pleasing of our mental palates, the fugi- 
tive pleasure we derive from it is due to the 
unrecognized and quickly forgotten play of 
the coarser of these reactions. 
218 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  
  INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION 
And it is only by the selective indulgence 
of our natural impulses toward noting the 
finer of these spontaneous reactions, and 
through gradually, by noting them, establish 
ing familiar paths of relationship among them, 
that all the progressive pleasures, the increas- 
ing stimulation, the accumulating capital, and 
the final enhancements and enfranchisements 
of right reading are to be sought and, in our 
respectively possible degrees, attained. 
XVI 
In addition, therefore, to the advisory rules 
laid down in the last chapter for those wish- 
ing, for whatsoever purpose, to increase their 
reading efficiency, we now need to emphasize 
the need of applying these same rules during 
the subsequent period of intellectual digestion. 
Do not make the “thinking over ” of a book 
a matter of “duty.” Do not keep “taking 
your mental temperature” about it or “pok- 
ing yourself to see if you are alive” with re- 
gard to it. 
But, on the other hand, learn to value your 
curiosity about books after reading them. 
Learn to evaluate your minor curiosities in re 
219 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
HOW TO READ 
gard to them after you have read them. Never 
fail to follow out, to the extent of your aroused 
interest, any subsequent promptings of in- 
quiry into their meaning for you, or into your 
feelings toward them. And, other things being 
equal, force yourself to give the right of way 
to curiosities as to your antagonisms and your 
dislikes, rather than to curiosities as to your 
acquiescences and your likings. 
And now, by way of taking up some of the 
larger questions of relationship-seeking in- 
volved in reading whole books, — questions 
that have purposely been deferred till we had 
laid a foundation for their consideration, — 
let us take up the matter of how to read a 
novel. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  CHAPTER VIII 
HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
I 
Tuus far we have dealt almost exclusively 
with the subjective side of reading: with the 
internal mechanisms of the process; with the 
character of the raw materials in which we 
work; with the sources from which we draw 
these materials; with the urges, largely un- 
conscious, that we obey in building up, out of 
these materials, our versions of the author’s 
work; with the limitations imposed upon us, 
and the general character and trend of the op- 
portunities opened out to us by the fact of our 
having to read under these generally unreal- 
ized and disregarded conditions. 
And we have perhaps seemed, in conse- 
quence, to be assuming that authors have no 
rights that a reader is bound to respect, and 
that the normally accepted and generally read- 
for objectivity of a book’s contents is either 
non-existent or of negligible value. 
But there has been a definite purpose in 
221
-P-A-G-E-230
    HOW TO READ 
this order of procedure. For whereas there 
are two distinct factors in right reading, and 
whereas we ordinarily overestimate the im- 
portance of one of these factors while ignoring 
the very existence of the other, it has been 
necessary to restore the balance by a compen- 
sating overemphasis. And we have attempted 
to do this while at the same time acquiring a 
first-hand and vivid realization of the living 
actuality and the finally governing character 
of the habitually ignored subjective factor. 
Moreover, this is the logical approach to a 
systemized understanding of right reading. 
For, while individual readers do constantly 
arrive at an intelligent and expert practice of 
right reading through the instinctive, uncon- 
scious, and unanalyzed adapting of these sub- 
jective means to the complex ends involved, 
the methods of these individual arrivals are 
unsystemized and incommunicable. And not 
alone the best routes of approach to right 
reading, but the true nature of its rewards and 
the real goals toward which it leads, cannot be 
made systematically clear to the inquiring, 
would-be practitioner of the art while he or 
she continues to regard the author’s concep- 
222
-P-A-G-E-231
   HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
tion as a concrete thing actually imprisoned 
in the text and identically derivable therefrom 
by each of us. 
Il 
The conception of the author is, of course, 
forever un-get-at-able except in approxima~ 
tion by any of us. It is not and cannot be 
“imprisoned in the text.” It exists, and can 
exist, nowhere in the world except in the au- 
thor’s consciousness. And yet this conception 
of the author is for us, as a matter of fact, 
more nearly an objectively sharable entity 
than our inquiries into our subjective reading 
processes have thus far led us to see. 
For in spite of the variousness (when 
closely examined) of our personal experiences, 
temperamental biases, intellectual predisposi- 
tions, and complex character make-ups, our 
type resemblances in these matters are (when 
viewed from a little distance) more noticeable 
than our individual differences. So that while 
no two of us ever make for ourselves identi- 
cal formulations of an author’s conception, 
ou’ individual formulations fall inevitably 
ito type classifications — into groups within 
223 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
    HOW TO READ 
which the general agreements outweigh the 
specific differences. And as even these type 
differences, and even racial distinctions and 
historical alterations of outlook, merge at last 
into the basic solidarity of our shared human- 
ity, it follows that in something very like a 
direct proportion to the universal human rele- 
vancy of an author’s conception our readings 
of his work tend to a consensus of practical 
agreement. They will, let us say, group them- 
selves into a central core of similar formula- 
tions, surrounded by smaller groups of aberrant 
type readings, and fringe out into individual 
freak interpretations. 
Let me illustrate this statement by an ex- 
ample. 
In the last chapter we used a fancied read- 
ing of “The Brushwood Boy” as a means of 
examining the extreme individuality of our per- 
sonal reading processes. Yet thousands upon 
thousands of English-speaking readers, in spite 
of their thousands of individual readings of the 
tale, have found themselves in essential agree- 
ment in their formulation of Kipling’s elusive 
conception of youth’s universal longing. And 
at the same time other, although fewer, thou-

sands have found themselves in equally es- 
sential agreement over their various impa- 
tient inabilities to “see anything init.” And 
a woman once actually and seriously declared 
to me that she thought “The Brushwood 
Boy” the “most indecent story she had ever 
read.” 
Tir 
We have now arrived, then, at a point where 
we can agree to define right reading as a con- 
structive and critical attempt to formulate, 
each one for himself, the thing that the author is 
trying to show us in the terms of those subjec- 
tive processes and materials that we have dis- 
cussed in the preceding chapters. And it re- 
mains for us to discuss the broader practical 
problems involved in our “adventure of learn- 
ing to read” when right reading is thus re- 
garded. 
And I have elected to discuss these broader 
problems under the chapter heading of “How 
to Read a Novel,” because, while every kind 
of right reading is demanded of us in special- 
ized and concentratedly developed form in 
some other-than-fiction kind of reading, it is 
225
-P-A-G-E-234
    HOW TO READ 
in fiction especially (and more and more so as 
the modern novel continues to claim the whole 
of life as its field and to include all of life’s at- 
tainments and relationships in its successive 
and many-angled “criticisms of life”) that all 
kinds of right reading are demanded of us in 
turn and in constructive and critical combina- 
tion. And, moreover, because it is especially 
in reading fiction that we are given to mud- 
dling along without any active exercise of 
right reading at all and without, therefore, de- 
riving any of the enhancements that should 
result to us. 
Iv 
Let us begin with the statement that the 
right reading of a novel consists in a construc- 
tive and critical formulation for ourselves, in 
the fullest possible terms of our own experi- 
ence, of the particular fictional conception that 
the author is trying to place before us. And 
in order to get the problems involved in this 
task intelligently stated, let us examine our 
relations to fiction and to fictional conceptions. 
Children and young people, as we have al- 
ready seen, love fiction because it gives form ta 
226
-P-A-G-E-235
  
HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
their unformulated experience; because it sup- 
plies an imaginative concreteness to their long= 
ing for adventure; because it makes articulate 
their unvoiced dreams of personal achieve- 
ment. They instinctively use it, in other 
words, even when taking refuge in it from 
their immediate griefs and boredom, as an ap- 
proach to wider living. And we, if we would 
have it continue to serve us, even as a refuge, 
must do the same. 
But we are no longer children. We are no 
longer, on the stream of youth’s development, 
being carried swiftly forward in a constantly 
altering approach to life and having our 
dreams automatically changed for us in con- 
sequence. We have, relatively speaking, ar- 
rived. Our development, to put it more ac- 
curately, has slowed down; so that our dreams, 
more and more, impinge upon reality; and 
experience, more and more, intervenes to con- 
tradict and correct our hopes. And our rela- 
tion to fiction, even as a refuge, changes ac- 
cordingly. 
If, under these new conditions, we gradually 
come to shrink from experience; gradually ac- 
cept life as a treadmill; gradually close our 
227
-P-A-G-E-236
  HOW TO READ 
eyes to its tangled and contradictory implica- 
tions and seek to take refuge from its new 
puzzles in the unaltered redreaming of old 
dreams; — we soon come to the using of fic- 
tion as a mere drug to deaden consciousness 
with. And as this is to drift, both in our living 
and our reading development, into the most 
vicious of all vicious circles of stagnation, we 
may, for our present purpose, dismiss such 
reading of fiction from our consideration. 
But if, as we come in contact with the reali- 
ties of living, we begin, in any measure what- 
ever, to develop an interest in the meaning of 
life; if we experience the slightest promptings 
of a will to inquire; if, hesitatingly at first, but 
with growing curiosity and deepening interest, 
we begin to ask questions of experience; if, 
from thus asking questions of experience, we 
come little by little to the seeking of experience 
in order to question it, — then more and more 
consciously and purposefully we find ourselves 
turning to fiction and enjoying it because it 
synthesizes our own observations of life and 
extends and amplifies and interprets them. 
Yet this is only one of its functions. For, 
since new attitudes toward experience are the 
228
-P-A-G-E-237
HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
  source of all new hopes and new dreams, it 
follows that the more we face life from this in- 
terested angle, and the more we practice the 
right reading of science and history and phi- 
losophy and fiction itself as aids to such facing, 
the more constantly can fiction reassume for 
us its legitimate function toward the “young” 
— the more often, that is to say, can it serve 
us afresh as the mould for new hopes, as the 
concrete expression of new dreams; in short, 
as the means of making tentative imaginary 
syntheses of the broader life we are thus ap- 
proaching. 
It was to these constantly readjusted and 
.oorganized functions of fiction that we re- 
ferred in the fifth chapter, in saying that 
“there are nursery rhymes for every mile of 
the way; love-stories for every stage of growth; 
adventure-tales for every enlargement of our 
consciousness and understanding.” 
v 
When looked at from this point of view, all 
reading matter becomes an invitation to us in 
some way to compare notes with another ob- 
server; either upon the actuality of the facte 
229 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
HOW TO READ 
  of existence, or upon the relations that these 
facts conceivably bear to one another and to 
ourselves. And the distinctive feature of 
fiction is that it invites us to undertake this 
comparing of notes by formulating for our- 
selves some particular, imaginative arrange- 
ment of the more or less characteristic and 
familiar facts of our common experience, so 
contrived by the author as to form an artificial 
synthesis, or appearance of completeness, in the 
human drama that is being tumultuously enacted 
before our eyes and within ourselves. 
And the first thing that, as prospective ac- 
ceptors of such fictional invitations, it is im- 
portant for us to realize, is that the ultimate 
basis of every such artificial synthesis or ap- 
pearance of completeness — and hence the 
fundamental factor of our personal formula- 
tion of it — is always a particular way of look- 
ing at things, a special attitude of mind, a 
mood of observation. This ultimate fictional 
basis is never, even in the shallowest and trash- 
iest yellow-backed time-killer, the plot of the 
story. And it is never, even in the most stir- 
ting romance or in the most shuddersome 
tragedy, that less tangible but more living 
230
-P-A-G-E-239
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
thing that we call “the story itself.” It is 
always an angle of observance, a human 
mood. Thus the ultimate basis of all detec- 
tive stories and mystery tales is the mood of 
momentarily looking at life as a challenge to 
our ingenuity. And the ultimate basis of all 
tales of adventurous action is the mood of 
looking at the world as an openable oyster. 
And the ultimate basis of all romance is the 
mood of imagining our dreams fulfilled. And 
the ultimate basis of all real tragedy is the 
mood of looking at the inevitable as the great 
consoler, the one final and sanctioned assumer 
of our responsibilities. 
So that in electing to read a novel, —in ac- 
cepting the invitation of a writer of fiction, — 
we have to become the guests of the author’s 
mood before we can intelligently act as his 
collaborators. We should in no case forget our 
guestship until we have felt our way to at 
least a tentative recognition of the mood the 
author is asking us to share with him. And 
so the first thing that is demanded of us in be- 
ginning a novel is an attitude of active and 
open-minded inquiry with this fact in mind. 
If this attitude does not come easy to us, we 
231 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
HOW TO READ 
    should force ourselves to assume it until it 
does. And the first and most effective prelim- 
inary to the assuming of this attitude is the 
deliberate and intentional clearing from our 
minds of all preferences, preconceptions, ex- 
pectations, and demands with regard to what 
it is that the author is going to ask of us and 
show us; at the same time holding ourselves 
ready, as soon as we have found the clue, to 
put our entire equipment unreservedly at his 
disposal for those purposes of “constructive 
and critical formulation” that we shall pres- 
ently examine. 
vI 
But before going on to examine these, it will 
be well to make absolutely certain that we un- 
derstand, not only the need for this initial 
open-mindedness, but the importance of con- 
sciously recognizing and falling in with the 
author’s mood at the earliest possible moment. 
For we do not, as a rule, realize how con- 
stantly, in every kind of trying to see what 
others are pointing out to us, we are hindered 
and handicapped and defeated by precon- 
ceptions.

For example, one of the surprises we en- 
counter on our first sea voyage is the discovery 
of how difficult it is to see a whale. 
It is, let us say, the third day out. Good 
weather has enabled us to acquire what we 
ignorantly imagine to be our “‘sea legs.”” We 
no longer speak of “going down stairs.” And 
at seven bells we no longer do surreptitious 
arithmetic on our fingers and verify the re- 
sult by covert glances at our watches. In- 
deed, we quite fancy ourselves old salts. And 
then, in passing our steamer chair, a ship’s 
acquaintance asks us if we have seen the 
whale. 
“Whale?” we exclaim eagerly. “No. 
Where is it?” 
And he explains that it is a mile or so off the 
weather bow and offers to show it to us. But 
when we’ve rushed to the opposite rail and 
joined the knot of excited people gathered 
there, we can see nothing— nothing, that is, 
except water and waves and sun-glints and 
white caps. And our self-appointed cicerone 
points and says, “There! Did n’t you see him 
then?” And we squint in the direction of his 
extended arm and say no, we did n’t. And he

becomes more and more explanatory, and we 
grow more and more obfuscated. Until, just as 
heis on the point of giving us up as hopeless, 
we happen quite by accident to notice an in- 
significant feather of white spray spurt up 
away off on the horizon, and to hear the girl 
next to us cry, “‘There he blows!” 
And we say, “That! Is that a whale?” 
And our friend says, “Why, of course. 
What did you think it was?” 
And then (according as we happen to be 
constituted) we either go back to our steamer 
chair and our novel, saying “Pooh! A nice 
fuss over nothing!” or else, our curiosity hav- 
ing been aroused, we take the trouble to back- 
track our recent mental processes and so dis- 
cover that as a matter of fact we had not once 
tried to see what our friend was pointing out 
to us, but had, instead, been looking demand- 
ingly for a large, square-headed, black fish 
with forked flukes and a miniature Old Faith- 
ful spouting intermittently from its head. In 
fine we discover that we had been unable to 
see the whale, not at all because we did not 
know what a whale looked like, but precisely 
because we thought we knew.

VII 
A few years ago Mr. Will Irwin published a 
little volume called “The Confessions of a 
Con Man.” And I remember, at the time it 
appeared, calling the attention of a friend 
to it and being rather taken to task by him in 
consequence. “Did you enjoy that?” he asked 
me with fine scorn. And when I had owned up 
that I had, he said, “Why, good heavens, the 
man does n’t give away a single confidence trick 
that has not been public property for years.” 
And this, as it happened, was perfectly 
true. But it was also, in view of the author’s 
invitation and intention, perfectly immaterial. 
It was, indeed, the tacit condition upon which 
the “con man’s” unintentional and far more interesting “confessions” had been obtained. 
For Mr. Irwin, having gained the partial con- 
fidence of a confidence man, had been wise 
enough not tomake him restive or suspicious 
by trying to get out of him the latest secrets of 
his profession —those tricks, new to-day and 
old to-morrow, by whose newness he gained 
his living. He had been glad to accept, in lieu 
of “modern instances,” the histories of deceits 
235
-P-A-G-E-244
    HOW TO READ 
now out-moded; because, in reminiscing about 
these, the man spoke openly and revealed him- 
‘self without guile. Mr. Irwin had thus sur- 
prised a secret far more elusive and enduring 
than that of the “latest” confidence tricks. 
He had induced the man, without his know- 
ing it, to “confess” his philosophy of life and 
to disclose the sanctions of his self-esteem. 
And in his book Mr. Irwin was offering us the 
interesting opportunity of looking, in imagi- 
nation, through a grafter’s eyes upon a graft- 
er’s world; of finding out, in imagination, 
what it might be like to be the proud possessor 
of sharp wits and to roam a happy hunting- 
ground where the only animals were the Gul- 
libles and the Ungullibles. 
But my friend, what with looking intently 
for a large, square-headed, black fish spouting 
geysers, had failed to see the whale. 
He had, in fact, when he read the title of 
Mr. Irwin’s book, made up his mind what he 
wanted Mr. Irwin to show him. He had kept 
on wanting this and looking for it to the end. 
And in condemning Mr. Irwin as a writer be- 
cause Mr. Irwin had been trying to show him 
something else and he had refused to let him, 
236
-P-A-G-E-245
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
he had passed judgment on nothing but his 
own skill as a reader. 
Of course he might not have cared to accept 
Mr. Irwin’s real invitation. And he might 
quite properly have laid the book down as 
soon as he had discovered the actual char- 
acter of its offering. But in omitting a pre- 
liminary, open-minded seeking-out of the au- 
thor’s attitude of observation, and then, on 
that basis, either looking at his whale or re- 
fusing to bother with it, he had failed in the 
first requirement of the intelligent reader.

Five years ago John Galsworthy published 
his novel “The Patrician.” And in the 
months that followed its appearance I met 
several confirmed admirers of Galsworthy’s 
work who seemed disappointed in the new 
book. They were even inclined to be a bit 
grouchy over — well, that was exactly where 
the trouble came in — over, let us say, some 
indefinable injustice toward them, whether 
of omission or of commission they could not 
tell, of which they dimly felt Mr. Galsworthy 
to have been guilty. This fact interested me at 
237

    HOW. TO READ 
the time and may well interest us now; for 
its explanation illuminates one of the pitfalls 
that our preconceptions are constantly dig- 
ging for our appreciation. 
To begin with, knowing the men, I am per- 
suaded that “The Patrician,” divested of 
Mr. Galsworthy’s name as author, would at 
once have been recognized by them as the 
very beautiful piece of work and as the sound 
and subtle criticism of life that itis. But hav- 
ing, through a series of years and of nov- 
els, accustomed themselves to reading Gals- 
worthy in the attitude of mind that he had 
theretofore maintained toward life in his 
work, they had insisted upon reading “The 
Patrician” in that mood and had ascribed 
their consequent puzzlement to the author. 
Galsworthy, in his earlier novels, is suc- 
cinctly describable as a man who saw with un- 
usual clearness the hidden interdependences 
and masked reciprocal relations ot human 
intercourse, and who presented these to us 
in terms of the ironies resulting from their 
non-recognition. While utterly free from any 
rancor against the individual exponents of the 
amiable and well-intentioned narrow-minded- 
238
-P-A-G-E-247
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
ness that he had portrayed, he was never con- 
tent until, by the exercise of just that sym- 
pathetic and tolerant understanding of them 
that he possessed, he had, as it were, given 
them enough rope to hang themselves by. 
Naturally enough, he had been called a cynic. 
And although behind the openly caustic irony 
of his novels there had ever lain the essen- 
tially cleansing humor and healing charity of 
his comprehension, yet having dubbed him 
“cynic” his readers had come to seek him out 
in the confident expectation of finding a sly 
dog. 
And lo, the author of “The Patrician” was 
a poet! 
The novel is a wonderful word-picture of a 
family of aristocrats with its three genera- 
tions subtly differentiated by their succes- 
sively lessening consciousness of caste; with 
its many members, clean-cut as cameos, seen 
from the authentic and indicative angles of 
their individual outlooks; with its patriarchs 
resigned or desperately at bay before the in- 
roads of modernity, and its high-hearted and 
stern-minded youths equally yet variously 
fretting at the curb of caste-tradition. The 
239 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
    HOW TO READ 
story is wrought with infinite loving labor, in words weighed to the fraction of intrinsic ap- 
positeness and in phrases of exquisite imagery. 
Yet for all its beauty there is a sardonic note 
in its denouement — the echo of a knell. For 
the work is not only a portrait, but a prophecy. 
It is a valedictory as well as an appreciation. 
It is the swan song of a type. 
In writing it, Mr. Galsworthy asked his 
readers to assume in turn the outlooks of three 
generations and from these to construct with 
him a particular mood of observation toward 
the passing order of the English nobility. But 
these guests of his mood in “The Man of 
Property” and “The Country House” had 
accepted his new invitation in the spirit of the 
old and so missed its meaning. 
Ix 
Fortunately for the student of right read- 
ing, it is in the simpler forms of fiction — in 
love-stories proper, in mystery-mongering 
tales, in stories of action and adventure and 
the like — that the mood of the author, the 
angle of observation from which the novel 
ds written, is most single-minded in itself; is 
240
-P-A-G-E-249
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
most quickly and openly and once-for-all re~ 
vealed; and is thus most easily and certainly 
to be recognized and fallen in with. In many 
of these cases the first paragraph or the first 
page contains a full clue to it. In many such 
instances one senses the book’s mood instinc- 
tively and adjusts one’s self to it spontane- 
ously and without ever consciously recogniz- 
ing that it has one. But to allow one’s self to 
do this is bad practice. For it is by the habit 
and consequent training of consciously estab- 
lishing this mood relation with one’s more 
naive and obvious authors that one acquires 
most quickly the ability to collaborate intel- 
ligently with authors who are dealing with 
life in more sophisticated and more complex 
moods. 
For one thing it is very easy to fall into the 
habit of expecting to have this simple mood- 
relationship instantly established for us by the 
author, and of then being “uninterested” if an 
author does so simple a thing as to begin by 
thoroughly outlining a situation before he 
develops his way of looking at what happens 
there. Yet this is constantly being done. It is, 
indeed, the rule rather than the exception for 
241 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
HOW TO READ 
  us to need to maintain our open-minded at~ 
titude toward the author’s selected way of 
looking at things until we have actively co- 
operated with him in the formulation of his 
scenic setting and in the initial conception of 
his characters. ; 
And perhaps the large majority of those 
readers who are naturally inclined toward 
right reading do this much automatically and 
without any actual recognition of what they 
are doing. But it is none the less bad practice 
on that account. For it is exactly by doing 
this consciously and watchfully that we can 
best develop that quick responsiveness to 
mood, that instant ability to recognize dis- 
closed angles of observation, and that supple 
readiness to assume them as they are revealed, 
that is the first requisite for our intelligent 
reading of an author whose own fictional at- 
titude is really that of observing the comedy 
aspects or the tragedy aspects of the conflict- 
ing attitudes of others. It is perhaps not too 
much to say that the failure to develop, in 
one way or another, this responsiveness and 
quickness in recognition and adaptation is 
what most frequently prevents our progress- 
242
-P-A-G-E-251
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
ing beyond the beginnings of fictional right 
reading. And it is certain that the higher we go 
in the scale of fiction, the more necessary does 
this development become for us. For modern 
fiction tends more and more toward being a 
dramatization of outlook, a demonstration of 
the varying possibilities of points of view. Not 
only are there countless novels written to-day 
that invite us, as novels have never invited us 
before, to look at life through the eyes of the 
“other half”; whose way of living as well as 
whose point of view has been ignored or de- 
spised by us; but much modern fiction of the 
first order is, in its final intention, a mood- 
constructor; that is to say, an invitation to 
us to formulate for ourselves, under the guid- 
ance of the author, and out of the gradually 
assembled implications of the development 
of his story, a final, tentative, point of view 
of our own—a “‘one way of looking at life,” 
an achieved synthesis of estimating out- 
look. 
Take, for example, Arnold Bennett’s “The 
Old Wives’ Tale.” Here is a novel which fol- 
lows, in the minutest and most “realistic” de- 
tail, the personal histories and interwoven at- 
243
-P-A-G-E-252
HOW TO READ 
  titudes of two and a half generations of a 
middle-class English family. In a leisurely, 
apparently “‘plotless,” and (by reason of its 
unemotional treatment of “‘events”) super- 
ficially uneventful, manner, it carries us, from 
the youth of its two leading characters and 
from the middle age of their parents, to the 
ultimate deaths of every one closely connected 
with the story except a single and, by then, | 
middle-aged and utterly worthless representa- 
tive of the third generation — a survivor who 
by his mere surviving stands before us as the 
sole and completely negligible result, hu- 
manly speaking, of the whole intensely hu- 
man and many-sidedly interesting struggle. 
Yet it achieves, for those of its readers who 
have read it with this open-minded and pro- 
gressively constructive responsiveness, a com- 
plete, dramatic amalgamation of two points 
of view that had never before been success- 
fully combined in fiction: — that of the su- 
preme importance and significance of life to 
the individual; and that of the supreme insig- 
nificance and unimportance of the individual 
or of any line of individuals to the mysterious, 
long-sighted purposes of Life.

Let us assume, now, that we have grasped 
the principle involved in this initial, active, 
and open-minded seeking-out of the attitude 
the author is asking us to share with him. 
And let us assume (deferring for the present 
our consideration of novels wherein the con- 
trolling mood of the author does not reveal 
itself either early or simply) that we have de- 
termined, in every obviously mooded novel 
that we read, definitely to identify the au- 
thor’s attitude at the earliest possible moment. 
The important point that we next have 
to note in formulating rules for the right read- 
ing of novels, is this: That having recognized 
the mood of the author and having either 
spontaneously “‘fallen in with it” or placed 
ourselves in sympathetic readiness to do so, 
we must, from then on, view the entire world 
of the story —its unfolding situations, its 
developing characters, their deploying rela- 
tions to each other, and all questions of the 
relations of ourselves or of the author to these 
— from the point of view of this governing and 
basic attitude.

  Do not misunderstand me. I do not for a 
moment mean that we should not, in the most 
ordinary and unself-conscious and zestful sense 
of the words, “‘read our book.” I mean that we 
must deal with all upwelling inquiries as to 
probability, consistency, truth to type, and 
mutual attitude of characters, with each out- 
cropping manifestation of personal like and 
dislike of actors or actions, with all disap- 
pointments of unconsciously aroused expecta- 
tion, or impulses toward resentment based on 
conventional attitudes of mind,— in short, 
with any and all subsidiary curiosities and 
any and all promptings to pass judgment that 
arise in the course of “reading our book,” 
—— with primary and specific relation to this 
established angle of observation. 
Suppose that an author’s story deals with 
a man torn between the conflicting urges of 
an adventurous Wanderlust and a persistent 
dream of a wife, children, and the coziness of 
the feathered nest. 
The author’s mood of observation may be 
that of the romantic portraying of sentiment 
triumphant over obstacles. Or it may be that 
of the romanic portrayal of the rolling stone’s

toying with successive mossbeds. Or it may 
be a mood of good-natured irony, smiling in 
sympathetic understanding of the irreconcila- 
bility of human desires. Or it may be that of 
looking with hilarious amusement at the spec- 
tacle of a human donkey, now running franti- 
cally toward this haystack and now toward 
that, and finally starving between them. It 
may be the mood of looking at this hero-of- 
divided-allegiance through the eyes of any 
one of a dozen types of human onlookers. 
Or it may be a mood of looking at the world 
and at life through the bi-focused eyes of the 
hero himself. 
Any one of these attitudes will be humanly 
valid. The author’s development of his story 
from the chosen point of view may be con- 
sistently true to mood and revealingly or 
amusingly interpretative of our own hearts 
and natures when so regarded. But in just so 
far as we allow the criteria of judgment that 
belong to another way of looking at things to 
color our reactions to the story as presented, 
in exactly so far shall we fail in our right read- 
ing of it, and shall we miss whatever dividends 
of enjoyment or of added responsiveness to

  life our proper collaboration with the author 
might have brought to us. 
And of course, since this is manifestly true 
in the case of a simply conceived and singly 
mooded story of idealized sentiment or smil- 
ing satire, it is progressively true, in a geo- 
metric ratio of importance, in novels where we 
are asked to look, first from one angle and 
then from another, at the same series of hu- 
man actions; or to maintain the attitude of 
impersonal and inquiring observers toward 
a conflict of clashing moods and their result- 
ing misunderstandings; or to build up a new 
mood of observation never before attained by 
us, by the constructive and dramatic juxtapo- 
sition of successive and interrelated and mood- 
derived realizations of relationship. 
So that one of the most important habits 
that the reader can form—a habit that con- 
sciously or unconsciously he must acquire and 
develop if he is going to increase his ability 
to read better, and more revealing and more | 
“up-channel” fiction —is this habit of dif- 
ferential criticism based on the criteria of 
outlook.      248

And this brings us finally face to face 
with those problems of the “constructive and 
critical” activity demanded of the right read- 
ers of a novel that we have repeatedly re- 
ferred to. 
_ The phrase has a somewhat portentous 
sound. It suggests responsibilities to be as- 
sumed; and we are prone to shirk the con- 
scious assumption of responsibilities. It sug- 
- gests work; and we are apt to look askance at 
- the idea of work in connection with the read- 
ing of fiction, which is always undertaken and 
always should be undertaken in some degree 
in the spirit of “play” as we have already de- 
fined that impulse. But the truth is that we 
are invariably both constructive and critical 
in all our reading; and the only real problem 
before us is that of so directing these per- 
fectly normal but often misapplied function- 
ings of our minds that they may more and 
more correctly and codperatively minister to 
our formulation for ourselves of the author’s 
conception.   
249
-P-A-G-E-258

XII 
We have already armed ourselves with a 
realization of the constructive methods we 
employ in reading, and of the more or less un~ 
conscious accompaniment of critical activity, 
corrective, recognitional, and comparative, 
that is automatically maintained at the backs 
of our minds as we read. And we have already 
agreed that it is important for us to identify 
and fall in with the main observational mood 
of the novel we are reading; to be ready to do 
the same with any subsidiary moods (as the 
points of view of individual characters) that 
are introduced as parts of its subject-matter; 
and that we must scrupulously view the entire 
world of the story, including its subsidiary 
ways of looking at things, from the selected 
angle of envisagement. But the very act of 
identifying this angle is a critical act. And 
every glance by which we assure ourselves 
that we are maintaining it, or discover that we 
are not, is an act of criticism. So that our 
problem is largely one of directive application. 
Let us, however, begin by considering the 
simpler problems of construction. 
250
-P-A-G-E-259
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
And the first rule that we should keep in 
mind in the matter of “‘constructive” codp- 
eration with the author, is that we should 
hold ourselves ready at any moment, and quite 
irrespective of our having or not having dis- 
covered the trend of his intention, to put our 
entire experiential equipment and the best 
efforts of our “mental movie” outfit and 
of our “idea distillery” at his disposal for 
the production of whatever scenes, character 
conceptions, or details of situational develop- 
ment he may ask to have produced. We may, 
or may not, see why he wants them. The in- 
ference is that they are going to be needed. 
Later on, if we discover that he is given to 
wasteful or unwarranted demands on us in 
this regard (as, for instance, if he proves to be 
a landscape-describing crank, or interpolates 
airings of his own views that are irrelevant 
and do not “pay their own way”), we may 
skim or skip judiciously. But “skimming” 
and “skipping,” whether we realize it or not, 
is a critical act. It is either a conscious criti- 
cism of the author, or an unconscious criticism 
of ourselves. So it should be used with care 
and in full realization of its meaning. It is an 
251. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
    HOW TO READ 
excellent rule to read at least a hundred pages 
of any novel before refusing the fullest con- 
structive codperation in our power to any 
passage of it. 
XIII 
But there is another kind of constructive 
activity and ability that is demanded of us in 
novel-reading besides this simple visualizing 
of scenes and of action, this preparatory rec- 
ognition of ideas and attitudes, this primary 
conceiving of characters and motives. All 
these things are, so to say, the manufactured 
parts (manufactured by us at the author’s 
order out of our own stock of experience) that 
we are gradually, under the author’s direction, 
to assemble into the completed structure of 
his artificial synthesis — that is to say, into 
our formulation of his conception of it. And 
it is because we cannot tell, beforehand, what 
use is going to be made of these parts, or how 
important any least one of them may prove to 
be, that we should codperate whole-heartedly 
in their construction as they are called for, 
and should then keep them open-mindedly 
at hand ready for whatever use the story re- 
252
-P-A-G-E-261
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
quires us to make of them. We are likely at 
any moment to be required to bring separate 
characters, ideas, impulses, and attitudes into 
imaginary contact and to construct the atmos- 
phere and implications of their conjunction; 
and weshould beas alertly and whole-heartedly 
coéperative in this secondary construction as 
in the first. 
But whereas, thus far, we have been con- 
sidering our constructive duties separately, 
we now arrive at a point where it is no longer 
possible to leave our critical activities out of 
account. 
XIV 
The least critical reader of us all passes con- 
stant judgment as he reads (1) upon the au- 
thor; (2) upon the characters of the story; and 
(3) upon himself. 
(1) He yawns and says to himself that the 
author is a bore. Or he grins and owns that 
the author is a clever wag. Or he bristles up 
and says that the author must be an atheist 
or a libertine. 
(2) He is very charitable to the characters 
who exhibit his own pet weaknesses. Or he is 
253
-P-A-G-E-262
HOW TO READ 
    bitterly condemnatory of the character who 
yields to his own most dreaded vice. Or he ap- 
proves the character who acts as he likes to 
think he acts, and condemns the character who 
acts, without justification, as he often acts 
himself, but with a perfectly good excuse. 
(3) He says to himself that he “can’t un- 
derstand” how any one can do this or that. 
Or he tells himself that he “‘would have done 
the same thing” as some one in the story. Or 
he says that he “has no time” for hard-luck 
stories, or that this, that, or the other point of 
view “makes him tired.” 
But of course the reader who experiences 
these feelings or expresses them to himself as 
he reads, does not necessarily recognize them 
as criticisms; and is still less likely to recog- 
nize the self-criticism involved in the third 
division. But as soon as we see these feelings | 
tabulated as above, we recognize the critical 
nature of them. And, moreover, a little ex- 
amination suffices to show us that they are not, 
really, three kinds of criticism, but three dif- 
ferent employments of a criticism that is al- 
ways three-sided. For reading a novel is a 
triangular operation in which (1) the author, 
254
-P-A-G-E-263
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
(2) the reader, and (3) their joint production 
are inseparably linked. There are two creators 
of every character, of every situation, of every 
outcome of the conjunction of characters and 
situations — the author and the reader. Both 
are responsible, not only for, but to, their 
joint production. Every criticism felt or ex- 
pressed by the reader involves all three. And 
every judgment of the reader, to be a self- 
helpful and self-guiding judgment, must take 
into account the relations of the thing judged 
to the other two. 
XV 
Going back, then, to our interrupted con- 
sideration of the more complex “construc- 
tion” involved in the bringing of separate 
characters, ideas, and attitudes into the im- 
agined contacts of developing situations, and 
thus, stage by stage, assembling the total con- 
ception of a novel, we see that this must be 
done, not only in open-minded and whole- 
hearted codperation of reader with author, but 
with a discriminating, three-pointed criticism 
always ready, at the back of the reader’s mind, 
to examine, correct, and co-relate his own 
255  
-P-A-G-E-264
  HOW TO READ 
instinctive reactions to these combinations 
and to their results. 
Among the commonest errors of novel- 
reading, for example, are: For a reader to as- cribe to the author the opinions of one of his 
characters, and to judge the author’s mind or 
morals or character accordingly, and to read 
the rest of his book under the bias of that un- critical ascription. Or for a reader to criticize 
a character, or the author, or both, because the 
character acts, or fails to act, in accordance 
with the conventional requirements of another 
way of looking at things. Or for a reader to 
call the author a pessimist, or some other hard 
name, because the logical development of the 
adopted point of view discloses inevitable 
human attitudes that the reader did n’t an- 
ticipate when he consented to adopt it. 
And not only are these errors manifestly 
due to a lack of “critical” as well as “con- 
structive” activity on the reader’s part, or to 
criticism misapplied and ill-directed, or to a 
one-sided, or two-sided, instead of the required 
three-sided criticism of a three-sided problem, 
but it is also evident that any reader’s final 
formulation of the author’s complete concep- 
256

tion will be discolored or actually deformed by 
such carelessly conducted reading. 
XVI 
And this brings us to the last points we have 
to consider under the head of “How to Read 
a Novel”; namely, our real relation to fictions 
as wholes: and the importance (1) of keeping 
this relation in mind as we read them; (2) of 
employing it as a criterion of judgment when 
we face our completed formulations of them; 
and (3) of remembering it when, as we con- 
stantly do, we employ past fictional formu- 
lations as bases of other judgments and 
as elements in other idea and attitude con- 
structions. 
In an early chapter we spoke of one of our 
unconscious urges toward reading as the need, 
experienced by us all, of somehow creating 
‘oases of orderliness” in the chaos of our re- 
lations to life. 
And more recently we defined fiction as a 
contrived synthesis or appearance of complete- 
ness in the tumultuous flux and flow of the 
human drama that goes endlessly on within us 
and about us. 
257 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  | HOW TO READ 
And here, in a nutshell, either expressed or 
implied, are our real relations to novels as 
wholes. 
We cannot, being ourselves a part of the 
flux of life, conceive its entirety. Nor can we 
conceive of the million-stranded, beginning- 
less and endless portion of it that we do per- 
ceive, as forming in itself a completeness. All 
that we can do, and what by the inescapable 
necessity of our inborn needs we are constantly 
forced to do, is to keep variously cutting chaos 
up into sections that can, from certain points 
of view, be regarded as complete in themselves, 
and thus examine it piecemeal. 
That is what physics and biology and psy- 
chology and agriculture and chemistry and 
astronomy — what science, in a word, is busy 
doing. That is what fetishism and superstition 
and faith and theology and morals and ethics 
and philosophy are at. And that, in its field, 
is the function of fiction; which variously 
uses as part of its constructive material the 
common activities and special attitudes of all 
these other decipherers of chaos. | 
But there is an esthetic as well as an in- 
tellectual appeal in fiction; and the novel is 
258
-P-A-G-E-267
  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
not alone an “appearance of completeness,” 
playful, diverting, or explanatory, presented 
to our understanding, but an art form—which 
is to say a means of at once arousing and satis- 
fying our emotional need for self-fulfillment. 
XVII 
If you will turn to the first chapter of 
Genesis and will read its account of God’s 
first labors; his dividing the primal void and 
formlessness into light and darkness, and his 
placing of the sun and moon in the firmament} 
you will find upon reading the sentence — 
And the morning and the evening were the 
first day 
— that you experience a distinct and pleasura- 
ble satisfaction in the statement. That satis- 
faction is essentially an esthetic one. Your 
mind has found an appearance of complete- 
ness to recognize and rest upon. Moreover, 
if you will examine the form of this statement, 
you will find that no little part of your pleas- 
ure in it derives from the perfect fitness and 
rhythm of the words — a fitness that is a con- 
stituting element of beauty, and a rhythm 
259 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
    HOW TO READ 
that first helps to arouse in you an emotional 
anticipation, and then guides it to its fulfill- 
ment. 
And here, again in a nutshell, we have the 
germs both of esthetic reaction and of the 
functioning of art. 
XVIII 
The novel, then, is a contrived appearance 
of completeness in the chaotic drama of life; 
an imagined phase of that drama, more or less 
arbitrarily fenced off so that from a certain 
point of view we can regard it as complete in 
itself; and at the same time so constructed 
that it rhythmically arouses in us, and then 
momentarily satisfies, some inherent need of 
self-fulfillment. 
Manifestly no reading of a novel that does 
not take all these facts into account, and con- 
structively and critically codperate in their 
realization, can, in the full sense, be a right 
reading. 
And it is therefore important that, in read- 
ing a novel, we keep our real relation to fic- 
tions as wholes in mind. 
Yet this involves a difficulty.

  HOW TO READ A NOVEL 
Wre only succeed in imagining the phase of 
living that a novel presents in proportion as 
we achieve an illusion of its reality in read- 
ing it. 
Yet if, even in the reading, we regard its 
ultimate “truth” as anything but relative, 
we risk missing its real significance to us. 
Yet to the beginner, a full recognition of 
either of these aspects is destructive of the 
other. 
However, the two recognitions are not in- 
compatible. On the contrary, the more we 
practice the binocular vision of their coinci- 
dent employment, the more will they prove to 
enhance our enjoyment and to cross-fertilize 
our intellectual and esthetic reactions to the 
story. But personal practice, and a persistent 
and interested experimenting in first alternat- 
ing and then combining these ways of looking 
at a story, is the only rule for attaining their 
joint employment.

of John Galsworthy’s “The Pigeon,” on the 
other hand, is simultaneously conscious and 
draws the final flavor of his appreciation from 
the combined realization of the play’s fine il- 
lusion of reality, its purely relative “truth” as 
an ironic criticism of life, and the inherent art 
of its complexly aroused and subtly satisfied 
emotions. And the gap between these two at- 
titudes, or between similar attitudes in the 
reading of fiction, is not to be bridged without 
personal interest and personal effort. Yet it 
is well worth bridging. And the realization 
that it is bridgable, the reasons for bridging it, 
and the advice to keep trying with these un- 
derstandings in mind, are here offered as in- 
centives to the undertaking and as directions 
for going about it. And the reasons for wanting 
to bridge the gap are that it is only by gradu- 
ally doing so that we grow into a full respon- 
siveness to fiction’s many-faceted offerings 
to us and consequently into profiting by its 
many-phased ministerings to our needs. Also 
that failure to do this is the cause of most of 
our driftings into stagnation in the reading of 
fiction.

tion of this it is necessary only to point out 
that it is by a realization of fiction’s synthetic 
and artistic relations to us as above outlined, 
and by a more and more interested reading of 
it with these in mind, that we gradually escape 
from the dwarfing tyranny of our demand for 
a “happy ending” into a realization that we 
need the self-fulfillment of imagined failure as 
well as that of imagined success; and that the 
interpretatively valid completeness of any fic- 
tional synthesis, and not its “happy” or “un 
happy” “ending,” is the ultimate source of 
all real intellectual profit, or esthetic pleasure, 
or emotional fulfillment to be derived from it.

As to the importance of employing our 
ripening realization of these relationships as 
the criterion of our judgment when we face 
the completed formulation of a novel, and as 
to the importance of remembering these rela-

constantly do, we employ past fictional for- 
mulations as bases of other judgments on life, 
and as elements in other idea and attitude con- 
structions: — the importance of these prac-

tices and the value of gradually developing 
them are by now self-evident. 
For, since the novel is an imaginary synthe- 
sis by means of which we at once isolate and 
examine our own conceptions of life and com- 
pare notes with the author, not to learn to 
read it as such, and judge it as such, and em- 
ploy our memories of the experience as such, 
is to fail in learning to read. And, since the 
novel is also an art form; not to learn to read 
it, constructively aware of its rhythmic arous- 
ings of emotional anticipation, and not to 
learn to judge it critically by its valid or in- 
valid satisfyings of their requirements, and 
not to remember and use the memory of these 
things for what they are, is to fail both in the 
flowering and the seeding of fictional right 
reading.

Tuer is a simple yet dramatic experiment in 
elemental physics with which we are all more 
or less familiar. 
In it a beam of sunlight is passed through a 
prism and is thereby separated — like a fan 
that our hands have opened — into the rain- 
bow-hued shafts of its component color rays. 
These are then caught upon a screen and the 
audience allowed to examine them — allowed 
to see for itself that here and no otherwhere is 
the magic paint-box from which the world is 
colored. And finally — that there may be no 
doubters — the experiment is proved by re- 
versing it. The divergent rays are passed 
through a lens that bends them back into 
focused reunion; and behold, the white beam 
of the sunlight is itself again. 
It is, in reality, a very similar experiment 
that we are engaged on in this book.

covered that our ability to read is made up of 
nothing less, and of nothing more, than of all 
the cal colorings, all the personal ex- 
periences, all the inborn impulses and unfold- 
ing forces o our individual lives. 
And now it remains for us to prove the 
value of ou r experiment by reversing it; to re- 
construct, that is to say, from the disunited 
elements of our ability to read and from the

And the lens with which I have elected to 
do the necessary focusing — the phrase that I 
have chosen in which to sum up this attitude 
— is the title of this chapter. 
You very likely feel that “the Cosmos 4 la 
carte” is a “hifalutin” phrase. It no doubt 
strikes some of you as — how shall I put it? 
— as a trifle “strong”; as “going some”; as, 
let us say, “‘a little bit of too much.” Some of 
you are no doubt inclined to smile and politely 
pass it up as hyperbole. Some of you are no 
doubt inclined to frown and set it down as 
“hot air.” 
Let me be quite frank and say that I meant 
you to. 
There is nothing like “stepping down a step 
that is n’t there” for making us realize the 
levelness of a piece of ground. 
There is nothing like being certain that we 
have caught some one in the very act of loose- 
minded overstatement, and then finding that 
he is, after all, well within the facts, for jolting 
us into a recognition of neglected truth. 
And this phrase is n’t “hifalutin.” It is n’t 
hyperbolic. It is n’t “hot air.” It is merely a 
slightly fanciful way of calling attention to 
267

  the most basic, the most primal, the most uni- 
versally operative attitude of all life. 
If you doubt this, allow me to introduce 
you to one of our poorest relations and most 
distant cousins, the amceba. 
II 
The amceba, as you doubtless know, is one 
of the protozoa — one of the first, or lowest, 
forms of life. It is an invisible pellicule of 
protoplasm; a microscopic animalcule con- 
sisting of a single life-cell. It has no mouth, 
no stomach, no sense-organs, no limbs. It 
lives in the sea and it moves from place to 
place by occasionally protruding portions of 
its jelly-like substance and sculling with these 
temporary fins. And when, on its tiny jour- 
neys, it encounters bits of floating matter 
smaller than itself, it wraps its soft cell-stuft 
round them,—engulfs these microscopic 
atoms in its own microscopic mass, — and 
either absorbs them, if they prove absorbable, 
or rejects them if they don’t. And this — ex- 
cept occasionally to divide itself in two and 
thus double the size of its own family — is all 
that it ever does.

  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
Here, then, on the lowest rung of the ladder 
of life, here, still lingering at the source from 
which we have all derived, is a literal and liv- 
ing embodiment of my “hifalutin” phrase. 
For the amceba’s sole attitude toward the 
cosmos is that the cosmos is edible. And it 
spends its life making experiments with the 
menu.

“But what,” you may perhaps ask, “has 
this to do with reading?” 
The proper and final answer to that ques- 
tion is “Everything.” But first, let us move a 
few million years up the scale of development. 
Did you ever notice that a human baby, 
when it arrives “trailing clouds of glory be- 
hind it,” also brings along the ameba attitude 
toward the cosmos? That it, too, regards the 
universe solely as edible, and conveys every 
fragment of it thatits little hands get hold of 
to its mouth? 
Let us see how this happens and what it 
means. 
Millions of years separate Man as we know 
him — Man with his complex physical organ-

ization and his developed mentality — from 
the one-celled creatures that were his earliest 
ancestors. But the individual human baby is 
not thus separated. The individual baby, 
newly born, is but a few short months removed 
from having been a microscopic, one-celled or- 
ganism itself. Moreover, in those few months, 
it has physically rehearsed (like a scholar, 
who reviews in a day the lessons of a term) 
the whole physical history of the race’s climb. 
It has been in turn a two-celled, a four-celled, 
an eight-celled organism. It has been the cup- 
shaped cell-mass that corresponds to a sponge. 
It has been a worm-like creature with a puls- 
ing tube for a heart. It has been a fish-like be- 
ing and breathed through gills. It has had the 
two-chambered heart of a fish, and the three- 
chambered heart of a frog, before it developed 
the four-chambered heart of a mammal. It has 
been a “quadruped” with four limbs alike. 
It has worn hair from head to heel. It has 
grown, and discarded, a long tail. 
And even when it is born, it is not yet, ex- 
cept in intention and promise, a human being. 
It is still merely a creature on the road to be- 
coming human — a creature that has already

developed the body of a baby, but that still 
retains the mind of an ameeba. 
On the physical side, the long recapitula- 
tory journey from protozoon to man is well 
advanced. But on the psychic side the jour- 
ney is not yet begun. The entire development 
from “amceba attitude” to “man attitude” 
remains to be carried out. All the marvelous 
overtones of Man’s emotional, intellectual, and 
spiritual appetites have still to be evolved from, 
and superimposed on, the basic hunger of the

Do you doubt the possibility of this transi- 
tion? 
Did you ever watch a baby a few days old 
nuzzle at its mother’s breast, and then fall 
asleep in the very act of suckling — at the in- 
stant, that is to say, of achieved satisfaction? 
And did you ever watch the same baby, a few 
weeks later, although its hunger had been 
sated, fret for its mother’s lullaby; and then 
fall asleep, suddenly, in the middle of a 
rhythm? 
If you have, you have watched one of the 
271

many beginnings of that other recapitulatory 
journey — the journey from physical hunger 
to mental appetites. 
For this latter falling to sleep also marks 
the instant of an achieved satisfaction. A sat- 
isfaction still physical, but no longer gastric. 
The satisfaction of what is, as yet, a mere 
faint bodily appetite; but which will, some 
day, develop into a spiritual hunger. 
For what has happened is this: the baby 
(not being deaf, like the imagined “Helen 
Keller” of our discussion of “The World 
Outside Us and the World Within”) has sensed 
a relationship, other than that of food and 
hunger, between the world outside it and its 
inner life. It has sensed the relationship be- 
tween the physical rhythm of its mother’s 
song, and the physical rhythms of its own 
body; the rhythms of its beating heart, its 
pulsing arteries, its expanding and contract- 
ing lungs, its breath alternately intaken and 
exhaled. And where, awhile ago, it was con- 
tent and fell asleep when it had hungered and 
been fed, it now instinctively craves and cla- 
mors for a periodic renewal of this other, com- 
Sortable sensing; and sleeps when that is sated.

It has discovered a new dish on the cosmic 
menu. 
It has, let us put it, sensed something in the 
world outside it, that is not food, and that yet, 
somehow, belongs to it. 
And have we not already, in the course of 
our previous inquiry, seen a child, a little 
further advanced on this journey, — “the in- 
habitant,” we then described it, “of a world 
where there was already rhyme, but not yet 
reason,” — reading Mother Goose with a 
satisfaction that was not wholly physical, yet 
not wholly mental; and discovering in the 
process something that was its own — “finding 
itself” as we said? 
Have we not, indeed, already, in our seek- 
ing for a Sense of Direction, followed one 
phase of this journey up through childhood 
and adolescence to the final culmination of 
maturity; and found, at every stage, — from 
the rhymes of Mother Goose to the gospels of 
the elect, — that the travelers were but discov- 
ering their own; formulating what belonged 
to them; “finding,” as we said, “themselves”? 
It is the universal impetus — this search 
for our own. 
273 
      
-P-A-G-E-282
    HOW TO READ 
It is the essence of that upward urge that 
has immemorially driven our race; that has 
driven it from being “amcebas” into being 
men; that will yet drive it into being what no 
man can now foresee. 
Not merely in metaphor, but in biologic 
fact, the acts and attitudes that we speak of 
as “drinking in beauty,” as “having an om- 
nivorous mind,” as “hungering and thirsting 
after righteousness,” are sublimated forms of 
the primal hunger. They are subtler searchings 
for our own on the menu of a Cosmos a la carte. 
In short, this search is the Law of Life. 
And it is also the focus-giving fact that we 
are seeking. 
For, since reading, as we have seen, is a form 
of living, we can best state our right attitude 
toward it in terms of Life-law. And so, in order 
to get our definition of that attitude into a 
concrete form that we can examine and ad- 
just ourselves to, we will put it that Rraprne

NATING SEARCH FOR OUR OWN.

Do you remember that, in our early discus- 
sions, when we discovered that we have to 
find our own materials in which to retell for 
ourselves an author’s story, and that we even 
have to find our own meanings for the words 
in which the story is written, we discovered 
that we do not always find the right word- 
meaning first? That we “react automatically” 
to words and then criticize the reactions? 
And. do you remember that it was there 
pointed out that this method — to feel first, 
and then examine our feelings; to react spon- 
taneously to life, and then accept or reject the 
reactions — is the only method we have of 
finding personal meanings, whether for words 
or for the world? 
And do you remember that it was further 
pointed out, there and thereafter, that the 
understanding of these facts and the employ- 
ment of this method are the only sources of 
genuine cultural growth and attainment? 
Please note, then, that this method is the 
method of the ameeba, which first engulfs its 
atom, and then either absorbs or rejects it. 
275 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
HOW TO READ 
It is the ancestral method. By it, and by it 
only, can we discriminate our own, anywhere 
in life. And by it, and by it only, can we make 
that, which should be our own, ours. Please 
note, also, that our friend George — he of the 
cold-storage mind— does not use this method. 
He engulfs as many atoms as he can hold; but 
neither absorbs, nor rejects, any. He is the 
kind of reader that Lord Bacon must have had 
in mind when he said that “‘reading maketh 
a full man.” He mistakes the Cosmos for a 
table @hote. 
VE 
But we are adopting a very different atti- 
tude; and our discussion of “Intellectual Di- 
gestion” in the seventh chapter was really un- 
dertaken in order to lay the foundation for a 
proper understanding, at this point, (1) of the 
true nature of this reading-search for our own, 
and (2) of the way we can best translate this 
understanding into efficient practice. For not 
everything in any book “‘belongs to us.” And, 
of what does, only so much is ever actually 
made ours through reading as we intellectu- 
ally digest, in addition to mentally engulfing. 
276 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
Let us now look, then, with this in mind, at 
a few obvious facts of reading, the meaning of 
which we seldom seek for. 
There are many books in every department 
(and there are few of us who have not had 
some experience with them) that we read, 
with fresh profit, at successive stages of our 
development; books in which, at each reread- 
ing, we find something now “belonging to us” 
that was not even potentially “ours” before. 
Sometimes this is because we have, in the 
mean while, acquired the necessary raw ma- 
terials of experience with which to read these 
books more fully. 
Sometimes this is merely because, in the 
mean while, we have developed new skill in 
the right using of our old material. 
Sometimes it is because, in the mean while, 
we have developed new needs that were dor- 
mant in our younger selves. 
But, generally speaking, these new discov- 
eries, in books that we have already read, of 
things that are potentially ours, and these 
new successes at making them so, are the out- 
come of all three of these causes combined in 
various proportions. 
277  
-P-A-G-E-286
  
HOW TO READ 
Again, there are many books in every de- 
partment (and again there are few of us who 
have not had some experience with them) 
that we read once with conscious enjoyment or 
personal profit; but of which a later reading 
leaves us puzzled to understand “what we ever 
saw in them.” 
Sometimes this is because, at our first read- 
ing, they synthesized certain portions of ex- 
perience for us (and these syntheses may be 
either the explanatory ones of elementary 
science or the imaginative ones of simple- 
mooded fiction) that we now know our way 
through blindfold, and so no longer realize the 
sense of rightful ownership we felt in our first 
finding of them thus simply grouped. 
Sometimes this is because, while in our 
first reading we found these books adequate 
moulds into which to pour some inchoate 
hope or dream or tentative realization of re- 
lationship, fictional, philosophical, historical, 
or what-not, the fuller store of our later mould- 
needing material finds them inadequate to its 
purposes, and we forget their former ade- 
quacy. 
Sometimes this is because, at our first read~ 
278 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
ing, these books ministered to a typical but 
temporary need — childish, adolescent, or de- 
velopmental — that we have since outgrown, 
have perhaps forgotten, and have even possi- 
bly come, while remembering, to despise. 
But again, generally speaking, all of these 
reasons are present in varying proportions 
when we thus discover that a book, once 
seemingly full of what by right belonged to us, 
is now comparatively empty, wholly worth- 
less, or even despicable. 
And a proper balancing against each other 
of these two sets of facts from our common 
reading experience will go far toward making 
clear to us the true meaning, both of what 
progressively and changingly constitutes “our 
own,” and of the step-by-step methods of our 
only efficient search for it. 
vil 
Even Science and Philosophy, we must re- 
member, constantly invent explanations and 
hypotheses; find them useful while they cover, 
and seem to co-relate, all the facts till then 
observed in a particular field; swear by them 
more or less dogmatically while maintained; 
279 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
    HOW TO READ 
use them as stepping-stones to new investi- 
gations and as tests of new discoveries; end 
by discarding them when outgrown and dis- 
credited, and frequently look back upon them 
with contempt. 
And this is but another way of expressing 
the use we have made of those books once 
found full of meaning, but later discovered to 
be empty. 
And even Science and Philosophy, those 
great, organized, supposedly authoritative 
forms of humanity’s search for its own in the 
chaos of experience, are constantly going back 
and discovering that their own growth has 
enabled them to find new meanings and new 
mysteries in chapters of the Great Book that 
they had already read and had thought to 
have read fully. 
And this is but another way of expressing 
the fresh discoveries we make in old books 
whose real “conceptions” were bigger than 
our first formulations of them.

But what the Science, and the Philosophy, 
and the You and the I of any particular mo«

-P-A-G-E-289
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
ment are all prone to lose sight of, is the fact 
that it is partly with the actually digested and 
assimilated essences of these old and perhaps 
exploded explanations, of these old and per- 
haps abandoned hypotheses, of these old and 
perhaps now despicable “readings,” that they, 
and we, in our respective fields, are now pursu- 
ing our enlarging search. 
Thus the chemist of to-day is thinking in 
part with the truths digested out of the crude 
syntheses of alchemy. 
Thus the idealist of to-day is more be- 
holden than he sometimes likes to acknowl- 
edge to those who first made idols and wor- 
shiped them. For the idol was the wooden 
synthesis of a crude idealism; and in the higher 
truth of all human worship there circulates 
to-day some transubstantiated essence of the 
idolater’s gropings after truth. 
Thus John Smith, formulating for himself 
(in reading W. H. Hudson’s romance of Cen- 
tral America, “Green Mansions”) a new syn- 
thesis of relations between the naive brutali- 
ties of savage life, the scientific marvels of 
nature-study, and the basic yearnings of the 
human heart, may unwittingly be building

into his creative structure something of what 
he first wonderingly found and made his own 
in reading that once gladly accepted, but 
now ridiculous-seeming “appearance of com-

Our minds, it seems, like our bodies, grow 
by what they feed on. But, like our bodies, 
our minds do not grow by means of the con- 
taining husks and form-giving fibers that in 
time they digestively reject, but by whatso- 
ever of the nutritive contents of these they 
assimilate and make their own. 
And now, with this idea also in mind, let us 
again look at some of the obvious facts of our 
common reading experience. 
One may read a volume on science, or an 
essay upon some philosophical conception, 
and be so poorly equipped with technical 
knowledge that one does little more, in the 
reading, than formulate for one’s self a vague 
idea — the hazy conception of a point of view 
bigger than one’s own. 
Later on, one may come to discard this idea 
282
-P-A-G-E-291
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
as fallacious, or arrive at regarding this point 
of view as dwarfing. 
And yet, meanwhile, they may have func- 
tioned for us — these experimental syntheses 
— as incentives to further searchings, as dis- 
closers of new possibilities, as touchstones 
and criteria of “ownership.” 
On the other hand, one may read such a 
book and be utterly incapable of grasping the 
synthetic idea contained in it; yet may inci- 
dentally formulate for one’s self, in reading 
it, a dozen subsidiary realizations of fact-re- 
lationship or idea-relationship that one uses 
thereafter as building-blocks in future formu- 
lations; that one gradually combines with 
other similar realizations, the personal mean- 
ings of which one slowly and digestively as- 
similates into one’s attitude toward the world. 
And the same thing is true of fiction. 
One may read a story and get little from 
reading it beyond the vividly emotionalized 
facing of a situation; or the eager, “I-told- 
you-so” notion of a proved moral; or a sense 
of violent antipathy to “that way of looking 
at things.” 
And one may — indeed, one must — use 
283 
   
-P-A-G-E-292
HOW TO READ 
these hazy findings of what belongs to one as 
parts of one’s future equipment. 
But, on the other hand, one may read a 
novel and discover no wholeness to it at all; 
yet have a dozen things “happen in one” in 
the course of the reading that prove, later, to 
have been true “findings of one’s own.” 
And of course the same thing is true of a 
history, an autobiography, a religious treatise, 
or any other printed invitation to compare 
notes on life, past, present, or to come. 
x 
All our reading, then, no matter how un- 
skillful or how unsophisticated it may be, 
proves on examination to be eclectic. 
And we see, moreover, that this eclecticism, 
even when unconscious and undirected, is ex- 
ercised in two typical manners: (1) it seizes 
upon, and makes future use of, the synthetic 
aspects of the book read; or (2) it seizes upon, 
and makes future use of, component details 
used by the author in his attempted synthesis. 
Or it does both. 
And the efficient application to practice of 
our defined attitude toward reading must 
284 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
  
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
therefore be sought through a gradual develop- 
ing in ourselves of a more conscious, zestful, and 
discriminating eclecticism: — an eclecticism 
eager for the discovery, in everything we read, 
of “our own” in either of these forms; and an 
eclecticism progressively able and willing to 
accept either, at its full value, without prej- 
udice to the other, while at the same time 
looking hopefully for the greater discovery 
of their complete combining. Such a combin- 
ing, for instance, as comes to us when a great 
novel helps us to build the disregarded facts of 
our common lives, the partial philosophies of 
our daily using, the accepted ‘‘science”’ of our 
passing civilization, into successively reveal- 
ing syntheses of understanding, and finally 
welds these rhythmically assembled parts into 
the interpretative “completeness” of an out- 
look, and at the same time leads our art- 
roused sense of ‘‘need” to an art-achieved ful- 
fillment. Or such a combining, again, as one 
may find in the writings of the French en- 
tomologist, Henri Fabre. Fabre had the scien- 
tist’s passion for truth, the unassuming cul- 
ture of the scholar, the unifying imagination 
of the poet, the dramatist’s sense of the tragic

and mysterious, the outlook of the philosopher 
and the creativeness of the artist. His books 
are about bugs. But their insect actors cast 
shadows on the stars. 
XI 
But there is a reverse side to every medal. 
And besides developing a more open-minded 
and receptive and discriminating eclecticism 
in the realm of what really belongs to us, we 
need also to discourage— at least to the 
extent of recognizing its true character — 
another kind of eclecticism that we all prac- 
tice more or less unintelligently in the realm 
of what, in the strictest sense, does not as yet 
belong to us. 
And here again our seventh chapter in- 
quiry into the matter of Intellectual Digestion 
will help us to an easier understanding. 
The mere acceptance — the “swallowing 
whole” — of statements of alleged fact, no 
matter how trustworthy, or of pronounced 
opinions, no matter how “authoritative,” may 
stock our memories with useful material — 
useful for certain experiments, or as points of 
departure for future inquiry, or as subject- 
286   
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
matter for future testing-out. But, so far from 
such mere acceptance making these things 
“ours,” it frequently results in preventing our 
ever discovering in them that which should 
by rights belong to us. 
If, for example, in the exercise of this bas- 
tard eclecticism, one uncritically accepts as 
personally and finally valid the orders of some 
critic, or specialist, or teacher (no matter how 
celebrated) as to what we must think of a 
picture, or what we must find in a book, or 
how we must regard some political theory, or 
what we must believe in religion, one closes by 
that supine act of acceptance the only door 
that opens into real “ownership” in that par- 
ticular synthesis of recognizable relationship. 
“But,” many readers are likely to exclaim 
at this point, “‘are we not to accept, then, as 
valid, the declaration of Science that it is so 
and so many million miles to the sun; that so 
much oxygen and so much hydrogen, properly 
combined, form water; and all the thousands 
of other authoritative declarations about 
things that we need to know, but have no 
chance to find out for ourselves?” And the 
answer to this question is very simple, for the 
287
-P-A-G-E-296
    HOW TO READ 
question has to do with a difficulty that is 
really only a confusion. The fact being that 
we accept the statements of others only in so 
far, and for so long, as their truth does not 
personally concern us. 
Science tells us that it is ninety-four million 
miles to the sun; and we accept the statement 
humbly and gratefully and admiringly. 
Later on, Science comes round and says 
that it is sorry, but it finds that it has made a 
mistake. It is only ninety-two and a half mil- 
lion miles to the sun. And we accept the new 
statement just as readily and as humbly as 
the first. But the real reason for this is that 
the only personal use we make of this “knowl- 
edge” is to use the supposed distance to the 
sun as a means of trying to conceive the dis- 
tances of inter-stellar space; and for this pur- 
pose one of these distances is as useful as the 
other. 
Again, Science tells us to-day that under cer- 
tain circumstances two atoms of oxygen and 
one of hydrogen will rush joyously together 
and form a molecule of water; and that under 
other circumstances these same atoms will 
find each other’s company unsupportable and 
288
-P-A-G-E-297
THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
will rush apart and resume their original 
status. And we accept the statement, humble 
and marveling. But if, to-morrow, Science 
came round and told us that it was sorry, but 
it found that it had overlooked something; 
namely, that it was only when a little radium 
was present, — say an eightieth of a grain in 
a gallon of water,— that these things ever 
happened, we should accept the new state- 
ment as complacently as the first; and should 
continue to discriminate just as eclectically 
as before between the bottled waters offered 
us by the Undine Spring Company and the 
Hygienic Distilling Corporation. For the 
truth is that the only personal use most of us 
ever make of the statements of Science about 
the composition of water is to use them as im- 
aginative items in our building-up of a con- 
ception of the marvelously intricate nature of 
matter, of the almost human loves and hates 
and liaisons and fallings-out of “chemical 
affinity,” and of the relations these bear to 
modern industry and modern thought. And 
for this purpose one of these statements is as 
serviceable as the other. 
But suppose one was a manufacturing

chemist, excited by the new declaration be- 
cause it suggested the possibility of his ex-

you imagine for a moment that he would ac- 
cept the new declaration without personal in- 
vestigation? Or build a plant until he had 
digested out of that investigation’s results the 
“personal meanings” of the discovery? 
But enough of Science. Let us come down 
to the practical plane of household practice. 
You get, let us say, your bread from a baker, 
But in glancing over the pages of Mrs. Roast-

ment unconditionally, and even pass the in- 
formation on toinquiring friends, rather proud 
that the corner of Authority’s mantle should 
thus for a moment rest on your shoulder. And 
if, next year, a new edition of Mrs. Roastem’s - 
book advises three eggs instead of four, you 
.accept the revision without question, and per= 
haps even boast to your advisees that Mrs. R. 
has found a way of making muffins with three 
eggs.

There are, as a matter of fact, but three 
services, broadly speaking, that any teacher 
or expounder or commentator or critic can 
render us. 
One of these is the important and necessary, 
but none-the-less humble, service of supply- 
ing our memories with storable raw materials 
of alleged ‘“‘facts,” of supposed relationships, 
and of the existence of this, that, or the other 
decision about these, arrived at by this, that, 
or the other investigator. 
‘The other two services are of a higher order; 
of opposed but mutually complementary char- 
acter, and hence of equal value. 
One of them is to help us (by inducing us 
constructively and critically to agree with 
them) to a more intelligent synthetic formula- 
tion of our own reactions to life. 
The other is to help us (by inducing us 
291
-P-A-G-E-300
HOW TO READ 
constructively and critically to disagree with 
them) to more intelligent syntheses of these 
same personal reactions. 
And there is no more fatal bar to the pro- 
gressive and successful reduction to practice 
of our accepted attitude toward reading than 
habitually to allow the first of these author 
services to take for us the place of the other 
two. 
xl 
One might fill a book with examples of the 
emotional and intellectual and spiritual lanes- 
leading-to-our-own that are blocked and 
turned into no-thoroughfares for us by this 
practice. 
But one common and typical instance will 
suffice — an instance so common that we con- 
stantly see examples of it; and so typical that 
we should always regard them as final reduc- 
tions-to-absurdity of the idea that we do not 
need to seek our own, or to digest it out of 
what we find, but can rest content in being 
told by another what it is. 
We all know people who will read a book in 
the firm conviction that they are getting a 
292 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
great deal out of it, and who, in that convic- 
tion, voraciously “swallow whole” all its state- 
ments, opinions, theories, and explanations; 
but who, if they chance upon some declara- 
tion in it that they know of their own knowl- 
edge to be inaccurate, will ‘“unswallow” 
everything they had taken in (which, having 
digested none of it, they are able to do) and 
will toss the book aside, declaring that “‘if it is 
wrong in that it may be wrong in everything” 
and that it is of no further use to them, since 
they no longer know “‘what to believe and 
what not to.” 
These are the people who, a few generations 
since, ceased to believe in God when they be- 
gan to believe in Darwin. 
And the root of their trouble— and of ours, 
since it is a trouble from which none of us is 
free — lies in the fact that they have not yet 
even begun to learn the thing that none of us 
has wholly learned; namely, that, while under- 
standing and faith must both feed on external 
things, they must both be generated within us.

Understanding and faith: These are the two 
forms that all our successful seekings for our 
own take on. They are equally changeable 
and fallible. They are equally subject to the 
laws of growth by digestion and assimilation. 
They are equally incapable of reaching “ul- 
timate truth.” Yet they are the equal and 
final storehouses of the harvest of living. 
All that is significant to the seer in his “‘at- 
titude toward the Cosmos” and toward the 
unknowable Power that stands behind it or 
pervades it, is summed up in these two terms. 
And all that is significant to the miser, gloat- 
ing on the dulling dollars in an old hair trunk, 
is similarly to be summed up. 
And since, while generated within us, un- 
derstanding and faith both feed on external 
things, — on the concreteness of our own con- 
tacts with life and on such comparings of notes 
as we are able to carry on with our fellows, — 
the homely problem of the “balanced ration” 
enters into all our dealings with their nourish- 
ment. 
We have already seen that our own con~ 
294 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE COSMOS A LA CARTE 
crete contacts with life and our own germinal 
“ideas” derived therefrom are the basic raw 
materials of our reading. We have already 
seen that it is in part with such increments 
of understanding and faith as we digest out of 
our old reading that we carry on our new. 
And we must not forget that these new read- 
ings must, taken together with our new liv- 
ing, constitute in some sort a “balanced ra- 
tion,” if the understanding and faith we build 
from them are to be sound and serviceable. 
We cannot practice to the full the right 
reading of modern fiction if we are utterly 
ignorant of modern thought. We cannot prac- 
tice to the full the right reading of even the 
simplest conceptions of modern thought if we 
are utterly ignorant of modern science. We 
cannot bring to the reading of the simplest 
scientific textbook the “curiosity” that fur- 
nishes the motive power of our reading if we 
walk the modern world without something of 
that will to inquire into its phenomena that 
every child possesses. 
Right reading is not ‘a trick. It is a struc- 
ture. It is built up from the digested satisfy- 
ings of a myriad curiosities — curiosities from

  HOW TO READ 
which, on the one hand, its materials are de- 
rived, and from which, on the other, its meth- 
ods are assembled, like the growing formula- 
tion of a novel’s conception. And its aim is an 
efficient readiness and ability, based on prac- 
tice and experiment, to make imaginative 
combinations of this material at the instiga- 
tion of the author, in the zestful seeking for 
what these may disclose in, and for, ourselves. 
Perhaps you are one of those who have kept 
hanging up, in your heart, a motto, worked in 
mental worsted on a bit of intellectual bristol 
board —a motto reading “Live, and let live.” 
If so, and if you would learn right reading, 
take this motto down and hang up in its place 
one with the inscription, “Live, and compare 
notes.” And then, when you are “reading 
your book,” remember George of the cold- 
storage mind, and remember the ameeba. 
Is there a simile in the sentence before you? 
Engulf it. Test yourself quickly with it for 
anything that it may disclose to, or in, or for, 
you, either of beauty or of meaning or of 
humor. Absorb what you find; or toss the 
empty husk of words aside, and pass on. Is 
there a statement in a paragraph? A moral

implication in an incident? A criticism of life 
implicit in a tale? An “outlook” in an out- 
come? An esthetic stimulus in a style? An 
art-enhancement in a writer’s creation? En- 
gulf them. Taste them. Test them by, and 
for, yourself. Smack your mind’s lips over 
them; or make a wry face, and pass on. 
When, and only when, you are doing this, 
are you really reading — seeking your own 
with a zestful and discriminating eclecticism. 
And when you are doing this, you are, like 
the ameeba, taking your Cosmos 4 Ja carte.

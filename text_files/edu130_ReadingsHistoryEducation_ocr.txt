PREFACE 
  Tue Readings which this volume reproduces have been collected, 
from time to time, by the author in connection with the instruc- 
tion of university classes in the general history of education, 
and have been used with students as reading supplemental to a 
lecture course on the subject. They are now gathered together 
and organized into the present volume, and made to run parallel 
with and to supplement the author’s textbook on the His- 
tory of Education, published at this same time. The chapter 
arrangement of the two books is the same, and the different 
Readings are referred to by cross-reference (R. 172, etc.) through- 
out the History volume. At the same time the selections are 
of such a general nature, have been so organized and arranged, 
and their importance and significance are so explained in the 
chapter introductions, that the volume of Readings may be 
used as a reference volume of sources by instructors using other 
texts on the history of education. 
The Readings have been selected and arranged primarily with 
a view to illustrating the history of educativnal practice and 
progress and organization, rather than the history of educational 
theory, though a number of typical and illustrative selections 
from the more important writers on educational theory, and 
particularly modern theory, have been included. They have also 
been selected with a view to illustrating that aspect of the his- 
tory of educational progress which conceives of educational de- 
velopment as being a phase of the rise and preservation and spread 
of our western civilization. The Readings accordingly follow 
such great main lines as the foundation elements of our civiliza- 
tion, as laid by Greece, Rome, and the Christians; the almost ex- 
tinction of the new civilization in the barbarian migrations, and 
the gradual reduction of these new peoples to order and a sem- 
blance of civilization; the preservation of the old learning and 
the foundation of schools during the dark period; the reawakening 
of scholarship, and the reéstablishment of learning in the new 
universities; the great period of the Revival of Learning, during 
which that human inquiry which first characterized Greek
-P-A-G-E-8
viii PREFACE 
  thought again arose in the western world; the continuation of 
this spirit of inquiry into matters of religion and world phenom- 
ena, giving rise to the religious revolts and the beginnings of 
modern science study; the educational consequences of the Prot- 
estant Revolts among the different religious sects, and the rise 
of the vernacular school; character of the schools as evolved by the 
middle of the eighteenth century; the rise of political inquiry, the 
formulation of a new individualistic and political theory for 
the school, and the transition of the school from the control of 
the Church to that of the State; the rise of modern state-school 
systems, and the adoption of the school as the great constructive 
tool of the State; the spread of western civilization and the 
state-school idea over the world; and some of the more impor- 
tant of the new expansions and conceptions of modern education. 
It is hoped that the volume of Readings as organized may prove 
useful to teachers and students of the history of education gen- 
erally, as well as to those who use the companion volume of 
Text. It is believed that this one volume will be found to con- 
tain sufficient supplemental reading to meet the needs of most 
classes studying the subject. It could be used asa library refer- 
ence volume, almost to the exclusion of other collateral reading.

HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
CHAPTER I 
THE OLD GREEK EDUCATION 
Tue Readings in this chapter deal with Spartan education, as 
typical of the older tribal practices of the Hellenes, and with 
Athenian education before the Age of Pericles, as typical of the 
best evolved in Greece before its Golden Age. The Readings re- 
produced describe and compare both, and give a good basis for an 
understanding of the underlying motives and the character of 
each. 
The selection from Plutarch (1) déscribes well the Spartan 
methods, purposes, and teachers, while the selection from Plato 
(2) gives a similar description for Athenian education. The se- 
lection from Lucian (3) pictures an Athenian schoolboy’s day, 
and the one from Aristotle (4) describes well the care taken as to 
citizenship enrollment, the exclusion of foreigners and all others 
not of proper birth, and the nature of the training of the Ephebic 
years. The selection from Freeman (5) is an excellent comparison 
of the character and ideals of the Spartan and the Athenian types 
of education, and the usefulness of each for the progress of the 
State. The aim of the Athenian education which produced such 
large human results is well stated by Thucydides (6). 
The degree to which Athens was able to evolve beyond the ear- 
lier tribal type of preparedness education, represented so well by 
Sparta, is evidence as to the wonderful ability of the Attic Greeks 
to make progressive changes in living and in government, and 
consequently to advance where others stood still. Far more than 
other Greeks, those of Attica were imaginative, original, versa- 
tile, adaptable, progressive, and endowed with rare mental abil- 
ity. Only on such an assumption can .we explain not only the 
very superior type of training for citizenship which they evolved, 
but also their marvelous achievements in art, philosophy, litera-

ture, and science at this early period in the development of the 
civilization of the world. 
1. Ancient Education in Sparta 
(Plutarch’s Lives, Lycurgus; selected passages) 
Plutarch (46-120 A.D.), a Greek who lived an active public life, 
largely in diplomatic service for Rome, has left us a number of 
character sketches of historical personages in Greek and Roman 
history which throw much light on ancient conditions. The fol- 
lowing extracts from his Life of Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver, 
who is supposed to have lived in the ninth century B.c., describes 
Spartan education. 
As for the education of youth, which he looked upon as the greatest 
and most glorious work of a lawgiver, he began with it at the very 
source, taking into consideration their conception and birth, by regu- 
lating the marriages. For he did not (as Aristotle says) desist from 
his attempt to bring the women under sober rules. They had, indeed, 
assumed great liberty and power on account of the frequent expeditions 
of their husbands, during which they were left sole mistresses at home, 
and so gained an undue deference and improper titles; but notwith- 
standing this he took all possible care of them. He ordered the virgins 
to exercise themselves in running, wrestling, and throwing quoits and 
darts; that their bodies being strong and vigorous, the children after- 
wards produced from them might be the same; and that, thus fortified 
by exercise, they might the better support the pangs of childbirth, and 
be delivered with safety. 
It was not left to the father to rear what children he pleased, but he 
was obliged to carry the child to a place called Lesche, to be examined 
by the most ancient men of the tribe, who were assembled there. If 
it was strong and well proportioned, they gave orders for its education, 
and assigned it to one of the nine thousand shares of land; but if it was 
weakly and deformed, they ordered it to be thrown into the place called 
Apothete, which is a deep cavern near the mountain Taygetus; con- 
cluding that its life could be no advantage either to itself or to the pub- 
lic, since nature had not given it at first any strength or goodness of 
constitution. ... The Spartan children were not under tutors pur- 
chased or hired with money, nor were the parents at liberty to educate 
them as they pleased: but as soon as they were seven years old, Lycur- 
gus ordered them to be enrolled in companies, where they were all kept 
under the same order and discipline, and had their exercises and recre- 
ations in common. He who showed the most conduct and courage 
amongst them, was made captain of the company. The rest kept
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE OLD GREEK EDUCATION 3 
their eyes upon him, obeyed his orders, and bore with patience the 
punishment he inflicted: so that their whole education was an exercise 
of obedience. The old men were present at their diversions, and often 
suggested some occasion of dispute or quarrel, that they might observe 
with exactness the spirit of each, and their firmness in battle. 
As for learning they had just what was absolutely necessary. All 
the rest of their education was calculated to make them subject to 
command, to endure labor, to fight and conquer. They added, there- 
fore, to their discipline, as they advanced in age; cutting their hair very 
close, making them go barefoot, and play, for the most part, quite 
naked. At twelve years of age, their undergarment was taken away, 
and but one upper one a year allowed them. Hence they were neces- 
sarily dirty in their persons, and not indulged the great favor of baths, 
and oils, except on some particular days of the year. They slept in 
companies, on beds made of the tops of reeds, which they gathered 
with their own hands, without knives, and brought from the banks of 
the Eurotas. In winter they were permitted to add a little thistle- 
down, as that seemed to have some warmth in it. 
At this age, the most distinguished amongst them became the favor- 
ite companions of the elder; and the old men attended more constantly 
their places of exercise, observing their trials of strength and wit, not 
slightly and in a cursory manner, but as their fathers, guardians, and 
governors: so that there was neither time nor place, where persons were 
wanting to instruct and chastise them. One of the best and ablest men 
of the city was, moreover, appointed instructor of the youth: and he 
gave the command of each company to the discreetest and most spir- 
ited of those called Ivens. An Iren was one that had been two years 
out of the class of boys: a Milliren, one of the oldest lads. This Jen, 
then, a youth twenty years old, gives orders to those under his com- 
mand, in their little battles, and has them to serve him at his house. 
He sends the oldest of them to fetch wood, and the younger to gather 
pot-herbs: these they steal where they can find them, either slyly get- 
ting into gardens, or else craftily and warily creeping to the common 
tables. But if any one be caught, he is severely flogged for negligence 
or want of dexterity. Vrhey Steal, too, whatever victuals they possibly 
can, ingeniously contriving to do it when persons are asleep, or keep 
but indifferent watch. If they are discovered, they are punished not 
only with whipping, but with hunger. Indeed, their supper is but 
slender at all times, that, to fence against want, they may be forced to 
exercise their courage and address. This is the first intention of their 
spare diet: a subordinate one is, to make them grow tall. ... 
The boys steal with so much caution, that one of them having con- 
veyed a young fox under his garment, suffered the creature to tear out 
his bowels with his teeth and claws, choosing rather to die than to be 
detected. Nor does this appear incredible, if we consider what their

  young men can endure to this day; for we have seen many of them ex- 
pire under the lash at the altar,of Diana Orthia. 
The Jren, reposing himself after supper, used to order one of the boys 
to sing a song; to another he put some question which required a judi- 
cious answer: for example, Who was the best man in the city? or, What he 
thought of such an action? This accustomed them from their childhood 
to judge of the virtues, to enter into the affairs of their countrymen. 
For if one of them was asked, Who is a good citizen, or who an infa- 
mous one, and hesitated in his answer, he was considered a boy of slow 
parts, and of a soul that would not inspire to honor. The answer was 
likewise to have a reason assigned for it, and proof conceived in a few 
words. He whose account of the matter was wrong, by way of pun- 
ishment, had his thumb bit by the ven. The old men and magistrates 
often attended these little trials, to see whether the Jren exercised his 
authority in a rational and proper manner. He was permitted, indeed, 
to inflict the penalties; but when the boys were gone, he was to be 
chastised himself, if he had punished them either with too much severity 
or remissness. 
The adopters of favorites also shared both in the honor and disgrace 
of their boys: and one of them is said to have been mulcted by the mag- 
istrates, because the boy whom he had taken into his affections let 
some ungenerous word or cry escape him as he was fighting. This love 
was so honorable, and in so much esteem, that the virgins too had their 
lovers amongst the most virtuous matrons. A competition of affection 
caused no misunderstanding, but rather a mutual friendship between 
those that had fixed their regards upon the same youth, and a united 
endeavor to make him as accomplished as possible. 
2. Description of an Athenian Schoolboy’s Life 
(Plato, The Protagoras; selected) 
Plato (429-348 B.c.), the famous Greek philosopher, here de- 
scribes in condensed form the training which an Athenian school- 
' boy received. The extract is from one of the Socratic dialogues 
in his Protagoras. 
Education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood, 
and last to the very end of life. Mother and nurse and father and tutor 
are quarreling about the improvement of the child as soon as ever he is 
able to understand them; he cannot say or do anything without their 
setting forth to him that this is just and that is unjust; this is honour- 
able, that is dishonourable; this is holy, that is unholy; do this and ab- 
stain from that. And if he obeys, well and good; if not, he is straight- 
ened by threats and blows, like a piece of warped wood. At a later 
stage they send him to teachers, and enjoin them to see to his manners
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE OLD GREEK EDUCATION 5 
  even more than to his reading and music; and the teachers do as they 
are desired. And when the boy has learned his letters and is beginning 
to understand what is written, as before he understood only what was 
spoken, they put into his hands the works of great poets, which he reads 
at school; in these are contained many admonitions, and many tales, 
and praises, and encomia of ancient famous men, which he is required 
to learn by heart, in order that he may imitate or emulate them and 
desire to become like them. Then, again, the teachers of the lyre take 
similar care that their young disciple is temperate and gets into no 
mischief; and when they have taught him the use of the lyre, they in- 
troduce him to the poems of other excellent poets, who are the lyric 
poets; and these they set to music, and make their harmonies and 
rhythms quite familiar to the children’s souls, in order that they may 
learn to be more gentle, and harmonious, and rhythmical, and so more 
fitted for speech and action; for the life of man in every part has need 
of harmony and rhythm. Then they send them to the master of gym- 
nastic, in order that their bodies may better minister to the virtuous 
mind, and that they may not be compelled through bodily weakness 
to play the coward in war or on any other occasion. This is what is 
done by those who have the means, and those who have the means are 
the rich; their children begin education soonest and leave off latest. 
When they have done with masters, the state again compels them to 
learn the laws, and live after the pattern they furnish, and not after 
their own fancies; and just as in learning to write, the writing-master 
first draws lines with a style for the use of the young beginner, and 
gives him the tablet and makes him follow the lines, so the city draws 
the laws, which were the invention of good law-givers who were of old 
time; these are given to the young man, in order to guide him in his 
conduct whether as ruler or ruled; and he who transgresses them is to 
be corrected, or, in other words, called to account, which is a term used 
not only in your country, but also in many others. 
3- Description of an Athenian Schoolboy’s Day 
The following description by Lucian of an Athenian schoolboy’s 
life of a later period, but which Freeman thinks applies equally 
well to an earlier period, related to the details of schoolroom pro- 
cedure rather than to the larger purposes, as did the preceding 
selection. It describes a long and a busy day for a boy, but one 
which must on the whole have been a very enjoyable one. It 
also seems to indicate that the boy attended different schools on 
the same day, a point which is not clear. 
He gets up at dawn, washes the sleep from his eyes, and puts on his 
cloak. Then he goes out from his father’s house, his eyes fixed on the

ground, not looking at any one who meets him. Behind him follow 
attendants and pedagogoi, bearing in their hands the implements of 
virtue, writing tablets or books containing the great deeds of old, or, 
if he is going to a music school, his well-tuned lyre. 
When he has labored diligently at intellectual studies, and his mind 
is sated with the benefits of the school curriculum, he exercises his body 
in liberal pursuits, riding, or hurling the javelin or spear. Then the 
wrestling school with its sleek, oiled pupils, labors under the midday 
sun, and sweats in the regular athletic contests. Then a bath, not too 
prolonged; then a meal, not too large, in view of afternoon school. For 
the school masters are waiting for him again, and the books which . 
openly or by allegory teach him who was a great hero, who was a lover 
of justice and purity. With the contemplation of such virtues he 
waters the garden of his young soul. When evening sets a limit to his 
work, he pays the necessary tribute to his stomach and retires to rest, 
to sleep sweetly after his busy day. 
  4. Athenian Citizenship and the Ephebic Years 
(Aristotle, Constitution of Athens; selected) 
Aristotle (384-322 B.c.), the great organizing Greek mind, 
whom Eusebius called ‘‘Nature’s private secretary, dipping his 
pen in intellect,” here describes the constitutional requirements 
as to citizenship at Athens, and the training of the Ephebic years, 
which, by his time, had been extended to three years. 
The present state of the constitution is as follows: Citizenship is a 
right of children whose parents are both of them citizens. Registra- 
tion as a member of a deme or township takes place when eighteen 
years of age are completed. Before it takes place the townsmen of the 
deme find a verdict on oath, firstly, whether they believe the youth to 
be as old as the law requires, and if the verdict is in the negative he 
returns to the ranks of the boys. Secondly, the jury find whether he is 
freeborn and legitimate. If the verdict is against him he appeals to the 
Heliza, and the municipality delegate five of their body to accuse him 
of illegitimacy. If he is found by the jurors to have been illegally pro- 
posed for the register, the State sells him for a slave; if the judgment is 
given in his favor, he must be registered as one of the municipality. 
Those on the register are afterwards examined by the senate, and if any 
one is found not to be eighteen years old, a fine is imposed on the mu- 
nicipality by which he is registered. After approbation, they are called 
epheboi, or cadets, and the parents of all who belong to a single tribe 
hold a meeting and, after being sworn, choose three men of the tribe 
over forty years of age, whom they believe to be of stainless character 
and fitted for the superintendence of youth, and out of these the com-

mons in ecclesia select one superintendent for all of each tribe, and a 
governor of the whole body of youths from the general body of the 
Athenians. These take them in charge, and after visiting with them 
all the temples, march down to Pirzeus, where they garrison the north 
and south harbors, Munychia and Acte. The commons also elect 
two gymnastic trainers for them, and persons who teach them to fight 
in heavy armor, to draw the bow, to throw the javelin, and to handle 
artillery. Each of the ten commanders receives as pay a drachma 
[about twenty cents] per diem, and each of the cadets four obols 
[about thirteen cents]. Each commander draws the pay of the cadets 
of his own tribe, buys with it the necessaries of life for the whole 
band (for they mess together by tribes), and purveys for all their 
wants. The first year is spent in military exercises. The second year 
the commons meet in the theater and the cadets, after displaying be- 
fore them their mastery in warlike evolutions, are each presented with 
a shield and spear, and become mounted patrols of the frontier and 
garrison the fortresses. “They perform this service for two years, 
wearing the equestrian cloak and enjoying immunity from civic 
functions. During this period, to guard their military duties from 
interruption, they can be parties to no action either as defendant or 
plaintiff, except in suits respecting inheritances, or heiresses, or suc- 
cessions to hereditary priesthoods. When three years are completed 
they fall into the ordinary body of citizens, 
5. Sparta and Athens compared 
(Freeman, K. J., The Schools of Hellas, pp. 275-79, 281-82. London, 1907) 
This is one of the most important books ever written on Greek 
educational practice, and in the extracts here presented the differ- 
ences in the motives and practices of Sparta and Athens are well 
set forth. 
The preceding chapters have sufficiently established, as it seems to 
me, that Hellenic education alike at Sparta and at Athens, in theory 
and in practice, aimed at producing the best possible citizen, not the 
best possible money-maker; it sought the good of the community, not 
the good of the individual. The methods and materials of education 
naturally differed with the conception of good citizenship held in each 
locality, but the ideal object was always the same. 
The Spartan, with his schoolboy conception of life, believed that the 
whole duty of man was to be brave, to be indifferent to hardships and 
pain, to be a good soldier, and to be always in perfect physical condi- 
tion; when his Hellenic instincts needed satisfaction, he made his 
military drill into a musical dance and sang songs in honour of valour. 
Long speaking and lengthy meditation he regarded with contempt, for
-P-A-G-E-34
8 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
he preferred deeds to words and thoughts, and the essence of a situation 
could always be expressed in a single sentence. This Spartan concep- 
tion of citizenship fixed the aim of Spartan education. Daily hard- 
ships, endless physical training, perpetual tests of pluck and endur- 
ance, were the lot of the Spartan boy. He did not learn to read or write 
or count; he was trained to speak only in single words or in the shortest 
of sentences, for what need had a Spartan of letters or of chattering? 
His imagination had also to be subordinated to the national ideal: his 
dances, his songs, his very deities, were all military. 
The Athenian’s conception of the perfect citizen was much wider 
and much more difficult of attainment. Pluck and harmony of physi- 
cal development did not satisfy him: there must be equal training of 
mind and imagination, without any sacrifice of bodily health. He de- 
manded of the ideal citizen perfection of body, extensive mental activ- 
ity and culture, and irreproachable taste. “We love and pursue wis- 
dom, yet avoid bodily sloth; we love and pursue beauty, yet avoid bad 
taste and extravagance,” proclaims Perikles in his summary of Athe- 
nian ideals. Consequently Athenian education was triple in its aims; 
its activities were divided between body, mind, and taste. The body 
of the young Athenian was symmetrically developed by the scientific- 
ally designed exercises of the palaistra. At eighteen the State imposed 
upon him two years of physical training at public cost. In after life he 
could exercise himself in the public gymnasia without any payment; 
there was no actual compulsion, except the perpetual imminence of 
military service, which, however, almost amounted to compulsion. 
As to mental instruction, every boy had to learn reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and gain such acquaintance with the national literature as 
these studies involved. The other branch of primary education, play- 
ing and singing, intended to develop the musical ear and taste, was 
optional, but rarely neglected. The secondary education given by the 
Sophists, rhetors, and philosophers was only intended for the compara- 
tively few who had wealth and leisure. 
Taste and imagination were cultivated in the music and art schools, 
but the influences of the theater, the Akropolis, the temples and public 
monuments, and the dances which accompanied every festival and re- 
ligious occasion, were still more potent, and were exercised upon all 
alike. This esthetic aspect of education was regarded as particularly 
important in Hellas owing to the prevalent idea that art and music had 
a strong influence over character. 
For the training of character was before all things the object of Hel- 
lenic education; it was this which Hellenic parents particularly de- 
manded of the schoolmaster. So strongly did they believe that virtue 
could be taught, that they held the teacher responsible for any subse- 
quent misdemeanour of his pupils. . . . 
Since the main object of the schools of Hellas was to train and mould 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE OLD GREEK EDUCATION 9 
the character of the young, it would be natural to suppose that the 
schoolmasters and every one else who was to come into contact with the 
boys were chosen with immense care, special attention being given to 
their reputation for virtue and conduct. At Sparta this principle was 
certainly observed. “ Education was controlled by a paidonomos, se- 
lected from the citizens of the highest position and reputation, and the 
teaching was given, not by hired foreigners or slaves, but by the citizens 
themselves under his supervision. But then the teaching at Sparta, 
dealt mostly with the manners and customs of the State, or with bodily 
or military exercises, known to every grown man, and the citizens had, 
plenty of leisure. The Athenians were in a more difficult position. 
There were more subjects for the boy to learn, and some of them the 
parents might have neither the capacity nor the time to teach. Owing 
also to the day-school system at Athens and the peculiarities of Hellenic 
manners, the boys needed some one always at hand to take them to and 
from school and palaistra. Thus both paid teachers and attendants 
were needed. But it was also necessary not to let education become 
too expensive lest the poor should be unable to afford it. Conse- 
quently the paidagogoi came often to be the cheapest and most worth- 
less slaves, and the schoolmasters as a class to be regarded with 
supreme contempt. No doubt careful parents chose excellent paida- 
gogoi, schoolmasters, and paidotribai for their sons, and made the choice 
a matter of much deliberation: the teachers at the best schools were 
often men of position and repute. But that the class as a whole was 
regarded with contempt there can be little doubt. The children went 
into school as they would have gone into any other shop, with a sense of 
superiority, bringing with them their pets, leopards and cats and dogs, 
and playing with them during lesson-times. Idlers and loungers came 
into the schools and palaistrai, as they came into the market-booths, to 
chatter and look on, seriously interrupting the work. The school- 
masters and paidotribai at Athens were, in fact, too dependent upon 
their public to take a strong line, and, in spite of their power, often 
exercised, of inflicting corporal punishment, they seem to have been 
distinctly at the mercy of the pupils and their friends. The paidago- 
goi too, though they seem to have kept their pupils in order, were often 
not the right people to control a boy’s conduct; they were apt to have 
a villainous accent, and still more villainous habits. It must be con- 
fessed that the Athenians, in their dtsire to make education cheap, ran 
a very great risk of spoiling what in their opinion was its chief object, 
the training of character. . . . 
It was the sense of duty to the State, the resolution to promote the 
happiness of the whole citizen-body, which made parents willing to 
undergo any sacrifice in order to have their sons educated in the way 
which would best minister to this ideal. The bills of the masters of 
letters and music and of the paidotribai, and the lengthy loss of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  10 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
son’s services in the shop or on the farm in Attica, the break-up of 
family life at Sparta, must have been a sore trial to the parents and have 
involved many sacrifices. Yet there is no trace of grumbling. The 
Hellene felt that it was quite as much his duty to the State to educate 
her future citizens properly as it was to be ready to die in her cause, 
and he did both ungrudgingly. If the laws which made the teaching of 
letters compulsory at Athens fell into desuetude, it was only because 
the citizens needed no compulsion to make them do their duty. Nor 
had the State to pay the school bills; for every citizen, however poor, 
was ready to make the necessary sacrifices of personal luxuries and 
amusements in order to do his duty by having his children properly 
taught. The State only interfered to make schooling as cheap and as 
easy to obtain as possible. 
6. Athenian Education summarized V 
(Thucydides, book 11, { 40) 
An excellent summary of the higher aims and accomplishments 
of Athenian education, at its best, is given by Phucydides (471- 
4oo B.c.), the Athenian historian, when he puts into the mouth 
of Pericles the following words: 
“Tf, then, we prefer to meet danger with a light heart but without 
laborious training, and with a courage which is gained by habit and 
not enforced by law, are we not greatly the gainers? Since we do not 
anticipate the pain, although, when the hour comes, we can be as 
rave as those who never allow themselves to rest; and thus, too, our 
city is equally admirable in peace and in war. For we are lovers of the 
beautiful, yet simple in our tastes, and we cultivate the mind without 
oss of manliness. Wealth we employ, not for talk and ostentation, 
ut when there is real use for it. To avow poverty with us is no dis- 
grace; the true disgrace is in doing nothing-to avoid it. An Athenian 
citizen does not neglect the state because he takes care of his own 
household; and even those of us who are engaged in business have a very 
fair idea of politics. We alone regard a man who takes no interest in 
public affairs, not as a harmless, but as a useless character; and if few 
of us are originators, we are all sound judges of a policy. The great 
impediment to action is, in our opinion, not discussion, but the want of 
that knowledge which is gained by discussion preparatory to action. 
For we have a peculiar power of thinking before we act and of acting 
00, whereas other men are courageous from ignorance but hesitate 
upon reflection. And they are surely to be esteemed the bravest 
spirits who, having the clearest sense both of the pains and pleasures of 
life, do not on that account shrink from danger.”  
-P-A-G-E-37
  CHAPTER II 
LATER GREEK EDUCATION 
Tue Readings in this chapter deal with Greek education and 
Greek educational influence in the period following the Persian 
Wars. The long-standing menace of Persian domination had 
been ended, and little democratic Attica, as well as Greece as a 
whole, was now free to develop according to its ability and native 
genius. In Attica a wonderful development took place almost at 
once, and Athens soon became the first city in the world in the 
arts of peace. The picture of Athens at the height of the Golden 
Age of Greece given by Wilkins (7) reveals something of her 
marvelous achievements in art and literature. 
Such a development, together with the great expansion of Greek 
life and commerce and political relationships throughout the east- 
ern Mediterranean world, naturally subjected the old education of 
the Ephebic class to serious strain, and remodeling had to take 
place. In the absence of any state educational system, all kinds 
of teachers opened schools of the newer type, offering to train for 
public speaking and eloquence and often making extravagant 
claims as to what they could accomplish. In time these new 
teachers organized and reduced their work to system, Isocrates 
being a leader in this work. In the selection given from his ora- 
tion against these new-type teachers (8) we get some conception 
as to their pretensions, and also of his ideas as to the necessities 
for such training. 
With the breakdown of the old training as a basis for developing 
virtue in the State, and the rise of the new teachers aiming to 
train for personal success without any basis of morality underly- 
ing their work, Athens faced a serious educational crisis. This 
Socrates attempted to solve by founding morality on personal 
knowledge as to right and wrong. His practice, well illustrated 
by the long dialogues in The Republic of Plato, which see, and by 
the selection given (9), was to lead men to correct ideas by asking 
them questions, and by a questioning method to draw men from

right, he claimed, would be followed by doing the right. That 
such a sharp questioner would not be popular anywhere is easily 
understood, and the task of reforming education on a new philo- 
sophical and ethical basis naturally proved too large for any one 
man.

7. Athens in the Time of Pericles 
(Wilkins, A. S., National Education in Greece in the Fourih Century B.C. 
London, 1873; selected) 
A brilliant picture of Athens in the days of her greatest glory — 
the Golden Age of Greece. The many non-school educational 
forces of the city are here well set forth. 
But above all things the Athenian of the time of Pericles was living 
in an atmosphere of unequalled genius and culture. He took his way 
past the temples where the friezes of Phidias seemed to breathe and 
struggle, under the-shadow of the colennades reared by the craft of 
Ictinus or Callicrates and glowing with the hues of Polygnotus, to the 
agora where, like his Aryan forefathers by the shores of the Caspian, 
or his Teutonic cousins in the forests of Germany, he was to take his 
part as a free man in fixing the fortunes of his country. There he 
would listen, with the eagerness of one who knew that all he held most 
dear was trembling in the balance, to the pregnant eloquence of Peri- 
cles. Or, in later times, he would measure the sober prudence of Nicias 
against the boisterous turbulence of Cleon, or the daring brilliance of 
Alcibiades. Then, as the great Dionysia came round once more with 
the spring-time, and the sea was open again for traffic, and from every 
quarter of Hellas the strangers flocked for pleasure or business, he 
would take his place betimes in the theater of Dionysus, and gaze from 
sunrise to sunset on the successive tragedies in which Sophocles, and 
Euripides, and Ion of Chios, were contending for the prize of poetry. 
Or, at the lesser festivals, he would listen to the wonderful comedies of 
Eupolis, Aristophanes, or the old Cratinus, with their rollicking fun 
and snatches of sweetest melody, their savage attacks on personal 
enemies and merry jeers at well-known cowards or wantons, and, un- 
derlying all, their weighty allusions and earnest political purpose. As 
he passed through the market-place, or looked in at one of the wres- 
tling schools, he may have chanced to come upon a group of men in 
eager conversation, or hanging with breathless interest on the words of 
 
-P-A-G-E-39

one of their number; and he may have found himself listening to an 
harangue of Gorgias, or to a fragment of the unsparing dialectic of 
Socrates. What could books do more for a man who was receiving 
such an education as this? It was what the student gazed on, what he 
heard, what he caught by the magic of sympathy, not what he read, 
which was the education furnished by Athens. Not by her discipline, 
like Sparta and Rome, but by the unfailing charm of her gracious in- 
fluence, did Athens train her children. 
  8. The Instruction of the Sophists 
(Isocrates, Against the Sophists; selected) 
Isocrates (436-338 B.c.), was an Athenian orator and rhetori- 
cian, who was educated in the schools of the Sophists Prodicus, 
Protagoras, and Gorgias. In 390 B.c., 
after a period as an advocate, he opened 
a school of his own, and organized the 
work of the preceding Sophists into what 
were afterwards known as the schools of 
Rhetoric. In his speech, Against the Soph- 
ists, written in this same year, he attacks 
those who attract pupils by low fees and 
big promises, and sets forth the principles 
underlying what he proposed to do in his 
school —a ‘school which sgon became 
famous throughout the Greek-speaking 
world. F TGs 2. 
Tf all those who undertake instruction, IsocraTEs (436-338 B.C.) 
would speak the truth, nor make greater 
promises than they can perform, they would not be accused by the 
illiterate. Now, those who inconsiderately have dared to boast, have 
been the cause that those men seem to have reasoned better, who 
indulge their indolence, than such as study philosophy: for, first, 
who would not detest and despise those who pass their time in soph- 
istic chicanery? who pretend, indeed, that they seek truth, but, from 
the beginning of their premises, labour to speak falsities; for I think 
it manifest to all, that the faculty of foreknowing future things is 
above our nature: nay, we are so far from such prudence, that Homer, 
who, for his wisdom, has acquired the highest fame, has sometimes 
introduced gods in his poem, consulting about futurity; not that he 
knew the nature of their minds, but that he would show to us, that this 
was one of those things which are impossible for man. These men are 
arrived at that pitch of insolence, that they endeavour to persuade the

younger, that, if they will be their disciples, they shall know what is 
best to be done, and thereby be made happy; and, after they have 
erected themselves into teachers of such sublime things, they are not 
ashamed to ask of them four or five minz;! though did they sell any 
other possession for much less than its value, they would not hesitate 
to grant themselves mad. But now exposing to sale all virtue and 
happiness (if we will believe them), they dare argue, that, as being 
wise men, they ought to be the preceptors of others; yet they say, in- 
deed, that they are not indigent of money, while, to diminish its idea, 
they call it pitiful gold and silver; though they require a trifling gain, 
and only promise to make those next to immortal, who will commence 
their disciples. . . . 
When therefore some of the unlearned, considering all these things, 
see those who profess teaching wisdom and happiness, indigent 
themselves of many things, requiring a small sum of their scholars, and 
observing contradictions in silly sentences, though they see them not 
in actions; professing likewise, that they know futurity, yet not capable 
of speaking or deliberating properly of things present; and that those 
are more consistent with themselves, and do more things right who 
follow common opinions, than those who say they are possessed of 
wisdom: when they see this, I say, they think such disputations mere 
trifles, a loss of time in idle things, and not a real improvement of the 
human mind. 
Nor is it just to blame these men only, but those likewise who profess 
to teach civil science to the citizens; for they also disregard truth; and 
think it artful, if they draw as many as possible, by the smallness of the 
recompense, and the greatness of their promises, and so receive some- 
thing of them: and they are so stupid, and imagine others so, that 
though they write orations more inaccurate than some who are un- 
learned speak extempore, yet they promise they will make their dis- 
ciples such orators, that they shall omit nothing in the nature of 
things; nay, that they will teach them eloquence, like grammar; not 
considering the nature of each, but thinking, that on account of the 
excellence of their promises, they will be admired, and the study of 
eloquence seem of higher value; not knowing, that arts render not 
those famous who insolently boast of them, but those who can find 
out and express whatever is in them... . Since I am advanced so 
far, I will speak more clearly of this topic; I say, then, it is no diffi- 
cult matter to learn those forms or orders of things, by which we 
know how to compose orations, if any one puts himself under the 
care not of such as easily vaunt themselves, but such as have the 
real science; but, in regard of what relates to particular things, which 
we must first see, and mix together, and dispose in order, and, besides,

not lose opportunities, but vary the whole discourse with arguments, 
and conclude it in a harmonious and musical manner: these things, 
Tsay, require great care, and are the province of a manly and wise 
mind; and the scholar must, besides his having necessary ingenuity, 
perfectly instruct himself in the different kinds of orations, and be 
exercised in the practice: but it becomes the master to explain all 
these as accurately as possible, so as to omit nothing which may be 
taught. As for the rest, show himself such an example, that they 
who can imitate and express it, may be able to speak in a more 
beautiful and elegant manner than others. In whatever regard any 
thing of what I have mentioned is wanting, it must follow, that his 
disciples will be less perfect. 
g. An Example of Socrates’ Teaching 
(Xenophon, Memorabilia, book rv, chap. 11) 
  The following selection offers a good example of the work of 
Socrates (470-399 B.C.) in counteracting the teaching of his time, 
and in showing to those about hin that 
there is a common morality and ‘intelli- 
gence which guides the right acts of men, 
and that the reason that all do not see 
and follow the right is that they do not 
think carefully. The youth, Euthydemus, 
aspired to become a statesman and a 
ruler. Socrates, after first winning his 
confidence, finally sought him out one 
day and engaged him in conversation, 
as follows: 
“Tell me, Euthydemus, have you really, as aa 
Thear, collected many of the writings of the Socrates (470-399 B.C.) 
men who are said to have been wise?” “I \ : 
have indeed, Socrates,” replied he, “and I am still collecting, intending 
to persevere until I get as many as I possibly can.” “By Juno,” rejoined 
Socrates, “I feel admiration for you, because you have not preferred 
acquiring treasures of silver and gold rather than of wisdom; for it is 
plain that you consider that silver and gold are unable to make men 
better, but that the thoughts of wise men enrich their possessors with 
virtue.” Euthydemus was delighted to hear this commendation, be- 
lieving that he was thought by Socrates to have sought wisdom in the 
right course. Socrates, observing that he was gratified with the praise, 
said, “And in what particular art do you wish to become skilful, that 
you collect these writings?” 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
  16 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
As Euthydemus continued silent, considering what reply he should 
make, Socrates again asked, “Do you wish to become a physician? 
for there are many writings of physicians.” ‘Not I, by Jupiter,” 
replied Euthydemus. ‘Do you wish to become an architect, then? for 
a man of knowledge is needed in that art also.” ‘‘No, indeed,” an- 
swered he. ‘Do you wish to become a good geometrician, like Theo- 
dorus?” “Nor a geometrician either,” said he. “Do you wish, then, 
to become an astronomer?” said Socrates. As Euthydemus said ‘‘No”’ 
to this, “Do you wish, then,” added Socrates, “to become a rhap- 
sodist, for they say that you are in possession of all the poems of 
Homer?” “No, indeed,” said he, “for I know that the rhapsodists, 
though eminently knowing in all the poems of Homer, are, as men, 
extremely foolish.” ‘‘You are perhaps desirous, then,” proceeded 
Socrates, “of attaining that talent by which men become skilled in 
governing states, in managing households, able to command, and quali- 
fied to benefit other men as well as themselves.” “TI indeed greatly 
desire,” said he, “Socrates, to acquire that talent.” “By Jupiter,” 
returned Socrates, “you aspire to a most honorable accomplishment, 
and a most exalted art, for it is the art of kings, and is called the royal 
art. But,” added he, “have you ever considered whether it is possible 
for a man who is not just to be eminent in that art?” “TI have cer- 
tainly,” replied he; “and it is not possible for a man to be even a good 
citizen without justice.’ “Have you yourself, then, made yourself 
master of that virtue?” “I think,” said he, “Socrates, that I shall be 
found not less just than any other man.” “Are there, then, works of 
just men, as there are works of artisans?” ‘There are, doubtless,” 
replied he. “Then,” said Socrates, “as artisans are able to show their 
works, would not just men be able also to tell their works?” “And 
why should not I,” asked Euthydemus, “‘be able to tell the works of 
justice; as also, indeed, those of injustice; for we may see and hear of 
no small number of them evety day?” 
“Are you willing, then,” said Socrates, “that we should make a 
delta on this side, and an alpha on that, and then that we should put 
whatever seems to us to be a work of justice under the delta, and what- 
ever seems to be a work of injustice under the alpha?” “Tf you think 
that we need those letters,” said Euthydemus, ‘make them.” Soc- 
rates, having made the letters as he proposed, asked, “ Does falsehood 
then exist among mankind?” “It does, assuredly,” replied he. “Un- 
der which head shall we place it?” ‘Under injustice, certainly.” 
“Does deceit also exist?” “Unquestionably.” “Under which head 
shall we place that?” “‘ Evidently under injustice.” ‘Does mischiev- 
ousness exist?”? “Undoubtedly.” ‘And the enslaving of men?” 
“That, too, prevails.” ‘And shall neither of these things be placed by 
us under justice, Euthydemus?” “It would be strange if they should 
be,” said he. “But,” said Socrates, “ if a man being chosen to lead an
-P-A-G-E-43
Te

army, should reduce to slavery an unjust and hostile people, should we 
say that he committed an injustice?” “No, certainly,” replied he. 
“Should we not rather say that he acted justly?” ‘“Indisputably.” 
“And if in the course of the war with them he should practice deceit? ” 
“That also would be just,” said he. “‘ And if he should steal and carry 
off their property, would he not do what was just?” ‘‘Certainly,” 
said Euthydemus; “ but I thought at first that you asked these ques- 
tions only with reference to our friends.” “Then,” said Socrates, “all 
that we have placed under the head of injustice, we must also place 
under that of justice?” ‘‘It seems so,” replied Euthydemus. “Do 
you agree, then,” continued Socrates, “that, having so placed them, we 
should make a new distinction, that it is just to do such things with 
regard to enemies, but unjust to do them with regard to friends, and 
that toward his friends our general should be as guileless as possible?” 
“By all means,” replied Euthydemus. “ Well, then,” said Socrates, “if 
a general, seeing his army dispirited, should tell them, inventing a 
falsehood, that auxiliaries were coming, and should, by that invention, 
check the despondency of his troops, under which head should we place 
such an act of deceit?” “It appears to me,” said Euthydemus, “that 
we must place it under justice.” “And if a father, when his son re- 
quires medicine, and refuses to take it, should deceive him, and give 
him the medicine as ordinary food, and, by adopting such deception, 
should restore him to health, under which head must we place such an 
act of deceit?” “It appears to me that we must put it under the same 
head.” “And if a person, when his friend was in despondency, should, 
through fear that he might kill himself, steal or take away his sword, or 
any other weapon, under which head must we place that act?” “That, 
assuredly, we must place under justice.” ‘‘You say, then,” said Soc- 
rates, “that not even toward our friends must we act on all occasions 
without deceit?” ‘We must not, indeed,” said he, “for I retract what 
I said before, if I may be permitted to do so.” “It is indeed much 
better that you should be permitted,” said Socrates, ‘‘than that you 
should not place actions on the right side. But of those who deceive 
their friends in order to injure them (that we may not leave even this 
point unconsidered) which of the two is the more unjust, he who does so 
intentionally or he who does so involuntarily?” “Indeed, Socrates,” 
said Euthydemus, “I no longer put confidence in the answers which I 
give; for all that I said before appears to me now to be quite different 
from what I then thought; however, let me venture to say that he who 
deceives intentionally is more unjust than he who deceives involun-

“Do you know any persons called slave-like?”. “Ido.” “Whether 
for their knowledge or their ignorance?” “For: their ignorance, cer- 
tainly.” “Is it, then, for their ignorance of working in brass that they 
receive this appellation?” “Not atall.” “Is it for their ignorance  
-P-A-G-E-44

in the art of building?” “Nor for that.” “Or for their ignorance of 
shoemaking?” ‘Not on any of these accounts; for the contrary is the 
case, as most of those who know such trades are servile.’ “Is it, then, 
an appellation of those who are ignorant of what is honorable, and 
good, and just?” “It appears so to me.” “It, therefore, becomes us 
to exert ourselves in every way to avoid being like slaves.” “But, by 
the gods, Socrates,” rejoined Euthydemus, “ I firmly believed that I was 
pursuing that course of study by which I should, as I expected, be made 
fully acquainted with all that was proper to be known by a man striv- 
ing after honor and virtue; but now, how dispirited must you think I 
feel, when I see that, with all my previous labor, I am not even able to 
answer about what I ought most of all to know, and am acquainted 
with no other course which I may pursue to become better!” 
  to. The Schools of Alexandria 
(Draper, J. W., History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, vol. 1, pp. 187-92. 
New York, 1876) 
An interesting description of the Alexandrian learning at its 
best is given in the following selection. 
. A great state institution was founded at Alexandria. It became 
celebrated as the Museum. To it, as a centre, philosophers from all 
parts of the world converged. It is said that one time not less than 
fourteen thousand students were assembled there. Alexandria, in 
confirmation of the prophetic foresight of the great soldier who founded 
it, quickly became an immense metropolis, abounding in mercantile 
and manufacturing activity. As is ever the case with such cities, its 
higher classes were prodigal and dissipated, its lower only to be held in 
restraint by armed force. Its public amusements were such as might 
be expected — theatrical shows, music, horse-racing. In the solitude 
of such a crowd, or in the noise of such dissipation, any one could find a 
retreat — atheists who had been banished from Athens, devotees from 
the Ganges, monotheistic Jews, blasphemers from Asia Minor. . . . 
The Alexandrian Museum soon assumed the character of a Univer- 
sity. In it those great libraries were collected, the pride and boast of 
antiquity. Demetrius Phalareus was instructed to collect all the writ- 
ings in the world. So] powerfully were the exertions of himself and his 
successors. enforced by the government that two immense libraries 
were procured. They contained 700,000 volumes. In this literary 
and scientific retreat, supported-in ease and even in luxury — luxury, 
for allusions to sumptuous dinners have descended to our times — the 
philosophers spent their time in-mental culture by study, or mutual 
improvement by debates. The king himself conferred appointments to 
these positions; in later times, the Roman emperors succeeded to the 
patronage, the government thereby binding in golden chains intellect
-P-A-G-E-45
enn

that might otherwise have proved troublesome. . . .. A botanical gar- 
den, in connection with the Museum, offered an opportunity to those 
who were interested in the study of the nature of plants; a zodlogical 
menagerie afforded like facilities to those interested in animals. . . An 
anatomical school [was added], suitably provided with means for the 
dissection of the human body, this anatomical school being the basis of 
a medical college for the education of physicians. For the astronomers 
Ptolemy Euergetes placed in the Square Porch an equinoctial anda 
solstitial armil, the graduated limbs of these instruments being divided 
into degrees and sixths. There were in the observatory stone quadrants, 
the precursors of our mural quadrants. On the floor a meridian line 
was drawn for the adjustment of the instruments. There were also 
astrolabes and dioptras. Thus, side by side, almost in the king’s 
palace, were noble provisions for the cultivation of exact science and 
for the pursuit of light literature. Under the same roof were gathered 
together geometers, astronomers, chemists, mechanicians, engineers. 
There were also poets, who ministered to the literary wants of the dis- 
sipated city — authors who could write verse, not only in correct 
metre, but in all kinds of fantastic forms — trees, hearts, and eggs. 
Here met together the literary dandy and the grim theologian. . . . 
. .. The Museum made an impression upon the intellectual career of 
Europe so powerful and enduring that we still enjoy its results. That 
impression was twofold, theological and physical. The dialectical 
spirit and literary culture diffused among the Alexandrians prepared 
that people, beyond all others, for: the reception of Christianity. . . . 
But it was not alone as regards theology that Alexandria exerted & 
power on subsequent ages; her influence was as strongly marked in the 
impression it gave to science. Astronomical observatories, chemical 
laboratories, libraries, dissecting-houses, were not in vain. There 
went forth from them a spirit powerful enough to tincture all future 
times. Nothing like the Alexandrian Museum was ever called into 
existence in Greece or Rome, even in their palmiest days. It is the 
unique and noble memorial of the dynasty of the Ptolemies, who have 
thereby laid the whole human race under obligations, and vindicated 
their title to be regarded as a most illustrious line of-kings. The Mu- 
seum was, in truth, an attempt at the organization of human knowl- 
edge, both for its development and its diffusion. It was conceived and 
executed in a practical manner worthy of Alexander. ‘And though, in 
the night through which Europe has been passing —a night full of 
dreams and delusions — men have not entertained a right estimate of 
the spirit in which that great institution was founded, and the work it 
accomplished, its glories being eclipsed by darker and more unworthy 
things, the time is approaching when its action on the course of human 
events will be better understood, and its influences on European civili- 
zation more clearly discerned.

Thus, then, about the beginning of the third century before Christ, 
in consequence of the Macedonian campaign, which had brought the 
Greeks into contact with the ancient civilization of Asia, a great degree 
of intellectual activity was manifested in Egypt. On the site of the 
village of Rhacotis, once held as an Egyptian post to prevent the in- 
gress of strangers, the Macedonians erected that city which was to be 
the entrepdt of the commerce of the East and West, and to transmit an 
illustrious name to the latest generations. Her long career of commer- 
cial prosperity, her commanding position as respects the material 
interests of the world, justified the statesmanship of her founder, and 
the intellectual glory which has gathered round her has given an en- 
during lustre to his name. 
11. What We Owe to the Greeks 
(Butcher, S. H., Some Aspects of the Greek Genius, Essay I. London, 1891) 
In the first Essay in the above-cited volume, entitled “‘What 
We Owe to Greece,” Professor Butcher gives a very interesting 
picture of the Greek contribution to the life of the modern world. 
From it the following selections have been taken. 
The Greeks, before any other people of antiquity, possessed the love 
of knowledge for its own sake. To see things as they really are, to 
discern their meanings and adjust their relations, was with them an 
instinct anda passion. ‘Their methods in science and philosophy might 
be very faulty, and their conclusions often absurd, but they had that 
féarlessness of intellect which is the first condition of seeing truly. 
Poets and philosophers alike looked with unflinching eyes on all that 
met them, on man and the world, on life and death. They interrogated 
Nature, and sought to wrest her secret from her, without misgiving 
and without afterthought. Greece, first smitten with the passion for 
truth, had the courage to put faith in reason, and in following its 
guidance to take no count of consequences. . . . 
At the moment when Greece first comes into the main current of the 
world’s history, we find a quickened and stirring sense of personality, 
and a free play of intellect and imagination. The oppressive silence 
with which Nature and her unexplained forces had brooded over man 
is broken. Not that the Greek temper is irreverent, or strips the uni- 
verse of mystery. The mystery is still there and felt, and has left 
many undertones of sadness in the bright and heroic records of Greece; 
but the sense of mystery has not yet become mysticism. ... Greek 
thinkers are not afraid that they may be guilty of prying into the hid- 
den things of the gods. They hold frank companionship with thoughts 
that had paralysed Eastern nations into dumbness or inactivity, and 
in their clear gaze there is no ignoble terror. Inroads, indeed, there 
were at times from the East of strange gods and fanatical rites; and 
 
-P-A-G-E-47

half-lit spaces always remained in which forms of faith or ritual, lower 
as well as higher than the popular creed, took shelter; but, on the 
whole, we are henceforth in an upper and a serener air in which man’s 
spiritual and intellectual freedom is assured. . . . 
It was the privilege of the Greeks to discover the sovereign efficacy 
of reason. They entered on the pursuit of knowledge with a sure and 
joyous instinct. Baffled and puzzled they might be, but they never 
grew weary of the quest. The speculative faculty which reached its 
height in Plato and Aristotle, was, when we make due allowance for 
time and circumstance, scarcely less eminent in the Ionian. philoso- 
phers; and it was Ionia that gave birth to an idea, which was foreign to 
the East, but has become the starting-point of modern science — the 
idea that Nature works by fixed laws... . . The early poet-philosophers 
of Ionia gave the impulse which has carried the human intellect for- 
ward across the line which separates empirical from scientific knowl- 
edge; and the Greek precocity of mind in this direction, unlike that of 
the Orientals, had in it the promise of uninterrupted advance in the 
future — of great discoveries in mathematics, geometry, experimental 
physics, in medicine also and physiology. . . . 
Again, the Greeks set themselves to discover a rational basis for 
conduct. Rigorously they brought their actions to the test of reason, 
and that not only by the mouth of philosophers, but through their 
poets, historians, and orators. Thinking and doing, “the spirit of 
counsel and might” — clear thought and noble action — did not to 
the Greek mind stand opposed. . . . 
The East did not attempt to reconcile the claims of the state and the 
individual. The pliant genius of Greece first made the effort. In 
Greece first the idea of the public good, of the free devotion of the citi- 
zen to the state, of government in the interests of the governed, of the 
rights of the individual, took shape. The problem of the relation be- 
tween the state and the individual was, indeed, very imperfectly solved 
in Greece. The demands, for instance, of the state were pitched-too 
high, and implied a virtue almost heroic in its members. Even in 
Athens, where individual liberty was: most regarded, certain urgent 
public needs were supplied mainly by the precarious method of private 
generosity instead of by state organisation. But though the Greeks 
may not have solved the political problem, they saw that there was a 
problem to solve, and set about it rationally ; and they were the first to 
do so. They were gifted with a power, péculiarly Western, of delicate 
adjustment, of combining principles apparently opposite, of harmo- 
nising conflicting claims; they possessed a sense of measure} a flexibility, 
a faculty of compromise, opposed to the,fatal simplicity with which 
Eastern politics had been stricken. Not tyranny, not anarchy, satis- 
fied the Greek, hut ordered liberty. . . . 
This brief sketch may serve to indicate the qualities most distinctive

of the Greek genius —+the-love-of knowledge, the love of—rational 
beauty, the-love-of freedom. In their first contact with the East — 
with Egypt and Assyria — during the period known.as the Greco- 
Pheenician period of art, the Greeks had a trying ordeal to pass through. 
They came out of it, as we have seen, in a characteristic fashion. 
1. Their political instinct was alien to Assyrian despotism. 
2. Their lay instinct rose up against Egyptian priestcraft. 
3. Their instinct for beauty and reason combined rejected in both 
arts —in Assyrian and Egyptian alike — what was monstrous and 
lifeless. 
4. Their instinct for knowledge, their curiosity, their cosmopolitan- 
ism, led them to adopt the foreign technique, and to absorb all that 
was fruitful in the foreigners’ ideas. They borrowed from every source, 
but all that they borrowed they made their own. The Phcenicians, it 
has been said, taught the Greeks writing, but it was the-Greeks who 
wrote. In every department the principle holds good. They stamped 
their genius upon each imported product, which was to them but the 
raw material of their art. . . . Such, briefly, is our debt to Greece. And 
when we speak of Greece we think first of Athens. . . . 
To Greece, then, we owe the love of Science, the love of Art, the love 
of Freedom: not Science alone, Art alone, or Freedom alone, but these 
vitally correlated with one another and brought into organic union. 
And in this union we recognise the distinctive features of the West. 
The Greek genius is the European genius in its first and brightest 
bloom. From a vivifying contact with the Greek spirit Europe de- 
rived that new and mighty impulse which we call Progress. . . . 
From Greece came that first mighty impulse whose far-off workings 
are felt by us to-day, and which has brought it about that progress has 
been accepted as the law and goal of human endeavour. Greece first 
took up the task of equipping man with all that fits him for civil life 
and promotes his secular well-being; of unfolding and expanding every 
inborn faculty and energy, bodily and mental; of striving restlessly 
after the perfection of the whole, and finding in this effort after an 
unattainable ideal that by which man becomes like to the gods. . . .

  CHAPTER III 
THE EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME 
TuE Readings in this chapter trace the education of a Roman boy 
from the earlier times, when the training given was simple and 
very practical, through the change in national ideals to the later 
period, when oratory had become the chief aim of Roman educa- 
tional effort. 
The principal early schoolbook was the Laws of the Twelve 
Tables. These have been lost in their original form, but the di- 
gest (12) gives an idea as to their nature, while Cicero tells us (13) 
of their importance in the education of youth. The Roman farm- 
er’s calendar (14) shows the farmer’s duties and sacrifices, and 
from it one gets some idea of the simple rural life of the early 
Romans. The extracts from Polybius (15) and Mommsen (16) 
give us good pictures of the Roman citizen of the old school. The 
epitaph for a Roman matron (17) describes briefly the education 
of a girl in this same earlier period. 
After Rome had expanded and had come to embrace all the 
Italian peninsula, and the State was being brought into increasing 
contact with the Hellenic world to the eastward, the need became 
manifest for a more extended education and a broader culture 
than the old education had afforded. Within two centuries the 
transition was accomplished, and the old educational training 
had been superseded by new types of schooling.’ At first Hel- 
lenic schools were set up, and the Hellenic school system was 
adopted at Rome; later a Roman modification of these schools 
was worked out; as better adapted to Roman life and more expres- 
sive of Roman character. That the change was resisted by the 
older and more conservative members of Roman society might 
naturally be supposed. Not only was much written against the 
new and in praise of the old education, of which the extracts from 
Marcus Aurelius (18) and Tacitus (19) were among the more 
temperate, but it was even attempted to prohibit the introduction 
of Greek teachers and schools by official edicts (20 a—b). Horace 
(22) gives a good picture of the solicitude of his father, in the tran- 
sition period, to secure the best teachers of the time for his son.

24 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The position of a schoolmaster at Rome, as in Greece, was that 
of a menial, and Martial (23 a~b) gives no very attractive picture 
of a Roman primary school. Teaching, unenlivened by any ideas 
as to psychological procedure, was one long grind. Both the 
teacher and the boy hada hard time. The difficulties a boy faced 
in learning to read Latin, as had been the case with the Greek boy 
as well, are shown in the page reproduced from’Vergil (21). Cic- 
ero (24) and Quintilian (25) set forth the aim of the new educa- 
tion as finally evolved — oratory. Though the position of the 
primary teacher always remained low, the teachers in the higher 
schools, under the later Empire, came to occupy an important 
social position, as is shown by the grant of privileges to physicians 
and teachers by Constantine (26). 
The Roman system of instruction as finally evolved spread to 
all the provincial cities, and passed over to the Middle Ages as the 
basis for the Christian schools which later arose in the cathedral 
cities. The Seven Liberal Arts of the Middle Ages were a direct 
descendant of the instruction in the Roman secondary schools. 
12. The Laws of the Twelve Tables 
What the laws of Moses were to the early Hebrews, the laws of 
~Lycurgus to Sparta, the laws-of Solon_and the Homeric poems to 
Attica, the Laws of the Twelve Tables were to the early Romans. 
These were adopted in 431 and 450 B.c., being in part a codifica- 
tion of previous practices, and made in part as a concession to the 
plebes. The first ten were adopted in 451, and the last two in 450. 
For several centuries these Laws formed the basis of instruction in 
reading and writing, and every boy was expected to know them 
and be able to explain their meaning. They express both the 
spirit and the ideals of the old life and education at Rome. 
The following is an analysis of their contents, as reconstructed 
by scholars, the originals being lost.

13. Importance of the Twelve Tables in Education 
(Cicero, De Oratore, book 1, chap. XLIV) 
Cicero, in his book on education for oratory, gives the following 
comment on the importance of a knowledge of the Laws of the 
Twelve Tables for those who would understand Roman law and 
~_ institutions. De Oratore was written in 55 B.C. 
Though all the world exclaim against me, I will say what I think: 
that single little book of the Twelve Tables, if any one look at the 
fountains and sources of laws, seems to me, assuredly, to surpass the 
libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in 
plenitude of utility. And if our country has our love, as it ought to 
have in the highest degree, — our country, I say, of which the force 
and natural attraction is so strong, that one of the wisest of mankind 
preferred his Ithaca, fixed, like a little nest, among the roughest of 
rocks, to immortality itself, — with what affection ought we to be 
warmed toward such a country as ours, which, preéminently above all 
other countries, is the seat of virtue, empire, and dignity? Its spirit, 
customs, and discipline ought to be our first objects of study, both 
because our country is the parent of us all, and because as much wisdom. 
must be thought to have been employed in framing such laws, as in 
establishing so vast and powerful an empire. You will receive also 
this pleasure and delight from the study of the law, that you will then 
most readily comprehend how fapgur ancestors excelled other nations

in wisdom, if you compare our laws with those of their Lycurgus, 
Draco, and Solon. It is indeed incredible how undigested and almost 
ridiculous is all civil law, except our own; on which subject I am accus- 
tomed to say much in my daily conversation, when I am praising the 
wisdom of our countrymen above that of all other men, and especially 
of the Greeks. For these reasons have I declared, Sceevola, that the 
knowledge of the civil law is indispensable to those who would become 
accomplished orators.

gi (Polybius, book 1, chap. 37) 
The following extract, taken from the historical writings of the 
Greek Polybius, who lived between 204 and 122 (?) B.c., and who 
spent much time in Rome, is a good description of the Roman 
point of view. 
But it is a peculiarity of the Roman people as a whole to treat every- 
thing as a question of strength; to consider that they must of course 
accomplish whatever they have proposed to themselves; and that 
nothing is impossible that they have once determined upon. The 
result of such self-confidence is that in many things they do succeed, 
while in some few they conspicuously fail, and especially at sea. On 
land it is against men only and their works that they have to direct 
their efforts: and as the forces against which they exert their strength
-P-A-G-E-53

do not differ intrinsically from their own, as a general rule they suc- 
ceed; while their failures are exceptional and rare. 
16. The Grave and Severe Character of the Life of the Earlier 
Roman 
(Mommsen, C. M. T., History of Rome, vol. 1, pp. 4, 8) 
The following passage from the German historian Mommsen 
gives a good picture of the life of a Roman citizen under the Re- 
public. 
Life in the case of the Roman was spent under conditions of austere 
restraint, and the nobler he was the less was he a freeman. All-power- 
ful custom restricted him to a narrow range of thought and action; and 
to have led a serious and strict life, or, to use a Latin expression, a 
grave and severe life, was his glory. Nothing more or less was expected 
of him than that he should keep his household in good order, and un- 
flinchingly bear his part of counsel and action in public affairs. But 
while the individual had neither the wish nor the power to be aught 
else than a member of the community, the glory and the might of that 
community were felt by every individual burgess as a personal posses- 
sion to be transmitted along with his name and his homestead to pos- 
terity; and thus, as one generation after another was laid in the tomb 
and each in succession added its fresh contribution to the stock of 
ancient honours, the collective sense of dignity in the noble families of 
Rome swelled into that mighty pride of Roman citizenship to which the 
earth has never, perhaps, witnessed a parallel, and the traces of which 
— strange as they are grand — seem to us whenever we meet them to 
belong, as it were, to another world. It was one of the characteristic 
peculiarities of this mighty pride of citizenship that, while not-sup- 
pressed, it was yet compelled by the rigid simplicity and equality that 
prevailed among the citizens to remain locked up in the breast during 
life, and was only allowed to find expression after death; but it was 
displayed in the funeral of the man of distinction so intensely and so 
conspicuously that this ceremonial is better fitted than any other phe- 
nomenon of Roman life to give us who live in other times a glimpse of 
the wonderful spirit of the Romans. 
17. The Education of Girls 
(An ancient epitaph) 
Women in Rome occupied a position of dignity and importance, 
but their place was in the homie. For this they were carefully _ 
educated by their mothers, though many, in later times, also ob- 
tained some literary training. The following epitaph describes 
the simple history of one worthy matron.

Stranger, my tale is briefly told; 
O stay, and read with care. 
This gloomy tomb contains the bloom 
Of one that once was fair. 
Her name was Claudia. To her lord 
Her heart’s full love she paid. 
Two sons she had, one left on earth 
And one beside her laid. 
Her words were mild, her manners chaste; 
Her home she ruled in peace. 
She plied the distaff and the loom. 
Now go away: I cease. 
18. The Old Roman Education described 
(Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,’The Thoughts, chap. 1; trans: by George Long. 
London, 1873) 
Marcus Aurelius, as he is commonly known, was born ‘in 
121 A.D., and was Emperor of Rome from 161 to 180. In the first 
chapter of his volume, The Thoughts, he has left us a good picture 
of old Roman family education. One sees from it the importance 
of the family life and training. ‘ 
1. From my grandfather Verus [I learned] good morals and the gov- 
ernment of my temper. 
2. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and 
a manly character. 
3. From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only 
from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in 
my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich. 
4. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, 
and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such 
things a man should spend liberally. 
5. From my governor, ...I learned endurance of labour, and to 
want little,and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with 
other people’s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander. 
6. From Diognetus (my tutor), not to busy myself about trifling 
things, and not to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and 
jugglers about incantations and the driving away of demons and such 
things; and not to breed quails (for fighting), nor to give myself up 
passionately to such things; and to endure freedom of speech; and to 
have become intimate with philosophy; and to have been a hearer, first 
of Bacchius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written
-P-A-G-E-55
  EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME 29 
dialogues in my youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and 
whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline. 
7. From Rusticus I received the impression that my character re- 
quired improvement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be 
led astray to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, 
nor to delivering little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as 
a man who practices much discipline, or does benevolent acts in order 
to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine 
writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor 
to do other things of the kind; and to write my letters with simplicity, 
like the letter which Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and 
with respect to those who have offended me with words, or done me 
wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled, as soon as 
they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and to read carefully, and 
not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book; nor hastily 
to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I am indebted to 
him for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he 
communicated to me out of his own collection. 
8. From Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating stead- 
iness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, 
except to reason;... 
9: From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a 
family governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conform- 
ably to nature; .. . 
to. From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, 
and not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous 
or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to in- 
troduce the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the 
way of answer or giving confirmation, or joining in an inquiry about 
the thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion. . . . 
14. From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and 
to love justice; ... and from him I received the idea of a polity in 
which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard 
to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly 
government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed; . . . 
15. From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led 
aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in 
illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and 
dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. . . . 
16. In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable 
resolution in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; 
and no vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a love of 
labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had 
anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness in 
giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived

30 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. 
. .. Lobserved too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliber- 
ation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation 
through being satisfied with appearances which first present them- 
selves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be 
soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be 
satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way 
off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check im- 
mediately popular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful 
over the things which were necessary for the administration of the 
empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to 
endure the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither 
superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts 
or by trying to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed 
sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or 
action, nor love of novelty. . . . There was in him nothing harsh, nor 
implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the 
sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he had abun- 
dance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously 
and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded 
of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those 
things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy 
without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to 
be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and in- 
vincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus. 
17. To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good 
parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen 
and friends, nearly everything good. .. . 
19. The Old and New Education contrasted 
(Tacitus, Dialogue concerning Oratory, chaps. 28, 29, 34, and 35) 
This dialogue, the scene of which is laid in the year 75 A.D., 
contrasts well the old Roman training with that which took its 
place. It will of course be evident that Tacitus was not par- 
ticularly favorable to the newer education. 
28. ... Before I enter on the subject, let me premise a few words on 
the strict discipline of our ancestors, in educating and training up their 
children. In the first place the son of every family was the legitimate 
offspring of a virtuous mother. The infant, as soon as born, was not 
consigned to the mean dwelling of a hireling nurse, but was reared and 
cherished in the bosom of its mother, whose highest praise it was to 
take care of her household affairs, and attend to her children. It was 
customary likewise for each family to choose some elderly relation of
-P-A-G-E-57
  EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME 31 
approved conduct, to whose charge the children were committed. In 
her presence not one indecent word was uttered; nothing was done 
against propriety and good manners. The hours of study and serious 
employment were settled by her direction; and not only so, but even 
the diversions of the children were conducted with modest reserve and 
sanctity of manners. Thus it was that Cornelia, the mother of the 
Gracchi, superintended the education of her illustrious issue. It was 
thus that Aurelia trained up Julius Cesar; and thus Atia formed the 
mind of Augustus. The consequence of this regular’ discipline was, 
that the young mind, whole and sound, and unwarped by irregular 
passions, received the elements of the liberal arts with hearty avidity. 
Whatever was the peculiar bias, whether to the military art, the study 
of the laws, or the profession of eloquence, that engrossed the whole 
attention, that was imbibed thoroughly and totally. 
29. In the present age what is our practice? The infant is committed 
to a Greek chambermaid, and a slave or two, chosen for the purpose, 
generally the worst of the whole household train, and unfit for any 
office of trust. From the idle tales and gross absurdities of these peo- 
ple, the tender and uninstructed mind is suffered to receive its earliest 
impressions. Throughout the house not one servant cares what he 
says or does in the presence of his young master; and, indeed, how 
should it be otherwise? since the parents themselves are so far from 
training their young families to virtue and modesty, that they set 
them the first examples of luxury and licentiousness. Thus our youth 
gradually acquire a confirmed habit of impudence, and a total disre- 
gard of that reverence they owe both to themselves and to others. To 
say truth, it seems as if a fondness for horses, actors, and gladiators, 
the peculiar and distinguishing folly of this our city, was impressed 
upon them even in the womb: and when once a passion of this contemp- 
tible sort has seized and engaged the mind, what opening is there left 
for the noble arts? Who talks of anything else in our houses? If we 
enter the schools, what other subjects of conversation do we hear among 
the boys? The preceptors themselves choose no other topic more 
frequently to entertain their hearers; for it is not by establishing a 
strict discipline, or by giving proofs of their genius, that this order of 
men gain pupils, but by fawning and flattery. Not to mention how ill 
instructed our youth are in the very elements of literature, sufficient 
pains are by no means taken in bringing them acquainted with the best 
authors, or in giving them a proper notion of history, together with a 
knowledge of men and things. The whole that seems to be considered 
in their education is, to find out a person for them called a rhetorician. 
I will presently give you some account of the introduction of this pro- 
fession at Rome, and show you with what contempt it was received by 
our ancestors. ... 
34. The practice of our ancestors was agreeable to this theory. The
-P-A-G-E-58
  32 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
youth who was intended for public declamation, was introduced by 
his father, or some near relation, with all the advantages of home 
discipline and a mind furnished with useful knowledge, to the most 
eminent orator of the time, whom 
thenceforth he attended upon all oc- 
casions; he listened with attention to 
his patron’s pleadings in the tribunals 
of justice, and his public harangues 
before the people; he heard him in 
the warmth of argument; he noted 
his sudden replies; and thus, in the 
field of battle, if I may so express 
myself, he learned the first rudiments 
of rhetorical warfare. The advantages 
of this method are obvious: the young 
candidate gained courage, and im- 
proved his judgment; he studied in 
open day, amidst the heat of the con- 
flict, where nothing weak or idle could be said with impunity; where 
everything absurd was instantly rebuked by the judge, exposed to ridi- 
cule by the adversary, and condemned by the whole body of advocates. 
In this way they imbibed at once the pure and uncorrupted streams of 
genuine eloquence. But though they chiefly attached themselves to 
one particular orator, they heard likewise all the rest of their contem- 
porary pleaders, in many of their respective debates; and they had an 
opportunity of acquainting themselves with the various sentiments of 
the people, and of observing what pleased or disgusted them most in 
the several orators of the forum. Thus they were supplied with an 
instructor of the best and most improving kind, exhibiting, not the 
feigned semblance of Eloquence, but her real and lively manifestation: 
not a pretended, but a genuine adversary, armed in earnest for the 
combat; an audience, ever full and ever new, composed of foes as well 
as friends, and where not a single expression could fall uncensured, or 
unapplauded. . . . 
35. On the other hand, our modern youth are sent’ to the mounte- 
bank schools of certain declaimers called rhetoricians: a set of men who 
made their first appearance in Rome a little before the time of Cicero. 
And that they were by no means approved by our ancestors plainly ap- 
pears from their being enjoined, under the censorship‘ of Crassus and 
Domitius, to shut up their schools of impudence, as Cicero expresses it. 
But I was going to say, our youths are sent to certain academies, where 
it is hard to determine whether the place, the company, or the method 
of instruction is most likely to infect the minds of young people, and 
produce a wrong turn of thought. There can be nothing to inspire 
1 92 A.D.; 662 A.U.C.     Fic. 4. READING A Manuscript
-P-A-G-E-59
EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME 33 
respect in a place where all who enter it are of the same low degree of 
understanding; nor any advantage to be received from their fellow- 
students, where a parcel of boys and raw youths of unripe judgments 
harangue before each other, without the least fear or danger of criti- 
cism. And as for their exercises, they are ridiculous in their very na- 
ture. They consist of two kinds, and are either persuasive or contro- 
versial. The first, as being easier and requiring less skill, is assigned to 
the younger lads; the other is the task of more mature years. But, 
good gods! with what incredible absurdity are they composed! And 
this as a matter of course, for the style of the declamations must needs 
accord with the preposterous nature of the subjects. Thus being 
taught to harangue in a most pompous diction, on the rewards due to 
tyrannicides, on the election to be made by deflowered virgins, on the 
licentiousness of married women, on the ceremonies to be observed in 
time of pestilence, with other topics,! which are daily debated in the 
schools, and scarce ever in the forum; when they come before the real 
judges... 
  20. Attempts to prohibit the Introduction of the Greek Higher 
Learning at Rome 
(Suetonius, Lives of Eminent Rhetoricians, chap. 1) 
The dread of Greek higher learning found frequent expression 
at Rome during the second century B.c. Cato the Elder, who 
died in 148 B.c., labored hard to prevent changes which were 
under way. Suetonius gives us two decrees which were aimed to 
prevent the introduction of rhetorical schools, but which were 
without effect. These are: 
(a) Decree of the Roman Senate, 161 B.c. 
In the consulship of Caius Fannius Strabo, and Marcus Valerius 
Messala: the Preetor Marcus Pomponius moved the Senate, that an act 
be passed respecting Philosophers and Rhetoricians. In this matter, 
they have decreed as follows: ‘It SHALL BE LAWFUL for M. Pomponius, 
the Pretor, to take such measures, and make such provisions, as the 
good of the Republic, and the duty of his office, require, that no Phi- 
losophers or Rhetoricians be suffered at Rome.’ 
(b) Decree of the Censor, 92 B.C. 
Ir Is REPORTED to us that certain persons have instituted a new kind 
of discipline; that our youth resort to their schools; that they have as- 
sumed the title of Latin Rhetoricians; and that young men waste their 
time there for whole days together. Our ancestors have ordained what 
1 These are specimen topics of themes debated in the rhetorical schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  34. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
instruction is fitting their children should receive, and what schools 
they should attend. These novelties, contrary to the customs and in- 
structions of our ancestors, we neither approve, nor do they appear to 
us good. Wherefore it appears to be our duty that we should notify 
our judgment both to those who keep such schools, and those who 
are in the practice of frequenting them, that they meet our disappro- 
bation.

  22. The Education given by a Father 
(Horace, Satires, book 1, 6, lines 65-80) 
The Roman poet Horace, who lived from 65 to 8 B.c., and 
whose father gave him a good education somewhat after the old 
type, and afterwards educated him at Rome and at Athens, leaves 
us this description of the education which he received. 
And yet, if the faults and defects of my nature are moderate ones, 
and with their exception my life is upright (just as if one were to cen- 
sure blemishes found here and there on a handsome body), if no one 
can truly lay to my charge avarice, meanness, or frequenting vicious 
haunts, if (that I may praise myself) my life is pure and innocent, and 
my friends love me, I owe it all to my father; he, though not rich, for 
his farm was a poor one, would not send me to the school of Flavius, to 
which the first youths of the town, the sons of the centurions, the great 
men there, used to go, with their bags and slates on their left arm, tak- 
ing the teacher’s fee on the Ides of eight months in the year; but he had 
the spirit to carry me, when a boy, to Rome, there to learn the liberal 
arts which any knight or senator would have his own sons taught. 
Had any one seen my dress, and the attendant servants, so far as would 
be observed in a populous city, he would have thought that such ex- 
pense was defrayed from an old hereditary estate. He himself was 
ever present, a guardian incorruptible, at all my studies. - 
23. The Ludi Magister 
Martial, a Spaniard, who lived from 43 to 104 A.D., and who 
spent many years in Rome, has left us some fifteen hundred 
Epigrams on Roman life and society. Two of these, which relate 
to the teacher in the primary school, are reproduced below. 
(a) To the Master of a Noisy School 
(Epigrams, book 1x, no. 68) 
What right have you to disturb me, abominable schoolmaster, ob- 
ject abhorred alike by boys and girls? Before the crested cocks have 
broken silence; you begin to roar out your savage scoldings and blows. 
Not with louder noise does the metal resound on the struck anvil, 
when the workman is fitting a lawyer on his horse;! nor is the noise so 
great in the large amphitheater, when the conquering gladiator is ap- 
plauded by his partisans. We, your neighbors, do not ask you to allow 
us to sleep for the whole night, for it is but a small matter to be occa- 
sionally awakened; but to be kept awake all night is a heavy affliction. 
Dismiss your scholars, brawler, and take as much for keeping quiet as 
you receive for making a noise. 
1 A sneer at the equestrian statues of lawyers.

  EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME 37. 
(b) To a Schoolmaster 
(Epigrams, book x, no. 62) 
Schoolmaster, be indulgent to your simple scholars; if you would 
have many a long-haired youth resort to your lectures, and the class 
seated round your critical table love you. So may no.teacher of arith- 
metic, or of swift writing, be surrounded by a greater ring of pupils. 
The days are bright, and glow under the flaming constellation of the 
Lion, and fervid July is ripening the teeming harvest. Let the Scyth- 
ian scourge with its formidable thongs, such as flogged Marsyas of 
Celenz, and the terrible cane, the schoolmaster’s sceptre, be laid 
aside, and sleep until the Ides of October.1_ In summer, if boys pre- 
serve their health, they do enough. 
24. Oratory the Aim of Education 
(Cicero, De Oratore, book 1) 
Cicero, whose De Oratore was published in 55 B.c., presents a, 
good description of the orator as the then ideal of Roman higher 
education, and describes the training nec- 
essary as viewed by the most successful 
orator of the time. The following selec- 
tions illustrate this ideal. 
IV. ... For when our empire over all na- 
tions was established, and after a period of 
peace had secured tranquillity, there was 
scarcely a youth ambitious of praise who did 
not think that he must strive, with all his , 
endeavors, to attain the art of speaking. Fora { 
time, indeed, as being ignorant of all method, 
and as thinking there was no course of exer- 
cise for them, or any precepts of art, they 
attained what they could by the single force 
of genius and thought. But afterwards, hav-  Fy¢, 6, M. Tutus 
ing heard the Greek orators, and gained an — CicERo (106-43 B.C.) 
acquaintance with Greek literature, and pro- 
cured instructors, our countrymen were inflamed with an incredible 
passion for eloquence. The magnitude, the variety, the multitude 
of all kinds of causes, excited them to such a degree, that to that 
learning which each had acquired by his individual study, frequent 
practice, which was superior to the precepts of all masters, was at once 
added. There were then, as there are also now, the highest induce- 
ments offered for the cultivation of this study, in regard to public 
  1 The usual time for the opening of the school term.
-P-A-G-E-64
38 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
favor, wealth, and dignity. The abilities of our countrymen (as we 
may judge from many particulars, far excelled those of the men of 
every other nation. For which reasons, who would not justly wonder 
that in the records of all ages, times, and states, so small a number of 
orators should be found? 
But the art of eloquence is something greater, and collected from 
more sciences and studies, than people imagine. V. For who can sup- 
pose that, amid the greatest multitude of students, the utmost abun- 
dance of masters, the most eminent geniuses among men, the infinite 
variety of causes, the most ample rewards offered to eloquence, there 
is any other reason to be found for the small number of orators than 
the incredible magnitude and difficulty of the art? A knowledge of a 
vast number of things is necessary, without which volubility of words 
is empty and ridiculous; speech itself is to be formed, not merely by 
choice, but by careful construction of words; and all the emotions of 
the mind, which nature has given to man, must be intimately known; 
for all the force and art of speaking must be employed in allaying or 
exciting the feelings of those who listen. To this must be added a cer- 
tain portion of grace and wit, learning worthy of a well-bred man, and 
quickness and brevity in replying as well as attacking, accompanied 
with a refined decorum and urbanity. Besides, the whole of antiquity 
and a multitude of examples is to be kept in the memory; nor is the 
knowledge of laws in general, or of the civil law in particular, to be 
neglected. 
25. On Oratory 
(Quintilian, Institutes of Oratory, Preface, and book u, chaps. xvi and xvm) 
The following extract gives Quintilian’s estimate of the impor- 
tance of oratory in the life of a Roman. 
Preface: 9. We are to form, then, the perfect orator, who cannot 
exist unless as a good man; and we require in him, therefore, not only 
consummate ability in speaking, but every excellence of mind. 
1o. For I cannot admit that the principles of moral and honourable 
conduct are, as some have thought, to be left to the philosophers; since 
the man who can duly sustain his character as a citizen, who is quali- 
fied for the management of public and private affairs, and who can _ 
govern communities by his counsels, settle them by means of laws, and 
improve them by judicial enactments, can certainly be nothing else 
but an orator. 11. Although I acknowledge, therefore, that I shall 
adopt some precepts which are contained in the writings of the philoso- 
phers, yet I shall maintain, with justice and truth, that they belong to 
my subject, and have a peculiar relation to the art of oratory. 12. If 
we have constantly occasion to discourse of justice, fortitude, temper- 
ance, and other similar topics, so that a cause can scarce be found in 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
EDUCATION AND WORK OF ROME 39 
which some such discussion does not occur, and if all such subjects are 
to be illustrated by invention and elocution, can it be doubted that, 
wherever power of intellect and copiousness of language are required, 
the art of the orator is to be there preéminently exerted? . . . 
Book IT. Chap. xvt: 17. Even to men, to whom speech has been 
denied, of how little avail is divine reason! If, therefore, we have re- 
ceived from the gods nothing more valuable than speech, what can we 
consider more deserving of cultivation and exercise? or in what can we 
more strongly desire to be superior to other men, than in that by which 
man himself is superior to other animals, especially as in no kind of exer- 
tion does labour more plentifully bring its reward? 18. This will be so 
much the more evident, if we reflect from what origin, and to what ex- 
tent, the art of eloquence has advanced, and how far it may still be im- 
oved. 19. For, not to mention how beneficial it is, and how becom- 
ing in a man of virtue, to defend his friends, to direct a senate or people 
f by his counsels, or to lead an army to whatever enterprise he may de- 
sire, is it not extremely honourable to attain, by the common under- 
standing and words which all men use, so high a degree of esteem and 
lory as to appear not to speak or plead, but, as was the case with Peri- 
dles, to hurl forth lightning and thunder? 
  26. Privileges granted to Physicians and Teachers by Constantine 
(Code, book 10, 53, 6; trans. by Norton) 
The following grant of immunities and privileges to physicians 
and teachers in the higher schools of the time was made by Con- 
stantine, in 333 A.D. The grant is very interesting as forming a 
precedent and a type for the many grants of immunity and privi- 
lege made later on to priests and monks and university scholars. 
(See especially Readings 38 and 51.) 
Tue EmMpreror CONSTANTINE, AUGUSTUS, TO THE PEOPLE: 
We direct that physicians, and chiefly imperial physicians, and ex- 
imperial physicians, grammarians and other professors of letters, to- 
gether with their wives and sons, and whatever property they possess 
in their own cities, be immune from all payment of taxes and from all 
civil or public duties, and that in the provinces they shall not have 
strangers quartered on them, or perform any official duties, or be 
brought into court, or be subject to legal process, or suffer injustice; 
and if any one harass them he shall be punished at the discretion of the 
Judge. We also command that their salaries and fees be paid, so that 
they may more readily instruct many in liberal studies and the above 
mentioned Arts. Proclaimed on the fifth day before the Kalends of 
October (September 27) at Constantinople, in the Consulship of Dal- 
matius and Zenophilas.

CHAPTER IV 
THE RISE AND CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY ~ 
  Tue Readings in this chapter deal with the rise and victory of 
Christianity, its challenge to all that for which Rome had stood, 
the ensuing persecutions of the Christians, the final triumph, the 
rejection of pagan learning by the Fathers of the Western branch 
of the new Church, the meager educational system developed for 
those assuming membership and for those desiring solitude, and 
the perfection of the administrative organization of the early 
Church. : 
The educational maxims selected from The Talmud (27) reveal 
the importance given to the position of teacher among the Hebrew 
people after their return from captivity. Saint Paul, in his Epis- 
tle (28), states the message he carried to the Romans while the 
picture he gives of life in intellectual Athens (29) is an interesting 
one. The extracts from Minucius Felix and Tertullian (30 a-b), 
Pliny and Trajan (31 a-b), Tertullian (32), Eusebius (33), Work- 
man (34), and Kingsley (35) show well Christianity and paganism 
in conflict — a conflict which could not end in compromise. Un- 
willing to be absorbed by Roman society on any other than exclu- 
sive terms, the Christians freely gave up their lives rather than 
perform the simplest rite of the old pagan worship. The extracts 
from Pliny (31 a) and Workman (34) are interesting as showing the 
tests used to determine loyalty to the State. The final victory of 
the Christian faith is seen in the Edict of Toleration of Galerius 
(36), and the two extracts from the Theodosian Code decreeing 
the Christian faith (37) and granting privileges and immunities 
to the clergy (38). The analogy of the latter to the similar grant 
to Roman physicians and teachers (26) is interesting. 
To train the new Christian members in the essentials of their 
faith some form of instruction was early found necessary, and a 
growing need for some unity of faith also manifested itself. The 
first was met by the establishment of catechumenal instruction in 
the churches, which is well described by the extracts from the 
Apostolic Constitutions (39) and Leach (40), while the second was 
answered by the first formulation of belief, in 325 a.p., in the
-P-A-G-E-67
  CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY 41 
Nicene Creed (42). The extract from the Apostolic Constitu- 
tions, ordering Christians to confine their readings to the sacred 
writings and to abstain from heathen books (41), is interesting as 
illustrating the reaction of the Western Church Fathers against all 
pagan learning which they gradually came to regard as a robbery 
from God. The Eastern branch of the Church, fortunately, was 
much more tolerant. 
To those who wished to withdraw still further from pagan 
society and worldly life, and to live a life of holy seclusion in small 
groups and in out-of-the-way places, the Church developed mo- 
nasticism, with monasteries for men and nunneries for women. 
The most famous of the monasteries were those whose members 
followed the rule of life instituted by Saint Benedict, and who 
were known as Benedictines. Three extracts from Benedict’s Rule 
are given (43) to show the debt of posterity to this order. The 
selection from Archbishop Lanfranc (44), enforcing the Benedic- 
tine rule requiring reading and study, is typical of many similar 
orders issued during the Dark Ages by the Church or monastic au- 
thorities. The letter of Saint Jerome on the education of girls (45) 
reveals well the extreme reaction of Christianity to all pagan life. 
The three great contributions of ancient society to modern 
civilization — those of Greece, Rome, and Christianity — had 
now been made, and had been more or less fused together into a 
great religious organization. This faced a stormy future. Dur- 
ing the dark period of the Middle Ages the onslaughts of bar- 
barians from the north tested all its strength to keep civilization 
from extinction. That it was able to do so was in part the result 
of the peculiar character of its faith, and in part due to the strong 
administrative organization which it evolved based on that of the 
Roman State. 
27. Educational Maxims from the Talmud 
The Talmud is a collection of writings of the Rabbins or scribes 
of the people, written between 70 B.c. and 500 A.D., and consists of 
interpretations of “the Law andthe Prophets” for the guidance 
and instruction of the people. Most Jews regard the Talmud as 
second in importance only to the Old Testament: The following 
extracts reveal the great emphasis placed by the Rabbins on the 
proper training of children.

4 Jerusalem was destroyed because her instructors were not re-

5 If both the father and the teacher are threatened with any mate- 
rial loss, the latter should be protected first. 
6 As soon as the child begins to speak the father should teach him to 
say in Hebrew, “The law which Moses commanded us is the 
heritage of the congregation of Jacob,” and, ‘Hear, O Israel, 
the Eternal our God is one God.” 
7 The teacher should strive to make the lesson agreeable to the pu- 
pils by clear reasons, as well as by frequent repetitions, until 
they thoroughly understand the matter and are able to recite it 
with great fluency. 
8 No man can acquire a proper knowledge of the Law unless he en- 
deavors to fix the same in his memory by certain marks and 
signs. 
9 Let the honor of the pupil be as dear to thee as thine own. 
10 He who gives instruction to an unworthy pupil will suffer for the 
consequences thereof. - 
11 The study of the Law is very important because it leads to good 
actions. He whose good actions exceed his wisdom, his wisdom 
shall endure. 
12 Just as a man is bound to have his son instructed in the Law, so 
also should he have his son taught some handicraft or profes- 
sion. Whosoever does not teach his son a handicraft teaches 
him to be a thief. 
13 One learns much from his teachers, more from his school-fellows, 
but most of all from his pupils. 
14 The instruction of children should not be interrupted, even for the 
purpose of building a Holy Temple. 
15 Only those pupils should be punished in whom the master sees 
that there are good capacities for learning, and who are inat- 
tentive; but if they are dull and cannot learn they should not be 
punished. Punish with one hand and caress with two. 
28. Saint Paul to the Romans 
(Romans, I, 1-17) 
In this extract from the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ro- 
mans, Paul states his mission to the Roman people and what it ‘is

Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated 
unto the gospel of God, 
2. (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scrip- 
tures,) 
3. Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the 
seed of David according to the flesh; 
4. And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the 
spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 
5. By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience 
to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
6. Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: 
7. Toall that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace 
to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your 
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel 
of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my 
prayers; 
to. Making request, if by any means now at length I might have 
a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. 
ir. For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual 
gift, to the end ye may be established; 
12. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mu- 
tual faith both of you and me. 
13. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes 
I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have 
some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 
14. Iam debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to 
the wise, and to the unwise. 
15. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you 
that are at Rome also. 
16. For Iam not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power 
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and 
also to the Greek.

faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 
29. Saint Paul to the Athenians 
(Acts xv, 16-23) 
The following quotation from The Acts shows Saint Paul in 
Athens, and gives somewhat of a picture of the kind of intellectual 
life found there in the first century, A.D. 
16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred 
in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

17. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with 
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with 
him. 
18. Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, 
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other 
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he 
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. 
1g. And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, 
May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? 
20. For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would 
know therefore what these things mean. 
21. (For all the Athenians, and strangers which were there, spent 
their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.) 
22. Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of 
Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. 
23. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar 
with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore 
ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. 
30. The Crimes of the Christians 
The Roman and Christian points of view as to the nature of the 
Christian worship and loyalty to the emperor are well set forth 
in the two following extracts; the first from the Roman writer 
Minucius Felix’s Octavius, and the second from Tertullian’s 
Apology. 
(a) The Roman Point of View 
I purposely pass over many things, for those that I have mentioned 
are already too many; and that all these, or the greater part of them, 
are true, the obscurity of their vile religion declares. For why do they 
endeavor with such pains to conceal and to cloak whatever they wor- 
ship, since honorable things always rejoice in publicity, while crimes 
are kept secret? Why have they no altars, no temples, no acknowl- 
edged images? Why do they never speak openly, never congregate 
freely, unless for the reason that what they adore and conceal is either 
worthy of punishment, or something to be ashamed of? . . . 
(b) The Christian Point of View 
ro. “You do not worship the gods,” you say; “and you do not offer 
sacrifice to the Emperors.’”’ Well, we do not offer sacrifice for others, 
for the same reason that we do not for ourselves, namely, that your 
gods are not at all the objects of our worship. So we are accused of 
sacrilege and treason. .. .
-P-A-G-E-71
  CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY 45 
32. There is also another and a greater necessity for our offering 
prayer in behalf of the Emperors, nay, for the complete stability of the 
Empire, and for Roman interests in general. For we know that a 
mighty shock is impending over the whole earth —in fact, the very 
end of all things threatening dreadful woes is only retarded by the con- 
tinued existence of the Roman Empire. We have no desire, then, to 
be overtaken by these dire events; and in praying that their coming 
may be delayed, we are lending our aid to Rome’s duration. . . . 
33. But why dwell longer on the reverence and sacred respect of 
Christians to the Emperor, whom we cannot but look up to as called 
by our Lord in his office? so that on valid grounds I might say Cesar is 
more ours than yours; for our God has appointed him. Therefore, as 
having this property in him, I do more than you for his welfare, not 
merely because I ask it of Him who can give it, nor because I ask it as 
one who deserves to get it, but also because, in keeping the majesty of 
Cesar within due limits, and putting it under the Most High, and mak- 
ing it less than divine, I commend him the more to the favor of the 
Deity, to whom alone I make him inferior. But I place him in sub- 
jection to one I regard as more glorious than himself. Never will I 
call the Emperor God... . 
35. This is the reason, then, why Christians are counted public ene- 
mies: that they pay no vain, nor false, nor foolish honors to the Em- 
peror; that, as men believing in the true religion, they prefer to cele- 
brate their festal days with a good conscience, instead of with common 
wantonness. .. . 
31. The Persecution of the Christians as Disloyal Citizens of the 
Roman Empire 
(Pliny, Letters, book x, letters 96 and 97) 
Pliny the Younger (62-113 A.D.), a distinguished Roman Sena- 
tor and man of letters, was appointed governor of Bithynia, a prov- 
ince lying along the central southern coast of the Black Sea, in 
Asia Minor, by the Emperor Trajan, about 112 A.D. The follow- 
ing letter from Pliny to the Emperor asking for instructions as to 
how to deal with the disloyal Christians, and Trajan’s reply, are 
of special value as displaying both the tolerant attitude of the 
Roman government toward their religion as such, and the pecu- 
liar difficulties met in dealing with them. 
(a) Pliny to Trajan 
It is my custom, my Lord, to refer to you all things concerning 
which I am in doubt. For who can better guide my indecision or 
enlighten my ignorance?

  46 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
I have never taken part in the trials of Christians: hence I do not 
know for what crime nor to what extent it is customary to punish or 
investigate. I have been in no little doubt as to whether any dis- 
crimination is made for age, or whether the treatment of the weakest 
does not differ from that of the stronger; whether pardon is granted in 
case of repentance, or whether he who has ever been a Christian gains 
nothing by having ceased to be one; whether the name itself without 
the proof of crimes, or the crimes, inseparably connected with the 
name, are punished. Meanwhile, I have followed this procedure in the 
case of those who have been brought before me as Christians. I asked 
them whether they were Christians a second and a third time and with 
threats of punishment; I questioned those who confessed; I ordered 
those who were obstinate to be executed. For I did not doubt that, 
whatever it was that they confessed, their stubbornness and inflexible 
obstinacy ought certainly to be punished. 
There were others of similar madness, whom, because they were 
Roman citizens, I have noted for sending to the City. Soon, the crime 
spreading, as is usual when attention is called to it, more cases arose. 
An anonymous accusation containing many names was ‘presented. 
Those who denied that they were or had been Christians, ought, I 
thought, to be dismissed, since they repeated after me a prayer to the 
gods and made supplication with incense and wine to your image, 
which I had ordered to be brought for the purpose together with the 
statues of the gods, and since besides they cursed Christ, not one of 
which things, they say, those who are really Christians can be com- 
pelled to do. 
Others, accused by the informer, said that they were Christians and 
afterwards denied it; in fact they had been but had ceased to be, some 
many years ago, some even twenty years before. All both worshipped 
your image, and cursed Christ. They continued to maintain that this 
was the amount of their fault or error, that on a fixed day they were 
accustomed to come together before daylight and to sing by turns a 
hymn to Christ as a god, and that they bound themselves by oath, not 
for some crime, but that they would not commit robbery, theft, or 
adultery, that they would not betray a trust nor deny a deposit when 
called upon. After this it was their custom to disperse and to come 
together again to partake of food, of an ordinary and harmless kind, 
however; even this they had ceased to do after the publication of my 
edict in which according to your command I had forbidden associa- 
tions. 
Hence I believed it the more necessary to examine two female 
slaves, who were called deaconesses, in order to find out what was 
true, and to do it by torture. I found nothing but a vicious, extrava- 
gant suspicion. Consequently I have postponed the examination and 
make haste to consult you. For it seemed to me that the subject
-P-A-G-E-73

would justify consultation, especially on account of the number of 
those in peril. For many of all ages, of every rank, and even of both 
sexes are and will be called into danger. : 
The infection of this superstition has not only spread to the cities, 
but even to the villages and country districts. It seems possible to 
stay it and bring about a reform. It is plain enough that the temples, 
which had been almost deserted, have begun to be frequented again, 
that the sacred rights, which had been neglected for a long time, have 
begun to be restored, and that fodder for victims, for which till now 
there was scarcely a purchaser, is sold. From which one may readily 
judge what a number of men can be reclaimed if repentance is per- 
mitted. 
(b) Trajan’s Reply 
You have followed the correct procedure, my Secundus, in conduct- 
ing the cases of those who were accused before you as Christians, for 
no general rule can be laid down as a set form. They ought not to be 
sought out; if they are brought before you and convicted, they ought 
to be punished, provided that he who denies that he is a Christian, and 
proves this by making supplication to our gods, however much he may 
have been under suspicion in the past, shall secure pardon on repent- 
ance. In the case of no crime should attention be paid to anonymous 
charges, for they afford a bad precedent and are not worthy of our age. 
  32. Effect of the Persecutions 
(Tertullian, Apology, chap. 50) 
The early Christian spirit is shown in the following extract from 
Tertullian (c. 150-230 A.D.), one of the Fathers of the Western 
Church. His A pology is an important work on the relations of the 
Christians and the imperial government. 
Nor does your cruelty, however exquisite, avail you; it is rather a 
temptation to us. The oftener we are mown down by you, the more 
in number we grow; the blood of Christians is seed. Many of your 
writers exhort to the courageous bearing of pain and death, as Cicero 
in Tusculans, as Seneca in his Chances, as Diogenes, Pyrrhus, Callini- 
cus; and yet their words do not find as many disciples as Christians do, 
teachers not by words, but by their deeds. That very obstinacy you 
rail against is the preceptress. For who that contemplates it, is not 
excited to inquire what is at the bottom of it? who, after inquiry, does 
not embrace our doctrines? and when he has embraced them, desires 
not to suffer that he may become partaker of the fulness of God’s 
grace, that he may obtain from God complete forgiveness, by giving in 
exchange his blood? For that secures the remission of all offences.

  33. Edicts of Diocletian against the Christians 
(Eusebius, P., Church History, book vt, chaps. 2, 6) 
The following descriptions of the edicts of Diocletian, 303 A.D., 
are from the early Church historian, Eusebius Pamphili, who was 
Bishop of Cesarea from 314 to his death, about 340 A.D. 
2, This was the nineteenth year of the reign of Diocletian, in Dys- 
trus (which the Romans call March), when the feast of the Saviour’s 
passion was near at hand, and royal edicts were published everywhere, 
commanding that the churches should be razed to the ground, the 
Scriptures destroyed by fire, those who held positions of honor de- 
graded, and the household servants, if they persisted in the Christian 
profession, be deprived of their liberty. : 
And such was the first decree against us. But issuing other decrees 
not long after, the Emperor commanded that all the rulers of the 
churches in every place should be first put in prison and afterwards 
compelled by every device to offer sacrifice. 
6. Then as the first decrees were followed by others commanding 
that those in prison should be set free, if they would offer sacrifice, but 
that those who refused should be tormented with countless tortures; 
who could again at that time count the multitude of martyrs through- 
out each province, and especially throughout Africa and among the 
race of the Moors, in Thebais and throughout Egypt, from which hay- 
ing already gone into other cities and provinces, they became illustri- 
ous in their martyrdoms! 
34. Certificate of having sacrificed to the Pagan Gods 
(Quoted from Workman, H. B., Persecutions in the Early Church, p. 340. 
London, 1906) 
The following certificate, issued in Egypt during the persecu- 
tions of Decius, in 250 a.p., comes from an old papyrus, found in 
1893. It was issued in a small village in Egypt, and shows how 
suspected Christians were forced to clear themselves of suspicion 
by sacrificing publicly to the old gods. 
To the Commissioners of Sacrifice in the Village of Alexander’s Island: 
from Aurelius Diogenes, the son of Satabus, of the Village of Alexander’s 
Island, aged 72 years: — scar on his right eyebrow. 
I have always sacrificed regularly to the gods, and now, in your 
presence, in accordance with the edict, I have done sacrifice, and 
poured the drink offering, and tasted of the sacrifices, and I request 
you to certify the same. Farewell.

35. The Empire and Christianity in Conflict 
(Kingsley, Chas., Introduction to Hypatia; selected) 
The Reverend Charles Kingsley (1819-75), an English writer, 
in the Introduction to his historical novel Hypatia, gives a good 
picture of the conflict between the Empire and the Christian 
Church, and the final victory of the latter, from which the follow- 
ing selection has been taken. 
For somewhat more than four hundred years the Roman Empire 
and the Christian Church, born into the world almost at the same 
moment, had been developing themselves side by side as two great 
rival powers, in deadly struggle for the possession of the human race. 
The weapons of the Empire had been not merely an overwhelming 
physical force, and a ruthless lust of aggressive conquest: but, even 
more powerful still, an unequalled genius for organization, and an uni- 
form system of external law and order. This was generally a real boon 
to conquered nations, because it substituted a fixed and regular spolia- 
tion for the fortuitous and arbitrary miseries of savage warfare: but it 
arrayed, meanwhile, on the side of the Empire the wealthier citizens of 
every province, by allowing them their share in the plunder of the la- 
boring classes beneath them. These, in the country districts, were ut- 
terly enslaved; while in the cities, nominal freedom was of little use to 
masses kept from starvation by the alms of the government, and 
drugged into brutish good-humor by a vast system of public spectacles, 
in which the realms of nature and of art were ransacked to glut the 
wonder, lust, and ferocity of a degraded population. 
Against this vast organization the Church had been fighting for now 
four hundred years, armed only with its own mighty and all-embracing 
message, and with the manifestation of a spirit of purity and virtue, of 
love and self-sacrifice, which had proved itself mightier to melt and 
weld together the hearts of men than all the force and terror, all the 
mechanical organization, all the sensual baits with which the Empire 
had been contending against that Gospel in which it had recognized 
instinctively, and at first sight, its internecine foe. 
And now the Church had conquered. The weak things of this 
world had confounded the strong. In spite of the devilish cruelties of 
persecutors; in spite of the contaminating atmosphere of sin which 
surrounded her; in spite of having to form herself, not out of a race of  
-P-A-G-E-76
  50 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
pure and separate creatures, but by a most literal “new birth” out of 
those very fallen masses who insulted and persecuted her; in spite of 
having to endure within herself continual outbursts of the evil passions 
in which her members had once indulged without check; in spite of a 
thousand counterfeits which sprung up around her and within her, 
claiming to be parts of her, and alluring men to themselves by that 
very exclusiveness and party arrogance which disproved their claim; 
in spite of all she had conquered. The very emperors had arrayed 
themselves on her side. Julian’s last attempt to restore paganism by 
imperial influences had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold 
upon the hearts of the masses; at his death the great tide wave of new 
opinion rolled on unchecked, and the rulers of the earth were fain to 
swim with the stream; to accept, in words at least, the Church’s law as 
theirs; to acknowledge a King of kings to whom even they owed hom- 
age and obedience; and to call their own slaves their “poorer breth- 
ren,” and often, too, their “spiritual superiors.” 
But if the emperors had become Christian, the Empire had not. 
Here and there an abuse was lopped off; or an edict was passed for the 
visitation of prisons and for the welfare of prisoners; or a Theodosius 
was recalled to justice and humanity for a while by the stern rebukes of 
an Ambrose. But the Empire was still the same: still a great tyranny, 
enslaving the masses; crushing national life; fattening itself and its 
officials on a system of world-wide robbery; and, while it was para- 
mount, there could be no hope for the human race. 
36. The Edict of Toleration by Galerius 
(Lactantius, On the Death of the Persecutors, chaps. 34, 35) 
Lactantius was a teacher of rhetoric at Nicomedia, and later 
was appointed tutor to one of Constantine’s sons. He wrote a 
history of Christianity from Nero to Galerius, from which this 
edict is taken. 
34. Among other arrangements which we are always accustomed to 
make for the prosperity and welfare of the Republic, we had desired 
formerly to bring all things into harmony with the ancient laws and 
public order of the Romans, and to provide that even the Christians 
who had left the religion of their fathers should come back to reason; 
since, indeed, the Christians themselves, for some reason, had followed 
such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not 
obey the institutes of antiquity, which perchance their own ancestors 
had first established; but at their own will and pleasure, they would 
thus make laws unto themselves which they should observe, and would 
collect various peoples in divers places in congregations. Finally, 
when our law had been promulgated to the effect that they should con-
-P-A-G-E-77
  CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY 51 
form to the institutes of antiquity, many were subdued by the fear of 
danger, many even suffered death. And yet since most of them perse- 
vered in their determination, and we saw that they neither paid the 
reverence and awe due to the gods nor worshipped the God of the 
Christians, in view of our most mild clemency and the constant habit 
by which we are accustomed to grant indulgence to all, we thought 
that we ought to grant our most prompt indulgence also to these, so 
that they may again be Christians and may hold their conventicles, 
provided that they do nothing contrary to good order. But we shall 
tell the magistrates in another letter what they ought to do. 
Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God 
for our safety, for that of the Republic, and for their own, that the 
Republic may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be 
able to live securely in their homes. 
35. This edict is published at Nicomedia on the day before the Ka- 
lends of May, in our eighth consulship and the second of Maximus. 
37. The Faith of Catholic Christians 
(Theodosian Code) 
‘In 438 a collection of Roman laws was issued under the title of 
Codex Theodosianus. One of these laws, dated 380, shows how 
completely the Christian belief had come to dominate the Roman 
State. 
We desire that all those who are under the sway of our clemency 
shall adhere to that religion which, according to his own testimony, 
coming down even to our own day, the blessed apostle Peter delivered 
to the Romans, namely, the doctrine which the pontiff Damasus 
(Bishop of Rome) and Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic 
sanctity, accept. According to the teachings of the apostles and of 
the Gospel we believe in one Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy 
Ghost, the blessed Trinity, alike in majesty. 
We ordain that the name of Catholic Christians shall apply to all 
those who obey this present law. All others we judge to be mad and 
demented; we declare them guilty of the infamy of holding heretical doc- 
trine; their assemblies shall not receive the name of churches. They 
shall first suffer the wrath of God, then the punishment in accordance 
with divine judgment we shall inflict. 
38. Privileges and Immunities granted the Clergy 
(Theodosian Code)

Roman laws made in 438 A.D. The following grants of privileges 
and immunities made to the clergy show still further the hold of
-P-A-G-E-78
ee 
52 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the Church organization on the Roman State. Compare these 
privileges with those previously granted (R. 26) to physicians and 
surgeons. 
319 A.D. Those who exercise the functions of divine worship, that 
is to say those who are called clerics (clerici), shall be exempt from all 
public burdens, lest otherwise they might be called away from their 
sacred duties through some one’s malicious interference. 
349 A.D. From public burdens and from every disquietude of civil 
office all clerics shall be free, and their sons shall continue in the Church 
if they are not subject to public responsibilities. 
377 A.D. We decree that all priests, deacons, subdeacons, exorcists, 
lectors, and doorkeepers, likewise all who are in higher orders, shall 
be free from personal taxes. 
361 A.D. In every city, in every town, hamlet, and burg, whoever, 
according to the spirit of the Christian law, shall have sincerely striven 
to bring home to all its supreme and peculiar merits shall enjoy per- 
manent protection. We should rejoice and be exceeding glad in the 
faith, knowing that our empire is maintained more by religion than by 
officials or by the labor and sweat of the body. 
412 A.D. It is right that clerics, whether they be bishops, priests, 
deacons, or those of lower rank, ministers of the Christian law, should 
be accused only before a bishop — unless there is some reason why the 
case should be considered elsewhere. 
39. How the Catechumens are to be instructed 
(From the A postolic Constitutions) 
This extract gives a good idea of the early Catechumenal in- 
struction. 
Let him, therefore, who is to be taught the truth in regard to piety 
be instructed before his baptism in the knowledge of the unbegotten 
God, in the understanding his only begotten Son, in the assured ac- 
knowledgement of the Holy Ghost. Let him learn the order of the 
several parts of the creation, the series of providence, the different 
dispensations of the laws. Let him be instructed how the world was 
made, and why man was appointed to be a citizen therein; let him also 
know his own nature, of what sort it is; let him be taught how God 
punished the wicked with water and fire, and did glorify the saints in 
every generation —I mean Seth, and Enos, and Enoch, and Noah, 
and Abraham and his posterity, and Melchizedek, and Job, and Moses, 
and Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas the priest, and those that were 
holy in every generation; and how God still took care of and did not 
reject mankind, but called them from their error and vanity to the 
acknowledgement of the truth at various seasons, reducing them from
-P-A-G-E-79
  CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY 53 
bondage and impiety unto liberty and piety, from injustice to righteous- 
ness, from death eternal to everlasting life. Let him that offers himself 
to baptism learn these and the like things during the time that he is a 
catechumen; and let him who lays his hands upon him adore God, the 
Lord of the whole world, and thank him for his creation, for his sending 
Christ his only begotten Son, that he might save man by blotting out 
his transgressions, and that he might remit ungedliness and sins, and 
might “purify him from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,” and sanctify 
man according to the good pleasure of his kindness, that he might in- 
spire him with the knowledge of his will, and enlighten the eyes of his 
heart to consider of his wonderful works, and make known to him the 
judgments of righteousness, that so he might hate every way of iniquity, 
and walk in the way of truth, that he might be thought worthy of the 
laver of regeneration, to the adoption of sons, which is in Christ, that 
“being planted together in the likeness of the death of Christ,” in hopes 
of a glorious communication, he may be mortified to sin, and may live 
to God, as to his mind, and word, and deed, and may be numbered to- 
gether in the book of the living. And after this thanksgiving, let him 
instruct him in the doctrines concerning our Lord’s incarnation, and in 
those concerning his passion, and resurrection from the dead, ‘and as- 
sumption. 
40. Catechumenal Schools of the Early Church 
(Leach, A. F., The Schools of Medieval England, p. 8. London, 1915) 
The following description of catechumenal instruction, by one 
of the foremost authorities on early education, gives a good picture 
of the nature and the work of these schools. 
Catechetical schools, so called, were nothing more than courses of lec- 
tures to catechumens, who, whether they were new converts or long- 
standing Christians, were grown-up people being prepared for baptism 
by catechesis, that is oral instruction, in the principles of the Christian 
faith. In the first three centuries of the Christian Church no one 
dreamt of baptizing infants. To do so would have seemed not so much 
profane, though it would have been that, as preposterous. Baptism 
was the supreme rite, the admission to the highest grade in the Christian 
gild, not as now the first initiation into it. Tertullian, writing in the 
third century on Baptism, exhorts the faithful to get over the business 
of marriage and founding families before they incur the awful respon- 
sibilities of baptism, a regeneration, a new birth of the soul, which was 
freed from all sin thereby, a “baptism of repentance.”’ He asks, re- 
ferring to the proposal made by some that children of three or four 
years old — no one had suggested new-born babies — should be bap- 
tized, why should the age of innocence be in a hurry to get its sins 
remitted? A century and a half later, when Augustine, at the age of 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
a eee amar a eal eae a) 
54 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
fourteen, clamoured to be baptized, his mother told him to wait until 
he was older and had a deeper sense of responsibility. To be baptized 
was to be illuminated, and a passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews had 
given rise to, or perhaps rather expressed, the current belief that mor- 
tal sin committed after baptism could not be forgiven. “ For as touch- 
ing those who once have been illuminated ... but then have fallen 
away it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance.” The age 
of thirty, the traditional age at which Christ was baptized, was re- 
garded as the normal age for baptism, but many put it off to their 
death-beds, and then risked being unable to receive it because through 
physical or mental weakness they were unable to repeat or understand 
the formulas. 
Catechumens therefore were grown persons being informed or in- 
structed in the mysteries of Christianity, translated by the Latin 
audientes, hearing or audience. 
There are two sets of early catechetical lectures extant. The fa- 
mous Didache or Teaching of the Apostles, now recognized as being a 
guide to catechists, is simply an exposition of the doctrines and services 
of the Church, a theological treatise. The Catechetical Lectures of 
Cyril of Alexandria, Bishop of Jerusalem, delivered in 347, are eighteen 
homilies or expository sermons, addressed to grown-up congregations. 
The title of the first is ‘To those to be enlightened,” the ilaminandi. 
The second is on the necessity for “ Repentance and remission of sins,” 
and the third expounds that “Baptism gives remission.” The last 
thirteen go steadily through the Creed, expounding and explaining the 
meaning and importance of its articles. There is not a word in them to 
suggest that this catechist is educating the young. Chiefly he is argu- 
ing against the heathen as a missionary nowadays might in preaching 
to Hindoos, Brahmins, or Chinese sages. 
41. Christians should abstain from all Heathen Books 
q (From the A postolic Constitutions) 
The Apostolic Constitutions, compiled at various times before 
the early part of the fourth century, was intended as a manual of 
instruction in conduct and worship for the use of the clergy and 
the educated laity, and gives a good idea of ecclesiastical usages 
and of the attitude of the Church as it had developed up to the 
time of its final victory in the reign of Constantine. 
VI. Abstain from all the heathen books. For what hast thou to do 
with such foreign discourses, or laws; or false prophets, which subvert 
the faith of the unstable? For what defect dost thou find in the law of 
God, that thou shouldst have recourse to those heathenish fables? For 
if thou hast a mind to read history, thou hast the books of the Kings; if
-P-A-G-E-81
  CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY 55 
books of wisdom or poetry, thou hast those of the prophets, of Job, and 
the Proverbs, in which thou wilt find greater depth of sagacity than in 
all the heathen poets and sophisters, because these are the words of the 
Lord, the only wise God. If thou desirest something to sing, thou hast 
the Psalms; if the origin of things, thou hast Genesis; if laws and stat- 
utes, thou hast the glorious law of the Lord God. Do thou, therefore, 
utterly abstain from all strange and diabolical books. Nay, when thou 
readest the law, think not thyself bound to observe the additional pre- 
cepts; though not all of them, yet some of them. Read those barely 
for the sake of history, in order to the knowledge of them, and to glorify 
God that he has delivered thee from such great and so many bonds. 
Propose to thyself to distinguish what rules were from the law of na- 
ture, and what were added afterwards, or were such additional rules as 
were introduced and given in the wilderness to the Israelites, after the 
making of the calf; for the law contains those precepts which were 
spoken by the Lord God before the people fell into idolatry, and made a 
calf like the Egyptian Apis — that is, the ten commandments. But-as 
to those bonds which were further laid upon them after they had sinned, 
do not thou draw them upon thyself; for our Saviour came for no other 
reason but that he might deliver those that were obnoxious thereto 
from the wrath which was reserved for them, that he might fulfil the 
Law and the Prophets, and that he might abrogate or change those 
secondary bonds which were superadded to the rest of the law. For 
therefore did he call to us, and say, “ Come unto me, all ye that labor 
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” When, therefore, thou 
hast read the Law, which is agreeable to the Gospel and the Prophets, 
read also the books of the Kings, that thou mayst thereby learn which 
of the kings were righteous, and how they were prospered by God, and 
how the promise of eternal life continued with them from him; but 
those kings which went a-whoring from God did soon perish in their 
apostasy by the righteous judgment of God, and were deprived of his 
life, inheriting, instead of rest, eternal punishment. Wherefore by 
reading these books thou wilt be mightily strengthened in the faith, and 
edified in Christ, whose body and member thou art. 
~ 42. The Nicene Creed as framed in 325 A.D. 
(From Mitchell, E. K., Canons and Creeds of the First Four Councils, p. 3) 
The Council of Nicza, in Asia Minor, was called by the Em- 
peror Constantine, in the summer of 325 A.D. Some three hun- 
dred bishops, mostly of the Eastern branch of the Church, were 
present at this first general Council of the Church. The following 
creed was the first authoritative formulation of the articles of 
faith of the Church.
-P-A-G-E-82
  56 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
We believe in one God, the Fatuer Almighty, Maker of all things 
visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Curist, the Son of God, 
begotten of the Father, the only-begotten; that is, of the essence of the 
Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, 
not made, being of one essence with the Father; by whom all things 
were made, both in heaven and on earth; who for us men, and for our 
salvation, came down and was incarnate and was made man; he suf- 
fered, and the third day he rose again, ascended into heaven; and he 
shall come to judge the living and the dead. And in the Holy Ghost. 
But those who say: “There was a time when he was not”’; and, “He was 
not before he was made”’; and, “He was made out of nothing,” or, “He 
is of another substance or essence,” or, ‘“alterable’”” — they are con- 
demned by the holy catholic and apostolic church. 
43. The Rule of Saint Benedict 
(Extracts from the translation in Henderson, E. F., Historical Documents of the 
Middle Ages, p. 274 et seg. London, 1896) 
Though monasticism in the West had begun as early as 340, 
and became established by the beginning of the fifth century, the 
really great impulse to monastic life was given by Saint Benedict, 
a native Italian with large genius for organization. In 529 he 
founded the monastery of Monte Casino, between Rome and 
Naples, on the site of an ancient temple of Apollo, and later others 
in the vicinity. For all these he established his ‘‘Rule,” a docu- 
ment of some length, divided into seventy-three different com- 
mands or rules. It was generally adopted by the monasteries of 
western Europe, those following the rule being known as Bene- 
dictines. The most important rules, from the standpoint of 
education and civilization, were numbers 38, 42, and 48, the im- 
portant parts of which are reproduced below. To rule 48, in par- 
ticular, we are in large part indebted for the copying of manu- 
scripts and the preservation of learning throughout the Middle 
~Ages. 
Prologue. . . . we are about to found, therefore, a school for the Lord’s 
service; in the organization of which we trust that we shall ordain 
nothing severe and nothing burdensome. But even if, the demands of 
justice dictating it, something a little irksome shall be the result, for 
the purpose of amending vices or preserving charity; — thou shalt not 
therefore, struck by fear, flee the way of salvation, which can not be 
entered upon except through a narrow entrance. 
  38. Concerning the weekly reader. At the tables of the brothers when 
they eat the reading should not fail; nor may any one at random dare
-P-A-G-E-83
FR 
CONTRIBUTION OF CHRISTIANITY 57 
to take up the book and begin to read there; but he who is about to 
read for the whole week shall begin his duties on Sunday. And, enter- 
ing upon his office after mass and communion, he shall ask all to pray 
for him, that God may avert from him the spirit of elation. And this 
verse shall be said in the oratory three times by ali, he, however, be- 
ginning it: “O Lord, open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth 
thy praise.” And thus, having received the benediction, he shall enter 
upon his duties as reader. And there shall be the greatest silence at 
table, so that the muttering or the voice of no one shall be heard there, 
except that of the reader alone. But whatever things are necessary to 
those eating and drinking, the brothers shall so furnish them to each 
other in turn, that no one shall need to ask for anything. But if, never- 
theless, something is wanted, it shall rather be sought by the employ- 
ment of some sign than by the voice. Nor shall any one presume there 
to ask questions concerning the reading or anything else; nor shall an 
opportunity be given: unless perhaps the prior wishes to say something, 
briefly, for the purpose of edifying. Moreover, the brother who reads 
for the week shall receive bread and wine before he begins to read, on 
account of the holy communion, and lest, perchance, it might be in- 
jurious for him to sustain a fast. Afterwards, moreover, he shall eat 
with the weekly cooks and servitors. The brothers, moreover, shall 
read or sing not in rotation; but the ones shall do so who will edify 
their hearers. . . . 
42. That after “completorium” no one shall speak. At all times the 
monks ought to practice silence, but most of all in the nocturnal hours. 
And thus at all times, whether of fasting or of eating: if it be mealtime, 
as soon as they have risen from the table, all shall sit together and one 
shall read selections or lives of the Fathers, or indeed anything that will 
edify the hearers. But not the Pentateuch or Kings; for, to weak in- 
tellects, it will be of no use at that hour to hear this part of Scripture; 
but they shall be read at other times. But if the days are fast days, 
when Vespers have been said, after a short interval they shall come to 
the reading of the selections as we have said; and four or five pages, or 
as much as the hour permits having been read, they shall all congregate, 
upon the cessation of the reading. If, by chance, any one is occupied 
in a task assigned to him, he shall nevertheless approach. All there- 
fore being gathered together, they shall say the completing prayer; 
and, going out from the “completorium,”’ there shall be no further op- 
portunity for any one to say anything. .. .   48. Concerning the daily manual labour. Idleness is the enemy of 
the soul. And therefore, at fixed times, the brothers ought to be occu- 
pied in manual labour; and again, at fixed times, in sacred reading. 
Therefore we believe that, according to this disposition, both seasons 
ought to be arranged; so that, from Easter until the Calends of Octo-

ber, going out early, from the first until the fourth hour they shall do 
what labour may be necessary. Moreover, from the fourth hour until 
about the sixth, they shall be free for reading. After the meal of the 
sixth hour, moreover, rising from table, they shall rest in their beds 
with all silence; or, perchance, 
he that wishes to read may so 
read to himself that he do not 
disturb another. And the nona 
(the second meal) shall be gone 
through with more moderately 
about the middle of the eighth 
hour; and again they shall work 
at what is to be done until Ves- 
pers. But, if the exigency or 
poverty of the place demands 
that they be occupied by them- 
selves in picking fruits, they 
shall not be dismayed: for then 
they are truly monks if they live 
by the labours of their hands; 
as did also our fathers and the

is enjoined upon them until the ninth. The first signal, moreover, 
of the ninth hour having been given, they shall each one leave 
off his work; and be ready when the second signal strikes. More- 
over, after the refection they shall be free for their readings or for 
psalms. But in the days of Lent, from dawn until the third full hour, 
they shall be free for their readings; and, until the tenth full hour, 
they shall do the labour that is enjoined on them. In which days of 
Lent they shall all receive separate books from the library; which they 
shall read entirely through in order. These books are to be given out 
on the first day of Lent. Above all there shall certainly be appointed 
one or two elders, who shall go round the monastery at the hours in 
which the brothers are engaged in reading, and see to it that no trou- 
blesome brother chance to be found who is open to idleness and trifling, 
and is not intent on his reading; being not only of no use to himself, 
but also stirring up others. If such a one — may it not happen — be 
found, he shall be admonished once and a second time. If he do not

the others may have fear. Nor shall brother join brother at unsuitable 
hours. Moreover, on Sunday all shall engage in reading: excepting 
those who are deputed to various duties. But if any one be so negli- 
gent and lazy that he will not or can not read, some task shall be im- 
posed upon him that he can do; so that he be not idle. On feeble or 
delicate brothers such a labour or art is to be imposed, that they shall 
neither be idle, nor shall they be so oppressed by the violence of labour 
as to be driven to take flight. Their weakness is to be taken into con-, 
sideration by the abbot. 
44. Enforcing Lenten Reading in the Monasteries 
(An English Benedictine Rule; Archbishop Lanfranc, 1070; trans. by J. W. Clark, 
Care of Books, pp. 67-68. London, 1901) 
The better to enforce the rule for Lenten reading, supplemen- 
tary rules were made after the rise of the reform movement among 
the monasteries. The following rule, issued to the English Bene- 
dictines in 1070 A.D., is illustrative of many others. 
On the Monday after the first Sunday in Lent . . . before the breth- 
ren go in to Chapter, the librarian ought to have all the books brought 
together into the Chapter-House and laid out on a carpet, except those 
which had been given out for reading during the past year: these the 
brethren ought to bring with them as they come into Chapter, each 
carrying his book in his hand. Of this they ought to have had notice 
given to them by the aforesaid librarian on the preceding day in Chap- 
ter. Then let the passage in the Rule of S. Benedict about the obsery- 
ance of Lent be read, and a discourse be preached upon it. Next let 
the librarian read a document setting forth the names of the brethren 
who have had books during the past year; and let each brother, when 
he hears his own name pronounced, return the book which had been 
entrusted to him for reading; and let him who is conscious of not having 
read the book through which he had received, fall down on his face, 
confess his fault, and pray for forgiveness. 
Then let the aforesaid librarian hand to each brother another book 
for reading; and when the books have been distributed in order, let the 
aforesaid librarian in the same Chapter put on record the names of the 
books, and of those who receive them. 
45. Saint Jerome on the Education of Girls 
(Letter to Leta) 
The following letter from Saint Jerome (c. 340-420) was written 
to the Roman matron Leta, regarding the education of her little 
daughter Paula. Sent from his retirement at Bethlehem, in 403, 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
a eR ne ee ee 
60 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
it is an important document in the history of early Christian 
education for girls. He gave similar advice in his Letter to Gau- 
dentius, regarding the education of her daughter Pacatula. Both 
letters are pervaded by the ascetic spirit of the age and of the 
monastic East. Leta later followed Saint Jerome’s advice, send- 
ing Paula to a nunnery near Bethlehem, where she finally became 
abbess of a nunnery founded there by her grandmother. 
+ Thus must a soul be educated which is to be a temple of God. It 
must learn to hear nothing and to say nothing but what belongs to the 
fear of God. It must have no understanding of unclean words, and no 
knowledge of the world’s songs. Its tongue must be steeped while 
still tender in the sweetness of the Psalms. Boys with their wanton 
thoughts must be kept from Paula: even her maids and female attend- 
ants must be separated from worldly associates. For if they have 
learned some mischief they may teach more. 
Get for her a set of letters made of boxwood or of ivory and called 
each by its proper name. Let her play with these, so that even her 
play may teach her something. And not only make her grasp the 
right order of the letters and see that she forms their names into a 
rhyme, but constantly disarrange their order and put the last letters in 
the middle and the middle ones at the beginning that she may know 
them all by sight as well as by sound. 
Moreover, so soon as she begins to use the style upon the wax, and 
her hand is still faltering, either guide her soft fingers by laying your 
hand upon hers, or else have simple copies cut upon a tablet; so that 
her efforts confined within these limits may keep to the lines traced out 
for her and not stray outside of these. Offer prizes for good spelling 
and draw her onwards with little gifts such as children of her age de- 
light in. 
And let her have companions in her lessons to excite emulation in 
her, that she may be stimulated when she sees them praised. You 
must not scold her if she is slow to learn, but must employ praise to ex- 
cite her mind, so that she may be glad when she excels others and sorry 
when she is excelled by them. Above all you must take care not to 
make her lessons distasteful to her, lest a dislike for them conceived in 
childhood may continue into her maturer years. The very words 
which she tries bit by bit to put together and pronounce ought not to 
be chance ones, but names specially fixed upon and heaped together 
for the purpose, those for example of the prophets or the apostles or the 
list of patriarchs from Adam downwards, as it is given by Matthew and 
Luke. In this way while her tongue will be well trained, her memory 
will be likewise developed. 
Again, you must choose for her a master of approved years, life, and 
learning. A man of culture will not, I think, blush to do for a kins-

woman or a high-born virgin what Aristotle did for Philip’s son when, 
descending to the level of an usher,! he consented to teach him his let- 
ters. Things must not be despised as of small account in the absence 
of which great results can not be achieved. The very rudiments and 
first beginnings of knowledge sound differently in the mouth of an 
educated man and of an uneducated. Accordingly you must see that 
the child is not led away by the silly coaxing of women to form a habit 
of shortening long words or of decking herself with gold and purple. 
Of these habits one will spoil her conversation and the other her char- 
acter. She must not therefore learn as a child what afterwards she 
will have to unlearn. 
The eloquence of the Gracchi is said to have been largely due to the 
way in which from their earliest years their mother spoke to them. 
Hortensius became an orator while still on his father’s lap. Early im- 
pressions are hard to eradicate from the mind. When once wool has 
been dyed purple, who can restore it to its previous whiteness? An 
unused jar long retains the taste and smell of that with which it was 
first filled. Grecian history tells us that the imperious Alexander, who 
was lord of the whole world, could not rid himself of the tricks of man- 
ner and gait which in his childhood he had caught from his governor 
Leonidas. We are always ready to imitate what is evil; and faults are 
quickly copied where virtues appear unattainable. Paula’s nurse 
must not be intemperate, or loose, or given to gossip. Her bearer 
must be respectable, and her foster-father of grave demeanor. . . . 
Let her very dress and garb remind her to Whom she‘is promised. 
Do not pierce her ears or paint her face, consecrated to Christ, with 
white lead or rouge. Do not hang gold or pearls about her neck or Joad 
her head with jewels, or by reddening her hair make it suggest the fires 
of Gehenna. .. . 
When Paula comes to be a little older and to increase like her Spouse 
in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man, let her go with 
her parents to the temple of her true Father, but let her not come out of 
the temple with them. Let them seek her upon the world’s highway 
amid the crowds and the throng of their kinsfolk, and let them find her 
nowhere but in the shrine of the Scriptures, questioning the prophets 
and apostles on the meaning of that spiritual marriage to which she is 
vowed. Let her imitate the retirement of Mary whom Gabriel found 
alone in her chamber. . . . 
And let it be her daily task to bring you the flowers which she has 
culled from Scripture. Let her learn by heart so many verses from the 
Greek, and let her be instructed in the Latin also. For, if the tender 
lips are not from the first shaped to this, the tongue is spoiled by a for- 
eign accent and its native speech debased by alien elements. You 
must yourself be her mistress, a model on which she may form her 
1 A term much used in England for an assistant teacher. 
  
Nod

childish conduct. Never either in you or in her father let her see what 
she can not imitate without sin. Remember both of you that you are 
the parents of a consecrated virgin, and that your example will teach 
her more than your precepts. 
Flowers are quick to fade, and a baleful wind soon withers the violet, 
the lily, and the crocus. Let her never appear in public unless accom- 
panied by you. Let her never visit a church or a martyr’s shrine unless 
with her mother. Let no young man greet her with smiles, no dandy 
with curled hair pay compliments to her. If our little virgin goes to 
keep solemn eves and all-night vigils, let her not stir a hair’s breadth 
from her mother’s side. 
She must not single out one of her maids to make her a special favor- 
ite or a confidante. What she says to one all ought to know. Let her 
choose for a companion not a handsome well-dressed girl, able to 
warble a song with liquid notes, but one pale and serious, sombrely at- 
tired and with the hue of melancholy. Let her take as her model some 
aged virgin of approved faith, character, and chastity, apt to instruct 
her by word and by example. 
She ought to rise at night to recite prayers and psalms; to sing hymns 
in the morning; at the third, sixth, and ninth hours to take her place in 
the line to do battle for Christ; and, lastly, to kindle her lamp and to 
offer her evening sacrifice. In these occupations let her pass the day, 
and when night comes let it find her still engaged in them. Let reading 
follow prayer with her, and prayer again succeed to reading. Time 
will seem short when employed on tasks so many and so varied. 
Let her learn, too, how to spin wool, to hold the distaff, to put the 
basket in her lap, to turn the spinning wheel and to shape the yarn 
with her thumb. Let her put away with disdain silken fabrics, Chi- 
nese fleeces, and gold brocades; the clothing which she makes for her- 
self should keep out the cold and not expose the body which it pro- 
fesses to cover. Let her food be herbs and wheaten bread, with now 
and then one or two small fishes. And that I may not waste more 
time in giving precepts for the regulation of her appetite, let her meals 
always leave her hungry and able on the moment to begin reading 
or chanting. I strongly disapprove — especially for those of tender 
years — of long and immoderate fasts in which week is added to week, 
and even oil and apples are forbidden as food. I have learned by ex- 
perience that the ass toiling along the highway makes for an inn when 
it is weary.... 
Let her treasures be not silks or gems, but manuscripts of the Holy 
Scriptures; and in these let her think less of gilding, and Babylonian 
parchment, and arabesque patterns, than of correctness and accurate 
punctuation. Let her begin by learning the Psalter, and then let her 
gather rules of life out of the proverbs of Solomon. From the Preacher 
let her gain the habit of despising the world and its vanities. Let her

follow the example set in Job of virtue and patience. Then let her 
pass on to the Gospels, never to be laid aside when once they have been 
taken in hand. Let her also drink in with a willing heart the Acts of 
the Apostles and the Epistles. As soon as she has enriched the store- 
house of her mind with these treasures, let her commit to memory the 
prophets, the heptateuch, the books of Kings and of Chronicles, the 
rolls also of Ezra and Esther. When she has done all these she may 
safely read the Song of Songs, but not before: for, were she to read it at 
the beginning, she would fail to perceive that, though it is written in 
fleshly words, it is a marriage song of a spiritual bridal. And not un- 
derstanding this she would suffer hurt from it. Cyprian’s writings let 
her have always in her hands. The letters of Athanasius and the trea- 
tises of Hilary she may go through without fear of stumbling. Let her 
take pleasure in the works and wits of all in whose books a due regard 
for the faith is not neglected. But if she reads the works of others, let 
it be rather to judge them than to follow them. 
You will answer, ‘How shall I, a woman of the world, living at 
Rome, surrounded by a crowd, be able to observe all these injunc- 
tions?”” In that case do not undertake a burthen to which you are not 
equal. When you have weaned Paula as Isaac was weaned, and when 
you have clothed her as Samuel was clothed, send her to her grand- 
mother and aunt; give up this most precious of gems, to be placed in 
Mary’s chamber and to rest in the cradle where the infant Jesus cried. 
Let her be brought up in a monastery, let her be one amid companies 
of virgins, let her learn to avoid swearing, let her regard lying as sacri- 
lege, let her be ignorant of the world, let her live the angelic life, while 
in the flesh let her be without the flesh, and let her suppose that all hu- 
man beings are like herself.

  CHAPRE RV. 
NEW PEOPLES IN THE EMPIRE 
Tue Readings in this chapter deal with the period of the break- 
down of the Roman authority in the provinces, and the barbarian 
deluge. From being on the defensive the Empire, after two cen- 
turies of resistance, finally fell before the repeated onslaughts of 
peoples who had gradually come to realize Roman weakness and 
barbarian strength. It was a period of great tribal movements, 
and when the movements were over and the different tribes had 
finally settled down within the boundaries of the old Empire, the 
old civilization had in large part vanished. To the Christian 
Church was left the task of preserving what remained and of 
building up a new civilization in western Europe. This required 
nearly a thousand years. The task confronting the Church was 
that of transforming the sixth-century barbarian into the civilized 
man of the fifteenth century, ready to begin anew the upward 
march of civilization. This long, weary thousand years covered 
_ the period known as the Middle Ages. Up to the eleventh cen- 
tury was a particularly difficult period; after that the tide began 
to turn. 
The Readings given here, and in succeeding chapters, serve to 
illustrate the enormous problem facing the few constructive forces 
in this ancient society. Cesar (46) and Tacitus (47) briefly 
describe the manners and the degree of civilization of the invading 
Germans. Dill (48) gives an interesting description of how the 
ancient world was shocked by the news that Rome had been taken 
and sacked by the barbarian Alaric, in 410 A.D., while the extract 
from Giry and Réville (49) pictures the passing of Roman towns 
as the barbarians came into control. Kingsley (50) writes with 
sympathetic pen of the.invaders and what they brought into the 
ancient world. Reading 51 is a general form, much used in the 
Middle Ages, by which to grant privileges and immunities to 
churches, monasteries, and church officers, so that they might 
pursue their civilizing work unhampered by the barbarian chief- 
tains. Number 52 is a specific grant to a monastery, by Charle- 
magne, of much the same privileges and immunities.

    NEW PEOPLES IN THE EMPIRE 65 
46. The Hunting Germans and their Fighting Ways 
(Cesar, Commentaries, book v1, chaps. 21-23) 
Caius Julius Cesar (c. 100-44 B.C.), in his Commentaries on the 
Gallic Wars, published at Rome in 51 B.c., gives us a good picture 
of the life and manners of the German tribes east of the Rhine, as 
he learned them during his period of dealing with them. The Com- 
mentaries are noted for their accuracy and excellent literary style. 
Chap. 21. The Germans differ much from these usages [of the Gauls 
to the west, previously described], for they have neither Druids to 
preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices. 
They rank in the number of gods those alone whom they behold, and 
by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the 
sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even 
by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits <~ 
of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue 
and hardships. .. . 
Chap. 22. They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a 
large portion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has 
any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the 
magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and 
families, who have united together, as much land as, and in the place 
in which, they think proper, and the year after compel them to remove 
elsewhere. For this enactment they advance many reasons — lest, 
seduced by long-continued custom, they may exchange their ardor in 
the waging of war for agriculture; lest they may be anxious to acquire 
extensive estates, and the more powerful drive the weaker from their 
possessions; lest they construct their houses with too great a desire to 
avoid heat and cold; lest the desire of wealth spring up, from which ~. 
cause divisions and discords arise; and that they may keep the common 
people in a contented state of mind, when each sees his own means 
placed on an equality with [those of] the most powerful. 
Chap. 23. It is the greatest glory to the several states to have as 
wide deserts as possible around them, their frontiers having been laid 
waste. They consider this the real evidence of their prowess, that their 
neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them, and that 
no one dare settle near them; at the same time they think that they 
shall be on that account the more secure, because they have removed 
the apprehension of a sudden incursion. When a state either repels 
war waged against it, or wages it against another, magistrates are 
chosen to preside over that war with such authority, that they have the 
power of life and death. In peace there is no common magistrate, but 
the chiefs of provinces and cantons administer justice and determine 
controversies among their own people. Robberies which are commit-

ted beyond the boundaries of each state bear no infamy, and they avow 
that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining their youth 
and of preventing sloth: And when any of their chiefs has said in an 
assembly “that he will be their leader, let those who are willing to fol- 
low, give in their names”’; they who approve of both the enterprise and 
the man arise and promise their assistance and are applauded by the 
people; such of them as have not followed him are accounted in the 
number of deserters and traitors, and confidence in all matters is after- 
ward refused them. To injure guests they regard as impious; they 
defend from wrong those who have come to them for any purpose 
whatever, and esteem them inviolable; to them the houses of all are 
open and maintenance is freely supplied. 
47. The Germans and their Domestic Habits 
(Tacitus, Germania, chaps. 4 ff. to 20) 
The Latin historian, Cornelius Tacitus (c. 54-117), about the 
year 100 wrote and published a book called Germania, describ- 
ing the character, habits, and political institutions of the Ger- 
mans. He had never visited Germany and probably obtained his 
information from Roman traders and soldiers. While regarded as 
an accurate historical writer, he nevertheless has been suspected 
of attempting to point a moral for the Romans by his descriptions 
of the better side of German life. The following extract gives a 
very favorable picture of their domestic ways. 
I agree in the opinion that the Germans have never inter-married 
with other nations; but to be a race pure, unmixed, and stamped with a 
distinct character. Hence a family likeness pervades the whole, though 
they are so numerous: — eyes stern and blue; ruddy hair; large bodies, 
powerful in sudden exertions, but impatient of toil and labor, least of 
all capable of sustaining thirst and heat. Cold and hunger they are 
accustomed by their climate and soil to endure. 
The land, though varied to a considerable extent in its aspect, is yet 
universally shagged with forests, or deformed by marshes; moister on 
the side of Gaul, more bleak on the side of Noricum and Pannonia. It 
is productive of grain, but unkindly to fruit trees. It abounds in flocks 
and herds, but generally of a small breed. . . . 
It is well known that the Germans do not inhabit cities. They 
dwell scattered and separate, as a spring, meadow, or grove may chance 
to invite them. [In their villages] they are not acquainted with the use 
of mortar and tiles; and for every purpose use rude unshapen timber, 
fashioned with no view to beauty; but they take great pains to coat 
parts of their buildings with a kind of earth, so pure and shining that it 
gives them the appearance of painting. They also dig underground  
-P-A-G-E-93
  NEW PEOPLES IN THE EMPIRE 67 
caves, and cover them over with a great quantity of manure. These 
they use as winter retreats and granaries. . 
The marriage bond is strict and severe among them; nor are any of 
their manners more praiseworthy than this. Almost singly among the 
Barbarians they content themselves with one wife (though a very few 
great chiefs are polygamists). When a woman is married she is ad- 
monished by the ceremonial that she comes to her husband as a partner 
of his toils and dangers, to suffer and to dare equally with him in peace 
and in war. The women live therefore fenced around with chastity, 
corrupted by no seductive spectacles, no convivial excitements. Adul- 
tery is extremely rare among so numerous a people (and profligate 
women are outcasts from society). Every mother-suckles-her-own 
children and does not deliver them into the hands of servants and 
“nurses (as at Rome). The young people are equally matched in their 
marriage, and the children inherit the vigor of their parents. 
48. Effect on the Roman World of the News of the Sacking of 
Rome by Alaric 
(Dill, S., Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire, p. 305. 
ad ed., London, 1899) 
The following selection from the important book by Professor 
Dill states the profound impression created throughout the 
civilized world by the news of the fall and sacking of the Eternal 
City. The picture drawn by Saint Jerome may be a little over- 
colored; still the effect produced by the news was staggering. 
~.. In 410, when after the failure of all negotiations, the city [of Rome] 
~~ had at last fallen a prey to the army of Alaric, everything was changed. 
Eight hundred years had passed since Rome had been violated by the 
Gauls of Brennus. In spite of all the troubles on the frontiers, in spite 
of the alarms of the great invasions of the second, third, and fourth 
centuries, the sacred centre of government had never realized the pos- 
sibility that her own stately security would ever be disturbed. Not 
only had all true sons of Rome a religious faith in her mission and 
destiny, but they had good reason to rely on the awe which she inspired 
in the barbarous races who ranged around her frontiers. 
But now the spell was broken; the mystery and awe which surrounded 
the great city had been pierced and set at naught. The moral force, so 
much more important in government than the material, had been weak- 
ened and desecrated. The shock given by this catastrophe to old 
Roman confidence and pride must, for the time, have been overwhelm- 
ing. We can conjecture the feelings [of men of the time . . . | from the 
words Saint Jerome penned in his cell in Bethlehem in the year 411. 
Although he had fled from the world, he was still a Roman at heart, 
steeped in her literary culture, and proud of her great history. When 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    68 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the rumor of the fall of Rome reached him, he broke off his commentary 
on Ezekiel; his voice was choked with sobs as he thought of the capture 
of the great city, “which had taken captive all the world.” 
In an earlier letter, referring to the invasion of the eastern provinces, 
he says that his soul shudders at the ruin of his time. For twenty 
years all the lands from Constantinople to the Julian Alps are drenched 
with Roman blood. The provinces are a prey to Alans, Huns, Van- 
dals, and Marcomanni. Matrons and virgins devoted to God, the noble 
and the priest, are made a sport of these monsters. The churches are 
demolished; the bones of the martyrs are dug up; horses are stabled 
at the altars of Christ. ‘The Roman world is sinking in ruin, . . . and 
yet we wish to live, and think that those who have been taken from such 
a scene are to be mourned rather than deemed happy in their fate. It 
is through our sins that the barbarians are strong.” 
~ {In another letter} he speaks of the countless hordes that have swept 
from the Rhine to the Pyrenees. Great cities like Mainz, Rheims, and 
Nantes have been wiped out; the provinces of Aquitaine, Lyons, and 
Narbonne have been desolated, thousands have been butchered even in 
the churches, and famine has completed the work of the sword. 
49. Fate of the Old Roman Towns 
(By Giry and Réville, in Lavisse et Rambaud’s Histoire Générale; trans. by Bates 
and Titsworth, in their Emancipation ef Medieval Towns. Henry Holt & Co., 
New York, 1907. Reproduced by permission) 
The following selection describes briefly the decline and oblit- 
eration of the Roman towns which took place with the decline in 
power of Rome and the coming of the barbarians into the Empire. 
The history of the towns and of urban civilization during the first 
centuries of the Middle Ages is little known; indeed it would be truer 
to say that it is almost entirely unknown. The meager documents 
which these times have left us touch only the greater political events, 
the history of kings and of the more prominent characters; as to the 
fate of the people, the anonymous masses, they give us but rare and 
vague ideas. Nevertheless, though explicit statements are lacking, we 
may see in part what was the lot of the urban groups and of the indi- 
viduals who composed them. 
The Roman Empire bequeathed to the Middle Ages a goodly number 
of towns. Of these the most important, by reason of population, 
wealth, and rank, were the cities. There were about one hundred and 
twelve such towns in ancient Gaul. Other towns, called castra, were 
simply fortified places. The cities, which for a long time had enjoyed a 
considerable degree of freedom, possessed municipal institutions; but 
this régime, under the oppressive action of the fisc and of an overwhelm- 
ing centralization, was in full disintegration as early as the fourth cen-  
-P-A-G-E-95
  NEW PEOPLES IN THE EMPIRE 69 
tury, even before the invasions had precipitated the fall of the Empire. 
In the anarchy which followed the arrival of the Barbarians, nothing 
remained standing of all this structure, for no one was interested in 
preserving it. The Roman municipal régime expired. 
What, then, became of the citiés? In most of them a certain person- 
age soon distinguished himself among the inhabitants and gained over 
them an undisputed preéminence: this was the bishop. He was no 
longer simply the first priest of his town, he was its lord. As early as 
the end of the seventh century, perhaps before, Tours was under the 
tule of its bishop. Thus it was that most of the old Roman cities be- 
came, in the Middle Ages, episcopal seigniories. This was the case 
with Amiens, Laon, Beauvais, and many others. ‘ 
All, however, did not have the same fate. Some, in consequence of 
wars, or of partitions, passed into the hands of lay princes. Angers 
belonged to the count of Anjou, Bordeaux to the duke of Aquitaine; 
Orleans and Paris were directly under the king. Elsewhere, beside the 
old city where the bishop ruled, there sprang up a new town, the bourg, 
which was under another lord, lay or ecclesiastical: thus at Marseilles 
the city was under the bishop, and the town under the viscount. In 
the same way the bourg was distinguished from the city at Arles, Nar- 
bonne, Toulouse, and Tours. Other places again, pillaged, ruined, and 
depopulated, lost their rank as towns and were reduced to simple vil- 
lages, or were even blotted out. London, after the English invasions, 
was a heap of ruins, and the courses of the old Roman roads which in- 
tersected it were so completely obscured that the new streets, marked 
out in the same directions when the town was reviving in the Middle 
Ages, no longer coincided with them. Viriconium, one of the richest of 
the British cities, was reduced to nothing, and it is only in our times 
(1857) that its exact situation has been discovered. In the same way 
the destruction of the Portus Itius, which stood upon the shores of the 
Strait of Dover, and that of Tauroentum, upon the coast of Provence, 
were so complete that to this day scholars do not agree as to where they 
were located. 
Such are the vague ideas which we possess concerning the political 
changes in the Roman towns at the beginning of the Middle Ages: with 
so much the more reason do we know nothing of the history of the small 
towns, of the simple fortified bourgs, which were built in great numbers 
at the end of the Empire. All must have come to constitute seigniories, 
but we do not know how this transformation took place.

mens sana must have a corpus sanum to inhabit. And even for the 
Western Church, the lofty future which was in store for it would have 
been impossible, without some infusion of new and healthier blood 
into the veins of a world drained and tainted by the influence of 
Rome. 
And the new blood .. . was at hand. The great tide of those Gothic 
nations, of which the Norwegian and the German are the purest re- 
maining types, though every nation of Europe, from Gibraltar to St. 
Petersburg, owes to them the most precious elements of strength, was 
sweeping onward, wave over wave, in a steady southwestern current 
across the whole Roman territory, and only stopping and recoiling 
when it reached the shores of the Mediterranean. Those wild tribes 
were bringing with them into the magic circle of the Western Chuirch’s 
influence the very materials which she required for the building up of a
-P-A-G-E-97

future Christendom, and which she could find as little in the Western 
Empire, as in the Eastern; comparative purity of morals; sacred re- 
spect for woman, for family life, law, equal justice, individual freedom, 
and, above all, for honesty in word and deed; bodies untainted by 
hereditary effeminacy, hearts earnest though genial, and blest with a 
strange willingness to learn, even from those whom they despised; 
a brain equal to that of the Roman in practical power, and not too 
far behind that of the Eastern in imaginative and speculative acute- 
ness. 
And their strength was felt at once. Their vanguard, confined with 
difficulty for three centuries beyond the Eastern Alps, at the expense of 
sanguinary wars had been adopted, wherever it was practicable, into 
the service of the Empire; and the heart’s core of the Roman legion was 
composed of Gothic officers and soldiers. But now the main body had 
arrived. ‘Tribe after tribe was crowding down to the Alps, and tramp- 
ling upon each other on the frontiers of the Empire. The Huns, singly 
their inferiors, pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of 
numbers; Italy, with her rich cities and fertile lowlands, beckoned them 
on to plunder; as auxiliaries, they had learned their own strength and 
Roman weakness; a casus belli was soon found. How iniquitous was the 
conduct of the sons of Theodosius, in refusing the usual bounty, by 
which the Goths were bribed not to attack the Empire! — The whole 
pent-up deluge burst over the plains of Italy, and the Western Empire 
became from that day forth a dying idiot, while the new invaders di- 
vided Europe among themselves. .. . The countless treasures which 
five centuries of rapine had accumulated around the Capitol, had be- 
come the prey of men clothed in sheepskin and horsehide; and the sister 
of an emperor had found her beauty, virtue, and pride of race, worthily 
matched by those of the hard-handed Northern hero who led her away 
from Italy as his captive and his bride,' to found new kingdoms in South 
France and Spain, and to drive the newly arrived Vandals across the 
Straits of Gibraltar into the then blooming coast-land of Northern 
Africa. Everywhere the mangled limbs of the Old World were seething 
in the Medea’s caldron, to come forth whole, and young, and strong. 
The Longbeards, noblest of their race, had found a temporary resting- 
place upon the Austrian frontier, after long southward wanderings 
from the Swedish mountains, soon to be dispossessed again by the 
advancing Huns, and, crossing the Alps, to give their name forever to 
the plains of Lombardy. A few more tumultuous years, and the Franks 
would find themselves lords of the Lower Rhineland; and before the 
hairs of Hypatia’s scholars had grown gray, the mythic Hengist and 
Horsa would have landed on the shores of Kent and an English nation 
have begun its world-wide life.

norius, the beautiful and learned Placidia, who became his wife.

51. General Form for a Grant of Immunity to a Bishop 
(Trans. by Cheyney, E. P., Documents Illustrative of Feudalism, p. 11) 
The following general form, used commonly during the Middle 
Ages to extend large powers and immunities to the bishops of the 
Church, illustrates both the form of grant and the extensive 
nature of the powers and immunities granted. 
A. Grants of Immunity from the Visits of the King’s Officials 
We believe that it increases the great strength of our realm, if with 
benevolent deliberation we concede opportune benefits to certain 
churches, — or to certain other specified parties, — and under God’s 
protection write them down to endure permanently. Therefore, may 
your Zeal know that we have seen fit upon petition to grant such a 
benefit, for our eternal reward, to that apostolic man, Lord ; 
bishop of the city of ; that in the vills belonging to the church of 
that lord, which he is seen to have at the present time, either by our 
gift or that of any one else, or which in the future godly piety shall 
wish to add to the possessions of that holy place, no public judge shall 
at any time presume to enter, for the hearing of causes or for the exac- 
tion of payments, but the prelate himself, or his successors in God’s 
name shall be able to rule over these possessions as enjoying complete 
immunity. 
We decree, therefore, that neither you, nor your subordinates, nor 
your successors; nor any public judicial power shall presume at any 
time to enter upon the vills of the same church anywhere in our king- 
dom, either those granted by royal bounty, or by that of private per- 
sons, or those which shall in future be granted; either for the purpose of 
settling disputes, or to exact fines for any cause, or to obtain lodgment, 
entertainment, or sureties. But whatever the treasury might expect 
from fines or otherwise, either from freemen, serfs, or others within the 
fields or boundaries of the aforesaid church, or dwelling upon its lands, 
— this revenue we surrender, for our future welfare, in order that it 
may be applied to the expenses of the same church by the hand of 
those ruling it, forever. 
And what we, in the name of God and for the remedy of our soul and 
that of our children after us, have granted from full devotion, let not 
the royal sublimity itself, nor the reckless cupidity of any of the mag- 
istrates be tempted to violate. 
And in order that the present decree may, by the aid of God, re- 
main inviolate now and hereafter, we have ordained that this be 
certified by the subscription of our hand.

are persuaded has been granted by preceding kings to Church founda- 
tions for the saving of souls, and not to deny fitting benefits, in order 
that we may deserve to be partakers of the reward, but to confirm 
them in still greater security. 
Now the illustrious Hubert, bishop and ruler of the church of St. 
Marcellus, which lies below the citadel of Chalons, where the precious 
martyr of the Lord himself rests in the body, has brought it to the at- 
tention of our Highness that the kings who preceded us, or our lord and 
father of blessed memory, Pippin, the preceding king, had by their 
charters granted complete immunities to that Monastery, so that in 
the towns or on the lands belonging to it no public judge, nor any one 
with power of hearing cases or exacting fines, or raising sureties, or ob- 
taining lodging or entertainment, or making requisitions of any kind, 
should enter. 
Moreover, the aforesaid bishop, Hubert, has presented the original 
charters of former kings, together with the confirmations of thém, to be 
read by us, and declares the same favors to be preserved into modern 
times; but desiring the confirmation of our clemency, he prays that our 
authority may confirm this grant anew to the Monastery. 
Wherefore, having inspected the said charters of former kings, we 
command that neither you, nor your subordinates, nor your successors, 
nor any person having judicial powers shall presume to enter into the 
villages which may at the present time be in possession of that Monas- 
tery, or which hereafter may have been so bestowed by God-fearing 
men, or (may be about to be so bestowed) (?). Let no public officer 
enter for the hearing of causes, or for exacting-fines, or procuring sure- 
ties, or obtaining lodging or entertainment, or making any requisi- 
tions, but in full immunity, even as the favor of former kings has been 
continued down to the present day, so in the future also shall it,

  through our authority, remain undiminished. And if in past times 
through any negligence of Abbots, or lukewarmness of rulers, or the 
presumption of public officers anything has been changed or torn 
away, removed or withdrawn from these immunities, let it be by our 
authority and favor restored. And, further, let neither you nor your 
subordinates presume to infringe or violate what we have granted. 
But if there be any one, Dominus, Comes, Domesticus, Vicarius, or 
one girded with any judicial power whatsoever, by the indulgence of 
the good or by the favor of pious Christians or kings, who shall have 
presumed to infringe ot violate these immunities, let him be punished 
with a fine of six hundred solidi, two parts to go to the library of this 
Monastery, and the third part to be paid into our treasury, so that im- 
pious men may not rejoice in violating that which our ancestors or 
good Christians may have conceded or granted. And whatever our 
treasury may have had a right to expect from this source, shall go to 
the profit of the men of this church of St. Marcellus the martyr, to the 
better establishment of our kingdom and the good of those who shall 
succeed us. 
And that this decree may firmly endure, we have ordered it to be 
confirmed with our own hand under our seal.

  CHAPTER VI 
EDUCATION DURING THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES 
I. CONDITION AND PRESERVATION OF LEARNING 
THE Readings in this chapter deal with the condition of learning 
after the downfall of the Roman Empire, the work of the monas- 
teries in preserving the old pagan learning and the arts of reading 
and writing, and the efforts of Kings Charlemagne and Alfred to 
revive the study of letters in their domains. 
To such a low ebb had all learning declined, after the barbarian 
invasions, that but few schools remained in Gaul and northern 
Italy, and these were needed only for the purposes of the Church. 
All through the early Middle Ages the monasteries or the Church 
offered the only means to an education, and the only type of ca- 
reer for which learning was needed. Parents wishing their-chil- 
dren to follow careers usually gave them to a monastery,—for— 
which gift fixed forms of dedication_(53 a) were used. Beside 
agriculture, various forms of manual labor, and acts of devotion, 
life in a monastery also called for some form of literary labor. 
For most of the monks this meant reading, though a few special- 
ized and became copyists, and some monasteries specialized on 
book copying and thus became the publishers of the Middle Ages. 
The work of copying books is well described in Numbers 54 and 
55, both being chronicles from old monastic writers. Some nun- 
neries also became noted for their book work, the work of one nun 
being described in Reading 56. The preparation and binding of 
books was a long and important process, and the work of the 
monks is well described in the extract from Symonds (57). When 
the manufacture of a book had been completed it was customary 
to inscribe in it an anathema, to protect it from theft. Samples of 
these anathemas are reproduced from Clark (58 a-f). 
During the early part of the Middle Ages learning was better 
preserved in England than on the Continent, and the extracts 
from Bede (59 a-c) and Alcuin (60) give good pictures of the teach- 
ing of Theodore at Canterbury and Albert at York. Alcuin also 
describes the more important books in the celebrated cathedral 
library at York (61).
-P-A-G-E-102
76 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION     
  In 768 a.D., there came to the throne as king of the great 
Frankish nation one of the greatest rulers of all time — Charle- 
magne. Finding learning in a most deplorable condition in his 
kingdom, and realizing the need for training for his clergy, he be- 
gan a series of efforts to bring scholars and teachers into Frank- 
land. The most important man brought in was Alcuin, from York, 
who arrived in 782, and spent the remainder of his life in educa- 
tional labors there. Organizing first a Palace School, he began 
the instruction of Charlemagne’s immediate household. A good 
sample of the instruction prepared for Charlemagne’s son, Pepin, 
is reproduced in Number 62. Under Alcuin’s inspiration a num- 
ber of proclamations on education were issued (64 a-c), and a 
collection of edited sermons (63) was issued to the churches. Af- 
ter fourteen years as Charlemagne’s teacher and minister of edu- 
cation, Alcuin retired to the monastery at Tours, where, as Abbot, 
he spent the remainder of his life in directing the copying of books 
and in training scholars. In a letter to Charlemagne, asking for 
books from England to copy (65), we get a good picture of the de- 
plorable educational conditions of the time, as well as of the old 
man’s thirst for learning. 
England, too, was later ravaged by the Danes, as was northern 
France by the Northmen, and learning fell into decay in both 
places. England especially suffered, and King Alfred, in his In- 
‘ troduction to Pope Gregory’s Pastoral Care (66), gives us a good 
picture of the sad conditions which had come about in his kingdom. 
As Charlemagne, before him, he too was forced to seek scholars 
from abroad (67) to restore learning at home. The education he 
gave his son (68) is indicative of the best training of the time. 
Many of the medieval monasteries grew into large and impor- 
tant institutions, one of the most notable of which was that of 
Saint Gall, in Switzerland. The ground plan of this monastery in 
the ninth century (69) shows what a large institution it had be- 
come, and the description appended reveals the varied activities 
carried on within the walls of one of the larger institutions.

The forms which follow represent examples used in offering a 
child to a monastery, the monastic vows which were taken, and
-P-A-G-E-103

the letter of honorable dismissal which a monk carried with him 
when he transferred from one monastery to another. It is interest- 
ing, as illustrating the continuity of our intellectual life and legal 
procedure, to compare these three forms with the modern forms 
for releasing parentage of .a child for adoption by another, any 
form of modern vow, and the letter of honorable dismissal given 
a college student leaving one college to enter another. 
(a) Form of offering a Child to a Monastery 
The dedication of children to the service of God is sanctioned by the 
example of Abraham and of many other holy men, as related in the 
Old and the New Testaments. Therefore, I, (name) now offer in the 
presence of abbot (name), this my son, (name), to omnipotent God and 
to the Virgin Mary, mother of God, for the salvation of my soul and of 
the soul of my parents. I promise for him that he shall follow the 
monastic life in this monastery of (name), according to the rule of St. 
Benedict, and that from this day forth he shall not withdraw his neck 
from the yoke of this service. I promise also that he shall never be 
tempted to leave by me or by anyone with my consent. 
(6) The Monastic Vow 
I hereby renounce my parents, my brothers and relatives, my 
friends, my possessions and my property, and the vain and empty 
glory and pleasure of this world. I also renounce my own will, for the 
will of God. I accept all the hardships of the monastic life, and take 
the vows of purity, chastity, and poverty, in the hope of heaven; and I 
promise to remain a monk in this monastery all the days of my life. 
(c) Letter of Honorable Dismissal from a Monastery 
This our brother (name), has desired to dwell in another monastery 
where it seems to him that he can best serve the Lord and save his own 
soul. Know ye, therefore, that we have given him permission by this 
letter of dismissal to betake himself thither. 
54. The Copying of Books at a Monastery 
(From Abbot Heriman’s account of the restoration of the monastery of Saint Mar- 
tin, at Tournay, in Flanders; trans. in Maitland, S. R., The Dark Ages, pp. 413-14. 
London, 1844) 
The writer here relates how the first Abbot, who was installed 
in 1093, not being much of a manager, turned the organization 
and direction of the work of the monastery over to the Prior, with 
good results. 
... The abbot greatly rejoiced, and used to thank God, who had given 
him a man that had relieved him from the anxiety and bustle of worldly 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
  78 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
affairs. For, committing to him the whole charge of the external af- 
airs of our monastery, he gave himself up so entirely to the duties of a 
monk, and to silence, that frequently he did not go out of the monas- 
ery for a month together, but, being devoted to reading, he took the 
utmost pains to promote the writing of books. He used, in fact, to 
exult in the number of writers which the Lord had given him; for if you 
ad gone into the cloister, you might in general have seen a dozen 
young monks sitting on chairs in perfect silence, writing at tables care- 
ully and artificially constructed. All Jerome’s Commentaries on the 
Prophets, all the works of Saint Gregory, and everything that he could 
find of Saint Augustine, Ambrose, Isidore, Bede, and the Lord Anselm, 
then Abbot of Bec, and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, he 
caused to be diligently transcribed. So that you would scarcely have 
ound such a library at any monastery in that part of the country, and 
everybody was begging for our copies to correct their own. Our mon- 
astery was at that time in great reputation, and in a high state of 
discipline; for in the whole province of Rheims there were at that 
eriod only three monasteries which followed the customs of Clugni 
—namely, Anchin, Afflighem, and our own. The monastery of Clugni 
at that time excelled all others belonging to the kingdom of the Francs 
in monastic order; for the rigor of the Cistercians had not then sprung 
up, and the Lord Norbert had not as yet been heard of.   55. Work of a Monk in writing and copying Books 
(From Othlonus’ De ipsius tentationibus, varia fortuna, et scriptis; trans. in Maitland, 
S. R., The Dark Ages, pp. 417-19. London, 1844) 
Othlonus, a monk of Saint Emmeram’s, at Ratisbon, born 
about ror3 A.D., has left us an interesting picture of his work as 
author and copyist, which shows how he disposed of the books 
produced. Just what books he copied he does not say, and we do 
not know. 
For the same reason I think it proper to add an account of the great 
knowledge and capacity for writing which was given me by the Lord in 
my childhood. When as yet a little child, I was sent to school, and 
quickly learned my letters; and I began, long before the usual time of 
learning, and without any orders from the master, to learn the art of 
writing. But ina furtive and unusual manner, and without any teacher, 
I attempted to learn that art. From this circumstance I got a habit of 
holding my pen in a wrong manner; nor were any of my teachers after- 
wards able to correct me in that point; for I had become too much 
accustomed to it to be capable of altering. Many who saw this unani- 
mously decided that I should never write well; but, by the grace of God, 
it turned out otherwise, as is known to many persons. For, even in my 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  PRESERVATION OF LEARNING 79 
childhood, and at the time when, together with the other boys, the 
tablet was put into my hands, that I might learn to write, it appeared 
that I had some notion of writing, to the no small surprise of those who 
saw it. Then, after a short time, I began to write so well, and was so 
fond of it, that in the place where I learned, that is, in the monastery of 
Tegernsee, (in Bavaria, almost in a line between Munich and Inn- 
sbruck,) I wrote many books. And being sent into Franconia while I 
was yet a boy, I worked so hard at writing while I was there, that be- 
fore I returned I had nearly lost my sight. This I resolved to mention, 
in the hope that I may excite some others to a similar love of labour; 
and that, by recounting to others the grace of God which had granted 
to me such benefits, I may lead them to magnify that grace of God with 
me. And the better to do this, I think it proper to relate how I la- 
boured in writing afterwards, when I had returned from Franconia, for 
T was there when the Emperor Henry died, and Conrad came to the 
throne (in the year 1024). 
Then, after I came to be a monk in the monastery of St. Emmeram, I 
was soon induced, by the request of some of them, again to occupy my- 
self so much in writing that I seldom got any interval of rest, except on 
festivals, and at such times as work could not be performed. In the 
meantime, there came more work upon me; for, as they saw that I was 
generally reading, or writing, or composing, they made me the school- 
master. By all which things I was, through God’s grace, so fully oc- 
cupied, that I frequently could not allow my body the necessary rest. 
And when I had a mind to compose anything, I very commonly could 
not find time for it, except on holydays, or by night, being tied down to 
the business of teaching the boys, and the transcribing which I had 
been persuaded to undertake. Therefore, beside the books which I 
composed myself, which I wrote to give away for the edification of 
those who asked for them, and of others to whom I gave them unasked, 
I wrote nineteen missals — ten for the abbots and monks in our own 
monastery, four for the brethren at Fulda, five for those in other places; 
three books of the Gospels, and two with the Epistles and Gospels, 
which are called Lectionaries; beside which I wrote four service books 
for matins. Afterwards, old age and infirmity of various kinds hin- 
dered me; especially the tedious interruption which lasted for a very 
long time through various anxieties, and the grief which was caused by 
the destruction of our monastery; but to Him who is the Author of all 
good, and who alone governs all things, and who has vouchsafed to give 
many things to me unworthy, be praise eternal, be honour everlasting. 
I think it right also to relate, as far as I am able to recollect, how 
many books I have given to different monasteries and friends; and 
first I would mention the monks at Fulda, because, as I worked a great 
deal in their monastery, writing many books which I sent to our mon- 
astery, so in ours I wrote out some books which they had not; and, if I 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  80 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
remember right, I sent them seven. To the monks of Hirschfeld, two 
books; and when I returned from those parts and came to Amarbach, I 
gave one to the abbot of that place. Afterwards, being under obliga- 
tion to brother William, I gave him four books, among which there was 
avery valuable missal. To the abbot of Lorsch, one book; to certain 
friends dwelling in Bohemia, four books; toa friend at Passau, one book; 
to the monastery of Tegernsee, two books; to the monastery of Pryel, 
near us, one volume, in which were three books. And also I gave one 
book, and various epistles, to my sister’s son, who was living there. To 
the monastery of Obermunster I gave three books; and to that of 
Nidermunster, one book. Moreover, to many others I gave or sent, at 
different times, sermons, proverbs, and edifying writings. 
56. Work of a Nun in copying Books 
(An account by a monk of Wessobrunn, in Bavaria, written in 1513; trans. in Mait- 
land, S. R., The Dark Ages, pp. 419-21. London, 1844) 
The following selection describes the rather extraordinary 
labors of a nun in copying books, and the type of books she copied. 
Diemudis was formerly a most devout nun of this our monastery of 
Wessobrunn. For our monastery was formerly double, or divided into 
two parts, — that is to say, of monksand nuns. The place of the monks 
was where it now is; but that of the nuns where the parish church now 
stands. This virgin was most skilful in the art of writing. For though 
she is not known to have composed any work, yet she wrote with her 
own hand many volumes in a most beautiful and legible character, both 
for divine service and for the public library of the monastery, which are 
enumerated in a list written by herself in a certain plenarius (missal). 
For in that list the following books pertaining to divine service are 
enumerated: 
A Missal, with the Gradual and Sequences. 
Another Missal, with Gradual and Sequences, which was given to 
the Bishop of Treves. 
Another Missal, with the Epistles, Gospels, Gradual and Sequences. 
Another Missal, with the Epistles and Gospels for the whole year; 
and the Gradual and Sequences, and the entire service for Baptism. 
A Missal, with Epistles and Gospels. 
A Book of Offices. 
Another Book of Offices, with the Baptismal Service, which was given 
to the Bishop of Augsburgh. 
A Book with the Gospels and Lessons. 
A Book with the Gospels. 
A Book with the Epistles. 
These books she wrote, as I have said, for the use and ornament of 
divine service. With the following she adorned our library, of which

only those which are marked thus § still remain there.!_ For the others, 
either through the burning of the monastery, (which is said to have 
happened twice,) or by the negligence and sloth of subsequent monks, 
have perished and are lost; for the list already mentioned specifies the 
following books belonging to the library: 
A Bible, in two volumes, which was given for the estate in Pisinberch. 
A Bible, in three volumes. 
The Morals of Saint Gregory, (that is, his Commentary on Job,) in 
six volumes, the first and third of which are lost.

in which they are put together, that these formed only one volume, 
as also the following:) 
Paschasius on the Body and Blood of Christ; The Conflict of Lan- 
franc with Berengarius; the Martyrdom of Saint Dionysius; The 
Life of Saint Adrian, pope, &c. 
Saint Jerome ‘De Hebraicis Questionibus,’ and many other works by

handmaid of God, Diemudis, to the praise of God and of the holy 
apostles, Peter and Paul, the patrons of this monastery. But at what 
period she lived I could never discover, since, in all the books, (we 
charitably hope from humility,) she omitted to mention her name and 
the time when she finished. 
  57. Scarcity and Cost of Books 
(Symonds, J. A., The Renaissance in Italy, vol. u, pp. 127-29. London, 1888) 
The following short extract from Symonds gives the contents of 
two libraries in northern Italy, and the cost of books before the 
days of printing. 
Scarcity of books was at first a chief impediment to the study of 
antiquity. Popes and princes and even great religious institutions 
possessed far fewer books than many farmers of the present age. The 
library belonging to the Cathedral Church of S. Martino at Lucca in the 
ninth century contained only nineteen volumes of abridgments from 
ecclesiastical ‘commentaries. 
The Cathedral of Novara in 
1212 could boast copies of Boe- 
thius, Priscian, the Code of Jus- 
tinian, the Decretals, and the 
Etymology of Isidorus, besides 
a Bible and some devotional 
treatises. This slender stock 
passed for great riches. Each 
of the precious volumes in such 
a collection was an epitome 
of medieval art. Its pages 
were composed of fine vellum 
adorned with pictures. The 
initial letters displayed elab-

bought a Josephus and Quintus Curtius for forty ducats. His great 
Bible in two volumes is said to have cost 1,375 sequins. Rinaldo 
degli Albizzi notes in his Memoirs that he paid eleven golden florins 
for a Bible at Arezzo in 1406. Of these MSS. the greater part were 
manufactured in the cloisters. 
58. Anathemas to Protect Books from Theft 
(From Clark, J. W., The Care of Books, pp. 77-78. London, rgor) 
In addition to chaining books with heavy rod and chains to 
- their case, it was customary to inscribe an anathema in the volume, 
further to protect them against removal. The following are ex- 
amples of such inscriptions. 
(a) This book belongs to S. Maximin at his monastery of Micy, 
which abbat Peter caused to be written, and with his own labour cor- 
rected and punctuated, and on Holy Thursday dedicated to God and 
S. Maximin on the altar of S. Stephen, with this imprecation that he 
who should take it away from thence by what device soever, with the 
intention of not restoring it, should incur damnation with the traitor 
Judas, with Annas, Caiaphas, and Pilate. Amen. 
(6) Should any one by craft or any device whatever abstract’ this 
book from this place (Jumiéges) may his soul suffer, in retribution for 
what he has done, and may his name be erased from the book of the 
living and not be recorded among the Blessed. 
(c) This book belongs to S. Alban. May whoever steals it from him 
or destroys its title be anathema. Amen. 
(d) May whoever steals or alienates this manuscript, or scratches out 
its title, be anathema. Amen. 
(e) May whoever destroys this title, or by gift or sale or loan or ex- 
change or theft or by any other device knowingly alienates this book 
from the aforesaid Christ Church, incur in this life the malediction of 
Jesus Christ and of the most glorious Virgin His Mother, and of the 
Blessed Thomas, Martyr. Should however it please Christ, who is 
patron of Christ Church, may his soul be saved in the Day of Judgment.

59. The Venerable Bede on Education in Early England 
(Bede, Ecclesiastical History of England; edited by C. Plummer, book tv, 1, 2, 20) 
The Venerable Bede (673-735), a famous scholar and historian 
and the author of many books, was a lifelong student at the twin 
monasteries of Wearmouth and_ Yarrow, in North Britain. In 
his Ecclesiastical History of England he has left us our chief picture 
of education in England in his time. The following selections are 
illustrative. 
(a) The Learning of Theodore 
Now there was in the monastery of Niridanum, which is not far, 
from Naples in Campania, abbot Hadrian, an African by birth, well 
learned in sacred literature, and versed in both monastic and ecclesias- 
tical discipline, and highly skilled in the Greek equally with the Latin 
tongue. ... 
There was at the same time (668 A.D.) in Rome a monk known to 
Hadrian, whose name was Theodore, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, a man 
instructed in secular and divine literature both Greek and Latin; of 
approved character and venerable age, that is, about 66 years old. 
Hadrian suggested him to the Pope to be ordained bishop, and the sug- 
gestion was adopted. 4 
(b) Theodore’s Work for the English Churches 
Theodore then arrived at his church in the second year after his con- 
secration, on Sunday, 27 May (670 A.D.), and lived in it 21 years, 3 
months and 26 days. He soon travelled through the whole island, 
wherever it was inhabited by the English race. For he was willingly 
received and listened to by every one, and everywhere in the company 
and with the assistance of Hadrian he sowed the right rule of life, the 
canonical rite for the celebration of Easter. And he was the first of the 
archbishops to whom the whole English church consented to do fealty. 
And because, as we have said, both were abundantly learned both in 
sacred and profane literature, rivers of saving knowledge daily flowed 
from them to irrigate the hearts of the band of pupils whom they 
brought together, insomuch that they passed on to their hearers the 
knowledge even of the art of metre, of astronomy and of ecclesiastical 
arithmetic, together with volumes of the sacred text. A proof of this is’ 
that even to-day (c. A.D. 731) some of their pupils are still living, who 
know the Latin and Greek languages as well as their native tongue. 
Never since the English came to Britain were there happier times than 
these, in which, under brave and Christian kings, they were a terror to 
all barbarian tribes, when the aspirations of all hung on the lately re- 
vealed joys of the kingdom of heaven, and every one who wished to 
become learned in holy Writ, had masters at hand to teach him.
-P-A-G-E-111
  PRESERVATION OF LEARNING 85 
Besides, they thenceforth began to learn in all the churches of the 
English the notes of ecclesiastical chants, which hitherto they had only 
known in Kent. The first singing master (except James whom we men- 
tioned above) in the Northumbrian churches was Stephen Aiddi, who 
was invited from Kent by the. venerable Wilfred, who was the first 
among the bishops of English birth to teach the catholic method of life 
to the churches of the English. 
(c) How Albinus succeeded Abbot Hadrian 
In the fifth year of King Osred, the most reverend father abbot 
Hadrian, fellow-worker in the word of God with bishop Theodore of 
blessed memory, died. Among other proofs of his learning and that of 
Theodore is this, that his pupil Albinus, who succeeded him in the rule 
of the monastery, was so advanced in the study of literature, that he 
had no small knowledge of the Greek language and knew the Latin 
tongue as well as that of the English, which was his native tongue. 
60. Alcuin’s Description of the School at York 
(On the Saints of the Church at York; trans. by James Rai) 
The cathedral school at York, England, was one of the oldest of 
the English schools. In 732 Egbert became archbishop of York, 
and the scholasticus of the school under him was Aélbert or Ethel- 
bert. He raised the school to a place of first importance. Alcuin, 
born about 735, entered the cathedral school as a child, was taught 
by Z:lbert, and later became master of the school himself. In one 
of his poems he has described the instruction under Aélbert. The 
whole medieval curriculum will be noted in this description. 
Bide with me for a while, I pray ye, youth of York, while I proceed 
with poetic steps to treat of him, because here he often drenched your 
senses with nectar, pouring forth sweet juices from his honey-flowing 
bosom. Fairest Philosophy took him from his very cradle and bore 
him to the topmost towers of learning, opening to him the hidden things 
of wisdom. He was born of ancestors of sufficient note, by whose care 
he was soon sent to kindly school, and entered at the Minster in his 
early years, that his tender age might grow up with holy understanding. 
Nor was his parents’ hope in vain; even as a boy as he grew in body so 
he became proficient in the understanding of books. 
Then pious and wise, teacher at once and priest, he was made a 
colleague of Bishop Egbert, to whom he was nearly allied by right of 
blood. By him he is made advocate of the clergy, and at the same time 
is preferred as master in the city of York. 
There he moistened thirsty hearts with diverse streams of teaching 
and the varied dews of learning, giving to these the art of the science of 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
es 
86 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
grammar, pouring on those the rivers of rhetoric. Some he polished on 
the whetstone of law, some he taught to sing together in Zonian chant, 
making others play on the flute of Castaly, and run with the feet of 
lyric poets over the hills of Parnassus. Others the said master made to 
know the harmony of heaven, the labours of sun and moon, the five 
belts of the sky, the seven planets, the laws of the fixed stars, their ris- 
ing and setting, the movements of the air, the quaking of sea and earth, 
the nature of men, cattle, birds and beasts, the divers kinds of numbers 
and various shapes. He gave certainty to the solemnity of Easter’s 
return; above all, opening the mysteries of holy writ and disclosing the 
abysses of the rude and ancient law. Whatever youths he saw of con- 
spicuous intelligence, those he joined to himself, he taught, he fed, he 
loved; and so the teacher had many disciples in the sacred volumes, ad- 
vanced in various arts. Soon he went in triumph abroad, led by the 
love of wisdom, to see if he could in find other lands anything novel in 
books or schools, which he could bring home with him. He went also 
devoutly to the city of Romulus, rich in God’s love, wandering far and 
wide through the holy places. Then returning home, he was received 
everywhere by kings and princes as a prince of doctors, whom great 
kings tried to keep that he might irrigate their lands with learning. But 
the master hurrying to his appointed work, returned home to his father- 
land by God’s ordinance. For no sooner had he been borne to his own 
shores, than he was compelled to take on him the pastoral care, and 
made high priest at the people’s demand. . . . 
61. Alcuin’s Catalogue of the Cathedral Library at York 
(On the Saints of the Church of York; trans. by West) 
On the death of Egbert, Archbishop of York, in 766, Alcuin was 
given charge of the cathedral library. then a famous one for its 
time. Ina continuation of the preceding poem, Alcuin has left a 
sort of metrical catalogue of its more important volumes, which 
has been rendered into English verse by Professor West. 
There shalt thou find the volumes that contain 
All of the ancient fathers who remain; 
There all the Latin writers make their home 
With those that glorious Greece transferred to Rome, — 
The Hebrews draw from their celestial stream, 
And Africa is bright with learning’s beam. 
Here shines what Jerome, Ambrose, Hilary thought, 
Or Athanasius and Augustine wrought.

Near Basil and Fulgentius coruscate.

(From Alcuin’s Disputation of Pepin, the Most Noble and Royal Youth, with

63. Charlemagne sends out an Edited Collection of Sermons for 
Use throughout the Year 
To enable the churches to conduct their services better, 
Charlemagne had prepared a number of copies of sermons and
-P-A-G-E-115

PRESERVATION OF LEARNING 89 
lesson-readings, ‘‘in two volumes, suitable for the whole year,” 
which he sent out in 786, accompanied by the following letter. 
Charles, confiding in the aid of God, King of the Franks and Lom- 
bards, and Patrician of the Romans, to the religious lectors subject to 
our power. 
Since the divine clemency always guards us at home and abroad, in 
the issues of war or in the tranquillity of peace, though human insignifi- 
cance is in no way able to pay back his benefits, nevertheless, because 
our God is inestimable in his mercy, He approves benignly the good- 
will of those devoted to His service. Therefore, because we take care 
constantly to improve the condition of our churches, we have striven 
with watchful zeal to advance the cause of learning, which has been 
almost forgotten by the negligence of our ancestors; and, by our exam- 
ple, also we invite those whom we can to master the study of the liberal 
arts. Accordingly, God aiding us in all things, we have already cor- 
rected carefully all the books of the Old and New Testaments, cor- 
rupted by the ignorance of the copyists. 
Incited, moreover, by the example of our father Pippin, of venerated 
memory, who by his zeal decorated all the churches of the Gauls with 
the songs of the Roman church, we are careful by our skill to make these 
churches illustrious by a series of excellent lectionaries. Finally be- 
cause we have found the lectionaries for the nocturnal offices, compiled 
by the fruitless labor of certain ones, in spite of their correct intention, 
unsuitable because they were written without the words of their authors 
and were full of an infinite number of errors, we cannot suffer in our 
days discordant solecisms to glide into the sacred lessons among the 
holy offices, and we purpose to improve these lessons. And we have 
entrusted this work to Paul the deacon, our friend and client. We have 
directed him to peruse carefully the sayings of the catholic fathers and 
to choose, so to speak, from the most broad meadows of their writings 
certain flowers, and from the most useful to form, as it were, a single 
garland. He, desiring to obey devoutly our highness, has read through 
the treatises and sermons of the different catholic fathers, has chosen 
from each the best, and has presented to us in two volumes lessons 
suitable for the whole year and for each separate festival, and free from 
error. We have examined the text of all these with our wisdom, we 
have established these volumes by our authority, and we deliver them 
to your religion to be read in the churches of Christ. 
64. Charlemagne’s General Proclamations as to Education 
(Trans. by Munro, D. C., in his Laws of Charles the Great) 
Issued by Charlemagne, in 787, to the abbots of the different 
monasteries, reproving their illiteracy and exhorting them to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  90 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
study of letters. This has been called “the first general charter of 
education for the Middle Ages.” Only the copy of the Proclama- 
tion addressed to the Abbot Baugulf of Fulda has escaped de- 
struction. This reads as follows: 
  (a) The Proclamation of 787.A.D. 
Charles, by the grace of God, King of the Franks and Lombards and 
Patrician of the Romans, to Abbot Baugulf and to all the congregation, 
also the faithful committed to you, we have directed a loving greeting 
by our ambassadors in the name of omnipotent God. 
Be it known, therefore, to your devotion pleasing to God, that we, 
together with our faithful, have considered it to be useful that the 
bishoprics and monasteries entrusted by the favor of Christ to our con- 
trol, in addition to the order of monastic life and the intercourse of holy 
religion, in the culture of letters also ought to be zealous in teaching 
those who by the gift of God are able to learn, according to the capacity 
of each individual, so that just as the observance of the rule imparts 
order and grace to honesty of morals, so also zeal in teaching and learn- 
ing may do the same for sentences, so that those who desire to please 
God by living rightly should not neglect to please him also by speaking 
correctly. For it is written: “ Either from thy words thou shalt be jus- 
tified or from thy words thou shalt be condemned.” (Matthew, xii, 37.) 
For although correct conduct may be better than knowledge, neverthe- 
less knowledge precedes conduct. Therefore, each one ought to study 
what he desires to accomplish, so that so much the more fully the mind 
may know what ought to be done, as the tongue hastens in the praises 
of omnipotent God without the hindrances of errors. For since errors 
should be shunned by all men, so much the more ought they to be 
avoided as far as possible by those who are chosen for this very purpose 
alone, so that they ought to be the especial servants of truth. 
For when in the years just passed letters were often written to us 
from several monasteries in which it was stated that the brethren who 
dwelt there offered up in our behalf sacred and pious prayers, we have 
recognized in most of these letters correct thoughts and uncouth ex- 
pressions; because what pious devotion dictated faithfully to the mind, 
the tongue, uneducated on account of the neglect of study, was not able 
to express in the letter without error. Whence it happened that we 
began to fear lest perchance, as the skill in writing was less, so also the 
wisdom for understanding the Holy Scriptures might be much less than 
it rightly ought to be. And we all know well that, though errors of 
speech are dangerous, far more dangerous are errors of the under- 
standing. 
Therefore, we exhort you not only not to neglect the study of letters, 
but also with most humble mind, pleasing to God, to study earnestly in
-P-A-G-E-117
  PRESERVATION OF LEARNING 91 
order that you may be able more easily and more correctly to penetrate 
the mysteries of the divine Scriptures. Since, moreover, images, 
trophes and similar figures are found in the sacred pages, no one doubts 
that each one in reading these will understand the spiritual sense more 
quickly if previously he shall have been fully instructed in the mastery 
of letters. Such men truly are to be chosen for this work as have both 
the will and the ability to learn and a desire to instruct others. And 
may this be done with a zeal as great as the earnestness with which we 
commend it. For we desire you to be, as it is fitting that soldiers of the 
church should be, devout in mind, learned in discourse, chaste in con- 
duct and eloquent in speech, so that whosoever shall seek to see you out 
of reverence for God, or on account of your reputation for holy con- 
duct, just as he is edified by your appearance, may also be instructed 
by your wisdom, which he has learned from your reading or singing, 
and may go away joyfully giving thanks to omnipotent God. Do not 
neglect, therefore, if you wish to have our favor, to send copies of this 
letter to all your suffragans and fellow-bishops and to all the monas- 
teries. (And let no monk hold courts outside of his monastery or go to 
the judicial and other public assemblies. Farewell. (Legens valeat.)) 
In 789 Charlemagne supplemented the above with the following 
general admonition: 
(b) The Proclamation of 789 A.D. 
And we also demand of your holiness that the ministers of the altar 
of God shall adorn their ministry by good manners, and likewise the 
other orders who observe a rule and the congregations of monks. We 
implore them to lead a just and fitting life, just as God Himself com- 
manded in the Gospel. “Let your light so shine before men that they 
may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven,” 
so that by their example many may be led to serve God; and let them 
join and associate to themselves not only children of servile condition, 
but also sons of free men. And let schools be established.in which 
boys may learn to read. Correct carefully the Psalms, the signs in 
writing (notas), the songs, the calendar, the grammar, in each monas- 
tery or bishopric, and the catholic books; because often some desire to 
pray to God properly, but they pray badly because of the incorrect 
books. And do not permit your boys to corrupt them in reading or 
writing. If there is need of writing the Gospel, Psalter and Missal, let 
men of mature age do the writing with all diligence. 
(c) In 802 he ordered further: 
(We will and command) that laymen shall learn thoroughly the 
creed and the Lord’s prayer. 
These three dociments reveal a deep interest in the improve-

ment of the learning of the clergy, and a large vision as to needs in 
that uncouth and illiterate age. The hand that prepared them 
was doubtless Alcuin’s, though they appear in the name of Charle- 
magne. 
65. Letter from Alcuin to Charlemagne 
(Alcuin’s Letters; trans. by C. W. Colby) 
In 796, Charlemagne appointed Alcuin Abbot of the monastery 
of Saint Martin’s at Tours, after fourteen years’ service as head of 
the palace school at the Frankish court. Alcuin was now sixty- 
one years old, and he spent the remaining eight years of his life 
here as Abbot, largely engaged in supervising the work of copying 
books. This letter, written to Charlemagne in 796, shortly after 
taking up his work at Tours, is interesting as describing his work 
in Frankland. In it he contrasts the learning with that of his 
homeland, and appeals for books to copy. His praise of wisdom 
and frequent quotations from Scripture are characteristic of the 
man. 
But I, your Flaccus,' am doing as you have urged and wished. To 
some who are beneath the roof of Saint Martin I am striving to dis- 
pense the honey of Holy Scripture; others I am eager to intoxicate with 
the old wine of ancient learning; others again I am beginning to feed 
with the apples of grammatical refinement; and there are some whom I 
long to adorn with the knowledge of astronomy, as a stately house is 
adorned with a painted roof. Iam made all things to all men that Imay 
instruct many to the profit of God’s Holy Church and to the lustre of 
your imperial reign. So shall the grace of Almighty God toward me be 
not in vain and the largess of your bounty be of no avail. But I your 
servant lack in part the rarer books of scholastic lore which in my 
native land I had, thanks to the unsparing labour of my master and a 
little also to my own toil. This I tell your excellency on the chance 
that in your boundless and beloved wisdom you may be pleased to 
have me send some of our youths to take thence what we need, and re- 
turn to France with the flowers of Britain; that the garden may not be 
confined to York alone but may bear fruit in Tours, and that the south 
wind blowing over the gardens of the Loire may be charged with per- 
fume. Then shall it be once more as is said in Solomon’s Song from 
which I quote: “Let my beloved come into his garden and eat his 
pleasant fruits.” And he shall say to his young men: “Eat, O friends; 
1 The members of that literary circle which formed itself about Charlemagne and 
Alcuin assumed among themselves Hebrew or Greek or Latin names. Charlemagne 
himself was David; Alcuin, Horatius Flaccus; Angilbert, Homer; Enginhard, Cal-

. drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved. I sleep, but my heart 
waketh.” Or that sentence of the prophet Isaiah which encourages us 
to learn wisdom: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, 
and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine 
and milk without money and without price.” 
This is a matter which has not escaped your most noble notice, how 
through all the pages of Holy Scripture we are urged to learn wisdom. 
In toiling toward the happy life nothing is more lofty, nothing more 
pleasant, nothing bolder against vices, nothing more praiseworthy in 
every place of dignity; and moreover, according to the words of philos- 
ophers, nothing is more essential to government, nothing more helpful 
in leading a moral life, than the beauty of wisdom, the praise of learn- 
ing and thé advantages of scholarship. Whence also wisest Solomon 
exclaims in its praise. ‘For wisdom is better than all things of price 
and no object of desire is to be compared with her. She exalts the meek, 
she brings honours to the great. Kings reign by her aid, and lawgivers 
decree justice. Happy are they who keep her ways, and happy are 
they who watch at her gates daily.””. O Lord King, exhort the youths 
who are in your excellency’s palace to learn wisdom with all their might, 
and to gain it by daily toil while they are yet in the flush of youth, so 
that they may be deemed worthy to grow grey in honour, and by the 
help of wisdom may reach everlasting happiness. But I, according to 
the measure of my little talent, shall not be slothful to sow the seeds of 
wisdom among your servants in this region, mindful of the saying, “In 
the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thy hand: 
for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or 
whether they both alike shall be good.” 
In the morning I sowed in Britain studies which have flourished for 
a generation. Now as it were towards even I do not cease with blood 
grown cold to sow in Francia. And in both places I hope that by the 
Grace of God the seed may spring. The solace of my broken strength 
is this saying of Saint Jerome who in his letter to Nepotian has it: 
“Almost all the strength of an old man’s body is changed and wisdom 
alone grows as the rest dwindles.” And a little later: “The old age of 
those who have trained their youth in honest arts and have meditated 
in the law of the Lord day and night, becomes more learned with age, 
more polished by use, wiser by the lapse of time, and reaps the sweetest 
fruits of studies long grown old.” In which letter whoever wishes may 
read much in praise of wisdom and the studies of the ancients, and may 
learn how the ancient sought to flourish in the beauty of wisdom. 
Eyer advance toward this wisdom, beloved of God and praiséworthy 
on earth, and delight to recognize zeal; and adorn a nobility of worldly 
lineage with the greater nobility of the mind. In which may our Lord 
Jesus Christ, who is the virtue and wisdom of God, guard thee, exalt thee. 
and make thee enter the glory of his blessed and everlasting vision.

  66. State of Learning in England in Alfred’s Time 
(From King Alfred’s Introduction to the Anglo-Saxon translation of Pastoral Care, 
by Pope Gregory the Great. English Text Society version, p. 2. Sweet, 1871) 
This shows how learning in England had decayed since the days 
when Alcuin was at York, due to the plundering and pillaging by 
the Danes. England had once supplied scholars to Frankland, 
but must now seek them abroad. King Alfred (king from 871 to 
gor) gives here a remarkable picture of the conditions of his time. 
King Alfred bids greet Bishop 
Waerferth with loving words 
and with friendship; and I let 
it be known to thee that it has 
very often come into my mind 
what wise men there formerly 
were throughout England, both 
of sacred and secular orders; 
and what happy times there 
were then; and how the kings 
who had power over the nation 
in those days obeyed God and 
his ministers; how they pre- 
served peace, morality, and or- 
der at home, and at the same 
time enlarged their territory 
abroad; and how they pros- 
pered both in war and in wis-

From which he delivered it.” So general became the decay 
of learning in England that 
there were very few on this side of the Humber who could understand 
the rituals in English, or translate a letter from Latin into English; and 
I believe that there were not many beyond the Humber. There were so 
few, in fact, that I cannot remember a single person south of the Thames 
when I came to the throne. Thanks be to God Almighty that we now
-P-A-G-E-121
  PRESERVATION OF LEARNING 95 
have some teachers among us. And therefore I command thee to disen- 
gage thyself, as I believe thou art willing, from worldly matters as often 
as thou art able, that thou mayst apply the wisdom which God has given 
thee wherever thou canst. Consider what punishments would come 
upon us if we neither loved wisdom ourselves nor suffered other men to 
obtain it: we should love the name only of Christian, and very few of the 
Christian virtues. 
When I thought of all this I remembered also how I saw the country 
before it had been ravaged and burned; how the churches throughout 
the whole of England stood filled with treasures and books. There was 
also a great multitude of God’s servants, but they had very little 
knowledge of the books, for they could not understand anything of 
them because they were not written in their own language. As if they 
had said: “Our forefathers, who formerly held these places, loved wis- 
dom, and through it they obtained wealth and bequeathed it to us. In 
this we can still see their traces, but we cannot follow them, and there- 
fore we have lost both the wealth and the wisdom, because we would 
not incline our hearts after their example.” 
When I remembered all this, I wondered extremely that the good and 
wise men who were formerly all over England, and had learned perfectly 
all the books, did not wish to translate them into their own language. 
But again I soon answered myself and said, ‘Their own desire for 
learning was so great that they did not suppose that men would ever be 
so careless, and that learning would so decay; and they wished, more- 
over, that the wisdom in this land might increase with our knowledge 
of languages.” Then I remembered how the law was first known in 
Hebrew, and when the Greeks had learned it how they translated the 
whole of it into their own language, and all other books besides. And 
again the Romans, when they had learned it, translated the whole of it, 
through learned interpreters, into their own language. And also all 
other Christian nations translated a part of it into their own language. 
Therefore it seems better to me, if you agree, for us also to trans- 
late some of the books into the language which we can all understand; 
and for you to see to it, as can easily be done if we have tranquillity 
enough, that all the free-born youth now in England, who are rich 
enough to be able to devote themselves to it, be set to learn as long as 
they are not fit for any other occupation, until that they are well able 
to read English writing; and let those afterwards be taught more in the 
Latin language who are to continue learning, and be promoted to a 
higher rank. 
When I remembered how the knowledge of Latin had decayed 
throughout England, and yet that many could read English writing, I 
began, among other various and manifold troubles of this kingdom, to 
translate into English the book which is called in Latin Pastoralis, and 
in English Shepherd’s Book, sometimes word by word, and sometimes

according to the sense, as I had learned it from Plegmund, my arch- 
bishop, and Asser, my bishop, and Grimbold, my mass-priest, and 
John, my mass-priest. And when I had learned it, as I could best un- 
derstand it and most clearly interpret it, I translated it into English. 
I will send a copy of this to every bishopric in my kingdom; and on 
each copy there shall be a clasp worth fifty mancuses. And I command, 
in God’s name, that no man take the clasp from the book, or the book 
from the minster. It is uncertain how long there may be such learned 
bishops, as thanks be to God there now are nearly everywhere; there- 
fore I wish these copies always to remain in their places, unless the 
bishop wishes to take them with him, or they be lent out anywhere, or 
any one wish to make a copy of them. 
67. Alfred obtains Scholars from abroad 
(Asser’s Life of Alfred the Great; trans. by J. A. Giles, p. 70. London, 1885) 
Asser, the companion and friend of the king, here describes his 
efforts to obtain scholars from Mercia (west central England, 
which had been overrun by the Danes) and from Frankland. 
But God at that time, as some consolation to the king’s benevolence, 
yielding to his complaint, sent certain lights to illuminate him, namely, 
Werefrith, bishop of the church of Worcester, a man well versed in di- 
vine scripture, who, by the king’s command, first turned the books of 
the Dialogues of Pope Gregory and Peter, his disciple, from Latin into 
Saxon, and sometimes putting sense for sense, interpreted them with 
clearness and elegance. After him was Plegmund, a Mercian by birth, 
archbishop of the church of Canterbury, a venerable man, and en- 
dowed with wisdom; Ethelstan also, and Werewulf, his priests and 
chaplains, Mercians by birth and erudite. These four had been in- 
vited out of Mercia by King Alfred, who exalted them with many hon- 
ours and powers in the kingdom of the West-Saxons, besides the privi- 
leges which archbishop Plegmund and bishop Werefrith enjoyed in 
Mercia.” By their teaching and wisdom the king’s desires increased 
unceasingly, and were gratified. Night and day, whenever he had 
leisure, he commanded such men as these to read books to him; for he 
never suffered himself to be without one of them, wherefore he pos- 
sessed a knowledge of every book... . 
But the king’s commendable avarice could not be gratified even in 
this; wherefore he sent messengers beyond the sea to Gaul, to procure 
teachers, and he invited from thence Grimbald, priest and monk, a 
venerable man and good singer, adorned with every kind of ecclesias- 
tical discipline and good morals, and most learned in holy scripture. 
He also obtained from thence John, also priest and monk, a man of 
most energetic talents; and learned in all kinds of literary science, and
-P-A-G-E-123

skilled in many other arts. By the teaching of these men the king’s 
mind was much enlarged, and he enriched and honoured them with 
much influence. 
68. The Education of the Son of King Alfred 
(Asser’s Life of Alfred the Great; trans. by J. A. Giles, p. 68. London, 1885) 
Asser was Bishop of Sherborne and a familiar friend of the 
king. He died about 909. The following extract gives a picture 
of the kind of education given Alfred’s son, Ethelwerd, and doubt- 
less represents the best of the possible training at that time. 
Ethelwerd, the youngest (of Alfred’s children), by the divine coun- 
sels and the admirable prudence of the king, was consigned to the 
schools of learning where, with the children of almost all the nobility of 
the country, and many also who were not noble, he prospered under the 
diligent care of his teachers. Books in both languages, namely Latin 
and Saxon, were read in the school. They also learned to write, so that 
before they were of an age to practice manly arts, namely, hunting and 
such pursuits as befit noblemen, they became studious and clever in the 
liberal arts. Edward and Ethelswitha were bred up in the king’s court 
and received great attention from their attendants and nurses; nay, 
they continue to this day, with the love of all about them, and showing 
affability, and even gentleness, towards all, both natives and foreigners, 
and in complete subjection to their father; nor, among their other 
studies which appertain to this life and are fit for noble youths, are they 
suffered to pass their time idly and unprofitably without learning the 
liberal arts; for they have carefully learned the Psalms and Saxon 
books, especially the Saxon poems, and are continually in the habit of 
making use of books. 
69. Ninth-Century Plan of the Monastery at Saint Gall 
(After an old plan, reconstructed by Professor Robert Willis, Arch. Jour., v, 86) 
This monastery was located at Saint Gall, in the canton of that 
name, in Switzerland. In 614 a.p. an Irish hermit, Saint Gall, 
built his cell in the thick forest there, and lived there until his 
death, in 640. It then became a shrine for pilgrims, and about 
750 was transformed into a Benedictine monastery. This monas- 
tery grew rapidly, and for the next three centuries was one of the 
chief seats of learning and education in Europe. The plan of the 
monastery, at the height of its development, is reproduced on the 
following page, and the explanation given below the plan will 
make it intelligible.

  CHAPTER VII 
EDUCATION DURING THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES 
II. SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 
Tue Readings of this chapter deal with the same period following 
the downfall of Roman authority as did the preceding chapter, but 
with the different types of schools established and the kind of 
education provided by the Church to enable it to meet the needs 
of the age, and help it in its struggle against barbarism. 
The first selection, from Leach (vo), clearly distinguishes be- 
tween two types of schools — the song and the grammar schools; 
while the one from Mullinger (71) does the same for the monastic 
and the episcopal (or cathedral) schools. The latter also mentions 
the more famous schools of each type during the early Middle 
Ages. Selection 72 outlines the duties of the different cathedral 
officers, particularly those of the Precentor and the Schoolmaster. 
Another type of later Middle-Age educational foundation is de- 
scribed in the selection (73), relating to the grants for founding a 
chantry school. These chantry grants began about the close of 
the period under consideration, were later extended to include 
grammar schools (142), and became quite common during the 
later Middle Ages. 
The subject-matter of instruction was naturally a survival from 
the old Roman schools, and was known as the Seven Liberal Arts. 
The selection from Rhabanus Maurus, describing each of these 
Seven Liberal Arts (74 a-g), gives a good outline of the uses and 
subject-matter of each of these great mediaeval disciplines, and 
reveals the meager scope of the learning of the time. The Collo- 
quy of Abbot Aélfric (75) is a good sample of the simple Latin 
reading matter in common use, as a sort of reading primer, before 
taking up classical or sacred writings following the study of gram- 
mar. 
During the early Middle Ages the great subject of study was 
Grammar, and the importance of a study of this fundamental art 
is well set forth in the extract from Quintilian (76). That but 
little could have been done, during this time, in the arts having a 
scientific basis, due to the very meager general knowledge of the

  100 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
~ day even among the so-called learned classes, is well evidenced by 
the two extracts from the thirteenth-century Encyclopedia of 
Bartholomew Anglius (77 a-b), relating to the chemical elements 
and:the movements of the planets. That this book continued to 
be translated into the vernaculars, and to be reissued for three 
centuries after its first compilation, tells much as to the need it 
met and filled. The selection from Cott, listing a tenth-century 
schoolmaster’s books (78), is also interesting as showing the mea- 
ger library, both in number of volumes and scope of subject- 
matter, of a scholar of the time. 
The struggle of the Church to enforce law and order during this 
period was a long and a difficult one. One of the means tried was 
that of the proclamation of a Truce of God. One of the earliest of 
these, declaring three bloodless days a week, is reproduced (79). 
Another means was the adoption and sanctification of chivalry, 
which was used to refine and civilize the barbarian nobility. A 
good description of such utilization of chivalry by the Church is 
given in the selection reproduced from Gautier (80). For the 
peasant and serf the educational influence of the Church was 
exercised largely through its services, a good description of which 
is given by Draper (81). 
Toward the latter part of the darkest period of the Middle Ages 
the Church, having established itself as the master, and seeing 
that the tide was turning, began to exercise a mild pressure for 
some form of education for certain of the sons of freemen. A good 
example of this is reproduced from the Statutes of Winchester 
Diocese, in England (82). The Church also evolved a supervisory 
system for the schools it had created, under a supervising princi- 
pal (Scholasticus; Precentor), and with teachers’ licenses (83), 
legal forms for appointment (84 a), and oaths of office (84 b) to be 
subscribed to before entering upon the duties of a position. These 
forms are the precursors of the teacher’s certificate, notice of 
appointment, and contract of to-day. 
70. Song and Grammar Schools in Engiand 
(Leach, A. F., The Schools of Medieval England, p. 6. London, 1915) 
The writer from whom the following selection is taken is a fore- 
most English authority on the history of early education in Eng- 
land. Of the song and grammar schools he writes:

These Song Schools became even more general than the Grammar 
Schools. The Song School at Rochester is expressly mentioned by 
Bede in Theodore’s time as being derived from Canterbury. Putta, 
whom Archbishop Theodore found at Rochester, and made bishop

(After Wright, Homes of Other Days, p. 130) 
In the original cut the bench on which the scholars are seated forms a 
complete circle. To the left are two writers, while to the right is the teacher, 
who seems to be lecturing. In the center is the teacher’s desk 
there, is described ‘‘as well instructed in ecclesiastical learning, .°. . 
and especially skilled in the art of chanting in church after the Roman 
fashion, which he had learnt from the pupils of the blessed Pope Greg- 
ory himself.” This Putta, when Rochester was ravaged by the King 
of Mercia in 675, settled down as a simple parish priest in Mercia and 
went about “teaching church singing (ecclesie@ carmina) wherever he 
was asked.” F 
The twin schools of Grammar and Song, which have often been con- 
founded as if they were one school, are found side by side in connexion 
with all the great churches, that is in all the great centers of population, 
from the age of Augustine and Ethelbert to the age of Cranmer and 
Edward VI, as distinct foundations, completely differentiated in func- 
tion as they were in their teaching, and generally in their government. 
In small places they were sometimes united under one master. Though 
as late as 1519 a school-author, who had been Headmaster first of Eton 
and then of Winchester, William Horman, asserted in echo of Quintil- 
ian, himself copying the Greeks, that, without a knowledge of music, 
grammar cannot be perfect, yet the teaching of singing and music, so

  often rashly asserted to be the main work of the pre-Reformation 
school, and the Song Schools which gave it, were always subordinate 
and secondary to the teaching of Grammar and the Grammar School. 
To a large extent the Song Schools performed the function of Elemen- 
tary Schools, while the Grammar Schools were the Secondary Schools, 
and, before the days of Universities, gave university orthigher educa- 
tion as well. 
71. The Episcopal and Monastic Schools 
(Mullinger, J. B., The Schools of Charles the Great, pp. 130-33. London, 1877) 
The first study of any importance in English of the work of 
Charlemagne and Alcuin was the one from which the following 
selection is taken, a book now difficult to obtain. Mr. Mullinger 
here contrasts the work of the episcopal and monastic schools, and 
throws much light on educational conditions during the early 
medizval period. 
From this time (817), we are accordingly able to distinguish, with 
somewhat more precision, the different training of the monastic and 
episcopal schools. Of the latter, indeed, throughout the ninth century, 
it is impossible to give much more than a conjectural account, as there 
existed fio systematic organization. Léon Maitre, in his endeavor to 
supply the want, presents us with a series of confused gleanings, the 
greater part of which apply evidently to the schools of the monasteries. 
Close to the cathedral precincts, and under the immediate supervision 
of the bishop, a school for boys, all destined to become priests, was con- 
fided to the care of one of the canons, known from his office as the 
scholasticus. .. . 
The education provided in these schools may be described as a kind 
of minor to the Benedictine major. In the range of subjects it prob- 
ably went little beyond the teaching of the schools of Cassian, but its 
method was more careful and efficient. We may picture to ourselves a 
group of lads seated on the floor, which was strewn with clean straw, 
their waxen tablets in their hands, and busily engaged in noting down 
the words read by the scholasticus from his manuscript volume. So 
rarely did the pupil, in those days, gain access to a book, that to read 
(legere) became synonymous with to teach. The scholars traced the 
words on their tablets, and afterwards, when their notes had been cor- 
rected by the master, transferred them to a little parchment volume, 
the treasured depository, with many, of nearly all the learning they 
managed to acquire in life. We have already investigated the probable 
extent and character of that learning, and it may safely be assumed that 
in the cathedral school the customary limits were seldom passed. In 
the ninth century, at least, only two examples of Church education in

Frankland stand forth as examples of a higher culture — the one, that 
at Orleans, under Theodulfus; the other, that at Rheims. 
The lively interest taken by Theodulfus in everything that related to 
the education of his day is attested by numerous facts, . . . Ably sec- 
onded by the poet Wulfin, Theodulfus raised the school at Orleans to 
considerable eminence. It became especially famous for the number, 
beauty, and accuracy of its 
manuscripts. t 
‘Yet more renowned was the 
episcopal school at Rheims, 
which, under the protection 
of Hincmar, the oracle and 
arbiter of the state in the 
days of Charles the Bald, and 
under the teaching of arch- 
bishop Fulk, of Remy of Au- 
xerre, and of Hucbald, claims 
the proud distinction of hav- 
ing preserved, in this century, 
that tradition of learning 
which links the episcopal 
schools with the University 
of Paris. 
But throughout the ninth 
century, and indeed for the 
greater part of the period 
known as “the Benedictine 
era”? — the four centuries 
preceding the reign of Philip 
Augustus — the work of the 
episcopal schools was com- 
pletely eclipsed by that of 
the monasteries. At Corbey,

waves of the Norman invasion; but its namesake, New Corbey, in 
Saxony, sustained with equal reputation, and more auspicious fortunes, 
the scholarly traditions of the age. The great abbey of Saint Riquier, 
under the rule of Angilbert, rivalled the school at Rheims in literary 
activity; and an inventory of its possessions, made in the year 831 by 
the direction of Lewis the Pious, included a library of no less than 231 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
104 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
volumes. The abbey of Saint Martin at Metz, under the rule of Al- 
dricus, was scarcely less celebrated; a Bible presented by its monks to 
Charles the Bald and the missal of Bishop Drogo are still preserved, ° 
and rank among the most valued specimens of ninth-century art. The 
society of Saint Mihiel-sur-Meuse enjoyed the instruction of Smarag- 
dus, whose compend from Donatus frequently appears in the cata- 
logues of the libraries of the period. Saint Bertin, in the diocese of 
Cambrai, laid claim to the distinguished honour of having educated 
Grimbald, King Alfred’s able seconder in his efforts toward a restora- 
tion of learning in England. At Ferriéres, in the Gatinais, the genius 
of Lupus Servatus shone forth in the troublous and disheartening pe- 
riod which immediately preceded and followed upon the division of the 
empire. 
The South and South-West present fewer evidences of culture; and 
in the ninth century no foundation, either in Normandy or Brittany, 
can be said to have reached celebrity; while in Aquitaine, if we except 
the labours of Benedict of Aniane in the diocese of Montpellier, the 
efforts of Lewis the Pious on behalf of his patrimonial kingdom seem to 
have been baffled by the frequent recurrence of war. 
  72. The School at Salisbury Cathedral 
(As provided for in the Foundation Statutes of the Cathedral, of 1091 a.D.; 
trans. by A. F. Leach) 
This extract from the Cathedral Statutes outlines the duties of 
the different church officers, and particularly sets forth the author- 
ity of the Precentor and Schoolmaster connected therewith. 
The Institution of Osmund 
These are the dignities and customs of the church of Salisbury, which 
I, Osmund, bishop of that church, in the name of the Holy Trinity, in 
the year of our Lord 1091, established and granted to the persons and 
canons of the same church, with the advice of the lords, the archbishop 
and other my co-bishops whose names are subscribed, and with the 
assent of the lord King William; namely, that Dean: and Chanter, 
Chancellor and Treasurer shafl be continually resident in the church at 
Salisbury, without any kind of excuse... . Nothing can excuse the 
canons from being personally resident in the church of Salisbury, ex- 
cept attendance at the schools and the service of the lord King, who can 
have one in his chapel, and the archbishop one, and the bishop three. 
The dean presided over all canons and vicars as regards the cure of 
souls and correction of conduct. 
The precentor ought to rule the choir as to chanting and can raise or 
lower the chant. 
The treasurer is pre-eminent in keeping the treasures and ornaments

and managing the lights. In like manner the chancellor in ruling the 
school and correcting the books. 
The archdeacons excel in the superintendence of parishes and the 
cure of souls. 
Dean and precentor, treasurer and chancellor, receive double, the 
rest of the canons single commons. 
The sub-dean holds from the dean the archdeaconry of the city and 
suburbs, the succentor from the precentor all that pertains to the sing- 
ing. If the dean is away from the church the sub-dean fills his place, 
and the succentor in like manner the precentor’s. 
The schoolmaster ought to hear and determine the lessons, and carry 
the church seal, compose letters and deeds and mark the readers on the 
table, and the precentor in like manner the singers. . . . 
73. Foundation Grant for a Chantry School 
(Foundation Grant of Aldwincle Chantry; trans. by A. F. Leach) 
A very common form of later medieval school foundation was 
what was known as the Chantry, a priest being provided for in an 
endowment to say prayers for the repose of some soul, and being’ 
required to do some teaching besides to occupy his time. This 
selection illustrates such a foundation. The priest here provided 
for was also to give instruction in spelling and reading to six poor 
boys of the town. The grant is dated November 8, 1480, but in 
substance is like many much earlier documents.

“God of the faithful.” 
74. The Seven Liberal Arts 
(Rhabanus Maurus, Education of the Clergy; trans. by F. V. N. Painter, from the 
German text of Schulz, Gansen, and Keller, in his Great Pedagogical Essays. 
American Book Co., New York, 1905. Reproduced by permission.) 
Rhabanus Maurus (784?-856) was a pupil of Alcuin at Tours, 
and afterwards became Scholasticus of the monastery at Fulda 
(818); was Abbot there from 822 to 842; and in 847 was made 
Archbishop of Mainz. He was a devoted student of the Seven 
Liberal Arts and of classical and Biblical literatures. The work 
from which the following extract is taken was written in 819. 
The first of the liberal arts is Grammar, the second Rhetoric, the 
third Dialectic, the fourth Arithmetic, the fifth Geometry, the sixth 
Music, the seventh Astronomy. 
(a) Grammar. Grammar takes its name from the written character, 
as the derivation of the word indicates. The definition of grammar is 
this: Grammar is the science which teaches us to explain the poets and 
historians; it is the art which qualifies us to write and speak correctly. 
Grammar is the source and foundation of the liberal arts. It should 
be taught in every Christian school, since the art of writing and speak- 
ing correctly is attained through it. How could one understand the 
sense of the spoken word or the meaning of letters and syllables, if one 
had not learned this before from grammar? How could one know 
about metrical feet, accent, and verses, if grammar had not given one 
knowledge of them? How should one learn to know the articulation of 
discourse, the advantages of figurative language, the laws of word 
formation, and the correct forms of words, if one had not familiarized 
himself with the art of grammar? 
All the forms of speech, of which secular science makes use in its 
writings, are found repeatedly employed in the Holy Scriptures. Every 
one, who reads the sacred Scriptures with care, will discover that our 
(biblical) authors have used derivative forms of speech in greater and 
more manifold abundance than would have been supposed and be- 
lieved. There are in the Scriptures not only examples of all kinds of 
figurative expressions, but the designations of some of them by name; 
as allegory, riddle, parable. A knowledge of these things is proved to 
be necessary in relation to the interpretation of those passages of Holy 
Scripture which admit of a two-fold sense; an interpretation strictly
-P-A-G-E-133
  SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 107 
literal would lead to absurdities. Everywhere we are to consider 
whether that, which we do not at once understand, is to be apprehended 
as a figurative expression in some sense. A knowledge of prosody, 
which is offered in grammar, is not dishonorable, since among the Jews, 
as Saint Jerome testifies, the Psalter resounds sometimes with iambics, 
sometimes with Alcaics, sometimes chooses sonorous Sapphics, and 
sometimes even does not disdain catalectic feet. But in Deuteronomy 
and Isaiah, as in Solomon and Job, as Josephus and Origen have pointed 
out, there are hexameters and pentameters. Hence this art, though it 
may be secular, has nothing unworthy in itself; it should rather be 
learned as thotoughly as possible. 
(0) Rhetoric. According to the statements of teachers, rhetoric is 
the art of using secular discourse effectively in the circumstances © 
daily life. From this definition rhetoric seems indeed to have refer- 
ence merely to secular wisdom. Yet it is not foreign to ecclesiastica 
instruction. Whatever the preacher and herald of the divine law, in 
his instruction, brings forth in an eloquent and becoming manner; 
whatever in his written exposition he knows how to clothe in adequate 
and impressive language, he owes to his acquaintance with this art. 
Whoever at the proper time makes himself familiar with this art, and 
faithfully follows its rules in speaking and writing, needs not count it as 
something blameworthy. On the contrary, whoever thoroughly learns 
it so that he acquires the ability to proclaim God’s word, performs a 
true work. Through rhetoric anything is proved true or false. Who 
would have the courage to maintain that the defenders of truth should 
stand weaponless in the presence of falsehood, so that those, who dare 
to represent false, should know how by their discourse to win the favor 
and sympathy of the hearers, and that, on the other hand, the friends of 
truth should not be able to do this; that those should know how to 
present falsehood briefly, clearly, and with the semblance of truth, and 
that the latter, on the contrary, should clothe the truth in such an ex- 
position, that listening would become a burden, apprehension of the 
truth a weariness, and faith in the truth an impossibility? 
(c) Dialectic. Dialectic is the science of the understanding, which 
fits us for investigations and definitions, for explanations, and for dis- 
tinguishing the true from the false. It is the science of sciences. It 
teaches how to teach others; it teaches learning itself; in it the reason 
marks and manifests itself according to its nature, efforts, and activi- 
ties; it alone is capable of knowing; it not only will, but can lead others 
to knowledge; its conclusions lead us to an apprehension of our being 
and of our origin; through it we apprehend the origin and activity of 
the good, of Creator and creature; it teaches us to discover the truth 
and to unmask falsehood; it teaches us to draw conclusions; it shows us 
what is valid in argument and what is not; it teaches us to recognize 
what is contrary to the nature of things; it teaches us to distinguish in  
-P-A-G-E-134
  108 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
conttoversy the true, the probable, and the wholly false; by means of 
this science we are able to investigate everything with penetration, 
to determine its nature with certainty, and to discuss it with circum- 
spection. ‘ 
Therefore the clergy must understand this excellent art and con- 
stantly reflect upon its laws, in order that they may be able keenly to 
pierce the craftiness of errorists, and to refute their fatal fallacies. 
(d) Arithmetic. Arithmetic is the science of pure extension determi- 
nable by number; it is the science of numbers. Writers on secular 
    Fic. 14. A ScHoor: A Lesson in Locic 
(After a woodcut at the end of a copy of the third edition of Parvus 
et Magnus Chato, now in the library of Saint Jokn’s College, Oxford, and 
which was printed by Caxton in 1481) 
science assign it, under the head of mathematics, to the first place, be- 
cause it does not presuppose any of the other departments. Music, 
geometry, and astronomy, on the contrary, need the help of arithmetic; 
without it they cannot arise or exist. We should know, however, that 
the learned Hebrew Josephus, in his work on Antiquities, Chapter 
vut of Book 1, makes the statement that Abraham brought arith- 
metic and astronomy to the Egyptians; but that they as a people of 
penetrating mind, extensively developed from these germs the other 
sciences. The holy Fathers were right in advising those eager for knowl- 
edge to cultivate arithmetic, because in large measure it turns the mind 
from fleshly desires, and furthermore awakens the wish to comprehend 
what with God’s help we can merely receive with the heart. Therefore 
the significance of number is not to be underestimated. Its very great
-P-A-G-E-135
  SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 109 
value for an interpretation of many passages of Holy Scripture is mani- 
fest to all who exhibit zeal in their investigations. Not without good 
reason is it said in praise of God, “Thou hast ordained all things by 
measure, number, and weight.” (Book of Wisdom xt, 21.) 
But every number, through its peculiar qualities, is so definite that 
none of the others can be like it. They are all unequal and different. 
The single numbers are different; the single numbers are limited; but 
all are infinite. 
Those with whom Plato stands in especial honor will not make bold 
to esteem numbers lightly, as if they were of no consequence for the 
knowledge of God. He teaches that God made the world out of num- 
bers. And among us the prophet says of God, ‘“‘He forms the world by 
number.” And in the Gospel the Savior says, “The very hairs of your 
head are all numbered.”. . . Ignorance of numbers leaves many things 
unintelligible that are expressed in the Holy Scripture in a derivative 
sense or with a mystical meaning. 
(e) Geometry. We now come to the discussion of geometry. It is an 
exposition of form proceeding from observation; it is also a very com- 
mon means of demonstration among philosophers, who, to adduce at 
once the most full-toned evidence, declare that their Jupiter made use 
of astronomy in his works. I do not know indeed whether I should 
find praise or censure in this declaration of the philosophers, that Jupi- 
ter engraved upon the vault of the skies precisely what they them- 
selves draw in the sand of the earth. 
When this in a proper manner is transferred to God, the Almighty 
Creator, this assumption may perhaps come near the truth. ~If this 
statement seems admissible, the Holy Trinity makes use of geometry 
in so far as it bestows manifold forms and images upon the creatures 
which up to the present day it has called into being, as in its adorable 
omnipotence it further determines the course of the stars, as it pre- 
scribes their courses to the planets, and as it assigns to the fixed stars 
their unalterable position. For every excellent and well-ordered ar- 
rangement can be reduced to the special requirements of this sci- 
ENCES See. 
This science found realization also at the building of the tabernacle 
and the temple; the same measuring rod, circles, spheres, hemispheres, 
quadrangles, and other figures were employed. The knowledge of all 
this brings to him, who is occupied with it, no small gain for his spir- 
itual culture. 
(f) Music. Music is the science of time intervals as they are per- 
ceived in tones. This science is as eminent as it is useful. He who isa 
stranger to it is not able to fulfil the duties of an ecclesiastical officer in 
asuitablemanner. A proper delivery in reading and a lovely rendering 
of the Psalms in the church are regulated by a knowledge of this sci- 
ence. Yet it is not only good reading and beautiful psalmody that we
-P-A-G-E-136
  110 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
owe to music; through it alone do we become capable of celebrating in 
the most solemn manner every divine service. Music penetrates all the 
activities of our life, in this sense namely, that we above all carry out 
the commands of the Creator and bow with a pure heart to his com- 
mands; all that we speak, all that makes our hearts beat faster, is shown 
through the rhythm of music united with the excellence of harmony; 
for music is the science which teaches us agreeably to change tones in 
duration and pitch. When we employ ourselves with good pursuits in 
life, we show ourselves thereby disciples of this art; so long as we do 
what is wrong, we do not feel ourselves drawn to music. Even heaven 
and earth, as everything that happens here through the arrangement of 
the Most High, is nothing but music, as Pythagoras testifies that this 
world was created by music and can be ruled by it. Even with the 
Christian religion music is most intimately united; thus it is possible 
that to him, who does not know eyen a little music, many things re- 
main closed and hidden. 
(g) Astronomy. There remains yet astronomy which, as some one 
‘has said, is a weighty means of demonstration to the pious, and to the 
curious a grievous torment. If we seek to investigate it with a pure 
heart and an ample mind, then it fills us, as the ancients said, with 
great love for it. For what will it not signify, that we soar in spirit to 
the sky, that with penetration of mind we analyze that sublime struc- 
ture, that we, in part at least, fathom with the keenness of our logical 
faculties what mighty space has enveloped in mystery! The world it- 
self, according to the assumption of some, is said to have the shape of a 
sphere, in order that in its circumference it may be able to contain the 
different forms of things. Thus Seneca, in agreement with the philoso- 
phers of ancient times, composed a work under the title, “The Shape of 
the Earth.” 
Astronomy, of which we now speak, teaches the laws of the stellar 
world. The stars can take their place or carry out their motion only 
in the manner established by the Creator, unless by the will of the 
Creator a miraculous change takes place. Thus we read that Joshua 
commanded the sun to stand still in Gibeon, that in the days of King 
Josiah the sun went backward ten degrees, and that at the death of the 
Lord the sun was darkened for three hours. « We call such occurrences 
miracles, because they contradict the usual course of things, and there- 
fore excite wonder. 
That’ part of astronomy, which is built up on the investigation of 
natural phenomena in order to determine the course of the sun, of the 
moon, and stars, and to effect a proper reckoning of time, the Christian 
clergy should seek to learn with the utmost diligence, in order through 
the knowledge of laws brought to light and through the valid and con- 
vincing proof of the given means of evidence, to place themselves in a 
position, not only to determine the course of past years according to
-P-A-G-E-137
FE 
SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 111 
truth and reality, but also for further times to draw confident conclu- 
sions, and to fix the time of Easter and all other festivals and holy days 
and to announce to the congregation the proper celebration of them. 
The seven liberal arts of the philosophers, which Christians should 
learn for their utility and advantage, we have, as I think, sufficiently 
discussed. We have this yet toadd. When those, who are called phi- 
losophers, have in their expositions or in their writings, uttered per- 
chance some truth, which agrees with our faith, we should not handle 
it timidly, but rather take it as from its unlawful possessors and apply 
it to our own use. 
75. A Medieval Latin Colloquy 
(Leach, A. F., Educational Charters, pp. 37-47. London, 1911) 
After boys had learned to read Latin words and had begun to 
study the grammar, often a simple Latin colloquy was read before 
taking up sacred or classical writers. The following, composed by 
the English Abbot A®lfric, in 1005, is illustrative of the type and 
interesting for the instruction as to proper living which it contains. 
Boys. Master, we children ask you to teach us to speak correctly 
for we are unlearned and speak corruptly. 
Master. What do you want 
to say? 
B. What do we care what 
we say so long as we speak cor- 
rectly and say what is useful, 
not old-womanish or improper. 
M. Will you be flogged 
while learning? 
B. We would rather be 
flogged while learning than re- 
main ignorant; but we know 
that you will be kind to us and 
not flog us unless you are 
obliged. Hy

1st Boy. Some are ploughmen, others shepherds, some are cowherds, 
some too are hunters, some are fishermen, some hawkers, some mer- 
chants, some shoemakers, some salters, some bakers of the place. 
M. What do you say, ploughboy, how do you do your work? 
P. Oh,sir, I work very hard. I go out at dawn to drive the oxen to 
the field, and yoke them to the plough; however hard the winter I dare 
not stay at home for fear of my master; and having yoked the oxen 
and made the plough-share and coulter fast to the plough, every day I 
have to plough a whole acre or more. 
M. Have you any one with you? 
P. Ihave a boy to drive the oxen with the goad, and he is now 
hoarse with cold and shouting. 
M. What more do you do in the day? 
P. A great deal more. I have to fill the oxen’s bins with hay, and 
give them water, and carry the dung outside. 
M. Oh, it is hard work. 
P. Yes, itis hard work, because I am not free. 
(So they go on through all the other occupations. At the end there 
is a discussion as to who does the best work and which is the most use- 
ful, and a counsellor is called in to decide the question. He decides 
that divine service comes first, but among secular crafts agriculture, 
because it feeds all. Then the smith and the wheelwright point out 
that the ploughman is no use without the plough which they make.) 
The counsellor says: Oh, all you good fellows and good workers, let 
us end this dispute and have peace and harmony among us, and let 
each help the other by his craft, and let us all meet at the ploughman’s, 
where we find food for ourselves and fodder for our horses. And this is 
the advice I give all workmen, that each of them should do his work as 
well as he can, as the man who neglects his work is dismissed from his 
work. Whether you are a priest or a monk, a layman or a soldier, 
apply yourself to that, and be what you are, as it is a great loss and 
shame for a man not to be what he is and what he ought to be. 
M. Now, children, how do you like this speech? 
B. We like it very much, but what you say is too deep for us, and 
is beyond our age. But talk to us in a way we can follow so that we 
may understand what you are talking about. 
M. Well, I ask you why you are learning so diligently? 
B. Because we do not want to be like beasts, who know nothing 
but grass and water. 
(The master then goes off into a disquisition whether they want to 
be worldly wise, full of craft, or otherwise. They complain again that 
he is too deep for them.) 
But talk to us so that we may understand, not so profoundly. 
M. Well, Iwill do what youask. You, boy; what did you do to-day? 
B. Idid many things. At night when I heard the bell, I got out

Then we sang the martyrology and lauds; after that, prime and the 
seven psalms with litanies and first mass; next tierce, and did the mass 
of the day; after that we sang sext, and ate and drank and slept; and 
then we got up again and sang nones, and now here we are before you 
ready to listen to what you tell us. 
M. When will you sing vespers or compline? 
B. When it’s time. 
M. Were you flogged to-day? 
B. Iwas not, because I was very careful. 
M. And how about the others? 
B. Why do youask me that? I dare n’t tell you our secrets. Each 
one knows whether he was flogged or not. 
M. Where do you sleep? 
B. In the dormitory with the brethren. 
M. Who calls you to nocturnes? 
B. Sometimes I hear the bell, and get up; sometimes my master 
wakes me with a ground-ash. 
M. All you good children and clever scholars, your teacher exhorts 
you to keep the commandments of God, and behave properly every- 
where. Walk quietly when you hear the church bells and go into 
church, and bow to the holy altars, and stand quietly and sing in uni- 
son, and ask pardon for your sins, and go out again without playing, 
to the cloister or to school. 
76. Quintilian on the Importance of Grammar 
(Quintilian, Institutes of Oratory, book rt, chap. Iv; trans. by J. S. Watson. 
London, 1892) 
Though Quintilian’s treatise existed only in fragmentary form 
until 1416, when a copy, was found at the monastery of Saint 
Gall, in Switzerland (R. 127), Quintilian’s ideas, which repre- 
sented the best Roman practice, were followed in the teaching of 
Grammar in the schools of the Middle Ages. The following se- 
lection from his Institutes outlines the many different aspects of 
this important subject. 
1. In regard to the boy who has attained facility in reading and writ- 
ing, the next object is instruction from the grammarians (language 
masters; teachers of languages and literature). Nor is it of importance 
whether I speak of the Greek or Latin grammarian, though I am in- 
clined to think that the Greek should take the precedence. 
2.' Both have the same method. This profession, then, distinguished 
as it is, most compendiously, into two parts, the art of speaking cor- 
rectly, and the illustration of the poets, carries more beneath the surface 
than it shows on its front.
-P-A-G-E-140
Ee 
114 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
3. For not only is the art of writing combined with that of speaking, 
but correct reading also precedes illustration, and with all these is joined 
the exercise of judgment, which the old grammarians (of Alexandria), 
indeed, used with such severity, that they not only allowed themselves 
to distinguish certain verses with a particular mark of censure, and to 
remove, as spurious, certain books which had been inscribed with false 
titles, from their sets, but even brought some authors within their 
canon, and excluded others altogether from classification. 
4. Nor is it sufficient to have read the poets only; every class of 
writers must be studied, not simply for matter, but for words, which 
often receive their authority from writers. Nor can grammar be com- 
plete without a knowledge of music, since the grammarian has to speak 
of metre and rhythm; nor if he is ignorant of astronomy, can he under- 
stand the poets, who, to say nothing of other matters, so often allude 
to the rising and setting of the stars in marking the seasons; nor must 
he be unacquainted with philosophy, both on account of numbers of 
passages, in almost all poems, drawn from the most abstruse subtleties 
of physical investigation, and also on account of Empedocles among the 
Greeks, and Varro and Lucretius among the Latins, who have com- 
mitted the precepts of philosophy to verse. 
5. The grammarian has also need of no small portion of eloquence, 
that he may speak aptly and fluently on each of those subjects which 
are here mentioned. Those therefore are by no means to be regarded 
who deride this science as trifling and empty, for unless it lays a sure 
foundation for the future orator, whatever superstructure you raise 
will fall; it is a science which is necessary to the young, pleasing to the 
old, and an agreeable companion in retirement, and which alone, of all 
departments of learning, has in it more service than show. 
6. Let no man, therefore, look down on the elements of grammar as 
small matters; not because it requires great labour to distinguish con- 
sonants from vowels, and to divide them into the proper number of 
semivowels and mutes, but because, to those entering the recesses, as 
it were, of this temple, there will appear much subtlety on points, 
which may not only sharpen the wits of boys, but may exercise even 
the deepest: erudition and knowledge. 
77. The Elements, and the Movements of the Planets 
(Translated from the Encyclopedia of Bartholomew Anglius, entitled On the Prop- 
erties of Things, written about the middle of the thirteenth century. Edited by 
Robt. Steele, Medieval Lore. London, 1893) 
The Encyclopedia of scientific matters from which the follow- 
ing is taken was a small one-volume work, written in Latin, prob- 
ably before 1260, and was intended to explain to the priest and 
preaching friars, as well as to the small educated class then begin-
-P-A-G-E-141
  SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 115 
ning to form, the properties of natural things, and the allusions to 
natural objects met with in the Scriptures. In time it became 
very popular in France, Holland, and Spain as well, being trans- 
lated into French in 1372, and into Spanish, Dutch, and English in 
1397. After the invention of printing, and before the rise of the 
newer scientific ideas, it was repeatedly reissued in both the Latin 
and the native languages. 
The two extracts which follow illustrate physical and astrono- 
mical conceptions toward the close of the Middle Ages. 
(a) Of the Elements 
Elements are simple, and the least particles of a body that is com- 
pound. And it is called least touching us, for it is not perceived by 
wits of feeling. For it is the least part and last in undoing of the body, 
as it is first in composition. And is called simple, not for an element is 
simple without any composition, but for it hath no parts that com- 
pound it, that be diverse in kind and in number as some medlied bodies 
have: as it fareth in metals of the which some parts be diverse; for some 
part is air, and some is earth. But each part of fire is fire, and so of 
others. Elements are four, and so there are four qualities of elements, 
of the which every body is composed and made as of matter. The four 
elements are Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, of the which each hath his 
proper qualities. Four be called the first and principal qualities, that 
is hot, cold, dry, and moist: they are called the first qualities because 
they slide first from the elements into the things that be made of ele- 
ments. Two of these qualities are called Active, heat and coldness. 
The other are dry and wetness and are called Passive. 
(b) Of Double Moving of the Planets 
All the planets move by double moving; by their own kind moving 
out of the west into the east, against the moving of the firmament; and 
by the other moving out of the east into the west, and that by ravishing 
of the firmament. By violence of the firmament they are ravished 
every day out of the east into the west. And by their kindly moving, 
by the which they labour to move against the firmament, some of them 
fulfil their course in shorter time, and some in longer time. And that is 
for their courses are some more and some less. For Saturn abideth in 
every sign xxx months, and full endeth its course in xxx years. Jupiter 
dwelleth in every sign one year, and full endeth its course in xij years. 
Mars abideth in every sign xlv days, and full endeth its course in two 
years. The sun abideth in every sign xxx days and ten hours and a 
half, and full endeth its course in ccclxv days and vj hours. Mercury 
abideth in every sign xxviij days and vj hours, and full endeth its course 
in ccexxxviij days. Venus abideth in every sign 29 days, and full
-P-A-G-E-142
  116 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
endeth its course in 348 days. The moon abideth in every sign two 
days and a half, and six hours and one bisse less, and full endeth its 
course from point to point in 27 days and 8 hours. And by entering 
and out passing of these 7 stars into the 12 signs and out thereof every 
thing that is bred and corrupt in this nether world is varied and dis- 
posed, and therefore in the philosopher’s book Mesalath it is read in 
this manner: ‘The Highest made the world to the likeness of a sphere, 
and made the highest circle above it movable in the earth, pight and 
stedfast in the middle thereof; not withdrawing toward the left side, nor 
toward the right side, and set the other elements moveable, and made 
them move by the moving of 7 planets, and all other stars help the 
planets in their working and kind.’ Every creature upon Earth hath a 
manner inclination by the moving of the planets, and destruction 
cometh by moving and working of planets. The working of them 
varieth and is diverse by diversity of climates and countries. For 
they work one manner of thing about the land of blue men, and another 
about the land and country of Slavens... . In the signs the planets 
move and abate with double moving, and move by accidental ravishing 
of the firmament out of the East into the West; and by kindly moving, 
the which is double, the first and the second. The first moving is the 
round moving that a planet maketh in its own circle, and passeth never 
the marks and bounds of the circle. The second moving is that he 
maketh under the Zodiac, and passeth alway like great space in a like 
space of time. And the first moving of a planet is made in its own 
circle that is called Eccentric, and it is called so, for the earth is not the 
middle thereof, as it is the middle of the circle that is called Zodiac. 
Epicycle is a little circle that a planet describeth, and goeth about 
therin by the moving of its body, and the body of the planet goeth 
about the roundness thereof. And therefore it sheweth, that the sun 
and other planets move in their own circles; and first alike swift, though 
they move diversely in divers circles. Also in these circles the manner 
moving of planets is full wisely found of astronomers, that are called 
Direct, Stationary, and Retrograde Motion. Forthwight moving is in 
the over part of the circle that is called Epicycle, backward is in the 
nether part, and stinting and abiding or hoving is in the middle.

79. The Truce of God 
(Monumenta Germanie Historica, Leges, u, 55; trans. by Munro, in Translations and 
Reprints from Sources of European History, vol. 1, no. 2) 
The Truce of God, first established by the Church at the Coun- 
cil of Clermont, France, in 1095, though having been proposed in 
Southern France as early as 990, was an effort on the part of the 
Church, aided by some of the rulers of the time, to mitigate the 
horrors and extent of private warfare by commanding the cessa- 
tion of hostilities on four days a week, and on all holy days of the 
Church, under pain of severe penalties.
-P-A-G-E-144
  118 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The following proclamation of the Archbishop of Cologne to the 
Bishop of Miinster, in 1083, gives the form of the truce he estab- 
lished, twelve years before the definite church decree, and also 
throws much light on the conditions of society among the Ger- 
mans in the valley of the Rhine at that time. 
Inasmuch as in our own times the Church, through its members, has 
been extraordinarily afflicted by tribulations and difficulties, so that 
tranquillity and peace were wholly despaired of, we have endeavored 
with God’s help to come to its aid, in the midst of its sufferings and 
perils. And by the advice of our faithful subjects we have at length 
provided this remedy, so that we might to some extent reéstablish, on 
certain days at least, the peace which, because of our sins, we could not 
make enduring. Accordingly we have enacted and set forth the fol- 
lowing: 
Having called together those under us to a legally summoned coun- 
cil, which was held at Cologne, the chief city of our province, in the 
church of Saint Peter, in the 1083d year of our Lord’s Incarnation, in 
the sixth indiction, on the twelfth day before the Kalends of May, after 
arranging other business, we have caused to be read in public what we 
proposed to do in this matter. After this had been fully discussed by 
all, both clergy and people with God’s aid reached an agreement, and 
we set forth in what manner and during what parts of the year the 
peace should be observed, namely: 
That from the first day of the Advent of our Lord through Epiphany, 
and from the beginning of Septuagesima to the eighth day after Pente- 
cost and through that whole day, and throughout the year on every 
Sunday, Friday, and Saturday, and on the fast days of the four seasons, 
and on the eve and the day of all the apostles, and on all days canoni- 
cally set apart — or which shall in future be set apart — for fasts or 
feasts, this decree of peace shall be observed; so that both those who 
travel and those who remain at home may enjoy security and the most 
entire peace, so that no one may commit murder, arson, robbery, or 
assault, no one may injure another with a sword, club or any kind 
of weapon. Let no one, however irritated by wrong, presume to 
carry arms, shield, sword, or lance, or any kind of armor, from the 
Advent of our Lord to the eighth day after Epiphany, and from 
Septuagesima to the eighth day after Pentecost. On the remaining 
days, indeed, namely, on Sundays, Fridays, apostles’ days, and the 
vigils of the apostles, and on every day set aside, or to be set aside, 
for feasts or feasts, arms may be carried, but on this condition, that 
no injury shall be done in any way to any one. 
If it shall be necessary for any one, during the period of the peace — 
ie. from the Advent of our Lord to the eighth day after Epiphany, and 
from Septuagesima to the eighth day after Pentecost — to go from one
-P-A-G-E-145
  SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 119 
: bishopric into another in which the peace is not observed, he may bear 
arms, but on the condition that he shall not injure any one, except in 
self-defense if he is attacked; and when he returns into our diocese he 
shall immediately lay aside his arms. If it shall happen that any castle 
is besieged during the days which are included within the peace, the be- 
siegers shall cease from attack unless they are set upon by the besieged 
and compelled to beat the latter back. 
And in order that this statute of peace should not be violated by any 
one rashly or with impunity, a penalty was fixed by the common con- 
~ sent of all, namely: If a free man or noble violates it, i.e. commits homi- 
cide, or wounds any one, or is at fault in any manner whatever, he shall 
be expelled from his lands, without any indulgence on account of the 
payment of money or the intercession of friends, and his heirs shall take 
all his property. If he holds a fief, the lord to whom it belongs shall 
receive it again. Moreover, if it appear that his heirs after his expul- 
sion have furnished him any support or aid, and if they are convicted of 
it, the estate shall be taken from them and revert to the king. But if 
they wish to clear themselves of the charge against them, they shall take 
oath, with twelve who are equally free or equally noble. 
Tf a slave kills a man, he shall be beheaded; if he wounds a man, he 
shall lose a hand; if he does an injury any other way with his fist or a 
club, or by striking with a stone, he shall be shorn and flogged. If, 
however, he is accused and wishes to prove his innocence, he shall clear 
himself by the ordeal of cold water, but he must himself be put into the 
water and no one in his place. If, however, fearing the sentence de- 
creed against him, he flees, he shall be under a perpetual excommunica- 
tion; and if he is known to be in any place, letters shall be sent thither, 
in which it shall be announced to all that he is excommunicate, and that 
it is unlawful for any one to associate with him. In the case of boys 
who have not yet completed their twelfth year, the hand ought not to 
be cut off; but only in the case of those who are twelve years or more of 
age. Nevertheless, if boys fight, they shall be whipped and prevented 
from fighting. 
It is not an infringement of the peace if any one orders his delinquent 
slave, pupil, or any one in any way under his charge, to be chastised 
with rods or sticks. It is also an exception to this constitution of peace 
if the lord king publicly orders an expedition to attack the enemies of 
the kingdom, or is pleased to hold a council to judge the enemies of jus- 
tice. The peace is not violated if, during the times specified, a duke, or 
other counts, magistrates, or their substitutes, hold courts and inflict 
punishment legally on thieves, robbers, and other criminals. 
The statute of this noble peace is especially enacted for the safety of 
those engaged in feuds; but after the end of the peace they are not to 
dare to rob and plunder in the villages and houses, since the laws and 
penalties enacted before the institution of the peace are still legally
-P-A-G-E-146
  120 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
valid to restrain them from crime, and, moreover, because robbers and 
highwaymen are excluded from this divine peace, and indeed from any 
peace. 
If any one attempts to oppose this pious institution and is unwilling 
to promise peace to God with the others, or to observe it, no priest in 
our diocese shall presume to say a mass for him, or shall take any care 
for his salvation; if he is sick, no Christian shall dare to visit him; on his 
deathbed he shall not receive the eucharist, unless he repents. The su- 
preme authority of the peace pledged to God and generally extolled by 
all will be so great that it will be observed not only in our times, but 
forever among our posterity, because if any one shall presume to in- 
fringe or violate it, either now or ages hence, he is irrevocably excom- 
municated by us. 
The responsibility for carrying out the above-mentioned penalties 
against the violaters of the peace rests no more with the counts, local 
judges, or officials than with the whole people in general. ' They are to 
be especially careful not to show friendship or hatred, nor to do any- 
thing contrary to justice in punishing, nor to conceal crimes, which may 
be hidden, but to bring them to light. No one is to receive money for 
the release of those taken in fault, or to attempt to aid the guilty by any 
favor of any kind, because whoever does this incurs the intolerable 
damnation of his soul; and all the faithful ought to remember that this 
peace has not been promised to men, but to God, and therefore must be 
observed so much the more rigidly and firmly. Wherefore we exhort all 
in Christ to guard inviolably this necessary contract of peace, and if 
any one hereafter presumes to violate it, let him be damned by the 
ban of irrevocable excommunication and by the anathema of eternal 
perdition. .. . 
In 1095, at the Council of Clermont, France, the Truce of God 
was officially proclaimed. The original decree has been lost, but 
the Canon adopted by the Council was as follows: 
Be it enacted, that monks, clergymen, women, and those who may 
be with them, shall remain in peace every day; farther, on three days, 
viz., the second, third, and fourth days of the week, an injury done to 
any one shall not be considered an infraction of the Peace; but on the 
remaining four days, if any one injures another, he shall be considered 
a violater of the sacred Peace, and shall be punished in the manner 
decreed. 
80. How the Church used Chivalry 
(Selected from Gautier, Léon, La Chevalerie ; trans. by H. Frith. London, 1891) 
The following selections, chosen from chapter 1 of Gautier’s 
work, show how useful the Church made the institution of chivalry 
in regulating the life of the half-civilized warrior of the feudal age.
-P-A-G-E-147
  SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 121 
Chivalry is not one of those official institutions which make their 
appearance suddenly in history, promulgated by a pope and decreed by 
a sovereign. 
Religious as it might have been, it had nothing in its origin that re- 
minded one of the foundations of a religious order. One may in fact 
declare, that every single monastic order has been conceived in the 
mind of an individual. The grand Benedictine order arose out of the 
intelligence of Saint Benedict, and the Franciscan order from the heart 
of Saint Francis. There is no parallel to this in the case of chivalry, 
and it would be useless to search for the place of its birth or for the name 
of its founder. What a great archeologist of our day has said of the 
Romance architecture is scientifically applicable to the birth of chiv- 
alry. It was born everywhere at once, and has been everywhere at the 
same time the natural effect of the same aspirations and the same needs. 
There was a moment when the Christians in the East experienced the 
necessity of sheltering themselves at prayers in churches built of stone 
which could not be burned; and then, to use the graceful terms of Raoul 
Glaber, the Christian soil was everywhere covered with the white robes 
of new churches. ! 
Hence the Romance architecture. There was another moment when 
people everywhere felt the necessity of tempering the ardour of the old 
German blood, and of giving to their ill-regulated passions an ideal. 
Hence chivalry! 
Chivalry, as we shall presently show, arose from a German custom 
which has been idealized by the Church. 
It is less an institution than an ideal. 
Many volumes have been written upon this noble subject, and a few 
words will be sufficient to define clearly chivalry and the knight. 
“Chivalry is the Christian form of the military profession: the knight 
is the Christian soldier.”. . . 
There is a sentence of Tacitus which here comes to the front and 
which illustrious scholars have brought out before us; this is the cele- 
brated passage from the Germania which refers to a German rite in 
which we really find all the military elements of our future chivalry. 
The scene took place beneath the shade of an old forest. The bar- 
barous tribe is assembled, and one feels that a solemn ceremony is in 
preparation. Into the midst of the assembly advances a very young 
man, whom you can picture to yourself with sea-green eyes and long 
fair hair and perhaps some tattooing. A chief of the tribe is present, 
who without delay places gravely in the hands of the young man a 
framea anda buckler. Failing a sovereign ruler, it is the father of the 
youth — who presently will be a man — it is his father or some relative 
who undertakes this delivery of weapons. “Such is the ‘virile robe’ of 
these people,” as Tacitus well puts it: “Such is the first honour of their 
youth. Till then the young man was only one in a family; he becomes
-P-A-G-E-148
  122 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
by this rite a member of the Republic. . . . This sword and buckler he 
will never abandon, for the Germans in all their acts, whether public 
or private, are always armed. So, the ceremony finished, the assembly 
separates,-and the tribe reckons a miles —a warrior — the more. 
That is all!” 
The solemn handing of arms to the young German — such is the first 
germ of chivalry which Christianity was one day to animate into life. 
. .. In time the Church came to intervene positively in the education 
of the German miles. The time was rough, and it is not easy to picture 
amore distracted period than that in the ninth and tenth centuries. . . . 
Countries were on the way to be formed, and people were asking to 
which country they could best belong. Independent kingdoms were 
founded which had no precedents, and were not destined to have a long 
life. . . . People were fighting everywhere more or less — family against 
family — man to man. No road was safe, the churches were burned, 
there was universal terror, and every one sought protection. The king 
had no longer strength to resist any one, and the counts made them- 
selves kings. The sun of the realm was set, and one had to look to the 
stars for light. As soon as the people perceived a strong man-at-arms, 
resolute, defiant, well established in his wooden keep, well fortified 
within the lines of his hedge, behind his palisade of dead branches, or 
within his barriers of planks; well posted on his hill, against his rock, or 
on his hillock, and dominating all the surrounding country, as soon as 
they saw this each said to him, “I am your man”’; and all these weak 
ones grouped themselves around the strong one, who next day proceeded 
to'wage war with his neighbors. Thence supervened a terrible series of 
private wars. Every one was fighting, or thinking of fighting. .. . 
It was then, it was in that terrible hour — the decisive epoch in our 
history — that the Church undertook the education of the Christian 
soldier; and it was at that time by a resolute step she found the feudal 
baron in his rude wooden citadel, and proposed to him an ideal. 
This ideal was chivalry! . . . 
That chivalry may be considered a great military confraternity as 
well as an eighth sacrament will be conceded after a careful perusal of 
the text. But, before familiarising themselves with these ideas, the 
rough spirits of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries had to learn 
the principles of them. The chivalrous ideal was not conceived “all of 
a piece,” and certainly it did not triumph without sustained effort; so it 
was by degrees, and very slowly, that the Church succeeded in inoculat- 
ing the almost animal intelligence and the untrained minds of our an- 
cestors with so many virtues. Nothing is improvised — such is the law 
of history. Whoever cannot see it is blind. This same Church which 
we have to thank for the best elements of our chivalry has scarcely put 
down slavery in eight or nine hundred years. It cannot, as a matter of 
fact, march with a more rapid step... . : 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTION PROVIDED 123 
In the hands of the Church which wished to mould him into a Chris- 
tian knight, the feudal baron was a very intractable individual. No 
one could be more brutal or more barbarous than he. . . . 
- The Church said “ Moderate your courage.” They did moder- 
ate it, and their savagery by degrees became their prowess. . . . First 
Galen then /argesse, then moderation, and finally that otecn of 
| civilized chivalry which we call courtesy. Honour crowns them all. 
“Death rather than dishonour”: the whole code of chivalry is con- 
tained in these four words, which, by the grace of God, have be- 
come a commonplace term with us. It is the grand saying of Hue le 
Maine, brother of the King of France, before Antioch: “ Who does not 
prefer eth to dishonour has no right i in seignorie.” And throughout 
the Middle Ages this motto was preserved. 
No matter in what sequence the Church bestowed these virtues upon 
the warrior, she gave him a definite aim and object — a precise law. 
The law was the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments of chivalry, 
which we propose to illustrate. 
The object was to enlarge the Kingdom of God on earth. 
When our knights attended mass one might have seen them, before 
the reading of the second lesson, draw their swords and hold them un- 
sheathed in their hands until the reading of the lesson was finished. 
This defiant attitude seemed to imply their readiness to defend the 
Gospel. ‘‘If the Word is to be defended, we are ready.” 
This is the whole spirit of chivalry. 
  81. Educational Influences of the Church Services 
(Draper, J. W., History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, vol. U1, p. 202. 
New York, 1876) 
For the great mass of the people of western Europe there was no 
other education during the long Middle Ages than that given by 
daily toil, training to do what others had done before, and the re- 
ligious services of the Church. Draper describes very well the 
influence of the last in the following selection. 
And yet we must not undervalue the power once exercised on a non- 
reading community by oral and scenic teachings. What could better 
instruct it than a formal congregating of neighborhoods together each 
Sabbath-day to listen in silence and without questioning? In those 
great churches, the architectural grandeur of which is still the admira- 
tion of our material age, nothing was wanting to impress the worshipper. 
The vast pile, with its turrets or spire pointing to heaven; its steep in- 
clining roof; its walls, with niches and statues; its echoing belfry; its 
windows of exquisite hues and of every form, lancet, or wheel, or rose, 
through which stole in the many-colored light; its chapels, with their

pictured walls; its rows of slender, clustering columns, and arches tier 
upon tier; its many tapering pendants; the priest emerging from his 
scenic retreat; his chalice and forbidden wine; the covering paten, the 
cibory, and the pix. Amid clouds of incense from smoking censers, the 
blaze of lamps, and tapers, and branching candlesticks, the tinkling of 
silver bells, the play of jewelled vessels and gorgeous dresses of violet, 
green, and gold, banners and crosses were borne aloft through lines of 
kneeling worshippers in processional services along the aisles. The 
chanting of litanies and psalms gave a foretaste of the melodies of 
heaven, and the voices of the choristers and sounds of the organ now 
thundered forth glory to God in the highest, now whispered to the 
broken in spirit, peace. 
82. How the Church Urged that the Elements of Religious 
Education be Given 
(Statutes Diocesan Council, Winchester Diocese, England. Leach, A. F., History 
of Winchester College, p. 40) 
The following statutes, dating from 1295, are interesting as 
showing the mild pressure exerted by the Church in one English 
diocese to secure a little learning for the members and their chil- 
dren. 
  In the churches near the school of the city of Winchester or in other 
walled cities of our diocese, let scholars only be appointed to carry the 
holy water. ; 
Moreover, let the rectors, vicars, and parish priests take care that 
the boys in their parishes know the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the 
Salutation of the Blessed Virgin, and how to cross themselves rightly. 
Let inquiry also be made of the grown-up laymen when they come to 
confession whether they know this exactly, that if by any chance they 
do not know it, as is very often the case, they may be taught it by the 
same priests. 
Let boys’ parents also be induced to let their boys, when they have 
learnt to read the psalter, learn singing also, so that after they have 
learnt higher subjects they may not be compelled to return to learn 
this, nor as being ignorant of this be always less fit for divine service.

schools in the bishopric of Lincoln, England.

version of Saint Paul all the parish clerks of the churches of the city of 
Lincoln were teaching boys in the churches singing or music; and being 
present in chapter before Masters Robert de Lacy and William of 
Thornton, who charged them that they had held adulterine schools to 
the prejudice of the liberty of the mother church, they firmly denied 
that they were keeping any schools in the churches, or teaching boys 
singing; but as they could not deny that they had at some time done so, 
the said Masters Robert and William made them swear, holding the 
most holy Gospels, that they will not henceforward keep any adulterine 
schools in the churches, nor teach boys song or music, without license 
from the (Song) Master.

  CHAPTER VIII 
INFLUENCES TENDING TOWARD A REVIVAL OF 
LEARNING 
Tue Readings of this chapter are illustrative of a number of the 
more important movements which took place in the eleventh and 
twelfth centuries, and which did much to prepare the way for the 
rise of the universities in the thirteenth century and the revival of 
learning in the fourteenth. The development of a new and, for 
the time, wonderful Mohammedan civilization in Spain; the rise 
of Scholasticism within the Western Church; the recovery of the 
Roman legal code, the revival of the study of Roman law; the 
restoration of the old city life and commerce; and the rise of mer- 
chant and trade guilds in the cities — these were the most impor- 
tant of the new influences and movements which indicated that 2 
a revival of learning in the western world was about to begin. 
The first of these new influences was the rapid development of 
Mohammedan civilization and learning in Spain. The influence 
exerted by this on western Europe, chiefly through the introduc- 
tion of the lost texts of Aristotle and some new mathematical 
knowledge, is indicated in the Readings. The first selection (85) 
pictures the Mohammedan civilization at its best, and the second 
(86) reveals their remarkable scientific work. The next selection, 
which is a list of Aristotle’s works known to western Europe by 
1300 (87), shows the extent to which Christian Europe drew upon 
Mohammedan translations. The greatness of Aristotle’s mind is 
testified to by the Mohammedan Averroés (88), while the recep- 
tion given to his writings in the rising universities at Oxford and 
Paris is indicated by the testimony of Roger Bacon (89) and the 
four extracts from the Paris Statutes (90 a-d). The latter extend 
over a period of forty-four years, and cover the time from the 
earlier prohibition of his works to their later full acceptance by 
the Western Church authorities. 
The new questioning attitude of a few thinkers within the 
Church, another of the new movements of the time, is well shown 
by the extracts from Abelard’s new textbook on Theology, Sic et 
Non (91 a-b), while the great reconciling and harmonizing work
-P-A-G-E-154
  128 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
of the Scholastics, all within lines which the Church fully ap- 
proved, is well set forth in the brief extract from Rashdall (92). 
The revival of legal study was another of the important new 
influences of the period under consideration. The extract from 
the Institutes of Justinian (93), which was an important and in- 
troductory part of the famous Justinian Code, sets forth well the 
nature of this introductory textbook on Roman law, the recovery 
of which formed the basis for the new study of Roman law in 
western Europe. 
The rise of the medizval town, and of the merchant and trade 
guilds within the town, were other important new movements 
which indicated a change in thinking and in human endeavor. 
The two extracts from Giry and Réville (94 a-b) describe the evo- 
lution of these towns over a period of centuries. The charter of 
rights and privileges granted by Henry IT to the town of Walling- 
ford, England (95), is an important document as showing not only 
what rights and privileges a town could beg, buy, or wring from a 
king, but also as indicating the important position held, at that 
early date, by the rising guild merchant in such a town. It re- 
veals clearly the evolution of a merchant class as a new Estate. 
Closely following the rise of these merchant guilds came the trade 
guilds, and the selections giving the oath of a freeman (96), and 
the ordinances of the guild of white-tawyers (97), reveal the na- 
ture and scope of these new organizations, and the control these 
medizval guilds exercised over their members and their trade. 
These guilds not only developed apprentice education for the sons 
of their members, but also, in time, schools of their own (98) as 
well. The old indenture of apprenticeship reproduced (99) is 
typical of such documents, not only at the time, but also for cen- 
turies to come. 
These new influences and movements indicate that the long 
period of the Dark Ages was approaching an end. They point 
unmistakably to the rise of new classes in society and to an ap- 
proaching intellectual awakening, as well as to a revival of the old 
long-lost Greek and Roman learning. The eleventh and twelfth 
centuries were turning-points of great significance in the history 
of our western civilization, and with the opening of the wonderful 
thirteenth century the western world was at last headed toward a 
new life and modern ways of thinking.

  85. The Moslem Civilization in Spain 
(Draper, J. W., History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, vol. 11, 
PP. 30, 33-34; 42-45. New York, 1876) 
The following selection gives an interesting picture of life in 
Mohammedan Spain in the time of its Golden Age. 
Scarcely had the Arabs become firmly settled in Spain when they 
commenced a brilliant career. Adopting what had now become the 
established policy of the Commanders of the Faithful in Asia, the 
Emirs of Cordova distinguished themselves as patrons of learning, and 
set an example of refinement strongly contrasting with the condition of 
the native European princes. Cordova, under their administration, at 
its highest point of prosperity, boasted of more than two hundred thou- 
sand houses, and more than a million of inhabitants. After sunset, a 
man might walk through it in a straight line for ten miles by the light 
of the public lamps. Seven hundred years after this time there was not 
so much as one public lamp in London. Its streets were solidly paved. 
In Paris, centuries subsequently, whoever stepped over his threshold 
ona rainy day stepped up to his anklesin mud. Other cities, as Gra- 
nada, Seville, Toledo, considered themselves as rivals of Cordova. The 
palaces of the khalifs were magnificently decorated. Those sovereigns 
might well look down with supercilious contempt on the dwellings of 
the rulers of Germany, France, and England, which were scarcely bet- 
ter than stables — chimneyless, windowless, and with a hole in the roof 
for the smoke to escape, like the wigwams of certain Indians. The 
Spanish Mohammedans had brought with them all the luxuries and 
prodigalities of Asia... . The representation of the human form was 
religiously forbidden . . . For this reason, the Arabs never produced 
artists; religion turned them from the beautiful, and made them sol- 
diers, philosophers, and men of affairs. . . . There were, for the master 
himself, grand libraries. The Khalif Alhakem’s was so large that the 
catalogue alone filled forty volumes. He had also apartments for 
the transcribing, binding, and ornamenting of books. A taste for 
caligraphy and the possession of splendidly-illustrated manuscripts 
seems to have anticipated in the khalifs, both of Asia and Spain, the 
taste for statuary and paintings among the later popes of Rome. ... 
In the midst of all this luxury, which cannot be regarded by the his- 
torian with disdain, since in the end it produced a most important re- 
sult in the south of France, the Spanish khalifs, emulating the example 
of their Asiatic compeers, and in this strongly contrasting with the 
popes of Rome, were not only the patrons, but the personal cultivators 
of all the branches of human learning. One of them was himself the 
author of a work on polite literature in not less than fifty volumes; 
another wrote a treatise on algebra. When Zaryab the musician came 
from the East to Spain, the Khalif Abderrahman rode forth to meet him  
-P-A-G-E-156
  130 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
inhonour. The College of Music in Cordova was sustained by ample 
government patronage, and produced many illustrious professors. 
Our obligations to the Spanish Moors in the arts of life are even more 
marked than in the higher branches of science, perhaps only because our 
ancestors were better prepared to take advantage of things connected 
with daily affairs. They set an example of skilful agriculture, the 
practice of which was regulated by a code of laws. Not only did they 
attend to the cultivation of plants, introducing very many new ones, 
they likewise paid great attention to the breeding of cattle, especially 
the sheep and horse. To them we owe the introduction of the great 
products, rice, sugar, cotton, and also, as we have previously observed, 
nearly all the fine garden and orchard fruits, together with many less 
important plants, as spinach and saffron. To them Spain owes the 
culture of silk; they gave the Xeres and Malaga their celebrity for wine. 
They introduced the Egyptian system of irrigation by floodgates, 
wheels, and pumps. They also promoted many important branches of 
industry; improved the manufacture of textile fabrics, earthenware, 
iron, steel; the Toledo sword-blades were everywhere prized for their 
temper. The Arabs, on their expulsion from Spain, carried the manu- 
facture of a kind of leather, in which they were acknowledged to excel, 
to Morocco, from which country the leather itself has now taken its 
name. ‘They also introduced inventions of a more ominous kind — 
gunpowder and artillery. The cannon they used appeared to have 
been made’ of wrought iron. But perhaps they more than compen- 
sated for these evil contrivances by the introduction of the mariner’s 
compass. 
The mention of the mariner’s compass might lead us correctly to in- 
fer that the Spanish Arabs were interested in commercial pursuits, a 
conclusion to which we should also come when we consider the revenues 
of some of their khalifs. That of Abderrahman III. is stated at five 
and a half million sterling —a vast sum if considered by its modern 
equivalent, and far more than could possibly be raised by taxes on the 
produce of the soil. It probably exceeded the entire revenue of all the 
sovereigns of Christendom taken together. From Barcelona and other 
ports an immense trade with the Levant was maintained, but it was 
mainly in the hands of the Jews, who, from the first invasion of Spain 
by Musa, had ever been the firm allies and collaborators of the Arabs. 
Together they had participated in the dangers of the invasion; together 
they had shared its boundless success; together they had held in irrev- 
erent derision, nay, even in contempt, the woman-worshippers and 
polytheistic savages beyond the Pyrenees — as they mirthfully called 
those whose long-delayed vengeance they were in the end to feel; to- 
gether they were expelled. Against such Jews as lingered behind the 
hideous persecutions of the Inquisition were directed. But in the days 
of their prosperity they maintained a merchant marine of more than a
-P-A-G-E-157
  INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 131 
thousand ships. They had factories and consuls on the Tanais. With 
Constantinople alone they maintained a great trade; it ramified from 
the Black Sea and East Mediterranean into the interior of Asia; it 
reached the ports of India and China, and extended along the African 
coast as far as Madagascar. Even in these commercial affairs the sin- 
gular genius of the Jew and Arab shines forth. In the midst of the 
tenth century, when Europe was about in the same condition that 
Caffraria is now, enlightened Moors, like Abul Cassem, were writing 
treatises on the principles of trade and commerce. As on so many 
other occasions, on these affairs they have left their traces. The small- 
est weight they used in trade was the grain of barley, four of which 
were equal to one sweet pea, called in Arabic carat. We still use the 
grain as our unit of weight, and still speak of gold as being so many 
carats fine. 
Such were the Khalifs of the West; such their splendour, their lux- 
ury, their knowledge; such some of the obligations we are under to 
them — obligations which Christian Europe, with singular insincerity, 
has ever been fain to hide. The cry against the misbeliever has long 
outlived the Crusades. Considering the enchanting country over 
which they ruled, it was not without reason that they caused to be en- 
graven on the public seal, “The servant of the Merciful rests contented 
in the decrees of God.”’ What more, indeed, could Paradise give them? 
But, considering also the evil end of all this happiness and pomp, this 
learning, liberality, and wealth, we may well appreciate the solemn 
truth which these monarchs, in their day of pride and power, grandly 
wrote in the beautiful mosaics on their palace walls, an ever-recurring 
warning to him who owes dominion to the sword, “There is no 
conqueror but God.” 
86. Learning among the Moslems of Spain 
(Draper, J. W., History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, vol. 11, pp. 36-42. 
New York, 1876) 
The following is a continuation of the preceding selection. 
The khalifs of the West carried out the precepts of Ali, the fourth 
successor of Mohammed, in the patronage of literature. They estab- 
lished libraries in all their chief towns; it is said that not fewer than sev- 
enty were in existence. To every mosque was attached a public school, 
in which the children of the poor were taught to read and write, and in- 
structed in the precepts of the Koran. For those in easier circum- 
stances there were academies, usually arranged in twenty-five or thirty 
- apartments, each calculated for accommodating four students; the 
academy being presided over by a rector. In Cordova, Granada, and 
other great cities, there were universities, frequently under the superin- 
tendence of Jews; the Mohammedan maxim being that the real learn-
-P-A-G-E-158
  132 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ing of a man is of more public importance than any particular religious 
opinions he may entertain. In this they followed the example of the 
Asiatic khalif, Haroun Alraschid, who actually conferred the superin- 
tendence of his schools on John Masué, a Nestorian Christian. The 
Mohammedan liberality was in striking contrast with the intolerance 
of Europe. Indeed, it may be doubted whether at this time any Euro- 
pean nation is sufficiently advanced to follow such an example. In the 
universities some of the professors of polite literature gave lectures on 
Arabic classical works; others taught rhetoric or composition, or math- 
ematics, or astronomy. From these institutions many of the prac- 
tices observed in our colleges were derived. They held Commence- 
ments, at which poems were read and orations delivered in the presence 
of the public. They had also, in addition to these schools of general 
learning, professional ones, particularly for medicine. 
With a pride perhaps not altogether inexcusable, the Arabians 
boasted of their language as being the most perfect spoken by man. . . . 
It is not then surprising that, in the Arabian schools, great attention 
was paid to the study of language, and that so many celebrated gram- 
marians were produced. By these scholars, dictionaries, similar to 
those now in use, were composed; their copiousness is indicated by the 
circumstance that one of them consisted of sixty volumes, the defini- 
tion of each word being illustrated or sustained by quotations from 
Arab authors of acknowledged repute. They had also lexicons of 
Greek, Latin, Hebrew; and cyclopedias such as the “Historical Dic- 
tionary of Sciences” of Mohammed Ibn Abdallah, of Granada... . 
Their poetical productions embriced all the modern minor forms — 
satires, odes, elegies, etc.; but they never produced any work in the 
higher walks of poesy, no epic, no tragedy. Perhaps this was due to 
their false fashion of valuing the mechanical execution of a work. They 
were the authors and introducers of rhyme; . . . this is the more inter- 
esting to us, since it was from the Provengal poetry, the direct de- 
scendant of these efforts, that European literature arose. Sonnets and 
romances at last displaced the grimly-orthodox productions of the 
wearisome and ignorant fathers of the Church. 
. .. Many of their learned men were travellers and voyagers, con- 
stantly moving about for the acquisition or diffusion of knowledge, 
their acquirements being a passport to them wherever they went, anda 
sufficient introduction to any of the African or Asiatic courts. They 
were thus continually brought into contact with men of affairs, soldiers 
of fortune, statesmen, and became imbued with much of their practical 
spirit; and hence the singularly romantic character which the biogra- 
phies of many of these mendisplay, wonderful turnsof prosperity, violent 
deaths. The scope of their literary labours offers a subject well worthy 
of meditation; it contrasts with the contemporary ignorance of Europe. 
Some wrote on chronology; some on numismatics; some, now that mili-
-P-A-G-E-159
    INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 133 
tary eloquence had become objectless, wrote on pulpit oratory; some 
on agriculture and its allied branches, as the art of irrigation. Not 
one of the purely mathematical, or mixed, or practical sciences was 
omitted. 
Out of a list too long for detailed quotation, I may recall a few names. 
Assamh, who wrote on topography and statistics, a brave soldier, who 
was killed in the invasion of France, A.D. 720; Avicenna, the great phy- 
sician and philosopher, who died a.p. 1037; Averroés, of Cordova, the 
chief commentatoron Aristotle, A.D. 1198. It was his intention to unite 
the doctrines of Aristotle with those of the Koran. To him is imputed 
the discovery of spots upon the sun. ... Abu Othman wrote on zoélogy; 
Alberuni, on gems — he had travelled to India to procure information; 
Rhazes, Al Abbas, and Al Beithar, on botany — the latter had been in 
all parts of the world for the purpose of obtaining specimens. Ebn 
Zoar, better known as Avenzoar, may be looked upon as the authority 
in Moorish pharmacy. Pharmacopceias were published by the schools, 
improvements on the old ones of the Nestorians: to them may be traced 
the introduction of many Arabic words, such as syrup, julep, elixir, still 
used among apothecaries. A competent scholar might furnish not only 
an interesting, but valuable book, founded on the remaining relics of 
the Arab vocabulary; for, in whatever direction we may look, we meet, 
in the various pursuits of peace and war, of letters and of science, Sar- 
acenic vestiges. Our dictionaries tell us that such is the origin of 
admiral, alchemy, alcohol, algebra, chemise, cotton, and hundreds of 
other words. The Saracens commenced the application of chemistry, 
both to the theory and practice of medicine, in the explanation of the 
functions of the human body and in the cure of its diseases. Nor was 
their surgery behind their medicine. ' Albucasis, of Cordova, shrinks 
not from the performance of the most formidable operations in his own 
and in the obstetrical art; the actual cautery and knife are used with- 
out hesitation. He has left us ample descriptions of the surgical in- 
struments then employed; and from him we learn that, in operations on 
females in which considerations of delicacy intervened, the services of 
properly instructed women were secured. How different was -all 
this from the state of things in Europe: The Christian peasant, 
fever-stricken or overtaken by accident, hied to the nearest saint- 
shrine and expected a miracle; the Spanish Moor relied on the pre- 
scription or lancet of his physician, or the bandage and knife of his 
surgeon. 
In Mathematics the Arabians acknowledged their indebtedness to 
two sources, Greek and Indian, but they greatly improved upon both. 
The Asiatic khalifs had made exertions to procure translations of 
Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, and other Greek geometers. Al- 
mainon, in a letter to the Emperor Theophilus, expressed his desire to 
visit Constantinople if his public duties would have permitted. He
-P-A-G-E-160
  134 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
requests of him to allow Leo the mathematician to come to Bagdad to 
impart to him a portion of his learning, pledging his word that he would 
restore him quickly and safely again. “Do not,” says the high-minded 
khalif, “let diversity of religion or of country cause you to refuse my 
request. Do what friendship would concede to a friend. In return, I 
offer you a hundred weight of gold, a perpetual alliance, and peace.” 
True to the instincts of his race and the traditions of his city, the By- 
zantine sourly and insolently refused the request, saying that “the 
learning which had illustrated the Roman name should never be im- 
parted to a barbarian.” 
From the Hindus the Arabs learned arithmetic, especially that val- 
uable invention termed by us the Arabic numerals, but honourably 
ascribed by them to its proper source, under the designation of “In- 
dian numerals.” They also entitled their treatises on the subject 
“Systems of Indian Arithmetic.” This admirable notation by nine 
digits and cipher occasioned a complete revolution in arithmetical 
computations. As in the case of so many other things, the Arab im- 
press is upon it; our word cipher, and its derivatives, ciphering, etc., 
recall the Arabic word tsaphara or ciphra, the name for the o, and 
meaning that which is blank or void. Mohammed Ben Musa, said to 
be the earliest of the Saracen authors on algebra, and who made the 
great improvement of substituting sines for chords in trigonometry, 
wrote also on this Indian system. He lived at the end of the ninth 
century; before the end of the tenth it was in common use among the 
African and Spanish mathematicians. Ebn Junis, A.D. 1008, used it 
in his astronomical works. From Spain it passed into Italy, its singular 
advantage in commercial computation causing it to be eagerly adopted 
in the great trading cities. We still use the word algorithm in reference 
to calculations. The study of algebra was intently cultivated among 
the Arabs, who gave it the name it bears. Ben Musa, just referred to, 
was the inventor of the common method of solving quadratic equations. 
In the application of mathematics to astronomy and physics they had 
long been distinguished. Almaimon had determined with considerable 
accuracy the obliquity of the ecliptic. He had also ascertained the 
size of the earth from the measurement of a degree on the shore of the 
Red Sea — an operation implying true ideas of its form, and in singular 
contrast with thedoctrineof Constantinople and Rome. While the lat- 
ter wasasserting, inall itsabsurdity, the flatness of the earth, the Spanish 
Moors were teaching geography in their common schools from globes. 
In Africa, there is still preserved, with almost religious reverence, in the 
library at Cairo, one of brass, reputed to have belonged to the great 
astronomer Ptolemy. Al Idrisi made one of silver for Roger II, of 
Sicily; and Gerbert used one which he had brought from Cordova in the 
school he established at Rheims. It cost a struggle of several centuries, 
illustrated by some martyrdoms, before the dictum of Lactantius and 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 135 
Augustine could be overthrown. Among problems of interest that were 
solved may be mentioned the determination of the length of the year by 
Albategnius and Thebit Ben Corrah; and increased accuracy was given 
to the correction of astronomical observations by Alhazen’s great dis- 
covery of atmospheric refraction. Among the astronomers, some com- 
posed tables; some wrote on the measure of time; some on the improve- 
ment of clocks, for which purpose they were the first to apply the 
pendulum; some on instruments, as the astrolabe. ‘The introduction of 
astronomy into Christian Europe has been attributed to the translation 
of the works of Mohammed Fargani. In Europe, also, the Arabs were 
the first to build observatories; the Giralda, or tower of Seville, was 
erected under the superintendence of Geber, the mathematician, A.D. 
1196, for that purpose. Its fate was not a little characteristic. After 
the expulsion of the Moors it was turned into a belfry, the Spaniards 
not knowing what else to do with it. 
87. Works of Aristotle known by 1300 
(List adapted from Norton, Readings in the History of Education; Medieval 
Universities. Cambridge, 1909) 
This Greek scientist and philosopher lived from 384 to 322 B.c., 
and wrote his organization of human knowledge in Athens be- 
tween 335 B.c. and his death. His was the greatest organizing 
mind of antiquity, and it is no wonder that he came eventually 
to dominate medieval thinking. The following list of his works 
shows what had been recovered by 1300. Abélard, the great 
medizval scholar of France, who died in 1142, knew certainly 
only t and 2, though it is possible he had knowledge of 3 and 4. 
By 1150 all the Organon was known; between 1200 and 1270 most 
of the other works were translated; and by 1300 the twenty-one 
listed were known. For the next three centuries these were the 
great textbooks in the Faculty of Arts in the European univer- 
sities. 
Many of these came in fram Mohammedan sources in Spain, 
having experienced translation from the Greek into Syriac, then 
into Arabic, and then into Latin and Castilian, and were quite 
imperfect. After the capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders 
and the Venetians, in 1203, the original Greek texts began to 
find their way westward, and were translated directly into the 
Latin. By 1500all had been retranslated from the original Greek, 
and the newer Latin editions were in use. 
The following list was known by 1300:

88. Averroés, on Aristotle’s Greatness 
(Averroés; Introduction to his Commentary on Aristotle’s Physics) 
Abu’l Walid Mohammed Averroés, born at Cordova in 1126, 
of distinguished parents, became the greatest of all commentators 
on Aristotle, and exerted, through the translation of his works 
into Latin, a profound influence on the thinking of western 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 137 
Europe. His translations were the medium whereby much of 
the lost Aristotle was restored to western civilization. He ex- 
presses himself as to Aristotle’s greatness as follows. 
Aristotle was the wisest of the Greeks and constituted and completed 
logic, physics, and metaphysics. I say that he constituted these sci- 
ences, because all the works on these subjects previous to him do not 
deserve to be mentioned and were completely eclipsed by his writings 
I say that he put the finishing touches on these sciences, because none 
of those who have succeeded him up to our time, to wit, during nearly 
fifteen hundred years, have been able to add anything to his writings or 
to find in them any error of any importance. Now that all this should 
be found in one man is a strange and miraculous thing, and this privi- 
leged being deserves to be called divine rather than human. 
89. How Aristotle was Received at Oxford 
(A description by Roger Bacon; trans. by Rashdall) 
The following description by Roger Bacon, an English monk, 
who died in 1294, indicates a rather more tardy reception of 
Aristotle at Oxford than at Paris. 
But a part of the philosophy of Aristotle has come slowly into the use 
of the Latins. For his Natural Philosophy and Metaphysics, and the 
Commentaries of Averroés and of others, were 
translated in our times, and were excommuni- 
cated at Paris before the year of our Lord 1237 
on account of (their heretical views on) the 
eternity of matter and of time, and on account 
of the (heresies contained in the) book on In- 
ter pretation of Dreams (which is the third book 
on Sleep and Wakefulness), and on account of 
the many errors in the translation. The Logi- 
calia were also slowly received and read, for 
the blessed Edmund, Archbishop of Canter- 
bury, was the first at Oxford, in my time, to 
lecture on the book of Elenchi (Sophistical Ref- 
utations), and I saw Master Hugo who at first 
read the book of Posterior Analytics, and I saw

his opinion. So there were few (books) which (384-322 B.C.) 
were considered worth (reading) in the afore- 
said philosophy of Aristotle, considering the multitudes of Latins; nay, 
exceedingly few and almost none, up to this year of our Lord 1292. So, 
too, the Ethics of Aristotle has been tardily tried and has lately been 
read by Masters, though only here and there. And the entire remain-

ing philosophy of Aristotle in a thousand volumes, in which he treated 
all the knowledges, has never yet been translated and made known to 
the Latins. 
90. How Aristotle was Received at Paris 
(From Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1; trans. by Norton) 
The hesitant attitude of the ecclesiastical authorities toward 
the study of Aristotle, and later his adoption as the great sup- 
porter and bulwark of theology, is well shown in the following 
regulations adopted at Paris, between 1210 and 1254 A.D. 
(a) Church Council, Paris, 1210 
Nor shall the books of Aristotle on Natural Philosophy, and the Com- 
mentaries (of Averroés on Aristotle) be read in Paris in public or in 
secret; and this we enjoin under pain of excommunication. 
(b) Statutes of the Papal Legate for the University, 1215 
The treatises of Aristotle on Logic, both the Old and the New, are to 
be read in the schools in the regular and not in the extraordinary 
courses. On feast-days (holidays) nothing is to be read except .. . 
the Ethics, if one so chooses, and the fourth book of the Topics. The 
books of Aristotleon Metaphysics or Natural Philosophy, or the abridg- 
ments of these works, are not to be read. 
(c) Statutes of Pope Gregory for the University, 1231 
Furthermore, we command that the Mastersof Arts . . . shall not use 
in Paris those books on Natural Philosophy which for a definite reason 
were prohibited in the provincial council (of 1210), until they have been 
examined and purged from every suspicion of error. 
(d) Statutes of the Masters of Arts for the University, 1254 
None of Aristotle’s works is now forbidden. Of the twenty-one in the 
list given in Reading 87, the ones marked with a * are now prescribed 
as regular texts. 
g1. Abelard’s Sic et Non 
(Cousin, V., Ouvrages Inédits d’Abélard) 
As a teacher of theology at Paris, early in the twelfth century, 
Abélard (1079-1142) prepared a little textbook for the use of his 
pupils, entitled Sic et Non (Yea and Nay). It was in the form 
of a large number of questions as to Church dogma and practices, 
in which, after stating the question, he presented the arguments
-P-A-G-E-165
  
INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 139 
on both sides as gleaned from Scriptures and advanced by the 
Christian Fathers, but drew no conclusions. In the introduction 
he stated his method, it being his desire to stimulate thinking. 
The following extracts indicate the nature of the work. 
(a) From the Introduction to Sic et Non 
Tn truth, constant or frequent questioning is the first key to wisdom; 
and it is, indeed, to the acquiring of this (habit of) questioning with 
absorbing eagerness that the famous philosopher, Aristotle, the most 
clear-sighted of all, urges the studious when he says: “It is perhaps dif- 
ficult to speak confidently in matters of this sort unless they have often 
been investigated. Indeed, to doubt in special cases will not be with- 
out advantage.” For through doubting we come to inquiry, and 
through inquiry we perceive the truth. As the Truth Himself says: 
“Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.”’ And 
He also, instructing us by His own example, about the twelfth year of 
His life wished to be found sitting in the midst of the doctors, asking 
them questions, exhibiting to us by His asking of questions the appear- 
ance of a pupil, rather than, by preaching, that of a teacher, although 
there is in him, nevertheless, the full and perfect wisdom of God. 
Now when a number of quotations from (various) writings are in- 
troduced they spur on the reader, and allure him into seeking the truth 
in proportion as the authority of the writing itself is commended. . . . 
In accordance, then, with these forecasts it is our pleasure to collect 
different sayings of the holy Fathers as we planned, just as they have 
come to mind, suggesting (as they do) some questioning from their 
apparent disagreement, in order that they may stimulate tender read- 
ers to the utmost effort in seeking the truth and may make them keener 
as the result of their seeking. 
(b) Types of Questions he raised for Debate 
Of the 158 questions he raised and gave evidence on, the fol- 
lowing are illustrative. 
Should human faith be based on reason, or no? 
Is God one, or no? 
Is God a substance, or no? 
Does the first Psalm refer to Christ, or no? 
Is sin pleasing to God, or no? 
Is God the author of evil, or no? 
Is God all-powerful, or no? 
Can God be resisted, or no? 
Has God free will, or no? 
Was the first man persuaded to sin by the devil, or no? 
Was Adam saved, or no?
-P-A-G-E-166
  140 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Did all the apostles have wives except John, or no? 
Are the flesh and blood of Christ in very truth and essence present in 
the sacrament of the altar, or no? 
Do we sometimes sin unwillingly, or no? 
Does God punish the same sin both here and in the future, or no? 
Is it worse to sin openly than secretly, or no? 
92. The Great Work of the Schoolmen 
(Rashdall, H., Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, vol. 1, p. 365. 
Oxford, 1895 
The following statement gives a good summary of the organiz- 
ing and reconciling work of the Schoolmen, as well as of their 
services in satisfying the intellectual hunger of the age. 
The Dominican Theologians made peace between the contending 
factions by placing Aristotle and the Fathers side by side, and defer- 
ring as reverentially to one as to the other, except on the few fundamen- 
tal points upon which the former could not be interpreted into harmony 
with the latter. The Scholastic form of argument, which attained its 
full development in Aquinas — a chain of authorities and syllogisms in 
defence of one thesis, another series for the opposite view, a conclusion 
in harmony with Augustine or Aristotle as the case might:be, and a 
reply to the opposing arguments by means of ingenious distinction or 
reconciliation — afforded exceptional facilities for the harmonious 
combination of orthodoxy and intellectuality. 
The Dominicans showed the Latin Churchmen how to be ingenious, 
startling, brilliant, even destructive, without suspicion of heresy. 
(Saint) Bernard would have been shocked at the idea of inventing or 
even of fairly stating objections to the Catholic Faith. By the time 
of Aquinas it was felt_that the better the imaginary opponent’s case 
could be stated, the more credit there was in refuting it. The scholar’s 
intellectual enjoyment of thirty ingenious arguments against the Im- 
mortality of the Soul was not diminished by the thirty-six equally in- 
genious arguments with which the attack would immediately be met. 
In scholastic disputation . . . restless intellectual activity found an 
innocent outlet, love of controversy and speculation an innocent grati- 
fication; and into the love of controversy and speculation the real ax- 
dour for truth and knowledge, which distinguished the age of Berengar 
and the age of Abélard, had for the most part degenerated. 
93. The Justinian Code 
(Justinian, Preface to the Institutes; trans. by Sandars) 
The great compilation of Roman law known as the Corpus Juris 
Civilis was perfected at Constantinople by a staff of eminent 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 141 
jurists, under the direction of the Emperor Justinian, in 529-33 
A.D. It consisted of the Code, in twelve books; the Digest, in fifty 
books; and the Jmstitutes, in four books. The first contained the 
Statutes of the Emperors; the second extracts from legal opinions 
by Roman lawyers; and the third was an elementary textbook for 
students, somewhat like the English Blackstone. In the intro- 
duction to the Institutes Justinian explains the nature of the 
entire compilation. 
When we had arranged and brought into perfect harmony the hith- 
erto confused mass of imperial constitutions (i.e. the Code), we then 
extended our care to the vast volumes of ancient law; and, sailing as it 
were across the mid ocean, have now completed, through the favour of 
heaven, a work that once seemed beyond hope (i.e. the Digest). 
When by the blessing of God this task was accomplished, we sum- 
moned the most eminent Tribonian, master and ex-questor of our 
palace, together with the illustrious Theophilus and Dorotheus, profes- 
sors of law, all of whom have on many occasions proved to us their 
ability, legal knowledge, and obedience to our orders; and we have 
specially charged them to compose, under our authority and advice, 
Institutes, so that you may no more learn the first elements of law from 
old and erroneous sources, but apprehend them by the clear light of 
imperial wisdom; and that your minds and ears may receive nothing 
that is useless or misplaced, but only what obtains in actual practice. 
So that, whereas, formerly, the junior students could scarcely, after 
three years’ study, read the imperial constitutions, you may now 
commence your studies by reading them, you who have been thought 
worthy of an honour and a happiness so great that the first and last 
lessons in the knowledge of the law should issue for you from the 
mouth of the emperor. 
When, therefore, by the assistance of the same eminent person Tri- 
bonian and that of other illustrious and learned men, we have compiled 
the fifty books, called Digests or Pandects, in which is collected the 
whole ancient law, we directed that these Institutes should be divided 
into four books, which might serve as the first elements of the whole 
science of law. 
In these books a brief exposition is given of the ancient laws, and of 
those also, which, overshadowed by disuse, have been again brought 
to light by our imperial authority. 
These four books of Justitutes thus compiled, from all the Institutes 
left us by the ancients, and chiefly from the commentaries of our Gaius, 
both in his Institutes and in his work on daily affairs, and also from 
many other commentaries, were presented to us by the three learned 
men we have above named. We have read and examined them and 
have accorded to them all the force of our constitutions.
-P-A-G-E-168

Receive, therefore, with eagerness, and study with cheerful dili- 
gence, these our laws, and show yourselves persons of such learning 
that you may conceive the flattering hope of yourselves being able, 
when your course of legal study is completed, to govern our empire in 
the different portions that may be entrusted to your care. 
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh day of the calends of 
December, in the third consulate of the Emperor Justinian, ever

94. The Early Medieval Town 
(By Giry and Réville, in Lavisse et Rambaud’s Histoire Générale; trans. by Bates 
and Titsworth, in their The Emancipation of the Medieval Towns. Henry Holt, 
New York, 1907. Reproduced by permission) 
The following extract is a continuation of Reading 49, and 
describes briefly the formation of new towns and the condition 
of towns-people down to the thirteenth century. 
  (a) To the Eleventh Century 
Care should be taken not to overestimate the importance of the ur- 
ban communities during the first centuries of the Middle Ages. They 
were more numerous than important, and it is probable that they were 
neither very populous nor very rich. In a backward state of civiliza- 
tion it is impossible for towns to develop. A large city can live only 
by the exchange of its products for those things which it does not pro- 
duce but which are brought to it. Without commerce there can be 
no large cities. Now, in that obscure age which extends from the fifth 
to the tenth century, all commerce was reduced to an indispensable 
minimum, except during an ephemeral renaissance in the time of 
Charlemagne. Only the shores of the Mediterranean continued to be 
frequented by merchants, and the relations between Provence, Italy, 
Greece, and the Orient were never entirely broken. In consequence, 
the cities of that privileged region preserved, it seems, a commercial 
class and a certain degree of prosperity. Everywhere else commerce 
was nearly annihilated, because there was neither the security nor the 
centers of exchange which it needed. Each domain lived upon itself, 
was almost self-sufficient; made the iron, wood, and woolen articles it 
needed, as well as produced its own wheat. The towns probably did 
the same; they were rural bourgs, and the inhabitants were peasants 
who worked on the surrounding land. Besides, custom did not aid 
in their development. Kings, nobles, Gallo-Roman and Germanic 
proprietors preferred to live in the country; the towns were no longer 
the theater of great events. 
It is difficult to form a clear picture of the urban groups at that time 
and of the people that composed them. The new small towns huddled
-P-A-G-E-169
  INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 143 
around the castles, abbeys, and churches. The old cities, once spa- 
cious, razed their former suburbs and restricted their limits so as to 
have less area to defend, as at Paris, Bordeaux, Evreux, Poitiers, and 
Sens. Roman monuments are discovered to-day outside the enclo- 
sures which these towns made for themselves at the time of the inva- 
  Fic. 17. A TyprcAL MEpIzvAL Town 
A Prussian town, containing walls, castle, cathedral, watch-towers, and closely- 
huddled buildings 
sions. All towns, whenever possible, encircled themselves with ram- 
parts, with embattled walls surrounded by moats, and armed their 
counterscarps with traps, abatis, and palisades. Inside the city the 
population, although not numerous, must have lived crowded to- - 
gether, as the architecture of the houses-shows. The Roman dwelling 
was spread out in a comfortable way, with a large inner court, the 
atrium, and was generally low. Now the atrium was given up, filled 
in, and the roof rose high over a series of stories, which perhaps already 
were built so as to overhang, to gain still more room. As for monu- 
ments, the only ones which adorned the towns were those which the 
Romans had left. And sometimes even these were appropriated to 
strange uses, like the temple of Vesuna at Périgueux, which was 
changed into a tower for purposes of defense, or like the circus of 
Nimes, which sheltered a part of the inhabitants and formed a veri- 
table “quarter.”” Sometimes, too, these monuments were destroyed 
that the materials might be used for other constructions, especially 
for fortifications. 
Between the church and the seigniorial dwelling, which was usually 
built to one side upon a precipitous hill or upon an artificial mound, 
the townsman passed his monotonous life, happy when a private war 
or an incursion for pillage did not bring upon his house or upon him 
the horrors of assault. Of political rights, he had none. The lord 
or his officers ruled the inhabitants as masters, imposed dues upon 
them, arrested, and judged them. The civil condition of the inhabit- 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  144 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ants must also have grown harder. It seems, indeed, that the num- 
ber of freemen had noticeably diminished in the towns as well as in 
the country. Perhaps the cities of the south, thanks to their privileged 
situation, may have escaped in part this social decline; but this decline 
was general in the north, where only those preserved their independ- 
ence. who made it their business to bear arms in the following of a 
seignior and to live at the expense of others. 
Thus from the sixth to the tenth century, townsmen did not count 
in society. Bishop Adalberon, ina famous poem to King Robert, con- 
sidered around him only two classes; churchmen and nobles, beneath 
whom, but very far beneath, were the commons who worked. 
(b) By the Thirteenth Century 
On the whole, nothing could be more variable, or diverse, than the 
condition of the towns in the middle of the thirteenth century. Di- 
verse in their origin, some dated back to antiquity; others, born of the 
wretchedness of the times, during the ninth and tenth centuries, were 
slowly formed by continuous agglomeration about a monastery or 
castle; a goodly number were of recent and artificial formation and 
owed their existence to the intelligent initiative of a few barons. Di- 
verse in their history, some sustained struggles that were prolonged 
and hard, and sometimes savage; many bought more privileges than 
they gained by conquest; certain ones neither had to fight nor spend 
money, and saw themselves granted privileges which they did not ask 
for. Diverse in their prerogatives, some became independent repub- 
lics, others consular municipalities or sworn communes, free like the 
lords, and involved like them in the feudal hierarchy; some, finally, 
possessed liberties so strictly limited to the civil and administrative 
order that historians have made of them a separate class, under the 
name of towns of burgessy. These innumerable differences should 
not surprise us; it is the law of life and of progress. Societies, like 
species, become diversified as they develop. 
Development, in fact, is the common characteristic of the history of 
urban populations of the Middle Ages; the variety of their develop- 
ment is infinite. Let us note the profound transformation they under- 
went. In place of small bourgs, continually narrowing their bounda- 
ries in order to have less to defend, and becoming depopulated through 
wars, pillage, and famines that commerce no longer mitigated, were sub- 
stituted more numerous and larger towns, which outgrew their walls 
and had powerful suburbs, and in which, thanks to the impulse of in- 
dustry and trade, inhabitants abounded. In place of miserable and 
servile populations succeeded new generations, which attained compe- 
tence, sometimes wealth, and through competence liberty: personal and 
civil liberty always and everywhere; often also collective and political 
liberty, although in infinitely varied degrees and very unequally dis-
-P-A-G-E-171

tributed. The towns from the seventh to the tenth century seemed 
mute; a sepulchral atmosphere pervaded them. In the thirteenth cen- 
tury the cities hummed like hives. The streets were still narrow, ir- 
regular, and unsanitary, but they were teeming with life. Encumber- 
ing them were bales, baskets, venders crying their wares, and enormous 
signs swinging in the wind, which sometimes imperiled the safety of 
passers-by. It was a new civilization bursting into bloom. Splendid 
monuments arose, attesting the public prosperity and the genius of 
modest, unknown builders; romanesque and gothic churches lifted 
toward heaven their domes, campaniles, or spires; glorious belfries, 
which dominated and threatened their surroundings, awaiting the 
approaching time when the inimitable town halls, with their brilliant 
ornamentations of stone, should cause them to be forgotten. The 
town bell was the public voice of the city, as the church bell was the 
voice of souls. The city in the thirteenth century lived, spoke, and 
acted. It was a new factor in society. A heretofore unknown order, 
which grand and distant destinies awaited, was slowly growing. This 
order was the Third Estate. 
95. An English Town Charter . 
(Gross, Charles, The Gild Merchant, vol. u, p. 244. Oxford, 1890) 
The following town charter, granted by Henry II (1154-89), to 
the town of Wallingford, England, is illustrative of these medix- 
val documents. Note the importance of the guild merchant in 
the government of the town and in freedom of travel. 
Henry, by the grace of God, King of England, Duke of Normandy 
and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, . . . Icommand you that my bur- 
gesses of Wallingford shall have my secure peace through my whole 
land of England and Normandy, wherever they may be. And know 
that I have given and conceded to them forever all their liberties and 
laws and customs well and honorably, just as they had them best and 
most honorably in the time of King Edward, and in the time of my 
great grandfather King William, and of his son, the second King Wil- 
liam, and in the time of King Henry, my grandfather; that is to say, 
that they should have freely the guild merchant with all its customs and 
laws, so that neither my bailiff nor any justice of mine should meddle 
with their guild; but only their own alderman and officer. And if my 
officers or any justice shall have brought suit against them in any plea 
or for any occasion or shall have wished to lead them into a suit, I for- 
bid it, and require that they should not make defense in any manner, 
except in their own proper portmote. And if the reeve himself shall 
implead them on any occasion without an accuser, they shall not re- 
spond, and if on account of any transgression, or by a right judgment 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
    146 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
any one of them shall have made forfeiture by a right consideration of 
the burgesses, to the reeve shall he pay it. I forbid, moreover, and 
require that there shall be no market in Crowmarsh, nor any merchant, 
unless he is in the guild of merchants; and if any one goes out from the 
borough of Wallingford and lives from the merchandise of the same 
Wallingford, I command that he should make the right guild of the 
merchants with the same burgesses, wherever he may be, within the 
borough or without. Know moreover, that I have given and conceded 
forever to all the men of Wallingford full quittance from my yearly rent, 
which they were accustomed to pay from the borough of Wallingford, 
that is to say, from that which pertains to me in the borough. All 
these laws and customs and liberties and quittances I give to them and 
concede forever, and all others which they are able to show that their 
ancestors had, freely, quietly, and honorably, just as my citizens of 
Winchester ever had them at the best; and this on account of the great 
service and labor which they sustained for me in the acquisition of 
my hereditary right in England. I concede to them, moreover, that 
wherever they shall go in their journeys as merchants, through my 
whole land of England and Normandy, Aquitaine and Anjou, “by 
water and by strand, by wood and by land,” they shall be free from 
toll and passage fees, and from all customs and exactions; nor are they 
to be troubled in this respect by any one, under a penalty of £10. I 
forbid, moreover, and require under the same penalty, that the reeve 
of Wallingford shall not make any fine of scotale or New Year’s gift 
from any one, and that he shall not establish any custom in Walling- 
ford which shall injure the burgesses of the town. Of this grant and 
concession, the witnesses are Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury and 
others. Given at Oxford, the first day before the Ides of January. 
96. Oath of a New Freeman in a Medieval Town 
(Sharpe, R.R., Calendar of Letter Books Preserved among the Archives of the Corporation 
of the City of London at the Guildhall, Letter Book D, p. 195. London, 1899-1912) 
Apprenticeship in England goes back to the thirteenth century. 
The regulations as to freemen, their oaths, and the number and 
conditions of apprenticeship were early prescribed. The follow- 
ing oath of a Freeman has been preserved at the Guildhall, in 
London, and dates from 1275. . 
Ye shall swear that ye shall be faithful and loyal unto our Lord the 
King, King of England . . . and the franchises and customs of the City 
ye shall maintain according to your power. ... Ye shall take no ap- 
prentice for less than seven years, and ye shall cause him to be en- 
rolled as such within the first year of your covenant, and at the end of 
his term, if he has well and loyally served you, you shall cause his
-P-A-G-E-173
  INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 147 
egress to be enrolled. . . . And ye shall take no apprentice unless he be 
a free man and not a bondsman. All of which points aforesaid ye shall 
well and truly keep, so God you help and all his saints. 
97. Ordinances of the White-Tawyer’s Guild 
(Riley, Henry T., Memorials of London, p. 232) 
The following ordinances of the guild of white-tawyers, that is 
those who dressed leather with salt, alum, and other substances, 
to give it a white surface, is typical of guild regulations and guild 
activities of the time. The date of the document is uncertain, 
but probably about the middle of the fourteenth century. 
In honor of God, of our Lady, and of all Saints, and for the nurture 
of tranquillity and peace among the good folks the megucers, called 
white-tawyers, the folks of the same trade have, by assent of Richard 
Lacer, mayor, and of the aldermen, ordained the points under-written. 
In the first place, they have ordained that they will find a wax can- 
dle, to burn before our Lady in the church of Allhallows, near London 
wall. 
Also, that each person of the said trade shall put in the box such 
sum as he shall think fit, in aid of maintaining the said candle. 
Also, if by chance any one of the said trade shall fall into poverty, 
whether through old age or because he cannot labor or work, and have 
nothing with which to keep himself, he shall have every week from the 
said box 7d. for his support, if he be a man of good repute. And after 
his decease, if he have a wife, a woman of good repute, she shall have 
weekly for her support 7d. from the said box, so long as she shall be- 
have herself well and keep single. 
And that no stranger shall work in the said trade, or keep house for 
the same in the city, if he be not an apprentice, or a man admitted to 
the franchise of the said city. 
And that no one shall take the serving-man of another to work with 
him, during his term, unless it be with the permission of his master. 
And if any one of the said trade shall have work in his house that 
he cannot complete, or if for want of assistance such work shall be in 
danger of being lost, those of the said trade shall aid him, that so the 
said work be not lost. : 
And if any one of the said trade shall depart this life, and have not 
wherewithal to be buried, he shall be buried at the expense of their 
common box. And when any one of the said trade shall die, all those 
of the said trade shall go to the vigil, and make offering on the morrow. 
And if any serving-man shail conduct himself in any other manner 
than properly toward his master, and act rebelliously toward him, no 
one of the said trade shall set him to work, until he shall have made
-P-A-G-E-174
  3148 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
amends before the mayor and aldermen; and before them such mis- 
prision shall be redressed. 
And that no one of the said trade shall behave himself the more 
thoughtlessly, in the way of speaking or acting amiss, by reason of the 
points aforesaid; and if any one shall do to the contrary thereof, he 
shall not follow the said trade until he shall have reasonably made 
amends. 
And if any one of the said trade shall do to the contrary of any point 
of the ordinances aforesaid, and be convicted thereof by good men of 
the same trade, he shall pay to the Chamber of the Gildhall of London, 
the first time 2s., the second time 4od., the third time half a mark, 
and the fourth time ros., and shall forswear the trade. 
Also, — that the good folks of the same trade shall once in the year 
be assembled in a certain place, convenient thereto, there to choose 
two men of the most loyal and befitting of the said trade, to be over- 
seers of work and all other things touching the trade for that year; 
which persons shall be presented to the mayor and aldermen for the 
time being, and sworn before them diligently to inquire and make 
search, and loyally to present to the said mayor and aldermen such 
defaults as they shall find touching the said trade without sparing any 
one for friendship or for hatred, or in any other manner. And if any 
one of the said trade shall be found rebellious against the said over- 
seers, so as not to let them properly make their search and assay, as 
they ought to do; or if he shall absent himself from the meeting afore- 
said, without reasonable cause, after due warning by the said over- 
seers, he shall pay to the Chamber, upon the first default, 4od.; and 
on the second like default, half a mark; and on the third one mark; 
and on the fourth, 20s., and shall forswear the trade forever. 
Also, that if the overseers shall be found lax and negligent about 
their duty, or partial to any person for gift or for friendship, maintain- 
ing him or voluntarily permitting him to continue in his default, and 
shall not present him to the mayor and aldermen, as before stated, 
they are to incur the penalty aforesaid. 
Also, that each year, at such assemblies of the good folks of the said 
trade, there shall be chosen overseers, as before stated. And if it be 
found that through laxity or negligence of the said governors such 
assemblies are not held, each of the said overseers is to incur the said

(Report of the Commissioner of Edward VI, Toulmin Smith, Ordinances of English 
Guilds, p. 105. In Old English Text Society Pubs.) 
Many of the guilds, after the twelfth century, began to main- 
tain schools for the educa- 
tion of the children of their 
members. During the reign 
of Edward VI (1547-53) an 
investigation as to schools 
was made, and in the Re-

99. Indenture of Apprenticeship, 1396 
(From the Archeological Journal, London, 1872, vol. xxIx, 184. Trans. by H. C.) 
The following Indenture of Apprenticeship was executed in 
Northampton, England, in 1396, and is typical of apprenticeship 
documents for hundreds of years thereafter. 
This Indenture testifies that thus it is agreed between John Hyndlee 
of Northampton, Brazier, on the one part, and Thomas Edward, son of 
Gilbert Edward of Windsor, on the other part, that the aforesaid 
Thomas shall place himself and serve as apprentice to the said John 
Hyndlee, to be subject to this John Hyndlee and his assigns well and 
faithfully after the custom of apprentices, from the feast of All Saints 
next following after the present date up to the end of the seven years 
next succeeding shall have been fulfilled and completed, to the art 
called brazier’s craft, practiced by the said John, during this time learn- 
ing humbly. - 
i Subject to him during the term of seven years aforesaid, the above- 
mentioned Thomas Edward shall keep secret all concerns of his said 
master John Hyndlee which ought to be concealed. He shall not do 
any injury to John, his master, nor see any done, but shall quickly 
prevent anything of the kind and shall protect his said master stead- 
fastly from this time forth. He shall not absent himself from his 
aforesaid service. He shall not employ the goods and cattle of the said 
John, his master, without his permission. Booths, prostitutes, dies, 
dice, and similar games he shall not frequent, at the expense of his 
aforesaid master. He shall by no means commit fornication or adultery 
with any woman of the house and family of the said John, his master, 
nor shall he marry a wife, without the consent of his said master. The 
precepts, legal mandates, and reasonable requirements of the said John, 
his master, are to be faithfully observed by said Thomas; he shall dili- 
gently fulfill them, and obey the commands fully, during the whole 
period of his term above noted. And if the said Thomas should default 
from any of his agreements or from the prescribed articles, then said 
Thomas, according to the manner and the amount of his defection, shall 
make reparation to his master, John aforesaid, and shall double the 
term of his apprenticeship before mentioned, repeating his said service.
-P-A-G-E-177
  INFLUENCES TOWARD A REVIVAL 151 
And the aforesaid John Hyndlee and his assigns shall direct said 
Thomas, his apprentice, in the above-mentioned arts in the best way 
said John knows and is able to do, they shall teach and instruct him. 
Or, if they can make him learn in no other way, let them do it by pun- 
ishment. Moreover, said John shall give to the teaching and inform- 
ing of said Thomas in the art called the Pewterer’s craft as much as he 
knows how and is able to do beyond the limits of his first duties. And 
said John shall conceal (a hole in the deed) from said Thomas, his ap- 
prentice, none of the aforesaid arts, during the above-mentioned term. 
Finally, said John and his assigns shall furnish to said Thomas every- 
thing necessary to him, his food and clothing, linen, bedding, housing, 
shoes, et cetera, enough to suffice him each year according as the age 
and stature of the said Thomas increase during the term aforesaid. 
In testimony of this matter the above-mentioned parties have affixed 
to these Indentures their seals alternately. 
Dated at Northampton, the Sunday next after the feast of Saint 
Luke, the apostle and evangelist, in the nineteenth year of the reign of 
King Richard the Second, following the Conquest. 
Witnesses: — Henry Caysho, then mayor of the city of Northamp- 
ton, William Wale and John Wodeward, bailiffs of the same. Richard 
Gosselyn, John Esex Smyth, and others.

  CHAPTER 1X 
THE RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 
Tue Readings contained in this chapter relate to the rise of the 
medieval university, the organization of its instruction, and the 
influence of these institutions on the intellectual life of the later 
medieval period. Slowly evolving out of some cathedral or 
monastery school, which had for long been noted for the high 
character of its instruction, the universities of medieval Europe 
finally arose, were chartered as a medieval guild, and in time 
became important not only intellectually, but socially and politi- 
cally as well. For centuries they were almost the only homes of 
free thought. The value of their work is well set forth in the final 
selection of the chapter (124), by the great historian of these medi- 
eval institutions. 
The table giving country and date of foundation of these great 
medizval institutions (100) shows the slow progress of new ideas 
in the Europe of that day, and the direction and rate of that 
progress. As both teachers and students were regarded as clerici 
they naturally possessed the privileges and immunities of the 
clergy (51), but, these not being regarded as sufficient for the new 
traveling scholars, new privileges and exemptions and protections 
were extended to both masters and students. Of these new priv- 
ileges the grants of Frederick Barbarossa in Italy (x01), King 
Philip Augustus at Paris (102), Count Rupert at Heidelberg (103) 
and Philip IV of France (104) have been selected as typical. The 
charter granted to the new university of Heidelberg (103) is also 
typical of these early documents, and is noteworthy for the de- 
tailed provision it made for the future university. 
As these universities in time brought many strangers to the 
cities in which they were located, and as these persons needed 
eating and sleeping accommodations and thus helped local 
business, as well as adding to the intellectual prestige of the city, 
the different cities interested began to vie with one another in 
making special concessions to secure a university, and some even 
were willing to spend much money in maintaining such an insti- 
tution. The privileges granted by Vercelli, to induce a migrating
-P-A-G-E-179

body of professors and students from Padua to locate there (105), 
is a good example of the first; and the selection from Villani, as to 
the cost for maintaining a university (106), is a good example of 
the second. The efforts made by the English king to secure 
scholars from Paris (109) is another example of the first type. As 
the early universities were in no way held to place by buildings 
and equipment, as is a modern university, it was easy for them to 
move to some other city whenever conditions did not please them. 
This right of cessatio was formally recognized by Papal Bull (207), 
and was frequently exercised (108, 109) for reasons that to-day 
seem trivial. 
As the early universities were essentially guilds, with the stages 
of apprentice, journeyman, and master represented, the right to 
create and license masters was recognized almost from the first. 
The Bulls of Popes Gregory IX (107) and Nicholas IV (121), giv- 
ing such right to Paris, are typical and illustrative. The form of 
this license to teach is well shown in the document reproduced 
from Rashdall (112). 
The courses of reading or lectures required for the different de- 
grees are shown in the documents giving the requirements for the 
Arts degree at Paris (113), Leipzig (114 a-b), and Oxford (115); 
while the requirements for the still higher professional degrees in 
theology, civil and canon law, and medicine are well illustrated in 
the statement of Oxford requirements for each (116 a-b), and the 
Paris requirements for the degree in medicine (117). The scho- 
lastic character of the theological instruction may beinferred from 
the criticisms made by Roger Bacon (118), a keen Oxford scholar 
and monk of the latter part of the thirteenth century. 
The scarcity of books before the invention of printing did much 
to keep the character of the instruction on a low level, the master 
being compelled to ‘‘read”’ from the one text available and com- 
ment from his “‘gloss.” This lack of books is shown by the list 
of twenty-seven volumes contained in a scholar’s library, left by 
will to the University of Paris (119); by Roger Bacon’s lament 
(120); and by the Paris statute prescribing the character of the 
classroom instruction to be given (121). The latter also throws 
some light on the classroom conduct of the time. Selections 122 
and 123 reproduce two of the earliest schedules of lectures known, 
the one at Toulouse (122) dating from 1309, and the one from 
Leipzig (123) from 1519.

  156 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
tor. Privileges for Students who Travel for Study 
(Monumenta Germanie Historica; Leges, t, p. 114; trans. by Munro, in Translations 
and Reprints from Sources of European History, vol. 1, no. 3, p. 2) 
With the increase in the number of students who journeyed 
some distance to study, under famous cathedral-school teachers, 
the need for their better protection began to be evident. Many 
of these came from afar, and at a time when international 
courtesies and public safety were little known. As the presence 
of many strangers, attracted to a city or a little state to hear 
some noted teacher read and comment on the famous text- 
books of the time, added much to its prestige and wealth, it 
came to be worth while to offer them inducements to come, in 
the form of special favors and additional safety. 
By way of giving students better protection, however, the 
Emperor Frederick Barbaross, in 1158, issued the following docu- 
ment, the first of its kind of which we have record. This was 
said to have been obtained for the benefit of students going to 
Bologna to study civil and canon law, but it was made general, 
and applied to students and professors anywhere. Freedom from 
arrest for certain causes, and trial before the professors or bishop 
instead of the city authorities, were valuable privileges, and once 
granted were tenaciously retained by the universities. One still 
finds survivals of these ancient privileges in the jails and courts 
of the German universities, and in the English universities. 
After a careful consideration of this subject by the bishops, abbots, 
dukes, counts, judges, and other nobles of our sacred palace, we, from 
our piety, have granted this privilege to all scholars who travel for 
the sake of study, and especially, to the professors of divine and sacred 
laws, namely, that they may go in safety to the places in which the 
studies are carried on, both they themselves and their messengers, and 
may dwell there in security. For we think it fitting that, during good 
behavior, those should enjoy our praise and protection, by whose 
learning the world is enlightened to the obedience of God and of us, 
his ministers and the life of the subjects is moulded; and by a certain 
special love we defend them from ali injuries. 
For who does not pity those who exile themselves through love of 
learning, who wear themselves out in poverty in place of riches, who 
expose their lives to all perils and often suffer bodily injury from the ” 
vilest men — this must be endured with vexation. Therefore, we de- 
clare by this general and ever to be valid law, that in the future no 
one shall be so rash as to venture to inflict any injury on scholars, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  
  RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 157 
to occasion any loss to them on account of a debt owed to them by 
an inhabitant of their province — a thing which we have learned is 
sometimes done by an evil custom. And let it be known to the vio- 
laters of this constitution, and also to those who shall at the time be 
the rulers of the places, that a four-fold restitution of property shall be 
exacted from all and that, the mark of infamy being affixed to them 
by the law itself, they shall lose their office forever. 
Moreover, if any one shall presume to bring a suit against them on 
account of any business, the choice in this matter shall be given to the 
scholars, who may summon the accusers to appear before their profes- 
sors or the bishop of the city, to whom we have given jurisdiction in 
this matter. But if, in sooth, the accuser shall attempt to drag the 
scholar before another judge, even if his cause is a very just one, he 
shall lose his suit for such an attempt. 
We also order this law to be inserted among the imperial constitu- 
tions under the title, me filius pro patre, etc. 
Given at Roncaglia, in the year of our Lord 1158, in the month of 
November. ; 
102. Privileges granted the Students at Paris by Philip Augustus 
(Chartulariwm Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1,no. 1, p. 59; trans. by Munro, Trans- 
lations and Reprints from Sources of European History, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 4-7) 
This is the first royal privilege granted at Paris which has been 
preserved to us. It dates from 1200. Since students and teach- 
ers could leave the city so easily, and thus seriously interfere 
with its prosperity, it was desirable to make many concessions to 
them to make them satisfied to remain. Later, in the interests 
of law and order, many of these privileges had to be withdrawn. 
Here the king makes very liberal grants. 
In the Name of the sacred and indivisible Trinity, amen. Philip, 
by the grace of God, King of the French. Let all men know, now and 
in the future, that for the terrible crime owing to which five of the 
clergy and laity at Paris were killed by certain malefactors, we shall do 
justice as follows: that Thomas, then provost, concerning whom more 
than all others the students have complained, because he denies the 
deed, we shall consign to perpetual imprisonment, in close confinement, 
with meagre fare, as long as he shall live; unless, perchance, he shall 
choose to undergo publicly at Paris the ordeal by water. If he suc- 
ceeds, never henceforth at Paris nor anywhere else in our own land 
shall he be our provost or bailiff; nor elsewhere, if we are able to pre- 
vent it; nor shall he in the future enter Paris. 
. .. concerning the safety of.the students at Paris in the future, by 
the advice of our subjects we have ordained as follows: we will cause 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  158 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
all the citizens of Paris to swear that if any one sees an injury done to 
any student by any layman, he will testify truthfully to this, nor will 
any one withdraw in order not to see (the act). And if it shall happen 
that any one strikes a student, except on self-defense, especially if he 
strikes the student with a weapon, a club or a stone, all laymen who 
see (the act) shall in good faith seize the malefactor or malefactors and 
deliver them to our judge; nor shall they withdraw in order not to see 
the act, or seize the malefactor, or testify to the truth. Also, whether 
the malefactor is seized in open crime or not, we will make a legal and 
full examination through clerks or laymen or certain lawful persons; 
and our count and our judges shall do the same. And if by a full ex- 
amination we or our judges are able to learn that he who is accused, 
is guilty of the crime, then -we or our judges shall immediately inflict 
a penalty, according to the quality and nature of the crime; notwith- 
standing the fact that the criminal may deny the deed and say that he 
is ready to defend himself in single combat, or to purge himself by the 
ordeal by water. 
Also, neither our provost nor our judges shall lay hands on a student 
for any offense whatever; nor shall they place him in our prison, unless 
such a crime has been committed by the student, that he ought to be 
arrested. And in that case, our judge shall arrest him on the spot, 
without:striking him at all, unless he resists, and shall hand him over 
to the ecclesiastical judge, who ought to guard him in order to satisfy 
us and the one suffering the injury. And if a serious crime has been 
committed, our judge shall go or shall send to see what is done with 
the student. If, indeed, the student does not resist arrest and yet 
suffers any injury, we will exact satisfaction for it, according to the 
aforesaid examination and the aforesaid oath. Also our judges shall 
not lay hands on the chattels of the students at Paris for any crime 
whatever. But if it shall seem that these ought to be sequestrated, 
they shall be sequestrated and guarded after sequestration by the 
ecclesiastical judge, in order that whatever is judged legal by the 
church; may be done with the chattels. But if students are arrested 
by our count at such an hour that the ecclesiastical judge can not be 
found and be present at once, our provost shall cause the culprits to 
be guarded in some student’s house without any ill-treatment, as is 
said above, until they are delivered to the ecclesiastical judge. . . . 
In order, moreover, that these (decrees) may be kept more carefully 
and may be established forever by a fixed law, we have decided that 
our present provost and the people of Paris shall affirm by an oath, in 
the presence of the scholars, that they will carry out in good faith all 
the above-mentioned. And always in the future, whosoever receives 
from us the office of provost in Paris, among the other initiatory acts 
of his office, namely, on the first or second Sunday, in one of the 
churches of Paris, — after he has been summoned for the purpose, —
-P-A-G-E-185

shall affirm by an oath, publicly in the presence of the scholars, that 
he will keep in good faith all the above-mentioned. And that these 
decrees may be valid forever, we have ordered this document to be 
confirmed by the authority of our seal and by the characters of the 
royal name, signed below. i

103. Charter of the University of Heidelberg 
(Emminghaus, Corpus Juris Germanici; trans. by Henderson) 
The following complete university charter, dating from 1386, 
is interesting in showing how much Paris formed a model, and 
also the extent of the grant of privileges to the master and 
scholars. 
a. We, Rupert the elder, by the grace of God Count Palatine of the 
Rhine, elector of the Holy Empire and duke of Bavaria — lest we seem 
to abuse the privilege conceded to us by the apostolic see of founding 
a place of study at Heidelberg like to that at Paris, and lest, for this 
reason, being subjected to the divine judgment, we should merit to 
be deprived of the privilege granted, —do decree with provident 
counsel, which decree is to be observed there unto all time, that the 
university of Heidelberg shall be ruled, disposed and regulated accord- 
ing to the modes and matters accustomed to be observed in the uni- 
versity of Paris. Also that, as a handmaid of the Parisian institution 
—a worthy one, let us hope, — the latter’s steps shall be imitated in 
every way possible; so that, namely, there shall be four faculties in it: 
the first, of sacred theology or divinity; the second, of canon and civil 
law, which, by reason of their similarity, we think best to comprise 
under one faculty; the third, of medicine; the fourth, of liberal arts — 
of the threefold philosophy, namely, primal, natural, and moral, three 
mutually subservient daughters. We wish this institution to be di- 
vided and marked out into four nations, as it is at Paris; and that all 
these faculties shall make one university, and that to it the individual 
students, in whichever of the said faculties they are, shall indivisibly 
belong like lawful sons of one mother. Likewise that that university 
shall be governed by one rector, and that the different masters and 
teachers, before they are admitted to the common pursuits of our insti- 
tution, shall swear to observe the statutes, laws, privileges, liberties

grade they may rise. Also that they will uphold the honour of the 
rector.and the rectorship of our university, and will obey the rector in 
all things lawful and honest, whatever be the grade to which they may 
afterwards happen to be promoted. Moreover that the different 
masters and bachelors shall read theirslectures and exercise their scho- 
lastic functions and go about in caps and gowns of a uniform and simi- 
lar nature, according as that has been observed at Paris up to this time 
in the different faculties. And we will say that if any faculty, nation 
or person shall oppose the aforesaid regulations, or pertinaciously re- 
fuse to obey them or any one of them — which God forbid, — from 
that time forward that same faculty, nation or person, if it do not de- 
sist upon being warned, shall be deprived of all connection with our 
aforesaid institution, and shall not have the benefit of our defence or 
protection. Moreover we will and ordain that as the university as a 
whole may do for those assembled here and subject to it, so each fac- 
ulty, nation or province of it may found lawful statutes and ones suit- 
able to its needs, provided that through them or any one of them no 
prejudice is done to the above regulations and to our institution, and 
that no kind of impediment arise from them. And we will that when 
the separate bodies shall have passed the statutes for their own ob- 
servance, they may make them perpetually binding on those subject 
to them and on their successors. And as in the university of Paris 
the different servants of the institutions have the benefit of the differ- 
ent privileges which its masters and scholars enjoy, so in starting our 
institution in Heidelberg, we grant, with even greater liberality, 
through these presents, that all the servants, viz.: its Pedells, librarians, 
lower officials, preparers of parchment, scribes, illuminators and others 
who serve it, may each and all, without fraud, enjoy in it the same 
privileges, franchises, immunities and liberties with which its masters 
or scholars are now or shall hereafter be endowed. 
6. Lest in the new community of the city of Heidelberg, their faults 
being unpunished, there be an incentive to the scholars of doing wrong, 
we ordain with provident counsel by these presents, that the bishop of 
Worms, as judge ordinary of the clerks of our institution, shall have 
and possess, now and hereafter while our institution shall last, prisons, 
and an office in our town of Heidelberg for the detection of criminal 
clerks. These things we have seen fit to grant to him and his succes- 
sors, adding these conditions: that he shall permit no clerk to be ar- 
rested unless for a misdemeanour; that he shall restore any one detained 
for such fault or for any light offence to his master or to the rector if he 
asks for him, a promise having been given that the culprit will appear 
in court and that the rector or master will answer for him if the injured 
parties should go to law about the matter. Furthermore that, on being 
requested, he will restore a clerk arrested for a crime on slight evidence, 
upon receiving a sufficient pledge — sponsers if the prisoner can obtain
-P-A-G-E-187
   RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 161 
them, otherwise an oath if he can not obtain sponsers — to the effect 
that he will answer in court the charges against him; and in all these 
things there shall be no pecuniary exactions, except that the clerk shall 
give satisfaction, reasonably and according to the rule of the aforemen- 
tioned town, for the expenses which he incurred while in prison. And 
that he will detain honestly and without serious injury a criminal clerk 
thus arrested for a crime where the suspicion is grave and strong, until 
the truth can be found out concerning the deed of which he is suspected. 
And he shall not for any cause, moreover, take away any clerk from our 
aforesaid town, or permit him to be taken away, unless the proper 
observances have been followed, and he has been condemned by judi- 
cial sentence to perpetual imprisonment for a crime. We command our 
advocate and bailiff and their servants in our aforesaid town, under 
pain of losing their office and our favour, not to put a detaining hand on 
any master or scholar of our said institution, nor to arrest him nor 
allow him to be arrested, unless the deed be such a one that that master 
or scholar ought rightly to be detained. He shall be restored to his 
rector or master, if he is held for,a slight cause, provided he will swear 
and promise to appear in court concerning the matter; and we decree 
that a slight fault is one for which a layman, if he had committed it, 
ought to have been condemned to a light pecuniary fine. Likewise, if 
the master or scholar detained be found gravely or strongly suspected 
of the crime, we command that he be handed over by our officials to 
the.bishop or to his representative in our said town, to be kept in 
custody. 
c. By the tenor of these presents we grant to each and all the masters 
and scholars that, when they come to said institution, while they re- 
main there, and also when they return from it to their homes, they may 
freely carry with them both coming and going, throughout all the lands 
subject to us, all their things which they need while pursuing their 
studies, and all the goods necessary for their support, without any duty, 
levy, imposts, tailles, gabelles, or other exactions whatever. And we 
wish them and each one of them, to be free from all the aforesaid im- 
posts when purchasing corn, wines, meat, fish, clothes and all things 
necessary for their living and for their rank. And we decree that the 
scholars from their stock in hand of provisions, if there remain over one 
or two waggonloads of wine without their having practiced deception, 
may after the feast of Easter of that year sell it en gros without paying 
impost. We grant to them, moreover, that each day the scholars, of 
themselves or through their servants, may be allowed to buy in 
the town of Heidelberg, at the accustomed hour, freely.and without 
impediment or hurtful delay, any eatables or other necessaries of 
life. 
d. Lest the masters and scholars of our institution of Heidelberg may 
be oppressed by the citizens, avarice inducing them, through the ex-     
    
-P-A-G-E-188
162 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  tortionate price of lodgings, we have seen fit to decree that henceforth 
each year, after Christmas, one expert from the university-on the part 
of the scholars, and one prudent, pious and circumspect citizen on the 
part of the citizens, shall be deputed to fix on the price for the students’ 
lodgings. -Moreover we will and decree that the different masters and 
scholars shall, through our bailiff, our judge and the officials subject to 
us, be defended and maintained in the quiet possession of the lodgings 
given to them free or of those for which they pay rent. Moreover, by 
the tenor of these presents, we grant to the rector and the university, 
or to those deputed by them, entire and total jurisdiction concerning 
the paying of rents for the lodgings occupied by the students, concern- 
ing the making and buying of codices, and the borrowing of money for 
other purposes by the scholars of our institution; also concerning the 
payment of assessments, together with everything that arises from, 
depends on and is connected with these. 
e. Inaddition we command our officials that, when the rector requires 
their and our aid and agsistance for carrying out his sentences against 
scholars who try to rebel, they shall assist our clients and servants in 
this matter; first, however, obtaining lawful permission to proceed 
against clerks from the lord bishop of Worms, or from one deputed by 
him for his purpose. 
104. Exemption of Masters and Students from Taxation 
(Charter of Philip IV, 1340-41, to the University of Paris; trans. by Norton) 
It became customary to confer many privileges on both masters 
and students of the medieval universities, such as freedom from 
military service, exemption from arrest and deportation for trial, 
the right to be tried by the university authorities instead of the 
civil or ecclesiastical, the right to be confined in the university 
jail in punishment, exemption from taxation, etc. The following 
grant of exemption from taxation is an example of these privileges, 
and is noteworthy for the large exemptions allowed. ? 
To the aforesaid Masters and Scholars [of Paris], now in attendance 
at the University, and to those who are hereafter to come to the same 
University, or who are actually preparing in sincerity so to come, also 
while [they are] staying at the University, or returning to their own 
homes, we grant . . . that no layman, of whatever condition or promi- 
nence he may be, whether he be a private person, prefect, or bailiff, 
shall disturb, molest, or presume otherwise in any way whatsoever to 
seek to extort anything from the aforesaid Masters and Scholars, in 
person, family or property, under pretext of toll, ¢a/lia [special form of 
feudal tax], tax, customs, or other such personal taxes, or other personal 
exaction of any kind, while they are either coming to the University it-

self, or actually preparing in sincerity to come, or returning to their own 
homes; and whose status as scholars shall be established by the proper 
oath. 
105. Privileges granted the University of Vercelli 
(From a document printed in Rashdall, H., The Universities of Europe in the Middle 
Ages, vol. 0, p. 746. Oxford, 1895) 
In 1228 a body of masters and students, dissatisfied with their 
treatment at Padua, migrated to Vercelli, another Italian city. 
In establishing a university there they entered into an elaborate 
contract with the city, which was incorporated into the city 
charter and was to hold for eight years, by which the city, in con- 
sideration of a university being established in Vercelli, agreed, 
among other things, to loan money to students at lower than the 
regular rates, and to see that the markets were properly supplied 
with food without increase in price. The following provisions in 
the contract throw much light on early university practices. 
. .. Likewise the town of Vercelli shall provide salaries (for profes- 
sors) which shall be deemed competent by two scholars and two towns- 
men, and if they disagree the Bishop shall decide the matter .. . and 
said salaries shall be for one Theologian, three Masters of Laws, two 
Decretalists, two teachers of Natural Philosophy, two Logicians, and 
two Grammarians. (These professors shall be chosen by the rectors of 
the university. The town will send out at its own expense) trustworthy 
messengers under oath, who shall in good faith, and in the interests of 
the university of Vercelli, seek out the chosen Masters and Teachers, 
and shall use their best endeavors to bind them to lecture in the city of 
Vercelli. (The town will preserve peace within its borders, will con- 
sider scholars and their messengers neutral in time of war, will grant 
them the rights of citizens, and will respect the legal jurisdiction of the 
rectors, except in criminal and other specially mentioned cases.) 
Likewise, the town of Vercelli will provide two copyists, through 
whom it will undertake to furnish men able to supply to the scholars 
copies in both kinds of Law (Civil and Canon) and in Theology, which 
shall be satisfactory and accurate both in text and in glosses, and the 
students shall pay for their copies (no extortionate prices but) a rate. 
based on the estimate of the rectors (of the university). 
. . . Likewise, the scholars or their representatives shall not pay the 
tributes in the district of Vercelli which belong and accrue to the town 
of Vercelli. ... The Podesta (Chief Magistrate) and the town itself 
shall be bound to send, throughout the cities of Italy and elsewhere 
(as shall seem expedient to them) notice that a university has been es- 
tablished at Vercelli, and to invite scholars to come to the University of 
Vercelli.

106. Cost to a City of maintaining a University 
(Matteo Villani’s Chronicle, book 1, cap. 8; trans. by J. A. Symonds, in his Revival 
of Learning, vol. 11, pp. 119-20. London, 1888) 
This selection gives some estimate as to the commercial im- 
portance of a university to a city. 
The importance attached by great cities to their universities as a 
source of strength, may be gathered from the chapter in Matteo Vil- 
lani’s Chronicle describing the foundation of the studio pubblico in 
Florence. He expressly mentions that the Signory were induced to 
take this step in consequence of the depopulation inflicted by the Black 
Death of 1348. By drawing residents to Florence from other States, 
they hoped to increase the number of the inhabitants, and to restore the 
decayed fame and splendor of the commonwealth. At the same time 
they thought that serious studies might put an end to the demoraliza- 
tion produced in all classes by the plague. With this object in view, 
they engaged the best teachers, and did not hesitate to devote a yearly 
sum of 2500 gold florins to the maintenance of their school. Bologna, 
which owed even more than Florence to its university, is said to have 
lavished as much as half its revenue, about 20,000 ducats,' on the pay of 
professors and other incidental expenses. The actual cost incurred by 
the cities through their schools cannot, however, be accurately esti- 
mated, since it varied from year to year according to the engagements 
made with special teachers. At Pavia, for example, in 1400, the univer- 
sity supported in Canon Law several eminent doctors, in Civil Law 
thirteen, in Medicine five, in Philosophy three, in Astrology one, in 
Greek one, and in Eloquence one. Whether this staff was maintained 
after the lapse of another twenty years we do not know for certain. 
107. Right to suspend Lectures (Cessatio) 
(Bull of Pope Gregory IX for Paris, 1231; trans. by D. C. Munro) 
One of the most effective rights of the mediaeval university was 
the right of cessatio, that is, to suspend lectures and go on a strike 
as a means of enforcing a redress of grievances against either town 
or church authorities. This right was frequently exercised and 
often for trivial offenses, usually bringing the offending party to 
terms rather promptly. The following Papal Bull of 1231, con- 
ferring this right on the University of Paris, is typical of rights 
elsewhere conferred or assumed. This continued in force at 
Paris until 1499, when the last attempt at a cessatio took place. 
1 A ducat was worth approximately $2.30 in terms of our money and the prices of 
a quarter of a century ago.
-P-A-G-E-191
    RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 165 
And if, perchance, the assessment [right to fix the prices] of lodgings 
is taken from you, or anything else is lacking, or an injury or outrageous 
damage, such as death or the mutilation of a limb, is inflicted on one of 
you, unless through a suitable admonition satisfaction is rendered within 
fifteen days, you may suspend your lectures until you have received 
full satisfaction. And if it happens that any one of you is unlawfully 
imprisoned, unless the injury ceases on a remonstrance from you, you 
may, if you judge it expedient, suspend your lectures immediately. 
108. A Cessatio at Oxford (1209) 
(Chron. Roger of Wendover (Rolls Series), 84, 11, p. 51; trans. by Leach) 
This is an early example of the cessatio, and illustrates how 
vigorously the early universities contended with both Church and 
civil authorities for the right of freedom of internal government. 
About the same time a clerk, who was studying the liberal arts at 
Oxford, by accident killed a woman, and when he found she was dead, 
sought safety in flight. But the bailiff of the town and others who 
came up and found the woman dead, began to try to find the murderer 
in his hostel, which he had hired with three other clerks, and not finding 
the criminal, took his three friends, who knew almost nothing about 
the murder, and threw them into prison. A few days afterwards, on 
the orders of the king of the English, in contempt of the liberty of the 
church, they were taken outside the town and hung. On this nearly 
3000 clerks, masters and scholars alike, left Oxford, not a single one of 
the whole University remaining. Some of them went to study the lib- 
eral arts at Cambridge, some to Reading, but the town of Oxford was 
left empty. 
109. England invites Scholars to leave Paris 
(Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1, p. 119; trans. by Norton) 
In 1229 there were serious student riots at Paris, during a car- 
nival, and several persons were wounded. ‘The city authorities 
made reprisals, putting two students to death. For this a ces- 
satio was declared, and the masters and students left the city, 
going to Angers, Orleans, Rheims, and other studia, at the first 
two of which rival universities were established. The bishop 
launched excommunications against the deserters in vain, and 
the university remained closed for two years. As a bid to obtain 
some of the striking masters and students, King Henry III of 
England issued the following urgent invitation. As the result 
of this many came and settled at Cambridge, virtually reviving
-P-A-G-E-192

the institution after a period of quiescence covering fifteen years 
(r214-29). 
The King; Greeting to the Masters and the whole body of scholars 
at Paris. Humbly sympathizing with the exceeding tribulations and 
distresses which you have suffered at Paris under an unjust law, we 
wish by our pious aid, with reverence to God and His holy church, to 
restore your status to its proper condition of liberty. Wherefore we 
have concluded to make known to your entire body that if it shall be 
your pleasure to transfer yourselves to our kingdom of England and to 
remain there to study, we will for this purpose assign to you cities, 
boroughs, towns, whatsoever you may wish to select, and in every 
fitting way will cause you to rejoice in a state of liberty and tranquillity 
which should please God and fully meet your needs.

110. Early Licensing of Professors to teach 
(Bull of Pope Gregory IX, Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1, p. 2373 
trans. by Compayre) 
The universities being an evolution from the cathedral schools, 
the licensing to teach in them naturally came from the bishop, or 
his representative. In the cathedral schools this was the Scholas- 
ticus; in the universities this official evolved into a Chancellor, a 
term still used by a few of our universities instead of the modern 
designation of President. ‘The Chancellor at Paris received the 
following charge, in 1231, in a Bull from Pope Gregory IX. 
Future chancellors shall swear not to receive as professors of theol- 
ogy and canon law any but worthy men, able to do honor to their pre- 
cepts, and they shall reject all who are unworthy, without respect 
either to persons or to nations. Before conferring the license, the chan- 
cellor shall allow three months to elapse, dating from the day the license 
was asked for, and during these three months he shall make inquiries of 
the professors of theology and other serious and instructed persons, in 
order to become acquainted with the life and manners, the knowledge, 
capacity, love of study, perfectibility, and other qualities needful in 
those who aspire to teach; and, these inquiries finished, he shall grant or 
refuse the license according to his conscience. 
111. The Right to grant Licenses to teach 
(Bull of Pope Nicholas IV, 1292; trans. by Norton) 
Masters and Doctors of Paris, Bologna, and Oxford were early 
recognized as qualified to teach anywhere, without further exam-
-P-A-G-E-193

RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 167 
ination. Other universities gradually accepted the custom es- 
tablished at these university mothers. The right to grant such 
license, the jas ubique docendi, came to be regarded as the essence 
of a Studium Generale. The following Papal Bull, of 1292, for-, 
mally grants this right to Paris. 
Desiring, therefore, that the students in the field of knowledge in the 
city of Paris, may be stimulated to strive for the reward of a Master- 
ship, and may be able to instruct, in the Faculties in which they have 
deserved to be adorned with a Master’s chair, all those who come from 
all sides, — we decree, by this present letter, that whoever of our Uni- 
versity in the aforesaid city shall have been examined and approved by 
those through whom, under apostolic authority, the right to lecture is 
customarily bestowed on licentiates in said faculties, according to the 
custom heretofore observed there, — and who shall have from them 
license in the Faculty of Theology, or Canon Law, or Medicine, or the 
Liberal Arts, — shall thenceforward have authority to teach every- 
where outside of the aforesaid city, free from examination or test, 
either public or private, or any other new regulation as to lecturing or 
teaching. Nor shall he be prohibited by any one, all other customs and 
statutes to the contrary notwithstanding; and whether he wishes to 
lecture or not in the Faculties referred to, he shall nevertheless be 
regarded as a Doctor. 
112. A University License to teach 
(Document printed in Rashdall; The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, 
vol. 1, part 1, p. 734. Oxford, 1895) 
The following form, reproduced by Rashdall, is dated 1710, but 
is considered by him as probably similar to the medieval forms 
used. A comparison of this form with a modern Ph.D. diploma 
reveals an interesting similarity between the two. . 
Inasmuch as you have been presented to me for examination in both 
(Civil and Canon) Laws and for the customary approval, by the Most 
Illustrious and the Most Excellent D.D. (naming the Promoters), 
golden Knights, Counts Palatine, Most Celebrated Doctors, and in- 
asmuch as you have since undergone an arduous and rigorous examina- 
tion, in which you bore yourself with so much learning and distinction 
that that body of Most Illustrious and Excellent Promoters without 
one dissenting voice, — I repeat, without one dissenting voice, — have 
judged you worthy of the laurel, therefore by the authority which I 
have as Archdeacon and senior Chancellor, I create, publish, and name 
you, N. N., Doctor in the aforesaid Faculties, giving to you every privi- 
lege of lecturing, of ascending the Master’s chair, of writing glosses, of

interpreting, of acting as Advocate, and of exercising also the functions 
of a Doctor here and everywhere throughout the world; furthermore, of 
enjoying all those privileges which those happy individuals, who have 
been so deserving in these fostering colleges, are accustomed to use and 
enjoy. 
And I trust that all these things will forever result in the increase of 
your fame and the honor of our Colleges, to the praise and glory of 
Almighty God and of the ever blessed Virgin Mary. 
  113. Books required at Paris for the Arts Degree 
(Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1, p. r19) 
The following books were prescribed for the A.B. and A.M. de- 
grees at Paris by the Statutes of 1254. The list does not distin- 
guish the books required for the baccalaureate degree only, but 
gives for both degrees together. It will be noted that books on 
some of the Seven Liberal Arts are missing. 
The great preponderance of Aristotle in the list is noticeable, 
showing how completely Aristotle had been adopted by this time 
as the great authority of medieval Europe. In addition to hav- 
ing heard lectures on these subjects, the candidate must also have 
taken part in a number of disputations.

earlier (R. 113), it will be seen that Aristotle is less prominent, 
that the Seven Liberal Arts are better represented, and that the 
whole shows a much better balanced course. The time require- 
ments for each subject are also given here, showing a course re- 
quiring from twenty-two and one half to twenty-eight and one half 
months for the A.B. degree, and from forty-two to sixty-six and

(Rashdall, H., The Universities of Europe in the Middle A ges, vol. 11, part 11,

The following list of books shows those required for the A.B. 
and the A.M. degrees at Oxford in the period 1408-31. It is a 
more elastic course of study than the one at Paris, and Aristotle 
is less prominent. More alternatives or elections were offered 
the student than at either Paris or Leipzig. A clear attempt is 
seen to keep up the traditions that an Arts course should include 
the Trivium and Quadrivium of the earlier Middle Ages, as well 
as the “three philosophies” introduced by the rediscovery of 
Aristotle early in the thirteenth century. °

116. Requirements for the Professional Degrees at Oxford 
(Rashdall, H., The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, vol. 1, part 11, 
PP- 452-55. Oxford, 1895)

117. The Course in Medicine at Paris 
(Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1, no. 453, p. 517; trans. by Munro) 
The following required course in Medicine at Paris, 1270-74, 
gives the books used, and will prove of special interest to students 
interested in the study of medicine. It also shows the influence 
of Arabic writers on European learning in this subject. It is a 
poorer course of study than that provided at Montpellier, though 
Montpellier probably had the foremost medical faculty in Europe 
at that time. 
This is the form for licensing bachelors of medicine. First, the mas- 
ter under whom the bachelor is, ought to testify to the chancellor, in 
the presence of the masters called together for this purpose, concerning 
the suitability of licensing the bachelor. He ought to prove his time 
of study by at least two examinations; and the time which he ought to 
have studied is five and one half years, if he has ruled in arts or has been 
a licentiate; or six, if he has not. 
The course of study is as follows: 
I. He ought to have heard: 
1. The Ars Medica (probably Liber Tegni, of Galen) twice in 
the regular courses and once in an extraordinary course, 
with the exception of Theophilus. (Theophilus was a 
Byzantine physician, said to have lived in the seventh 
century, A.D.)
-P-A-G-E-201
  RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 175 
. On Urines, which is sufficient to have heard once in either a 
regular or an extraordinary course. 
3. The Viaticum (composed by Abu Djarfar Ahmad, disciple of 
Isaac) twice in regular courses. 
4. The other books of Isaac (a Jewish physician who wrote sev- 
eral books on medicine which were translated from the 
Arabic by Constantine the African) once in a regular 
course, twice in extraordinary courses, except the Particu- 
lar Diets, which it is sufficient to have heard in an extraor- 
dinary or regular course. 
. The Book of Antidotes (Book of Antidotes was then used in 
about the same sense as Book of Mendicaments. This bv n 
one was by Nicholas of Salerno) of Nicholas, once. 
6. The Verses of AXgidius are not required. (A®gidius of Cor- 
beil taught at Paris under Philip Augustus. He wrote his 
works in verse.) 
II. Also, he ought to have read: 
1. The books on Theory and Practice. (By this Denifle thinks 
the Opus Pantegni, by Ali ben Abbas, is meant. This was 
divided into Theory and Practice. It was sometimes at- 
tributed to Constantine the African.) 
And he ought to swear this. Moreover, if any one is convicted of 
perjury or lying he, although licensed, may be degraded. 
118. Roger Bacon on the Teaching of Theology 
(Roger Bacon, Opera Inedita, p. lvi; trans. by J. S. Brewer. London, 1859) 
The following comment by the English monk, Roger Bacon, 
written in 1292, shows how the great medieval textbooks on the- 
ology gradually superseded the study of 
the Bible. This tendency increased with 
time. Luther tells us that he was twenty 
years old when, by accident, he saw a Bible 
for the first time in the library of the Uni- 
versity of Erfurt. 
Although the principal study of the theo- 
logian ought to be in the text of Scripture, as 
I have proved in the former part of this work, 
yet in the last fifty years theologians have been 
principally occupied with questions (for de- 
bate) as all know, in tractates and summez, — 
  Fic. 20. Roger Bacon 
(1214?-94) 
horseloads, composed by many,— and not at all with the most holy text 
of God. And accordingly, theologians give a readier reception to a trea- 
tise of scholastic questions than they will do to one about the text of
-P-A-G-E-202
  176 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Scripture. ... The greater part of these questions introduced into 
theology, with all the modes of disputation and solution, are in the terms 
of philosophy, as is known to all theologians, who have been well exer- 
cised in philosophy before proceeding to theology. Again, other ques- 
tions which are in use among theologians, though in terms of theology, 
viz., of the Trinity, of the fall, of the incarnation, of sin, of virtue, of 
the sacraments, etc., are mainly ventilated by authorities, arguments, 
and solutions drawn from philosophy. And therefore the entire occupa- 
tion of theologians now-a-days is philosophical, both in substance and 
method. 
119. List of Books left by Will to the University of Paris 
(Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. 1, no. 437, P- 493; trans. by Munro) 
The following document, reproducing a clause from a will and 
the list of twenty-seven books contained in the private library of 
Master Stephen, presented to Paris, in 1271, as a loan collection 
for poor and deserving theological students, is interesting as 
showing what a prominent churchman and scholar of that day 
had accumulated. 
To all the officers of the court at Paris who shall read this document, 
greeting in the Lord. We make known that John of Orleans, consti- 
tuted master in our presence, canon and chancellor of Paris, acknowl- 
edges and admits that he has received and had from the venerable man 
master Nicholas, arch-deacon of the church at Paris, formerly chan- 
cellor of the aforesaid church at Paris, the books named below — to 
be lent to the poor students studying theology, — according to a cer- 
tain clause contained in the will of master Stephen of blessed memory, 
formerly arch-deacon of Canterbury, which is inserted in the present 
document, as follows: 
I will and command that my books on theology shall be delivered to 
the chancellor of Paris who, for the sake of piety, shall lend them to 
poor students studying theology at Paris who are without books; in 
such a manner, however, that each chancellor, each year, shall receive 
back the aforesaid books and after receiving them shall deliver and 
lend them, each year, to the poor students, as shall seem expedient. 
The names of the books are as follows: 
1. The Bible complete, with a glossary. 
. Genesis and Exodus, glossed, in one volume. 
. The books of Solomon, glossed, in one volume. 
. Exodus, glossed by itself. 
. Job, glossed by itself. 
. Ezekiel, glossed by itself. 
. The Gospels, glossed by themselves, in one volume. WAnNPRWDHD

12. The four books of Kings, Chronicles, first and second.

Bishop Stephen presented. 
27. The original of the Sentences of master Peter Lombard, in a

We, the above-mentioned official, have thought indeed that, in 
testimony and witness of all the above-mentioned, we ought to place 
on the present writing the seal of the court at Paris, together with the 
seal of the aforesaid chancellor; hoping and asking that his successors, 
who shall be chancellors, shall order and do with the aforesaid books, 
for the sake of the divine piety, according to the contents of the afore- 
said clause.

120. The Scarcity of Books on Morals 
(Roger Bacon; trans. by J. S. Brewer. London, 1859) 
Roger Bacon (1214?-94), writing as to the scarcity of books on 
morals, especially in the works of four classic writers, says: 
The scientific books of Aristotle, of Avicenna, of Seneca, of Cicero, 
and other ancients cannot be had except at a great cost; their principal 
works have not been translated into Latin, and copies of others are 
not to be found in ordinary libraries or elsewhere. The admirable 
books of Cicero De Republica are not to be found anywhere, as far as 
Ican hear, although I have made anxious inquiry for them in different  
-P-A-G-E-204
  178 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
parts of the world and by various messengers. And so of many other 
books of which I send extracts to your beatitude. I could never find 
the works of Seneca, until after the time when I received your com- 
mands, although I made diligent search for them during twenty years 
and more. And so it is with many more most useful books connected 
with the sciences of morals. 
121. Methods of Instruction in the Arts Faculty at Paris 
(Buleus, Historia Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. tv, p. 332; trans. by Norton) 
The following Statute of the Masters of Arts at Paris, enacted 
in 1355, compares the two methods of lecturing, and also throws an 
interesting side-light on university classroom manners of the time. 
Two methods of reading the books of the Liberal Arts have been 
tried: ; 
By the first, the Masters of Philosophy from their chairs rapidly 
set forth their own words, so that the mind of the listener can take 
them in, but his hand is not able to write them down; by the second, 
they pronounce them slowly so that the listeners are able to write them 
down in their presence with the pen. By diligent examination and 
mutual comparison of these ways the first method is found to be the 
better, because the conceptual power of the ordinary mind warns us to 
imitate it in our lectures. Therefore, we, one and all, Masters of Arts, 
both lecturing and not lecturing, being especially convoked for this 
purpose .. . have made a statute to this effect: : 
All lecturers, Masters as well as Scholars, of the same Faculty, when- 
ever and wherever they happen to be reading any book in regular order 
or course in the same Faculty, or to be discussing a’ question accord- 
ing to this or any other method of exposition, shall follow the former 
method of reading to the best of their ability, to wit: presenting it as 
though no one were writing it in their presence. It is in accordance 
with this method that discourses and recommendations are made in 
the University, and it is followed by Lecturers in the rest of the 
Faculties. 
Transgressors of this Statute, whether Masters or Scholars, we de- 
prive thenceforth of their positions as lecturers, or honors, offices, and 
the rest of their means of support under our Faculty, for one year. 
But if any one repeats the offense, we double the penalty for the first 
repetition; for the second we quadruple it, and so on. And auditors 
who interfere with the execution of this our Statute by shouting or 
whistling or raising a din, or by throwing stones, either personally or 
through their attendants or accomplices, or in any other way, we de- 
prive of and cut off from our company for one year, and for each repe- 
tition we increase the penalty to twice and four times the length as 
above.

122. Time-Table of Lectures in the Arts Faculty at the 
University of Toulouse, 1309 
(Constructed from the Latin Statute of that date by Paetow, S. J., in his The Arts 
Course at Medieval Universities. Univ. Ill. Studies, vol. m1, no. 7, p. 96. 1910) 
The time-table given on page 180 was sanctioned in 1309 (the 
University was founded in 1230), to avoid conflicts and disputes 
between masters and students, and is one of the earliest known. 
Norton gives a somewhat similar though less well-arranged time- 
table for the Arts Faculty at Leipzig, under date of 1519 
(R. 123). Both schedules show the great hold of Aristotle. 
The statute does not name the exact hour when lectures began 
in the morning, but it was probably about six o’clock, the usual 
opening hour at most medizval universities. The various periods 
must have been something like an hour and a half long, including 
the intermission between, as period six is stated as beginning at 
three in the afternoon. Period seven had no definite length, 
being all the time left after the close of period six. 
Books used as a basis for the lectures are given in ifalics. Un- 
less otherwise indicated on the schedule, all books are those of 
Aristotle. 
123. Schedule of Lectures, Faculty of Arts, University of Leipzig 
(Compiled by Norton from Zarncke’s Statutenbiicher der Universitat Leipzig. Re- 
produced in his Readings in the History of Education; Medieval Universities, p. 134, 
Cambridge, 1909) 
The earliest orderly arrangement of lectures which Norton dis- 
covered was the one framed for Leipzig, in 1519, which the 
Statutes of that date announce as ‘‘an accurate ‘arrangement of 
the Lectures of the Faculties of Fine Arts, hour by hour, adapted 
to a variety of intellects and to diverse interests.” It is repro- 
duced on page 181. A comparison of this schedule with that of 
the Arts portion of a modern university, or even with the program 
of studies in a normal school, will be interesting.

124. Value and Influence of the Medieval University 
(Rashdall, H., The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, vol. 1, part 0, 
pp. 703-12. Oxford. 1895) 
The standard history of the origin, development, customs, 
practices, work, and influence of the medieval universities is the 
three-volume one by Rashdall. It has been rated as “ the best 
history of the subject in any language.” From the concluding 
chapter of this work the following extracts are taken. 
What was the real value of the education which the medieval uni- 
versity imparted?... 
To the modern student, no doubt, the defects of a medieval educa- 
tion lie upon the’surface. The external defects of the University or- 
ganization have already been incidentally noticed. In the older Uni= 
CES 
  Fic. 21. A LEcTuRE aT A MEDIAVAL UNIVERSITY

versity system of northern Europe there is the want of selection and 
consequent incompetency of the teachers, and the excessive youth of 
the students in Arts. In the higher Faculties too we have encountered 
the constant effort on the part of the Doctors to evade the obligation 
of teaching without surrendering its emoluments, while the real teach- 
ing devolved upon half-trained Bachelors. It is, indeed, in the Stu- 
dent-Universities that the chairs would appear to have been most com- 
petently filled and their duties most efficiently discharged; in medieval 
times students were more anxious to learn than teachers were to teach. 
In the earlier period again there was an utter want of discipline among 
students who ought to have been treated as mere schoolboys. The 
want was partially corrected (in England) by the growth of the College 
system, but the improvement in this respect was balanced by the decay 
and degradation in the higher intellectual life of the Universities. . . . 
There is considerable reason to believe that in the Middle Ages a 
larger proportion than at the present day of the nominal students de- 
rived exceedingly little benefit from their University education. ... In 
the earlier part of our period this must have been peculiarly the case, 
when so little exertion on the part of the’student himself was required. 
A man was allowed year after year to sit through lectures of which he 
might not understand one word; later on this defect was partly reme- 
died by the multiplication of “exercises” in College and Hall. 
For the fairly competent student the main defects of a medieval 
education may be summed up by saying that it was at once too dog- 
matic and too disputatious. Of 
the superstitious adherence to 
Aristotle or other prescribed au- 
thority sufficient illustrations 
have already been given. It is, of 
course, a direct outcome of the 
intellectual vice of the age —a 
vice of which the human mind 
was by no means cured by the 
Renaissance or the Reformation. 
It lasted longest where it was 
most out of place. In the middle 
of the seventeenth century a Doc- 
tor of Medicine was compelled by 
the English College of Physicians 
to retract a proposition which he 
had advanced in opposition to 
the authority of Aristotle, under 
threat of imprisonment. It may 
seem a contradiction to allege 
that this education by authority Fic. 22. A Universrry DispuTaTion

—————— 
184 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
was at the same time too controversial. Yet the readiness with 
which the student was encouraged to dispute the thesis of a prescribed 
opponent, and the readiness with which he would swear to teach 
only the system of a prescribed authority, were but opposite sides 
of the same fundamental defect — the same fatal indifference to facts, 
the facts of external nature, the facts of history, and the facts of life. 
Books were put in the place of things. This is a defect which was 
certainly not removed by the mere substitution of Classics for Phi- 
losophy. . . . 
But, because it is easy enough to pick holes in the education of the 
past, it must not for one moment be supposed that the education either 
of the scholastic or of the ultra-classical period was of little value. 
Up to a certain point — and this is the one consolation to the educa- 
tional historian — the value of education is independent either of the 
intrinsic value or of the practical usefulness of what is taught. . . . It 
was emphatically so in the Middle Ages. Kings and princes found 
their statesmen and men of business in the Universities — most often, 
no doubt, among those trained in the practical science of Law, but not 
invariably so. Talleyrand is said to have asserted that Theologians 
made the best diplomatists.’ It was not the wont-of the practical men 
of the Middle Ages to disparage academic training. The rapid multi- 
plication of Universities during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries 
was largely due to a direct demand for highly educated lawyers and 
administrators. Ina sense the academic discipline of the Middle Ages 
was too practical. It trained pure intellect, encouraged habits of 
laborious subtlety, heroic industry, and intense application, while it - 
left uncultivated the imagination, the taste, the sense of beauty, — in 
a word, all the amenities and refinements of the civilized intellect. It 
taught men to think and to work rather than to enjoy. Most of what 
we understand by “‘culture,’”’ much of what Aristotle understood by 
the ‘‘noble use of leisure,” was unappreciated by the medieval intel- 
lect. On the speculative side the Universities were (as has been said) 
“the school of the modern spirit’”’: they taught men to reason and to 
speculate, to doubt and to inquire, to find a pleasure in the things of 
the intellect both for their own sake and for the sake of their applica- 
tions to life. They dispelled forever the obscurantism of the Dark 
Ages. From a more practical point of view their greatest service to 
mankind was simply this, that they placed the administration of hu- 
man affairs — in short the government of the world — in the hands of 
educated men. The actual rulers— the Kings or the aristocrats — 
might often be as uneducated or more uneducated than modern de- 
mocracies, but they had to rule through the instrumentality of a 
highly educated class. 
In criticizing medieval culture and education, attention is some- 
times too much confined to the Scholastic Philosophy and Theology.

RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 185 
The Scholastic Philosophy and Theology do, indeed, represent the 
highest intellectual development of the period. But they do not rep- 
resent the most widely diffused or the most practically influential of 
medieval studies. Law was the leading Faculty in by far the greater 
number of medieval Universities: for a very large proportion of Univer- 
sity students the study of Arts, in so far as they pursued it at all, took 
the place of a modern school rather than of a modern University. 
From a broad political and social point of view one of the most impor- 
tant results of the Universities was the creation, or at least the enor- 
mously increased power and importance, of the lawyer-class. Great as 
are the evils which society still owes to lawyers, the lawyer-class has 
always been a civilizing agency. Their power represents at least the 
triumph of reason and education over caprice and brute force. Law- 
yers have moderated or regulated despotism even when they have 
proved its most willing tools: just as in modern democratic communi- 
ties their prominence must be looked upon as an important conserva- 
tive check upon democracy. 
Over the greater part of Europe the influence of the Universities 
meant more than this. It brought with it the increasing modification 
of legal and political institutions by the Roman Law, whether directly 
or through the Canon Law, whether by avowed adoption or by gradual 
and unconscious infiltration and imitation. This too was a civilizing 
agency, though here again an increase of civilization had often to be 
bought by a decline of rude, barbaric liberty. . . . 
It is more directly relative to our subject to examine what have 
_ been the effects of the medieval Universities upon our modern educa- 
tional system. The genius of the Middle Age showed itself above all 
in the creation of institutions. The institutions of the Middle Age are 
greater — they may prove more imperishable — even than its Cathe- 
drals. The University is a distinctly medieval institution. By this is 
implied not merely that in the most altered and the most modern of 
the Schools so called there are customs, offices, titles, for the explana- 
tion of which we must go back to the history of the thirteenth century 
with its Guild movement, its Cathedral Schools, and especially its 
great struggle between the Chancellor of Paris and the Society of Mas- 
ters.. The very idea of the institution is essentially medieval, and it is 
curious to observe how largely that idea still dominates our modern 
schemes of education. :

  CHAPTER X 
THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 
THE Readings contained in this chapter illustrate the great Re- 
vival of Learning or Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries. This revival began in Italy, and for a century ab- 
sorbed the energies of a small but very devoted body of scholars, 
inspired by a patriotic ardor for the recovery of their lost intel- 
lectual inheritance, and actuated by a modern spirit of investiga- 
tion and criticism. In that century they ransacked Europe for 
lost books, brought to light the old monastic treasures, recon- 
structed and edited them, and, in the process, reconstructed 
Roman life and literature and history. In searching for, copying, 
comparing, questioning, inferring, criticizing, and editing, they 
awakened that modern scientific spirit which, applied later to 
problems of religion, nature, and government, has been produc- 
tive of such great results. In awakening this modern scientific 
spirit, in developing an historical appreciation, and in creating a 
craving for truth for its own sake, they ushered in the modern, 
as contrasted with the medizeval, age. 
The first selection (125), a letter of Petrarch to a friend, re- 
turning a volume of Cicero he had borrowed to copy, breathes a 
spirit of literary appreciation new in the ancient world. The 
second (126), recording Boccaccio’s visit to the famous monastery 
at Monte Cassino and his finding its great library in ruins, also 
reveals the new feeling for the ancient learning. Even more is 
this shown in the letter of Poggio Bracciolini to his friend in Italy 
(127 a), describing his visit to the monastery at Saint Gall, in 
Switzerland, and his finding there a copy of the long-lost Quin- 
tilian’s Institutes of Oratory. His friend’s reply (127 b) is equally 
interesting as breathing the same new spirit. The difficulties 
involved in restoring and copying these old manuscripts, before 
the days of printing, may be inferred from the page from one of 
the copied manuscripts, reproduced as selection 128. 
After the pioneers had done their work, and the revival of an- 
cient learning, both Greek and Latin, was well under way all over 
central and northern Italy, a number of societies, usually called
-P-A-G-E-213
THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 187 
Academies, were formed in different Italian cities, much as socie- 
ties might be formed to-day to study or exploit any new subject 
of study. The brief description of these by Symonds (129) gives 
a good idea as to their nature and work. 
This new learning awakened deep patriotic feeling in Italy, 
and was tremendously aided by the wealthy men then ruling the 
northern Italian cities. They not only aided the scholars finan- 
cially, but in particular they built up many for-the-time large col- 
lections of books. Vespasiano, a famous ‘book-collector of Flor- 
ence, seems to have been called upon to assist in most of these 
undertakings, and in his Lives of Illustrious Men of the Fifteenth 
Century he has left us a number of very interesting pen-pictures 
of these men and of his part in the work they carried through. 
Three selections from this volume are reproduced here, describing 
the collecting and copying done for the Medicean Library at 
Florence (130), the library for Duke Frederic of Urbino (131), and 
the beginnings of the famous Vatican Library at Rome (132). 
These selections not only describe the methods of book-collect- 
ing before the days of printing, but also give a good idea as 
to the nature and number of the books which the libraries con- 
tained. 
Of the two remaining selections of this chapter, from Green’s 
celebrated history, the first (133) describes the introduction of 
the new learning at Oxford and the religious effects produced 
there by it; and the second (134) reveals the rapidly developing 
taste for books which came as a result of the revival, and shows 
_how this led naturally to the invention of printing. 
125. Petrarch on copying a Work of Cicero’s 
(From one of his letters. Robinson and Rolfe, Petrarch, p. 275. Putnams, New York, 
1898; reproduced by permission) 
The following letter of Petrarch, returning a copy of Cicero 
after he had copied it, clearly reveals his great passion for the 
classical "authors, and especially for the master stylist, Cicero. 
Petrarch was of Florentine parentage, but the family was in 
exile, and he was born at Arezzo, in 1304. The family removed 
to Avignon, in southern France, when Petrarch was nine years 
old. He studied law at the universities of Montpellier and Bo- 
logna. In 1341 he was crowned poet laureate at Rome. He 
traveled extensively, and died in 1374, near Padua.

  188 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Your copy of Cicero has been in my possession four years and more. 
There is good reason, though, for so long a delay; namely, the great 
scarcity of copyists who understand such work. It is a state of affairs 
that has resulted in an incredible loss of scholarship. Books that by 
their nature are a little hard to understand are no longer multiplied, 
and have ceased to be generally intelligible, 
and so have sunk into utter neglect, and in 
the end have perished. This age cf ours 
consequently has let fall, bit by bit, some of 
the richest and sweetest fruits that the tree 
of knowledge has yielded; has thrown away 
the results of the vigils and labors of the 
most illustrious men of genius, — things of 
more value, I am almost tempted to say, 
than anything else in the whole world. ... 
But I must return to your Cicero. I could 
not do without it, and the incompetence of 
the copyists would not let me possess it. 
What was left for me but to rely upon my 
own resources, and press these weary fingers 
and this worn and ragged pen into the service? The plan that I fol- 
lowed was this: I want you to know it, in case you should ever have 
to grapple with a similar task. Not a single word did I read except 
as I wrote. But how is that, I hear some one say; did you write with- 
out knowing what it was that you were writing? Ah! but from the 
very first it was enough for me to know that it was a work of Tullius, 
and an extremely rare one too. And then as soon as I was fairly 
started, I found at every step so much sweetness and charm, and felt 
so strong a desire to advance, that the only difficulty which I experi- 
enced in reading and writing at the same time came from the fact that 
my pen could not cover the ground so rapidly as I wanted it to, whereas 
my expectation had been rather that it would outstrip my eyes, and that 
my ardor for writing would be chilled by the slowness of my reading. 
So the pen held back the eye, and the eye drove on the pen, and I 
covered page after page, delighting in my task, and committing many 
and many a Passage to memory as I wrote. For just in proportion as 
the writing is slower than the reading does the passage make a deep 
impression and cling to the mind.

Benvenuto, a pupil of Boccaccio, has here left us a melan- 
choly picture of the library of this great Benedictine monastery,
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 189 
which had evidently fallen into decay at the time of Boccaccio’s 
visit. 
He said that when he was in Apulia, attracted by the celebrity of 
the convent, he paid a visit to Monte Cassino, whereof Dante speaks. 
Desirous of seeing the collection of books, which he understood to be 
a very choice one, he modestly asked a monk — for he was always most 
courteous in manners — to open the library, as a favor, forhim. The 
monk answered stiffly, pointing to a steep staircase, “Go up; it is 
open.” Boccaccio went up gladly; but he found that the place which 
held so great a treasure, was without a door or key. He entered, and 
saw grass sprouting on the windows, and all the books and benches 
thick with dust. In his astonishment he began to open and turn the 
leaves of first one tome and then another, and 
found many and divers volumes of ancient and 
foreign works. Some of them had lost several 
sheets; others were snipped and pared all 
round the text and mutilated in various ways. 
At length, lamenting that the toil and study 
of so many illustrious men should have passed 
into the hands of most abandoned wretches, 
he departed with tears and sighs. Coming 
to the cloister, he asked a monk whom he met, 
why those valuable books had been so dis- 
gracefully mangled. He answered that the 
monks, seeking to gain a few soldi, were in the 
habit of cutting off sheets and making psalters,  Fyc. 24. Boccaccio 
which they sold to boys. The margins too (1313-75) 
they manufactured into charms, and sold to 
women. So then, O man of study, go to and rack your brains; make 
books that you may come to this!   
  127. The Finding of Quintilian’s Institutes of Oratory at Saint Gall 
(Letter of Poggio Bracciolini to a friend, and his reply; trans. by Symonds, J. A., 
in his Renaissance in Italy, vol. 11, pp. 135-37. London, 1888) 
The famous Council of Constance met at Constance, Switzer- 
land, from 1414 to 1418, in an attempt to settle a controversy 
over the Papacy and to secure a reformation in church govern- 
ment. It succeeded in the first, but not in the second. 
One of the delegates to the Council was Manual Chrysoloras, 
the first Greek teacher in the West, who died and was buried at 
Constance, in 1415. Another of those in attendance was Poggio 
Bracciolini (1380-1459), a pupil of Chrysoloras and a devoted 
Renaissance scholar. He was then Apostolic Secretary, attending
-P-A-G-E-216
  190 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the Council by virtue of his office. During the intervals of the | 
Council, Poggio searched the neighboring monasteries of Switzer- 
land and southern Germany for lost books. The following selec- 
tion from one of his letters describes his visit (1416) to the famous 
Swiss monastery of Saint Gall, and his finding the Quintilian 
manuscript and other treasures there. 
(a) Letter of Poggio Bracciolini 
I verily believe that, if we had not come to the rescue, he [Quintilian] 
must speedily have perished; for it cannot be imagined that a man 
magnificent, polished, elegant, urbane, and witty could much longer 
have endured the squalor of the prison-house in which I found him, the 
savagery of his jailers, the forlorn filth of the place. He was indeed 
right sad to look upon, and ragged, like a condemned criminal, with 
rough beard and matted hair, protesting by his countenance and garb 
against the injustice of his sentence. He seemed to be stretching out 
his hands, calling upon the Romans, demanding to be saved from so 
unmerited a doom. Hard indeed it was for him to bear, that he who 
had preserved the lives of many by his eloquence and aid, should now 
find no redresser of his wrongs, no saviour from the unjust punishment 
awaiting him. But as it often happens, to quote Terence, that what 
you dare not wish for comes to you by chance, so a good fortune for 
him, but far more for ourselves, led us, while wasting our time in idle- 
ness at Constance, to take a fancy for visiting the place where he was 
held in prison. The Monastery of Saint Gallen lies at the distance of 
some twenty miles from that city. Thither, then, partly for the sake 
of amusement and partly of finding books, whereof we heard there 
was a large collection in the convent, we directed our steps. In the 
middle of a well-stocked library, too large to catalogue at present, we 
discovered Quintilian, safe as yet and sound, though covered with dust 
and filthy with neglect and age. The books, you must know, were 
not housed according to their worth, but were lying in a most foul and 
obscure dungeon at the very bottom of a tower, a place into which 
condemned criminals would hardly have been thrust; and I am firmly 
persuaded that if any one would but explore those ergastula of the bar- 
barians wherein they incarcerate such men, we should meet with like 
good fortune in the case of many whose funeral orations have long ago 
been pronounced. Besides Quintilian, we exhumed the three first 
books, and a half of the fourth book of the Argonautica of (Valerius) 
Flaccus, and the Commentaries of Asconius Pedianus upon eight ora- 
tions of Cicero. 
When the manuscript was being copied, his friend, Lionardo 
Bruni, wrote to him as follows:
-P-A-G-E-217
THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 191 
  (b) Reply of Lionardo Bruni 
The republic of letters has reason to rejoice not only in the works 
you have discovered, but also in those you have still to find. What a 
glory for you it is to have brought to light by your exertions the writ- 
ings of the most distinguished authors! Posterity will not forget that 
manuscripts which were bewailed as lost beyond the possibility of res- 
toration, have been recovered, thanks to you. As Camillus was called 
the second founder of Rome, so may you receive the title of the second 
author of the works you have restored to the world. Through you 
we now possess Quintilian entire; before we only boasted the half of 
him, and that defective and corrupt in text. O precious acquisition! 
O unexpected joy! And shall I, then, in truth be able to-read the 
whole of that Quintilian which, mutilated and deformed as it ‘has 
hitherto appeared, has formed my solace? I conjure you send it me 
at once, that at least I may set eyes on it before I die. 
‘These two letters reveal something of the spirit and emotions 
of those engaged in the revival and reconstruction of Latin liter- 
ature and history. 
128. Reproducing Books before the Days of Printing 
(Sandys, J. E., History of Classical Scholarship, vol. 1, p. 24. Cambridge, 1903) 
Among the volumes found at Saint Gall, and copied by the en- 
thusiasts for the recovery of the ancient manuscripts, was a copy 
of the Argonautica of the Roman writer, Valerius Flaccus, who 
died about 90 A.D. The last page and signature of his manuscript 
(see p. 192) illustrates well the slow method of reproducing books 
before the days of printing. 
129. Italian Societies for studying the Classics 
(Symonds, J. A., The Renaissance in Italy, vol. u, pp. 359-61. London, 1888) 
In the fifteenth century there was founded, in almost every 
important Italian city, one or more Academies to promote the 
new learning. Those at Venice, Florence, Rome, and Naples 
were the most famous. They took their name from the Academy 
of Plato, at Athens. The one at Florence was called the Platonic 
Academy of Florence. The following description of the Academy 
at Rome, founded in 1425 by an Italian who assumed the old 
Roman name of Pomponius Letus, shows the effect of the revival 
- of classical studies on its devotees. In 1500 a ‘“‘New Academy of 
Hellenists” was founded at Venice, after the same plan, the mem-

Last page, colophon, and signature of Valerius Flaccus’ Argonautica, copied at Saint 
Gall, in 1416, by the Florentine Poggio, a pupil of the Greek teacher, Chrysoloras   
bers assuming Greek names, the meetings being conducted in 
Greek, and one of the purposes being to edit some Greek author 
every month. 
Under these Popes [unfriendly to the new learning] humanism had 
to flourish, as it best could, in the society of private individuals. Ac- 
cordingly, we find the Roman scholars forming among themselves 
academies and learned circles. Of these the most eminent took its 
name from its founder, Julius Pomponius Letus. .. . Pomponius de- 
rived his scholarship from Valla, and devoted all his energies to Latin 
literature, refusing, it is even said, to learn Greek, lest it should dis- 
tract him from his favorite studies. He made it the object of his most 
serious endeavors not only to restore a knowledge of the ancients, but 
also to assimilate his life and manners to their standard. Men praised 
in him a second Cato for sobriety of conduct, frugal diet, and rural 
industry. He tilled his own ground after the methods of Varro and 
Columella, went a-fishing and a-fowling on holidays, and ate his spar- 
ing meal like a Roman Stoic under the spreading branches of an oak 
on the Campagna. The grand mansions of the prelates had no at- 
tractions for him. He preferred his own modest house upon the Es- 
quiline, his garden on the Quirinal. It was here that his favorite 
scholars conversed with him at leisure; and to these retreats of the 
philosopher came strangers of importance, eager to behold a Roman
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 193 
living in all points like an antique sage. The high school (university) 
owed much to his indefatigable industry. Through a long series of 
years he lectured upon the chief Latin authors, examining their text 
with critical accuracy, and preparing new editions of their works. Be- 
fore daybreak he would light his lantern, take his staff, and wend his 
way from the Esquiline to the lecture-room, where, however early the 
hour and however inclement the season, he was sure to find an over- 
flowing audience. Yet it was not as a professor that Pomponius 
Letus acquired his great celebrity, and left a lasting impress on the 
society of Rome. This he did by forming an academy for the avowed 
purpose of prosecuting the study of Latin antiquities and promoting 
the adoption of antique customs into modern life. The members as- 
sumed classical names, exchanging their Italian patronymics for fancy 
titles like: Callimachus Experiens, Asclepiades, Glaucus, Volscus, and 
Petrejus. They yearly kept the birthday feast of Rome, celebrating 
the Palilia with Pagan solemnities, playing comedies of Plautus, and 
striving to revive the humors of the old Atellan farces. 
130. Founding of the Medicean Library at Florence 
(Vespasiano, Lives of Illustrious Men of the Fifteenth Century; from the Life of Cosimo 
de’ Medici; trans. by Whitcomb, in his Literary Source Book of the Italian Renais- 
sance, p. 77. Univ. Pa., 1898; by permission) 
Vespasiano was a book-collector of Florence, which during his 
day was the leading literary and artistic center of the western 
world. In his Lives of Illustrious Men of the Fifteenth Century he 
has left us good pictures of men and events of his time. He died 
in 1498. The following selection from his book describes the 
founding of one of the great Italian libraries, that of Cosimo de’ 
Medici (1389-1446), and illustrates the difficulty of book-collect- 
ing before the days of printing. A picture of one of the stalls in 
this library is to be found in the accompanying Text Book (Fig. 
7% 1D: 252) = 
When he had finished the residence and a good part of the church, 
he fell to thinking how he should have the place peopled with honest 
men of letters; and in this way it occurred to him to found a fine li- 
brary; and one day when I happened to be present in his chamber, he 
said to me: “In what way would you furnish this library?” I replied 
that as for buying the books it would be impossible, for they were not 
to be had. Then he said: “How is it possible then to furnish it?” I 
told him that it would be necessary to have the books copied. He 
asked in reply if I would be willing to undertake the task. I answered 
him, that I was willing. He told me to commence my work and he 
would leave everything to me; and as for the money that would be
-P-A-G-E-220
  194 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
necessary he would refer the matter to Don Archangel, then prior of 
the monastery, who would draw bills upon the bank, which should be 
paid. The library was commenced at once, for it was his pleasure that 
it should be done with the utmost possible celerity; and as I did not 
lack for money I collected in a short time forty-five writers, and fin- 
ished 200 volumes in twenty-two months; in which work we made use 
of an excellent arrangement, that of the library of Pope Nicholas, which 
he had given to Cosimo, in the form of a catalogue made out with his - 
own hands... . 
And since there were not copies of all these works in Florence, we 
sent to Milan, to Bologna and to other places, wherever they might be 
found. Cosimo lived to see the library wholly completed, and the 
cataloguing and arranging of the books; in all of which he took great 
pleasure, and the work went forward, as was his custom, with great 
promptness. 
131. Founding of the Ducal Library at Urbino 
(Vespasiano, Lives of Illustrious Men of the Fifteenth Century; from the Life of 
Frederic of Urbino, trans. by Whitcomb, in his Literary Source Book of the Italian 
Renaissance, pp. 73-77. Univ. of Pa., 1898; by permission) 
Another selection from the Florentine bookseller, Vespasiano 
(d. 1498). This description of the founding of the ducal library 
at Urbino, and of the books obtained for it, shows the scope, the 
time, and the cost required for making one of the largest book 
collections of the time. 
XXVIII. Coming to the holy doctors, who are in Latin, he wished 
to have all the books of the four doctors; and what letters! what books! 
and how excellent! having no regard for expense. The four doctors 
having been finished, he then desired all the works of Saint Bernard, 
and all the holy doctors of antiquity; he desired that none should be 
wanting: Tertullian, Hilary, Remi, Hugh of Saint Victor, Isidore, An- 
selm, Rabanus Maurus, and all the holy doctors of antiquity that have 
ever written. Coming from the Latins to the sacred writings of the 
writers, which are converted into Latin, he desired in Latin the works 
of Dionysius the Areopagite, of Saint Basil, Cyril, Gregory of Nyssa, 
Eusebius, all his works, Ephraem the Monk, the most excellent writer 
Origen. Coming to the Latin doctors, as well in philosophy as in the- 
ology, all the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas, all the works of Albertus 
Magnus, all the works of Alexander of Hales, all the works of Scotus, 
all the works of Bonaventura, the works of Richard of Mediavilla; all 
the works of the Archbishop Antoninus, and all the modern doctors 
who are of authority, he wished to have, down to the Conformities of 
Saint Francis; all the works upon civil law, most beautiful texts; all 
the lectures of Bartolo, in kid-skin, and many writers in civillaw. The
-P-A-G-E-221

Bible, most excellent book, he had done in two pictured volumes, as 
rich and fine as might be made, covered with gold brocade, enriched 
with silver; and he had this done so elegantly, as the first of all writ- 
ings. And all the commentaries, those of the Master of the Sentences, 
of Nicholas de Lyra, and all the doctors of antiquity who have written 
commentaries, as well the Latins as the Greeks, and all the glossary of 
Nicholas de Lyra; this is a book like to which in this age no other has 
been made. All the writers of astronomy and their commentaries; all 
the works on geometry with commentaries; all the works on arithmetic; 
all the works on architecture, all the works De re militari, all books 
treating of the machines of the ancients for conquering a country, and 
those of the moderns, which was a very remarkable volume. Books of 
painting, of sculpture, of music, of canon law, and all the texts and 
lectures and the Summa of the bishop of Ostia, and more works in this 
department. Speculum innocentie. In medicine all the works of 
Avicenna, all the works of Hippocrates, of Galen, the Continente of 
Almansor plus quam commentum, all the works of Averroés, both on 
logic and on natural and moral philosophy. A book of all the ancient 
councils; all the works of Boetius, as well on logic as on philosophy and 
on music.

Pope Pius. He has all the works of Petrarch, both Latin and vulgar; 
all the works of Dante, Latin and vulgar; all the works of Boccaccio in 
Latin; all the works of Messer Coluccio; all the works of Messer Lio- 
nardo d’Arezzo, both original and translations; all the works of Brother

XXX. Having acquired all the books of every department which 
were to be found, written both by ancient and modern doctors, and 
translations as well in every branch, he desired to have-all the Greek 
books that were to be found; all the works of Aristotle in Greek; all 
the works of Plato, each volume bound in the finest kid-skin; all the 
works of Homer in one volume, the //iad, the Odyssey and the Batra- 
comiomachia; all the works of Sophocles; all the works of Pindar; all 
the works of Menander; and as well all the poets that were to be found 
in the Greek tongue; all the Lives of Plutarch, in one most excellent 
volume; the Cosmography of Ptolemy, with illustrations, in Greek, a 
most excellent book; all the moral works of Plutarch, a most worthy 
book; all the works of Herodotus, of Pausanias, of Thucydides, of 
Polybius; all the works of Demosthenes and of Aischines; Plotinus the 
philosopher, all his works; all the commentaries that are found among 
the Greeks, as for example the commentaries upon Aristotle; all the 
works of Theophrastus, the Physica de plantis; all the Greek lexicog- 
raphers, the Greek with the Latin explanation; all the works of Hip- 
pocrates and of Galen; all the works of Xenophon; part of the Bible in 
Greek; all the works of Saint Basil; all the works of Saint John Chrys- 
ostom; all the works of Saint Athanasius, of Saint John of Damascus; 
all the works of Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, of Gregory of Nyssa, of 
Origen, of Dionysius the Areopagite, of John Climacus, of Saint 
Ephraem the Monk, of Aineas the Sophist; the Collations of John 
Cassianus, the Book of Paradise, Vite sanctorum patrum ex gypto; 
the Lives of Barlaam and Jesaphat; a Psalter in three tongues, a won- 
derful thing, in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, verse for verse, a most ex- 
cellent book; all the books on geometry, on arithmetic, and on astron- 
omy that are found in any language. There are numerous Greek 
books, by various authors, which when he was not able to get them 
otherwise, he sent for them, desiring that nothing should be wanting 
in any tongue which it was possible to acquire. There were to be 
seen Hebrew books, all that could be found in that language, beginning 
with the Bible, and all those who have commented upon it, Rabbi 
Moses, and other commentators. Not only are these Hebrew books 
the Holy Scriptures, but also on medicine, on philosophy and in all 
branches, all that could be acquired in that tongue. 
XXXI. His Lordship having completed this worthy task at the 
great expense of more than 30,000 ducats, among the other excellent 
and praiseworthy arrangements which he made was this, that he un- 
dertook to give to each writer a title, and this he desired should be 
covered with crimson embellished with silver. He began, as has been 
noted above, with the Bible, as the foremost of all, and had it covered,   
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 197 
as was said, with gold brocade. Then beginning with all the doctors 
of the Church, he had each one covered with crimson and embellished 
with silver; and so with the Greek doctors as well as with the Latins. 
As well philosophy, history, and books on medicine and all the modern 
doctors; in such a manner that there are innumerable volumes of this 
kind, a thing gorgeous to behold. In this-library all the books are 
beautiful in the highest degree, all written with the pen, not one 
printed, that it might not be disgraced thereby; all elegantly illumi- 
nated, and there is not one that is not written on kid-skin. There is 
a singular thing about this library, which is not true of any other; and 
this is, that of all the writers, sacred as well as profane, original works 
as well as translations, not a single page is wanting from their works, 
in so far as they are in themselves complete; which cannot be said of 
any other library, all of which have portions of the work of a writer, 
but not all; and it is a great distinction to possess such perfection. 
Some time before I went to Ferrara, being at Urbino at his Lordship’s 
court, and having catalogues of all the libraries of Italy, commencing 
with that of the pope, of Saint Mark at Florence, of Pavia — and I 
had even sent to England to obtain a catalogue of the library of the 
university of Oxford, — I compared these with that of the duke, and 
I saw that all were faulty in one particular; that they had numerous 
copies of the same work, but they had not all the works of one writer 
complete as this had; nor were there writers of every branch as in 
this. 
132. Founding of the Vatican Library at Rome 
(Vespasiano, Lives of Illustrious Men of the Fifteenth Century; selected from the Life 
of Nicholas V; trans. by Whitcomb, in his Literary Source Book of the Italian 
Renaissance, pp. 70-73. Univ. Pa., 1898; by permission) 
Another selection from Vespasiano describing the beginnings of 
the famous Vatican_Library at Rome, by Pope Nicholas _V, in 
1450,, It also not only illustrates well the difficulties of book- 
collecting before the days of printing, but the enormous work 
done and cost required in making available old and important 
books. 
Owing to the jubilee of 1450 a great quantity of money came in by 
this means to the apostolic see, and with this the pope commenced 
building in many places, and sent for Greek and Latin books, wherever 
he was able to find them, without regard to price. He gathered to- 
gether a large band of writers, the best that he could find, and kept 
them in constant employment. He also summoned a number of 
learned men, both for the purpose of composing new works and of 
translating such existing works as were not already translated, giving 
them most abundant provision for their needs meanwhile; and when  
-P-A-G-E-224
  198 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the works were translated and brought to him, he gave them large 
sums of money, in order that they should do more willingly that which 
they undertook to do. 
He made great provision for the needs of learned men. He gathered 
together great numbers of books upon every subject, both Greek and 
Latin, to the number of five thousand volumes. So at his death it was 
found by inventory that never since the time of Ptolemy had half that 
number of books of every kind been brought together. All books 
he caused to be copied, without regard to what it cost him, and 
there were few places where his Holiness had not copiers at work. 
When he could not procure a book for himself in any way, he had it 
copied. 
After he had assembled at Rome, as I said above, many learned men 
at large salaries, he wrote to Florence to Messer Giannozzo Manetti, 
that he should come to Rome to translate and compose for him. And 
when Manetti left Florence and came to Rome, the pope, as was his 
custom, received him with honor, and assigned to him, in addition to 
his income as secretary, six hundred ducats, urging him to attempt 
the translation of the books of the Bible and of Aristotle, and to com- 
plete the book already commenced by him, Contra Jud@os et gentes; a 
wonderful book, if it had been completed, but he carried it only to the 
tenth book. ‘ Moreover he translated the New Testament, and the 
Psalter, ... with five apologetical books in defense of this Psalter, 
showing that in the Holy Scriptures there is not one syllable that does 
not contain the greatest of mysteries. 
Tt was Pope Nicholas’ intention to found a library in Saint Peter’s, 
for the general use of the whole Roman curia, which would have been an 
admirable thing indeed, if he had been able to carry it out, but death 
prevented his bringing it to completion. He illumined the Holy 
Scriptures through innumerable books, which he caused to be trans- 
lated; and in the same way with the works of the pagans, including 
certain works upon grammar, of use in learning Latin, — the Orthog- 
raphy of Messer Giovanni Tortelle, who was of his Holiness’ household 
and worked upon the library, a worthy book and useful to gram- 
marians; the Iliad of Homer; Strabo’s De situ orbis he caused to be 
translated by Guerrino, and gave him five hundred florins for each 
part, — that is to say, Asia, Africa, and Europe; that was in all fifteen 
hundred florins. Herodotus and Thucydides he had translated by 
Lorenzo Valla, and rewarded him liberally for his trouble; Xenophon 
and Diodorus, by Messer Poggio; Polybius, by Nicolo Perotto, whom, 
when he handed it to him, he gave five hundred brand-new papal 
ducats in a purse, and said to him that it was not what he deserved, 
but that in time he would take care to satisfy him.

133. The New Learning at Oxford 
(Green, J. R., Short History of the English People, pp. 303-05. London, 1888) 
The following selection gives a good picture of the effect of the 
introduction of the New Learning into England, and particularly 
the thorough-going character of the religious reform produced by 
the revival of the ancient learning in such men as Colet, Erasmus, 
and More. 
... The capture of Constantinople by the Turks, and the flight of 
its Greek scholars to the shores of Italy, opened anew the science and 
literature of the older world at the very hour when the intellectual 
energy of the Middle Ages had sunk into exhaustion. The exiled 
Greek scholars were welcomed in Italy, and Florence, so long the home 
of freedom and of art, became the home of an intellectual revival. The 
poetry of Homer, the drama of Sophocles, the philosophy of Aristotle 
and of Plato woke again to life beneath the shadow of the mighty 
dome with which Brunelleschi had just crowned the City by the Arno. 
All the restless energy which Florence had so long thrown into the 
cause of liberty she flung, now that her liberty was reft from her, into 
the cause of letters. The galleys of her merchants brought back man- 
uscripts from the East as the most precious portion of their freight. 
In the palaces of her nobles fragments of classic sculpture ranged 
themselves beneath the frescoes of Ghirlandajo. The recovery of a 
treatise of Cicero’s or a tract of Sallust’s from the dust of a monastic 
library was welcomed by a group of statesmen and artists who gathered 
in the Rucellai gardens with a thrill of enthusiasm. Foreign scholars 
soon flocked over the Alps to learn Greek, the key of the new knowl- 
edge, from the Florentine teachers. Grocyn, a fellow of New College, 
was perhaps the first Englishman who studied under the Greek exile, 
Chalcondyles; and the Greek lectures which he delivered in Oxford 
on his return mark the opening of a new period in our history. Physi- 
cal as well as literary activity awoke with the re-discovery of the teach- 
ers of Greece, and the continuous progress of English science may be 
dated from the day when Linacre, another Oxford student, returned 
from the lectures of the Florentine Politian to revive the older tradition 
- of medicine by his translation of Galen. 
But from the first it was manifest that the revival of letters would 
take a tone in England very different from the tone it had taken in 
Italy, a tone less literary, less largely human, but more moral, more 
religious, more practical in its bearings both upon society and politics. 
The awakening of a rational Christianity, whether in England or in 
the Teutonic world at large, began with the Italian studies of John 
Colet; and the vigour and earnestness of Colet were the best proof of 
the strength with which the new movement was to affect English
-P-A-G-E-226
  200 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
religion. He came back to Oxford utterly untouched by the.Platonic 
mysticism or the semi-serious infidelity which characterized the group 
of scholars round Lorenzo the Magnificent. He was hardly more in- 
fluenced by their literary enthusiasm. The knowledge of Greek seems 
to have had one almost exclusive end for him, and this was a religious 
end. Greek was the key by which he could unlock the Gospels and 
the New Testament, and in these he thought he could find a new reli- 
gious standing-ground. It was this resolve of Colet to fling aside the 
traditional dogmas of his day and to discover a rational and practical 
religion in the Gospels themselves, which gave its peculiar stamp to 
the theology of the Renascence. «His faith stood simply on a vivid 
realization of the person of Christ. In the prominence which such a 
view gave to the moral life, in his free criticism of the earlier Scriptures, 
in his tendency to simple forms of doctrine and confessions of faith, 
Colet struck the key-note of a mode of religious thought as strongly 
in contrast with that of the later Reformation as with that of Catholi- 
cism itself. The allegérical and mystical theology on which the Middle 
Ages had spent their intellectual vigour to such little purpose fell at 
one blow before his rejection of all but the historical and grammatical 
sense of the Biblical text. The great fabric of belief built up by the 
medieval doctors seemed to him simply “the corruptions of the 
Schoolmen.” In the life and sayings of its Founder he found a simple 
and rational Christianity, whose fittest expression was the Apostle’s 
creed. ‘About the rest,” he said with characteristic impatience, “let 
divines dispute as they will.” Of his attitude toward the coarser 
aspects of the current religion his behaviour at a later time before the 
famous shrine of Saint Thomas at Canterbury gives us a rough indica- 
tion. As the blaze of its jewels, its costly sculptures, its elaborate 
metal-work burst on Colet’s view, he suggested with bitter irony that 
a saint so lavish to the poor in his lifetime would certainly prefer that 
they should possess the wealth heaped round him since his death. 
With petulant disgust he rejected the rags of the martyr which were 
offered for his adoration, and the shoe which was offered for his kiss. 
The earnestness, the religious zeal, the very impatience and want of 
sympathy with the past which we see in every word and act of the man, 
burst out in the lectures on Saint Paul’s Epistles which he delivered at 
Oxford. Even to the most critical among his hearers he seemed “like 
one inspired, raised in voice, eye, his whole countenance and mien, out 
of himself.” Severe as was the outer life of the new teacher, a severity 
marked by his plain black robe and the frugal table which he preserved 
amidst his later dignities, his lively conversation, his frank simplicity, 
the purity and nobleness of his life, even the keen outbursts of his 
troublesome temper, endeared him to a group of scholars among whom 
Erasmus and Thomas More stood in the foremost rank.

  THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 201 
134. The New Taste for Books 
(Green, J. R., Short History of the English People, pp. 294-95. London, 1888) 
The following interesting selection pictures the decay of the 
mediaeval learning, the rising curiosity for secular knowledge, the 
increased use of books, and finally the invention of the great art 
of printing. 
... The literature of the Middle Ages was dying out with the Mid- 
dle Ages themselves; in letters as in life their thirst for knowledge had 
spent itself in the barren mazes of the scholastic philosophy, their ideal 
of warlike nobleness faded away before the gaudy travestie of a spuri- 
ous chivalry, and the mystic enthusiasm of their devotion shrank at 
the touch of persecution into a narrow orthodoxy and a flat morality. 
The clergy, who had concentrated in themselves’ the intellectual effort 
of the older time, were ceasing to be an intellectual class at all. The 
monasteries were no longer seats of learning. ‘‘I found in them,” said 
Poggio, an Italian traveller twenty years after Chaucer’s death, “men 
given up to sensuality in abundance, but very few lovers of learning, 
and those of a barbarous sort, skilled more in quibbles and sophisms 
than in literature.” The erection of colleges, which was beginning, 
failed to arrest the quick decline of the universities both in the num- 
bers and learning of their students. Those at Oxford amounted to 
only a fifth of the scholars who had attended its lectures a century be- 
fore, and “Oxford Latin” became proverbial for a jargon in which the 
very tradition of grammar had been lost. All literary production was 
nearly at an end. Historical composition lingered on indeed in com- 
pilations of extracts from past writers, such as make up the so-called 
works of Walsingham, in jejune monastic annals, or worthless popular 
compendiums. But the only trace of mental activity is to be found in 
the numerous treatises on alchemy and magic, on the elixir of life or 
the philosopher’s stone, a fungous growth which most unequivocally 
witnesses to the progress of intellectual decay. On the other hand, 
while the older literary class was dying out, a glance beneath the sur- 
face shows us the stir of a new interest in knowledge among the masses 
of the people itself. The correspondence of the Paston family, which 
has been happily preserved, not only displays a fluency and vivacity as 
well as a grammatical correctness which would have been impossible 
in familiar letters a few years before, but shews country squires dis- 
cussing about books and gathering libraries. The very character of 
the authorship of the time, its love of compendiums and abridgements 
of the scientific and historical knowledge of its day, its dramatic per- 
formances or mysteries, the commonplace morality of its poets, the 
popularity of its rimed chronicles, are additional proofs that literature 
was ceasing to be the possession of a purely intellectual class and was
-P-A-G-E-228

  beginning to appeal to the people at large. The increased use of linen 
paper in place of the costlier parchment helped in the popularization 
of letters. In no former age had finer copies of books been produced; 
in none had so many been transcribed. This increased demand for 
their production caused the processes of copying and illuminating 
manuscripts to be transferred from the scriptoria of the religious 
houses into the hands of trade-guilds, like the Guild of Saint John at 
Bruges, or the Brothers of the Pen at Brussels. It was, in fact, this 
increase of demand for books, pamphlets, or fly-sheets, especially of a 
grammatical or religious character, in the middle of the fifteenth cen- 
.tury that brought about the introduction of printing. We meet with 
it first in rude sheets simply struck off from wooden blocks, “ block- 
books” as they are now called, and later on in works printed front sep- 
arate and moveable types. Originating at Maintz with the three 
famous printers, Gutenberg, Fust, and Schoeffer, the new process tray- 
elled southward to Strasburg, crossed the Alps to Venice, where it lent 
itself through the Aldi to the spread of Greek literature in Europe, and 
then floated down the Rhine to the towns of Flanders. It was prob- 
ably at the press of Colard Mansion, in a little room over the porch of 
Saint Donat’s at Bruges, that Caxton learnt the art which he was the 
first to introduce into England.

CHAPTER XI 
EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE REVIVAL 
OF LEARNING 
  Tue Readings contained in this chapter illustrate the educational 
results of the Italian Revival of Learning, as shown in the changes 
in the schools in Italy, France, Germany, and England. Begin- 
ning with the court schools of Italy, the resulting reform of edu- 
cation gradually extended to northern lands. The largest amount 
of space is given to the results in England and to the work and 
character of the English grammar school, because we in America 
drew our early educational ideas and practices direct from Eng- 
land. The Boston Latin School, founded in 1635, was a direct 
descendant of the English grammar schools and English educa- 
tional traditions. 
The first selection (135) is from the tractate by Guarino da 
Verona on the teaching of the new literatures, and in this he de- 
scribes the method employed so successfully by his father in his 
Italian court school. He also lays down his new dictum as to 
the fundamental importance of a knowledge of Greek and Latin 
for the educated man. The second selection (136) describes the 
course of study at the French college of Guyenne, at Bordeaux, 
one of the leading exponents of the new humanism in France. 
The third selection (137) outlines the course of instruction which 
Sturm, employing the new humanism, finally evolved for his 
famous classical gymnasium at Strassburg. These two furnish 
an interesting comparison. 
The introduction of humanistic studies into the English sec- 
ondary schools was largely due to Colet, through the re-founding 
of Saint Paul’s School in London, in 1510. This school, though 
at first bitterly opposed, soon established the type for nearly all 
the English grammar schools founded or reorganized thereafter. 
The extracts from Colet’s Statutes for the school (138 a-c) are 
given to show the character of the provisions he made for the 
new school. The introduction of the new learning into England 
was also greatly aided by the English court, and the selection 
from Ascham (139) is given to show Queen Elizabeth’s deep in-
-P-A-G-E-230
  204 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
terest in the new studies. For Colet’s school Lily wrote a new 
type of Latin Grammar. This became a famous textbook and 
continued in use for centuries, and the Introduction contributed 
thereto by Colet is reproduced (140) to show his kindly interest 
in good learning. 
Even before the new humanistic type of school had been intro- 
duced into Engiand some efforts at securing schools directed by 
university-trained teachers, instead of clerics, had been made, of 
which the school established by William Sevenoaks is a good 
example. His will is reproduced (141) to show the type of school 
he wanted to establish. The chantry grammar school founded 
by John Percival (142), and the efforts of the city authorities of 
Sandwich to provide a grammar school (143), both illustrate the 
interest such new-type schools had awakened in England. 
The course of study for Eton College, one of the largest and 
best-endowed of the English grammar schools, as reproduced 
(144), shows how thoroughly the new humanistic studies had 
made a home for themselves in the larger grammar schools within 
half a century after Colet’s re-foundation of Saint Paul’s; while 
the description by Adam Martindale (145) of the instruction he 
received in a small country grammar school, about 1635, is inter- 
esting as showing how thoroughly the new learning had by that 
time penetrated to even thé small and remote grammar schools 
of England. It was in 1635 that the Boston Latin School, the 
first Latin grammar school in America, was founded by English 
settlers, most of whom had been educated in these English gram- 
mar schools. Our educational traditions for secondary education 
thus go back, through the English-type Latin grammar school, 
directly to the Italian Renaissance. 
After a time the new humanistic studies began to lose their 
earlier importance as cultural studies, due in part to a change in 
teaching methods. The emphasis now came to be placed upon 
drill and intellectual discipline instead of the humanistic spirit, 
and in consequence the schools in time became formal and life- 
less. This came to be particularly true of such instruction in the 
hands of the Jesuits, though it extended to secondary education 
in all lands and among all creeds. The description of such formal 
instruction by the Jesuit Campion (146) illustrates well how for- 
mal drill and minute analysis of the old authors had replaced the 
earlier humanistic culture.

135. Guarino on Teaching the Classical Authors 
(A letter; trans. by Woodward, W. H., in his Vittorino da Feltre, pp. 161-72. 
Cambridge, 1897) 
Battisto Guarino was the son of Guarino da Verona (1374- 
1460), and in a lengthy letter, under date of 1459, he describes 
The Order and the Method to be Ob- 
served in Teaching and in Reading 
the Classical Authors, as then being 
carried out by his father in his fa- 
mous school at Ferrara. By way 
of preface he says: 
In offering this short Treatise for 
your acceptance, I am fully aware that 
you need no incentive to regard the 
pursuit of Letters as the most worthy 
object of your ambition. But you may 
find what I have written a not un- 
welcome reminder of our past inter- 
course, whilst it may prove of use 
to other readers into whose hands it 
may fall. For I have had in view not 
only students anxious for guidance in 
their private reading, but masters 
  z : sie Fic. 26. GUARINO DA VERONA in search of some definite principles (1374-1460) 
of method in teaching the Classics. 
Hence I have treated both of Greek and of Latin Letters, and I have 
confidence that the course I have laid down will prove a thoroughly 
satisfactory training in literature and scholarship. 
Guarino begins the letter with a discussion as to the nature of 
the schoolmaster, and then passes to a consideration of methods 
of teaching Latin, which study he says “‘is so important that ne 
one who is ignorant of it can claim to be thought an educated 
man.” Vergil, he says, should be learned by heart. He then 
proceeds: ; 
§3. Ihave said that ability to write Latin verse is one of the essential 
marks of an educated person. I wish now to indicate a second, which is 
-of at least equal importance, namely, familiarity with the language and 
literature of Greece. The time has come when we must speak with no 
uncertain voice upon this vital requirement of scholarship. I am well 
aware that those who are ignorant of the Greek tongue decry its neces- 
sity, for reasons which are sufficiently evident. But I can allow no 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
206 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  doubt to remain as to my own conviction that without a knowledge 
of Greek, Latin Scholarship itself is, in any real sense, impossible. I 
might point to the vast number of words derived or borrowed from the 
Greek, and the questions which arise in connection with them; such as 
the quantity of the vowel sounds, the use of the diphthongs, obscure 
orthographies and etymologies. ... The Greek grammar, again, can 
alone explain the unusual case-endings which are met with in the de- 
clension of certain nouns, mostly proper names, which retain their 
foreign shape; such as “Dido” and “Mantus.”” Nor are these excep- 
tional forms confined to the poetic use. But I turn to the authority of 
the great Latins themselves, to Cicero, Quintilian, Cato and Horace: 
they are unanimous in proclaiming the close dependence of the Roman 
speech and Roman literature upon the Greek, and in urging by example 
as well as by precept the constant study of the older language. To 
quote Horace alone: 
“Do you, my friends, from Greece your models draw, 
And day and night to con them be your law.” 
And again, 
“To Greece, that cared for naught but fame, the Muse 
Gave genius, and a tongue the gods might use.” 
In such company I do not fear to urge the same contention. 
Were we, indeed, to follow Quintilian, we should even begin with 
Greek in preference to Latin. But this is practically impossible, when 
we consider that Greek must be for us, almost of necessity, a learned 
and not a colloquial language; and that Latin itself needs much more 
elaborate and careful teaching than was requisite to a Roman of the 
imperial epoch. On the other hand, I have myself known not a few 
pupils of my father — he was, as you know, a scholar of equal distinc- 
tion in either language — who, after gaining a thorough mastery of 
Latin, could then in a single year make such progress with Greek that 
they translated accurately entire works of ordinary difficulty from that 
language into good readable Latin at sight. Now proficiency of this 
edegree can only be attained by careful and systematic teaching of the 
rudiments of the Grammar, as they are laid down in such a manual as 
the well-known one of Manuel Chrysoloras, or in the abridgement 
which my father drew up of the original work of his beloved master. . . . 
» Our scholar should make his first acquaintance with the Poets 
through Homer, the sovereign master of them all. For from Homer 
our own poets, notably Vergil, drew their inspiration; and in reading 
the Iliad or the Odyssey no small part of our pleasure is derived fronr 
the constant parallels we meet with. Indeed we see in them as in a 
mirror the form and manner of the Aneid figured roughly before us, 
the incidents, not less than the simile or epithet which describes them, 
are, one might say, all there. In the same way, in his minor works
-P-A-G-E-233
      EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE REVIVAL 207 
Vergil has borrowed from Theocritus or Hesiod. After Homer has 
been attempted the way lies open to the other Homeric poets and to the 
Dramatists. 
He next discusses the use and importance of the historical 
writers, and the different Latin texts, and then says: 
The course of study which I have thus far sketched out will prove an 
admirable preparation for that further branch of scholarship which 
constitutes Rhetoric, including the thorough examination of the great 
monuments of eloquence, and skill in the oratorical art itself. The 
first work to claim our attention in this subject is the Rhetoric of Cicero, 
in which we find all the points of Oratory concisely but comprehen- 
sively set forth. The other rhetorical writings of Cicero will follow, 
and the principles therein laid down must be examined in the light of 
his own speeches. Indeed the student of eloquence must have his 
Cicero constantly in his hand; the simplicity, the lofty moral standard, 
the practical temper of his writings render them a peculiarly noble 
training for a public speaker. Nor should the admirable Quintilian 
be neglected in this same connection. 
It will be desirable also to include the elements of Logic in our course 
of studies, and with that the Ethics of Aristotle, and the Dialogues of 
Plato; for these are necessary aids to the proper understanding of 
Cicero. The Ciceronian Dialogue, in form and in matter, seems often 
to be modelled directly upon Plato. None of his works however are 
so attractive to myself personally as the De Officiis. and the Tuscu- 
lans. The former reviews all the main duties of life; the latter exhibits a 
wealth of knowledge most valuable — both as to material and expres- 
sion — to every modern writer. I would add that some knowledge of 
the principles of Roman Law will be helpful to the full understanding 
of Latin authors. 
A master who should carry his scholars through the curriculum 
which I have now laid down may have confidence that he has given 
them a training which will enable them, not only to carry forward their 
own reading without assistance, but also to act efficiently as teachers in

(Digest by W. H. Woodward, of Vinet’s Disciplina et ratio docendi (c. 1570). In 
Studies in Education during the Age of the Renaissance, chap. vi. Cambridge, 
1906) 
In 1534 the governing corporation of the city of Bordeaux, in 
southwestern France, decided to reorganize the boys’ school there 
along the new humanistic lines. Under a series of able principals

  the school was raised to first rank. The school was reorganized 
as a reformed grammar school of ten classes, with a two-year 
course in the Faculty of Arts in the university there added. The 
greatest period of prosperity of the school was during the prin- 
cipalship of Elie Vinet (1556-70), and he has left us a descriptive 
outline of its course of instruction, disciplina et ratio docendi, as 
he knew it. It represents the flowering period of the French Re- 
naissance, and is comparable to the school plan of Sturm (R. 137), 
Melancthon (R. 161), or of Eton (R. 144) at the same period. 
By classes the organization was as follows: 
Tenth, or Lowest Class. Entered at six or seven. Boys known as 
“ Alphabetarii” or “ Abecedarii.”” i 
Textbooks: the Alphabetum; the Pater Noster, the Seven Peniten- 
tial Psalms, and the Ave Maria; and the Libellus Puerulorum. 
Tests for promotion: ability to read the above, to decline and to 
conjugate, and to write legibly. 
Ninth Class. This was the largest in the school, indicating that 
many boys learned the above privately and entered the school 
at seven or eight. 
Textbooks: Reading and writing in both French and Latin, for 
both fluency and speed. 
Latin accidence of both noun and verb. 
The disticha de moribus of Cato, with French parallel transla- 
tion; and 
Cordier’s Exempla partium orationis, a small handbook of 
grammar. 
Eighth Class. Age eight or nine. 
Textbooks: Selection of Cicero’s Letters, selected scenes from 
Terence, and the Colloquia of Cordier. 
Seventh Class. Age nine or ten. 
Textbooks: Selections from Letters of Cicero continued; the Latin 
Grammar of Despantére, written in Latin hexameters. 
Much emphasis on style and composition. French the language 
of instruction for the Latin. 
Sixth Class. Age ten or eleven. 
Cicero’s Letters the standard prose text. Much memorization for 
form, and much explanation of construction. 
Fifth Class. Age eleven or twelve. 
Cicero’s Letters still the standard prose text, with emphasis as 
above. Also one play of Terence, and one book of the Epistole 
of Ovid. Rules of prosody now learned. 
Fourth Class. Age twelve or thirteen. 
Pupils now study for first time an oration of Cicero, and study with

  210 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
We have interesting light upon general methods of class instruction 
as pursued in the school. The retention of the mediaeval disputation, 
in the rational form of mutual questioning under the control of the form 
(class) master, was a safeguard against the prevalent fault of lecturing 
or dictating to the class which Erasmus so frequently ridiculed as the 
practice of the unskilled teacher or of the pedant parading his erudi- 
tion. The construing lesson lasted as a rule for one hour, and was 
followed by such disputation: the pupils asked questions of each other, 
propounded difficulties, discussed the matter of the text and the notes 
given by the master. This exercise occupied half an hour. On Sat- 
urdays, in place of a set lesson at midday, disputations were arranged 
in which form was pitted against form. Six pupils from each brought up 
as many compositions in prose or in verse which had been worked in 
advance. These were written out in large text hand, and pinned to a 
screen or on the wall of the class-room: Below each line of the script was 
left a clear space for interlinear correction and criticism. Thus the 
opposers could make careful examination of each exercise, detect errors 
and propound improvements. This disputation lasts an hour. 
Although French, as has been shown, was regularly employed for an 
instrument of Latin construing and composition, it-was not allowed to 
be used in school or play-ground except by the juniors: . . . Elder boys 
were required to use Latin in addressing little boys, and only when not 
understood were they to repeat their words in French. The words of 
the statute of the University of Paris as revised in 1599 show that to the 
very end of the century the same principle was upheld in the authori- 
tative seat of French learning. . . . 
The school hours were from 8-10, 12-1, 3-5, with an extra hour 
twice weekly in the case of pupils reading Greek and mathematics. 
Sunday was, apart from one exercise for the upper forms, a whole holi- 
day, as were certain Saints’ days. On some important vigils, about 
fifty during the year, a half holiday was allowed. Mass was attended 
daily by the entire school. The school year began in September, and 
continued till the beginning of August. 
137. Sturm’s Course of Study at Strassburg 
(Reconstructed from Sturm’s Plan (1538), his Classical Letters (1565), and the 
Examinations (1578) 
In 1537 Johann Sturm (1507-89) was placed at the head of the 
municipal Latin school, founded some years earlier by the city 
of Strassburg. The school had not been successful, and Sturm 
was given a free hand. He reorganized the school as a humanistic 
Latin school, omitting, however, the sports and contests of the 
Italian Court Schools and the English Grammar Schools; divided 
it into ten classes, with a teacher in charge of each; and soon

(Statutes of 1518, the original Statutes of 1510 being permanently lost. Lupton, J. H., 
Life of Colet. London, 1887) 
John Colet (1465-1519), an enthusiastic humanist, was made 
Dean of Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London, in 1500, and in 1510 
he re-founded the school of Saint Paul’s Churchyard as a New- 
Learning school. In a series of Statutes, first in 1510 and again in 
1518, he made detailed provision for its government and the in- 
struction in it. The Statutes begin with the words: 
John Colett, the sonne of henry Colett Dean of paules desiring noth- 
ing more thanne Educacion and bringing vpp chyldren in good Maners 
and litterature in the yere of our Lorde a mli fyve hundreth and twelfi

    214 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
From the Statutes of 1518 we quote three selections which show 
_ the care he exercised to put around the pupils the proper religious 
atmosphere, to prevent the instruction being wasted on poorly 
prepared or inattentive children, and to insure that pure Latin 
and Greek, and not monastic Latin, be taught. Many of his ex- 
pressions are very interesting and quaint. The Statutes are also 
interesting as having been written in English instead of in Latin.

139. Ascham on Queen Elizabeth’s Learning 
(Ascham, Roger, The Scholemaster. Arber ed., book 11, p. 194. London, 1570) 
One of the enthusiastic teachers of the New Learning in Eng- 
land was Roger Ascham (1516-68), who had studied at Saint 
John’s College; Cambridge — a center of the new learning — 
under Sir John Cheke, one of the greatest teachers of teachers. 
His years there Ascham often referred to as “my swete tyme at 
Cambridge.” Ascham in turn became a great teacher of reformed 
Latin and Greek, the tutor of Queen Elizabeth, and wrote The 
Scholemaster to show the advantages of a mild discipline and his 
method of double translation in teaching languages. Of Queen 
Elizabeth he wrote: 
... And by theis authorities and reasons am I moued to thinke, this 
waie of double translating, either onelie or chieflie, to be fittest, for the 
spedy and perfit atteyning of any tong. And for spedy atteyning, I 
durst venture a good wager, if a scholer, in whom is aptnes, loue, dili- 
gence, and constancie, would but translate, after this sorte, one litle 
booke in Tullie, as de senectute, . . . that scholer, I say, should cum to a 
better knowledge in the Latin tong, than the most part do, that spend 
four or fiue yeares, in tossing all the rules of Grammer in common 
scholes. . . . And a better, and nerer example herein, may be, our most 
noble Queene Elizabeth, who neuer toke yet, Greeke nor Latin Gram- 
mer in her hand, after the first declining of a nowne and a verbe, but 
onely by this double translating of Demosthenes and Isocrates dailie 
without missing euerie forenone, for the space of a yeare or two, hath 
atteyned to soch a perfite vnderstanding in both the tonges, and to 
soch a readie vtterance of the latin, and that wyth soch a judgement, 
as they be fewe in nomber in both the vniuersities, or els where in 
England, that be, in both tonges, comparable with her Maiestie. 
140. Colet’s Introduction of Lily’s Latin Grammar 
William Lily (1468-1522), one of the early English humanists, 
was appointed headmaster of the newly founded Saint Paul’s 
School, in London, in 1512, shortly after his return from Italy. 
For this school he wrote Lily’s Latin Grammar, a book which en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE REVIVAL 217 
tirely eclipsed his fame as a schoolmaster, and which was to the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries what Donatus had been 
to the Middle Ages. For this book Colet wrote the following 
Introduction: : 
Thaue .. . made this lytel boke, not thynkynge that I coude say ony 
thynge beter than hath be sayd before, but I toke this besynes, hau- 
ynge grete pleasure to shewe the testymony of my good mynde vnto the

alonely that I haue put tese partes in a more clere ordre, and haue made 
them a lytel more easy to yonge wyttes than (methynketh) they were 
before. ... Wherfore I praye you, all lytel babys, all lytel chyldren, 
lerne gladly this lytel treatyse, and commende it dylygently vnto your 
memoryes. Trustynge of this begynnynge that ye shal procede and 
growe to parfyt lyterature, and come at the last to be gret clarkes. And 
lyfte vp your lytel whyte handes for me, whiche prayeth for you to god. 
To whom be al honour and imperyal maieste and glory. Amen. 
141. Foundation Bequest for Sevenoaks Grammar School 
(Will of William Sevenoaks; trans. by A. F. Leach, Educational Charters, p. 399. 
Cambridge, 1911) 
The following bequest, under date of July 4, 1432, to provide 
for a grammar-school master who should be “by no means in 
holy orders,” but be in connection with a parish church, is a type 
of a number of similar foundations for grammar schools made in 
“England between 1200 and 1500. This foundation is particularly 
interesting as showing an effort to provide a school that should be 
taught by a university-trained teacher, instead of by a cleric. 
In God’s name, Amen. 
Whereas among other works of piety which flow from the fountain of 
charity to think upon the needy and poor is before all called blessed: 
led by this consideration, I, William Sevenoaks, citizen and grocer of 
  lands and tenements with a wharf adjoining, and the buildings built 
thereon and all other the appurtances which I lately have had by 
the demise and feoffment of Margaret, who was the wife of Robert 
Walton, in Petty Wales street in the parish of All Saints Barking 
church, near the tower of London, do frame make and ordain my pres- 
ent testament in this manner.

tor and saviour, to the Blessed Virgin Mary his mother and all saints, 
and my body to be buried where God has arranged. 
Also, I give and bequeath all my aforesaid lands and tenements with 
a wharf adjoining and with the buildings thereon built, and all other the 
appurtances, unto Mr John Charlton, Rector of Sevenoaks church in 
the county of Kent, to Master Vicar of the same church, and to the 
church-wardens of the same church and to other parishioners of that 
church, To Have and to Hold to them and their successors the Parsons, 
Vicars, Church-wardens, and Parishioners of the said Church hereafter 
for the time being all the said lands, tenements (etc.) of the chief Lord 
of the fees thereof by the services thereof due and of right accustomed, 
for ever; after the manner and form and under the conditions hereafter 
expressed, that is to say: 
First, (to pay an annuity of 20 marks to Margaret Walton for life, 
and after her death) do find and maintain forever one Master, an hon- 
est man, sufficiently advanced and expert in the science of grammar, 
B.A., by no means in holy orders, to keep a Grammar School in some 
convenient house within the said town of Sevenoaks with my goods, 
having obtained the license of the King or by other lawful means ac- 
cording to the discretion of my executors, and to teach and instruct all 
. poor boys whatsoever coming there for the sake of learning, taking 
nothing of them or their parents or friends for the teaching and instruct- 
‘ing them. For I will that the said rector (etc.) and their successors for 
the time being out of the issues and revenues of all the lands and tene- 
ments aforesaid with their appurtances, do pay yearly to the aforesaid 
Master of Grammer by way of salary or stipend for his service and 
labour to be done and exercised as aforesaid, 10 marks sterling at the 
four principal terms of the year by equal portions. Moreover I will’ 
and order that if any, and as often as it happens that any such master 
or teacher in grammar decease, depart or for the least time voluntarily 
cease from such determination, that then within at least the next 
quarter following another, such master, if any such can conveniently 
be found, be newly elected and chosen by the said rector or vicar, 
wardens and parishioners and their successors to inhabit and keep 
school and determine in the same house in ways, manner and form 
aforesaid.

The following brief outline of the authors read at Eton, in 1560, 
which is typical of other English grammar schools of the period, 
shows how completely the new humanistic learning had by this 
time been introduced into the grammar schools of England. An 
entirely new type of secondary school had been created since 
about 1200, and this had now been reformed and redirected along 
new lines. In addition to the subjects of study, religion, sports, 
and good manners received special emphasis.

of the daily work of every Eton scholar. In the lower forms it was con-

master. The boys in the Sixth and Seventh Forms wrote verses.

This description of an English country grammar school of about 
1635 is by a former pupil of the school. 
As for the proficience I made under my master ’twas this: He re- 
ceived me when I was learning in As in presenti and Cato, and in- 
structed me for prose in Corderius, A’sop’s Fables, Tullie’s Offices, 
epistles, and orations, together with Aphthonius for Latin in prose, and 
the Greek Grammars of Camden first, and Clenard afterwards, to- 
gether with a Greek Catechism, and lastly the Greek Testament (for I 
proceeded no further with him); and for poetry in Mantuan, Terence, 
Ovid’s Epistles and Metamorphoses, Virgil, and Horace. The rheto- 
tics he read to us were Susenbrotus first and Taleus afterwards. 
Mine exercises were usually A piece of Latin (of which he himself dic- 
tated the English) every day of the week, save Thursdays and Satur- 
days; and besides somewhat weekly as I rose in ability, first a dialogue 
in imitation of Corderius, or Pueriles Confabulatiuncule, then an epistle

  146. The Degeneracy of Classical Instruction 
(Simpson, Richard, Life of Campion, p. 105. London, 1896) 
The following selection describes the teaching of Edward Cam- 
pion, a Jesuit teacher of rhetoric at Prague, and relates to the year 
1574. It illustrates well how the early humanistic spirit, under 
the Ciceronian-style impulse, had given place to a narrow for- 
malism and a minute dissection of the classical authors. 
In class, he first made his scholars repeat a passage they had learned 
out of school-hours; then the monitors collected the written exercises, 
which he looked over and corrected. While he was thus occupied, the 
boys were trying to imitate a passage of a poet or an orator, which he 
had set them, or to write a brief account of a garden, a church, a storm, 
or any other visible object; to vary a sentence in all possible ways; to 
translate it from one language into another; to write Greek or Latin 
. Verses; to convert verses from one metre into another; to write epigrams, 
inscriptions, epitaphs; to collect phrases from good authors; to apply  
-P-A-G-E-251

the figures of rhetoric to a given subject; or to collect all the topics or 
commonplaces that are applicable to it. After this came a summary of 
the former day’s lesson, and then the lecture of the day, on one of 
Cicero’s speeches, was read, and the boys were examined upon it. The 
composition was to be on a given pattern. First, he was to explain his 
text, and to discriminate the various interpretations of it. Next, he 
was to elucidate the writer’s art, and to display his tricks of composi- 
tion, invention, disposition and style; the reasons of his dignity, his 
persuasiveness, or his power, and the rules of verisimilitude and illus- 
tration which he followed. Thirdly, the professor had to produce 
parallel or illustrative passages from other authors. Fourthly, he was 
to confirm the author’s facts or sentiments by other testimony, or by 
the saws of the wise. Fifthly, he was to illustrate the passage in any 
other way he could think of. Each lecture did not necessarily include 
all these points; but such was the range and the order prescribed for the 
points that were adopted.

  CHAPTER XII 
THE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY 
Tue few Readings contained in this chapter have been selected to 
illustrate first, the demands for church reform and the necessity 
for evolution to avoid revolution, and second, in case the reforms 
were refused, the natural consequences both to the reformer and 
to the Church. 
One marked effect of the Revival of Learning in northern lands 
was the deepening of an impulse, already under way, for moral 
and religious reform. In France, England, and in German lands 
there had been many before Luther who objected to the practices 
of the Church. One of the earliest and most influential of these 
was John Wycliffe, in England. A hundred and fifty years before 
the Protestant Revolt broke in Germany he had attacked the 
methods of the Church in no uncertain terms. For this Pope 
Gregory XI had addressed Bulls to the King of England and to 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in 1377 had ordered the 
Chancellor of the University of Oxford to arrest Wycliffe and de- 
liver him for trial. Selection 147 is illustrative of Wycliffe’s at- 
tacks, attacks which found much sympathy among the English 
people. That the Pope was aware of this is evident from the 
closing injunction of his Bull to the Chancellor, where he says: 
Besides, if there should be, which God forbid, in your university, 
subject to your jurisdiction, opponents stained with these [Wycliffe’s] 
errors, and if they should obstinately persist in them, proceed vigor- 
ously and earnestly to a similar arrest and removal of them, and other- 
wise as shall seem good to you. Be vigilant to repair your negligence 
which you have hitherto shown in the premises, and so obtain our grat- . 
itude and favor. 
Gregory’s successor, Pope Urban VI, continued unsuccessfully 
to try to stop Wycliffe. Shortly after Wycliffe’s death (1384) his 
followers replied to the charges against him, stating that they re- 
garded Pope Urban as Antichrist and as bearing no resemblance 
to “Seint Petur in erthe,” and attacked his life and doctrines. In 
particular they condemned the church theory of ‘‘indulgences,” 
as may be seen from selection 148. Wycliffe’s work was deeply 
influential in England, and through court influences was carried
-P-A-G-E-253
  
  THE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY 227 
to Bohemia, where it led to the martyrdom of John Huss, in 1415. 
By the beginning of the fifteenth century the demand for church 
reform had become general. From 1378 to 1417 there were two 
Popes, one at Rome and one at Avignon, in France, each claiming 
to be the rightful successor, and the contest which took place be- 
tween the two injured the Papacy greatly throughout Christen- 
dom. In 1414 a Council of the Church met at Constance, in 
Switzerland, to heal the breach, and, among other things, drew 
up a list of eighteen important reforms in church practices and 
procedure which it demanded, but unsuccessfully. These are 
enumerated in selection 149. Princes, legislative assemblies, citi- 
zens, priests, and sometimes even bishops protested in vain. Ex- 
tracts from the protests of the Cathedral preacher at Strassburg, 
and his prediction of a religious revolt if matters were not reme- 
died, are contained in selection 150, as typical of many of the 
time. Selection 151 reproduces fourteen of the ninety-five theses 
of Luther, as illustrating his point of view and the nature of the 
academic protests he at first made. 
Gradually led from protest to open revolt, Luther was finally 
excommunicated from the Church, in 1520, and the Diet of 
Worms, in 1521, ordered him arrested and confined, his writings 
burned, and his sympathizers treated as he was to be. We can 
understand this attitude better if we remember that the heretic 
was the anarchist of the Middle Ages, and was virtually guilty of 
treason to the State. The selection from Saint Thomas Aquinas’s 
Summa Theologica (152) will serve to make clearer the dangerous 
position of Luther and his followers, as viewed by the Church. 
The final selection (153) reproduces the English Act of Supremacy, 
which severed England from the Church of Rome and erected the 
King as head of the English Church and the defender of the faith 
in England. 
147. Wycliffe on the Enemies of Christ 
(Arnold, Thomas, Select English Works of John Wyeliffe, vol. 1, p. 208. 
Oxford, 1869) 
John Wycliffe (1320?-84), a popular English preacher and Ox- 
ford divinity graduate, was led by a study of the Bible to attack 
many of the claims and practices of the Church. His revolt 
against authority was as direct and vigorous as the later revolt 
of Luther, but he lacked the printing-press which Luther had to  
-P-A-G-E-254
  
  228 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
give effectiveness to his challenge. His attacks, however, deep- 
: ened the English feeling of 
unrest. The following selec- 
tion is a sample of his at- 
tacks, this being against the 
head of the Church in England 
for his opposition to the trans- 
lation of the Bible into Eng- 
lish, and naming the Pope and 
cardinals, bad bishops and rul- 
ers, and the mendicant friars 
as the three chief enemies of 
Christ. Wycliffe was only one 
of many who attacked the 
practices of the Church and

Wycliffe died in 1384, and shortly after his death his followers 
issued a defense, in which they charged the then Pope, Urban VI,
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY 229 
as being the Antichrist, and attacked, one hundred and thirty- 
three years before Luther’s theses, the church theory as to indul- 
gences. They said, in part: 
Furste, that this pope Urban tho sixte beres not strength of Seint 
Petur in erthe, but thai affermen hym to be the son of Anticriste, and 
that no verrey pope was sith tho tyme of Silvester (I) pope. 
Here Cristen men seyne pleynly, that whatever pope or other preste, 
in maner of lyvynge or techynge or lawis-makynge, contrarius Crist, is

149. List of Church Abuses demanding Reform 
(Von der Hardt, Magnum Constantiense Concilium, vol. 1v. 1452) 
A dominant note, running through later medieval writings and 
sermons, is a constant criticism of the Church and a demand for 
reform. In 1414-18 a Council of the Church, meeting at Con- 
stance, in Switzerland, made a serious attempt in this direction 
by drawing up a list of the abuses within the Church which it felt 
should be remedied. The attempt at reform failed, but the list 
of abuses, in view of the Protestant Revolt which broke a century 
later, is interesting. 
The holy Council of Constance decrees and ordains that the Supreme 
Pontiff who shall next, by the grace of God, assume office, shall, in 
conjunction with this holy council, or with the deputies of the several 
nations, reform the Church, before the council dissolves, in head and 
members, as well as the Roman curia, in accordance with justice and 
the proper organization of the Church, in all the respects enumerated 
below, which are presented by the mations as requiring reform: 
The number, character and nationality of the Lords Cardinals. 
The Reservations made by the Apostolic See. 
The Annates both the servitia communia and servitia minuta. 
The Collation to Benefices and Expectative Favors. 
Appeals to the Roman Curia. 
The functions of the (papal) Chancery and Plenitentiary. 
Exemptions and Incorporations made during the Schism. 
Benefices in Commendam. 
Confirmation of Elections. 
Income during Vacancies. 
The non-alienation of the possessions of the Roman Church or other 
churches. 
For what reasons and in what manner shall a Pope be corrected or 
deposed? 
The Extirpation of Heresy. 
Dispensations. 
The means of support of Pope and Cardinals. 
Indulgences. 
Tenths.   
  150. A German Priest’s Views as to Coming Reform 
(L. Dacheux, Jean Geiler. Paris, 1876. Trans. by Coulton) 
Johann Geiler (1445-1510) took his doctorate in Theology at 
Freiburg, and became Cathedral Preacher at Strassburg, in 1478. 
This position he held until his death. He hated the abuses of the
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY | 231 
Church of his time and thundered against them. He died be- 
lieving that a catastrophe was impending. Two extracts from 
his sermons will illustrate his feeling as to the need for reforms. 
Preaching before the Emperor Maximilian, a few years before 
his, death, he cried out: 
Since neither Pope nor Emperor, kings nor bishops, will reform our 
life, God will send a man for the purpose. I hope to see that day, but 
Tam too old. Many of you will see it; think then, I pray you, of these 
last words. . 
In another sermon on existing conditions, he said: 
O Lord my God, how falsely now do even those live who seem most 
spiritual — Parsons and Monks, Beguines and Penitents. Their study 
is not to work God’s works but to conceal the devil’s works. Among 
these all is outward show, and there is no truth, nought else but dung 
besnowed or buried under snow; without is the glistering whiteness of 
righteousness and honesty, but within a conscience reeking with ver- 
min and with the stench of sin. The day shall come when the Sun of 
Righteousness shall melt the snow, and then shall the secrets of your 
hearts be revealed. And would that the filth of our sins were at least 
covered with the appearance of snow, that our sin, like Sodom, were not 
published abroad without shame! 
151. Luther’s Theses illustrated 
(Ranke, Deutsche Geschichte in Zeitalter der Reformation, vol. tv, p. 83; trans. by 
Wace and Buchheim) 
The ninety-five theses which Martin Luther made out and 
nailed to the church door in Wittenberg in 
October, 1517, were after the university 
form of challenge to debate, and were in 
Latin. Of them Luther himself said that 
they were not his mature conclusions, and 
that they contained nothing he would stub- 
bornly adhere to, but that they were 
“somewhat obscurely expressed, as was the 
custom in such cases,” so that his oppo- 
nent in debate might not be too easily 
driven to the wall. In a letter to Pope 
Leo, six months afterward, Luther ex- 
pressed surprise and regret that they should 
have been given such wide circulation. The reproduction of a 
few of the theses will illustrate their nature.     HOEY

In the desire and with the purpose of elucidating the truth, a dispu- 
tation will be held on the underwritten propositions at Wittenberg, 
under the presidency of the Reverend Martin Luther, Monk of the Or- 
der of Saint Augustine, Master of Arts and Sacred Theology, and or- 
dinary Reader of the same in that place. He therefore asks those who 
cannot be present and discuss the subject with us orally, to do so by 
letter in their absence, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. ... 
5. The Pope has neither the will nor the power to remit any penalties, 
except those which he has imposed by his own authority, or by that of 
the canons. 
6. The Pope has no power to remit any guilt, except by declaring 
and warranting it to have been remitted by God; or at most by remit- 
ting cases reserved for himself; in which cases, if his power were de- 
spised, guilt would certainly remain. 
13. The dying pay all penalties by death, and are already dead to 
the canon laws, and are by right relieved from them. 
20. Therefore the Pope, when he speaks of the plenary remission of 
all penalties, does not mean really of all, but only of those imposed by 
himself. 
21. Thus those preachers of indulgences are in error who say that, 
by the indulgences of the Pope, a man is loosed and saved from all 
punishment. 
22. For in fact he remits to souls in purgatory no penalty which they 
would have had to pay in this life according to the canons. 
23. If any entire remission of all penalties can be granted to any one, 
it is certain that it is granted to none but the most perfect, that is to 
very few. 
24. Hence, the greater part of the people must needs be deceived by 
this indiscriminate and high-sounding promise of release from penalties. 
25. Such power as the Pope has over purgatory in general, such has 
every bishop in his own diocese, and every curate in his own parish, in 
particular. 
88. Again; what greater good could the Church receive than if the 
Pope, instead of once, as he does now, were to bestow these remissions 
and participations a hundred times a day on any one of the faithful? 
89. Since it is the salvation of souls, rather than money, that the 
Pope seeks by his pardons, why does he suspend the letters and pardons 
granted long ago, since they are equally efficacious? 
gi. If then pardons were preached according to the spirit and mind 
* of the Pope, all these questions would be resolved with ease; nay, 
would not exist. 
94. Christians should be exhorted to strive to follow Christ, their 
head, through pains, deaths, and hells. 
95. And thus trust to enter heaven through many tribulations, rather 
than in the security of peace.

  THE REVOLT AGAINST AUTHORITY 233 
152. Saint Thomas Aquinas on the Treatment of Heresy 
(Summa Theologica, Sec. Secunda, Quest. x1, Art. 111; trans. by J. H. Robinson, 
in Pennsylvania Reprints, vol. ut, no. 6) 
Thomas Aquinas (1225?-74) was a famous Italian Dominican 
scholar, generally regarded as one of the three great scholastics 
of the Middle Ages. He brought scholasticism to its highest de- 
velopment by harmonizing Aristotle with the doctrines of the 
Church. His Summa Theologica, written during the last three 
years of his life, has ever since been accepted as an authoritative 
statement of the doctrines of the Church. 
The selection here given deals with heresy, the great crime of 
the Middle Ages and early modern times, a crime worthy of the 
most severe punishment. The heretic was the anarchist of that 
time, one who was virtually guilty of treason to an institution 
necessary for salvation and the upholder of order and govern- 
ment. Not only was the heretic excommunicated and placed 
under political disabilities, but even torture and death were re- 
garded as justified to stamp out the dangerous contagion. Con- 
sidering the age, the mildness and fairness of the reasoning in the 
selection here given will be apparent. 
The selection also affords a good example of the plan of organ- 
ization and treatment of this famous textbook. 
Proceeding to the third question. First. It would appear that 
heretics are to be tolerated, for the Apostle says (2 Timothy, 11, 24), 
“The Lord’s servant must be gentle, in meekness, correcting them that op- 
pose themselves to the truth; if peradventure God may give them repentance 
unto the knowledge of the truth, and they may recover themselves out of the 
snare of the devil.” But if heretics are not tolerated but delivered over 
unto death, they are deprived of the opportunity of repentance. Hence, 
this would seem contrary to the precept of the Apostle. 
Second. Moreover, that which is necessary in the church must be 
tolerated. But heresies are necessary in the church. For the Apostle 
says (1 Corinthians, x1, 19), “For there must be also heresies among you 
that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.” There- 
fore, it would seem that heresies are to be tolerated. : 
Third. Moreover, the Lord commands his servants (Matthew, 
x11), that they should let the tares grow until the harvest, which is the 
end of the world, as is explained in the Interlinear Glossa. But the 
tares signify the heretics according to the interpretation of the saints. 
Therefore heretics are to be tolerated. 
But against this is to be urged the saying of the Apostle (Titus, m1,
-P-A-G-E-260
  234 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
1o), “A man that is heretical after a first and second admonition, re- 
fuse, knowing that such a one is perverted.” 
I reply that heretics must be considered from two points of view, 
namely, as regards the heretic himself, and secondly, as regards the 
church. As for the heretics themselves, there is their sin for which they 
deserve not only to be separated from the church by excommunication, 
but to be sent out of the world by death. It is, indeed, a much more 
serious offence to corrupt the faith, upon which depends the life of the 
soul, than to falsify coin, by means of which the temporal life is sus- 
tained. Hence, if counterfeiters and other malefactors are justly hur- 
ried to death by secular rulers, much the more may those who are con- 
victed of heresy not only be excommunicated but justly put to a speedy 
death. But on the side of the church, there is mercy looking for the 
conversion of the erring. She does not therefore condemn immediately, 
but only after a first and second admonition, as the Apostle teaches. 
Should the heretic still prove stubborn, the church, no longer hoping 
for his conversion, shall provide for the safety of others by separating 
him from herself by a sentence of excommunication. She further re- 
linquishes him to the secular judgment to be put out of the world by 
death. Jerome also says (on the passage in Galatians, v), “a little 
leaven’’; and as provided in 24. qu. 3, cap. 16 (Canon Law). “Foul 
flesh must be cut away, and mangy sheep must be kept from the fold lest the 
whole house be burned, the whole mass corrupted, the whole body be de- 
stroyed. Arius was but a spark in Alexandria but since this spark was 
not promptly quenched, the whole world has been devastated by the flames.” 
As to the first argument, namely that which relates to the meekness 
in which a heretic should be admonished a first and a second time; ii, 
after that, he refuses to return he is to be looked upon as perverted, as 
appears from the authority of the Apostle above cited (in the argu- 
ment beginning, But against). 
As to the second argument, any advantage which may proceed from 
heretics, is in no way intentional on their part, as for example, the proof 
they furnish according to the Apostle, of the constancy of the faithful, 
or as Augustine says — Lib. I de gen., cont. Manich. (cap. 1, about the 
middle) — “ Let us put away all slothfulness, carefully searching the Holy 
Scriptures.” Their intention is, on the contrary, to corrupt the faith, 
and this is most harmful. We should, therefore, give more weight to 
those conscious aims which would cut them off, rather than the unin- 
tentional good, which would seem to countenance their toleration. 
To the third argument we may reply, as it is written in the Decretals 
24, qu. 3, cap. Beginning, It is to be observed that excommunication is one 
thing and extirpation another. One is excommunicated with a view, as 
the Apostle says (x Cor. v, 5), “that the spirit may be saved in the day of 
the Lord.” That heretics shall be totally extirpated by death, is not 
however, contrary to the command of God, for that command is to be
-P-A-G-E-261

understood as applying only in the case when the tares cannot be de- 
stroyed, without destroying the wheat at the same time, as has been 
said in the preceding question, art. 8, argument 1, when we treated of 
heretics in common with infidels. 
153. The English ‘‘ Act of Supremacy ”’ 
(26 Henry VIII, c. 1, 1534, Statutes of the Realm, 1, p. 492) 
The following act passed by the English Parliament, in 1534, 
definitely severed England from Rome, and established the King 
as the head of the English Church. It illustrates the parlia- 
mentary side of the Reformation. 
An Act concernynge the Kynges Highnes to be supreme heed of the 
Churche of Englande and to have auctoryte to reforme and redresse all 
errours, heresyes and abuses yn the same.

  CHAPTER XIII 
EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE PROTESTANT 
REVOLTS 
I. LUTHERANS AND ANGLICANS 
Tue Readings in this chapter illustrate the development of Prot- 
estant education among the Lutherans and Anglicans. The first 
selection, from Rashdall (154), deals with the diffusion of educa- 
tion in later medieval times, from which we may infer something 
as to the effect of the Reformation on educational institutions. 
The selection on the literary style of the different translations of 
the Bible (155), contrasting these with the Ciceronian, is an in- 
teresting explanation of the hold which these vernacular transla- 
tions obtained from the first. 
The extract from Luther’s long address (156) is quite typical of 
the whole, and reveals his belief in the importance of the higher 
classical schools, when properly reformed, as a means for training 
learned ministers for the churches. Luther saw very clearly the 
need for teachers and preachers, and sets forth plainly the im- 
portance of the teacher’s work (157). He even advances very 
modern arguments for the compulsory attendance of children at 
school (158). 
Having abolished the old Church of Rome régime, it was neces-_ 
sary that the Lutherans reorganize the churches under the new 
form of worship, and for this some outline or form was necessary. 
These were supplied by the so-called Kirchenordnungen, worked 
out for the churches by Luther, Melanchthon, and Bugenhagen. 
An example of these is given in 159, from which their compre- 
hensive nature may be discerned. 
The schools also needed reorganization to fit them into the new 
Protestant state régime, and for this Schuleordnungen also were 
needed. Three of these are reproduced, the one prepared for Brieg 
(160), the Saxony Plan of Melanchthon (161), and the state 
school system adopted for Wiirtemberg (162). An outline of the 
Schulemethode adopted for the principality of Gotha, and a brief 
sketch of the important work of Duke Ernest, are given in 163. 
In England the Reformation zeal for education was far less
-P-A-G-E-263
  RESULTS AMONG LUTHERANS 237 
marked than in German lands, and took more the form of regula- 
tions to insure conformity to the new faith. Selections illustrat- 
ing the careful church supervision of a teacher’s acts and beliefs 
are given in 164; the type of penalties imposed on non-conforming 
schoolmasters by law in 165; a type of oath of fealty required of 
a grammar-school master is given in 167; an elementary-school 
teacher’s license is reproduced in 168; and typical grammar-school 
statutes regarding prayers are given in 169. Reading 166 gives 
the essential features of the English Act of Conformity of 1662, 
* an act which did much to drive good teachers from the work. 
One of the important results of the Reformation, in all Protestant 
lands, was that the people obtained the Bible in the vernacular, 
and selection 170 sets forth the great importance of this in educat- 
ing the people in England, and in influencing English literary art. 
It is often said that the Reformation was destructive of schools, 
and this certainly was the case in England. The general results 
afterward were wotse, in so far as numbers and opportunities 
were concerned, than before. That many of the schools abolished 
orre-founded needed reform may be seen from the extracts re- 
lating to the cathedral school at Canterbury (171, 172), the chief 
cathedral church in England. The details of the re-foundation 
by Henry VIII (172) give a clear idea of the type of reformed 
- humanistic cathedral grammar school established there. 
Elementary education in England remained for the nineteenth 
century to establish, as the nation soon settled down to the no- 
business-of-the-State attitude which persisted up to modern times. 
The State was, however, early forced to give attention to the 
needs of the children of paupers. Due to the change of England 
from an agricultural to a manufacturing nation, numbers of 
poor from the rural districts flocked into the growing cities, 
and a long series of Poor-Law legislation ensued. This cul- 
minated in the famous Poor-Relief and Apprenticeship Law 
of 1601 (174), toward which England had for some time been 
tending (173). 
154. Diffusion of Education in Medieval Times 
(Rashdall, H., Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, vol. 11, part 2, 
Pp. 600-04. Oxford, 1895) 
The following extract from Rashdall, an unusually pee 
scholar, dealing with the preparatory education of a medieval
-P-A-G-E-264
238 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
university student, throws an interesting side light on medieval 
education in general. 
There is no reason to believe that boys came to attend these inferior 
Grammar Schools in the University towns except from the immediate 
neighborhood. The majority of scholars must have learned reading, 
writing, and the rudiments of Grammar nearer home. As to where and 
how this knowledge was acquired, we have little detailed information. 
An investigation into the Grammar Schools of the Middle Ages would 
be a subject for a separate treatise. Suffice it to say that the old eccle- 
siastical Schools, in connexion with Cathedrals or other important 
Churches, were not destroyed by the growth of the Universities, and 
other Schools of the same kind were founded from time to time. Where 
the Universities were within easy reach, they were probably restricted 
for the most part to the study of Grammar, and sometimes the rudi- 
ments of Logic. In districts remote from Universities there were ec- 
clesiastical Schools of a higher 
type, which certainly taught a full 
course of Logic as well as Gram- 
mar, and in some cases perhaps 
the whole range of a University 
Arts Course. In some countries 
the bulk of the inferior clergy 
must have received their educa- 
tion in such Schools. At Vienna, 
Erfurt, and elsewhere, Schools of 
this character became a nucleus 
for the later Universities. 
Where there was no.Cathedral, 
Grammar Schools were attached 
to some Collegiate Church, or to 
ordinary Parish Churches. Some- 
times there was an endowment 
for such schools: elsewhere they 
were supported by the Munici- 
pality, or, in places like Canter- 
bury or Bury, taught by the Mon- 
  Fic. 34. A GERMAN FIFTEENTH- 
CENTURY SCHOOL 
(Reproduced from a woodcut on the title- 
page of an edition of Boethius’ De dis- 
ciplina scholarium cum notabile commento, 
printed by Henricus Quentell, at Cologne, 
in 1498, and now in the Library of Stan- 
ford University) astery. In other cases, no doubt, 
they were taught by some poor 
‘parochial chaplain’ in return for 
the scholars’ fees alone. Even in 
country parishes the Canon Law 
reouired that the parish clerk 
should be able to teach the boys 
to read as well as to sing their Psalter. How far such regulations were 
actually carried out, it is of course impossible to determine with pre- 
   
-P-A-G-E-265
  RESULTS AMONG LUTHERANS 239 
cision. But it may be stated with some confidence that at least in the 
later Middle Ages the smallest towns and even the larger villages pos- 
sessed Schools where a boy might learn to read and acquire the first 
rudiments of ecclesiastical Latin: while, except in very remote and 
thinly populated regions, he would never have had to go very far 
from home to find a regular Grammar School. That the means of 
education in reading, writing, and the elements of Latin were far more 
widely diffused in medieval times than has sometimes been supposed 
is coming to be generally recognized by students of medieval life. The 
knowledge of reading and writing and of the elements of Latin was by 
no means confined to the clergy: ‘the bailiff of every manor kept his 
accounts in Latin.’ A Grammar Master often formed part of the 
establishment of a great noble or prelate, who had pages of gentle 
family residing in his house for education. In other cases a boy of a 
well-to-do family no doubt received his earliest education from a chap- 
lain or ‘clerk’ of his father, or from a private tutor or neighboring 
Priest engaged for the purpose. 
In the Grammar School the rudiments of a classical education were 
imparted in much the same way as at the present day. Donatus and 
Alexander de Villa Dei were the Grammars. After the Psalms had been 
learned (this much was taught in the most elementary Schools of all), 
Cato served for Delectus, after which the boy might be put into Ovid 
and possibly Vergil. In the absence of dictionaries the Master no 
doubt literally ‘read’ the book to the pupils, ie. construed it to them 
and afterwards required them to do the same. In England books were 
construed into French as well as English. Questions were asked in 
parsing and exercises set in prose and verse. Disputations in Gram- 
mar... were also a favorite institution. After the boy had once 
entered the University all this ceased. No more classical books were 
construed, and we hear comparatively little of composition, though 
verse-making sometimes entered into University Examinations. Lec- 
tures in Grammar meant formal lectures on the elaborate grammatical 
treatises of Priscian and Donatus, or the more popular Alexander de 
Villa Dei. 
155. The Vernacular Style of the Translations of the Bible 
(From an article in the Literary Supplement of the London Times, 1911) 
The following short extract from a very interesting article on 
the English Bible applies with almost equal force to Luther’s 
German translation, in that each was couched in simple, homely 
phrases so unlike the language of the scholar of the day. This 
gave to each a strong appeal to the masses of the people, fixed the 
style of the vernacular, popularized religion, and greatly strength- 
ened the Reformation cause.

It was genuine enthusiasm for a high moral ideal which made the 
beauty. If Wyclif and his associates provided the seed, it was Tindale * 
and Cloverdale who raised the plant; the revisers of 1611 only pruned 
and trained it. . . . While Tindale was working alone in exile there was 
no promise in English literature. Chaucer’s light had set in darkness; 
tho he had died less than one hundred and fifty years before, he was not 
so easily read as he is to-day; and Wyclif’s Bible, tho more vernacular 
in style than Chaucer, was suffering the same obsolescence. Shakspere, 
without whom we can reckon nothing, was unborn. It was unfore- 
seen and unimaginable that at that time a book should arise unmatched 
in the world for its beauties and mastery of style. 
The style of prose eludes differentiation and description; it is one of 
the most complex and intangible of all phenomena that invite distinc- 
tion, but its history in western Europe offers a simple classification into 
two main divisions, the Ciceronian and the non-Ciceronian or Roman- 
tic. These terms are not satisfactory, but they do indicate a real dis- 
tinction. Cicero, founding himself on the Greek orators, perfected a 
manner of writing which, wherever it was known, affected European 
literature. Since he wrote in the language which was for centuries 
written and spoken by the learned all over Europe, we can not suppose 
that any one could wholly escape from some relics of his tradition; but 
his art was so elaborate that without familiarity and practice it could 
not be approached or attempted; and it is so far removed from collo- 
quial speech and untrained expression as to be almost unintelligible 
and repulsive to the natural man... . 
Our Bible, then, is in the Romantic style of prose; and, comparing 
our literature with the one literature in the world with which we can 
feel pride in comparing it, we may say that to the Greeks Herodotus’ 
history held something like the same literary position as our Bible holds 
with us —an early and inimitable masterpiece of abounding natural 
grace, whose simple charm set it above the reach of the conscious rules 
of grammarians, a model which no one who had sufficient taste to ad- 
mire would attempt to rival... . 
What England would have been if the Bible had never become a 
household book is a hypothetical problem for the moral philosopher; 
and if we ask how much we owe to the literary excellence of our transla- 
tion, that question is not a wholly literary one, but it has a very impor- 
tant literary aspect, of which we may venture to speak without in- 
truding upon morals or theology or the field of esoteric scholarship. 
For three hundred years, and we may almost say from the date of the 
first dissemination of Tindale’s New Testament, the average English- 
man has been subjected to an influence of incalculable magnitude, the 
greater because he has been unaware of its unusual character; for the 
Bible that he has read and revered has not only more beauty than any 
other vernacular rendering that any other nation has possessed, but it 
is in its vital parts more beautiful and intimate tkan its originals.

156. Luther to the Mayors and Magistrates of Germany 
(Martin Luther, Letter to the Mayors and Aldermen of all Cities of Germany in behalf 
of Christian Schools, 1524; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. 
IV, PP. 429-30, 437-38) 
Luther issued this address to the rulers of the German cities. 
The following extracts from it show his reasoning, and reveal the 
spirit of the Address. His great belief in the study of the lan- 
guages for the sake of understanding the Bible is also clearly 
demonstrated. 
To the Mayors and Councilmen of all the Towns of Germany: 
Grace and peace’ from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Beloved rulers, wise and sagacious men, . . . I would have you freely, 
cheerfully and in a spirit of love, give me your attention; since, doubt- 
less, if ye obey me herein, ye obey not me, but Christ, and whoever 
does not follow my precepts, despises Christ, and not me. Wherefore I 
beseech you all, beloved rulers and friends, for the sake of God and of 
poor neglected youth, do not count this a small matter, as some do, 
who, in their blindness, overlook the wiles of the adversary. For it is 
a great and solemn duty that is laid upon us, a duty of immense mo- 
ment to Christ and to the world, to give aid and council to the young. 
And in so doing we likewise promote our own best interests. And re- 
member, that the silent, hidden and malicious assaults of the devil can 
e withstood only by manly Christian effort. Beloved rulers, if we 
find it necessary to expend such large sums, as we do yearly, upon artil- 
ery, roads, bridges, dykes, and a thousand other things of the sort, in 
order that a city may be assured of continued order, peace, and tran- 
quillity, ought we not to expend on the poor suffering youth therein, at 
east enough to provide them with a schoolmaster or two? God, the 
Almighty, has, in very deed, visited us Germans with the small rain of 
his grace, and vouchsafed to us a right golden harvest. For we have 
now among us many excellent and learned young men, richly furnished 
with knowledge, both of the languages and of the arts, who could do 
great good, if we would only set them to the task of teaching our little 
olks. Do we not see before our very eyes, that a boy may now be so 
thoroughly drilled in three years, that, at fifteen or eighteen, he shall 
know more than hitherto all the high schools and cloisters put together 
ave ever been able to impart? Yea, what other thing have the high 
schools and cloisters ever achieved, but to make asses and blockheads? 
Twenty, forty years would they teach you, and after all you would 
know nothing of Latin, or of German either; and then, too, there is 
their shameful profligacy, by which how many ingenuous youths have 
been led astray! But, now that God has so richly favored_us, in giving 
us such a number of persons competent to teach these young folks, and

to mould their powers in the best manner, truly it behooves us not to 
throw his grace to the wind, and not to suffer him to knock at our door 
AMEVAIN.. is. - 
“This may be so,” you reply; “but, though we ought to have schools, 
and must have them, still what will it profit us to have Latin, Greek, 
Hebrew, and your other liberal arts taught in them? Will not German 
suffice to teach us all of the Bible andthe Word of God that is essential 
to salvation?” Alas, I fear me, that we Germans must ever be and 
continue to be mere brutes and wild beasts, as our neighbors with such 
good reason style us.... Surely, were there no other gocd to be got 
from the languages, the bare thought that they are a noble and a glori- 
ous gift from God, wherewith he has visited and enriched us, almost 
beyond all other nations, this thought, I say, ought to be a powerful 
motive, yea, an allurement to cultivate them. ... For the prince of 
darkness is shrewd enough to know that, where the languages flourish, 
there his power will soon be so rent and torn that he cannot readily 
repair it. But now, since he cannot keep them from expanding into a 
vigorous growth, and from bearing fruit, he is at work, devising how he 
may render them dwarfed and sickly, if so be that they may decay and 
die of themselves. . . . 
. .. For, as the light of the sun dispels the shadows of the night, so do 
the languages render useless all the glosses of the Fathers. Since now, 
it becomes Christians to regard the Scriptures as the one only book, 
which is all their own, and since it is a sin and a shame for us not to be 
familiar with our own book, nor with the language and the word of our 
God; — so it is a still greater sin and shame, for us not to learn the 
languages, especially now that God is bringing to us and freely offering 
us learned men, and suitable books, and everything which we need for 
this purpose, and is, so to speak, urging us to the task, so desirous is he 
to have his book open to us. O, how joyful would those beloved Fath- 
ers have been, if they could have come to the knowledge of the Scrip- 
tures, and have learned the languages so easily as we now may doit... . 
But, you say, “we can not bring all our children up to be students; 
we can not spare them; we need them at home to work for us.” I 
answer, “I do not ask for the establishment of such schools, as we have 
had hitherto, where our young men have spent twenty or thirty years 
over Donatus or Alexander, and yet have not learned anything at all. 
We have now another world, and things are done after a different pat- 
tern. And I ask no more than this, namely, that boys shall attend 
upon such schools as I have in view, an hour or two a day, and none the 
less; spend the rest of their time at home, or in learning some trade, or 
doing whatever else you will; thus both these matters will be cared for 
together, while they are young and opportunities are favorable. For 
else, they would haply spend tenfold this time in gunning and ball- 
playing. So, too, your little girls may easily find time enough to go to

school an hour a day, and yet do all their household duties; for they 
now devote more than that to overmuch play, dancing, and sleep. 
It is very plain that all we need, is a cordial. and earnest determina- 
tion to train up our youth aright, and by this means furnish the world 
with wise and efficient men. For the devil is better pleased with coarse 
blockheads and with folks who are useful to nobody; because where 
such characters abound, then things do not go on prosperously here 
on the. earth. 
Hence, there is great need, not for the sake of the young alone, but 
also for the welfare and stability of all our institutions, temporal and 
spiritual alike, that we should begin at once, and in gocd earnest, to 
attend to this matter. ... 
Wherefore, dearly beloved rulers, bend yourselves to the work which 
God so strictly enjoins upon you, which your office involves, which our 
youth stand so much in need of, and which neither the world nor the 
spirit can afford to do without. We have lain, alas, too long in the 
darkness of corruption and death; too long have we been German 
beasts. Let us now act as becomes reasonable beings, so that God may 
mark our gratitude for the good things he has given us, and that other 
lands may see that we, too, are men; nay, more, that we are men who 
can either learn somewhat from them, or impart somewhat to them: 
so, through us, the world shall be made better. I have done my part; 
and with longing have I desired to bring aid and counsel to this German

157. Luther’s Conception of the Dignity and Importance of the 
Teacher’s Work 
(Martin Luther, Sermon on the Duty of Sending Children to School; trans. in Bar- 
nard’s American Journal of Education, vol. Iv, p. 441) 
Another extract from the same source as the preceding. 
Where were your supply of preachers, jurists, and physicians, if the 
arts of grammar and rhetoric had no existence? These are the foun- 
tain, out of which they all flow. I tell you, in a word, that a diligent, 
devoted school-teacher, preceptor, or any person, no matter what his 
title, who faithfully trains and teaches boys, can never receive an ade- 
quate reward, and no money is sufficient to pay the debt you owe him; 
so, too, said the pagan, Aristotle. Yet we treat them with contempt, 
as if they were of no account whatever; and, all the time, we profess to 
be Christians. For my part, if I were, or were compelled to leave off 
preaching and to enter some other vocation, I know not an office that 
would please me better than that of schoolmaster, or teacher of boys. 
For Iam convinced that, next to preaching, this is the most useful, and 
greatly the best labor in all the world, and, in fact, I am sometimes in 
doubt which of the positions is the more honorable. For you can not
-P-A-G-E-270
  244 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
teach an old dog new tricks, and it is hard to reform old sinners, but™ 
this is what by preaching we undertake to do, and our labour is often 
spent in vain; but it is easy to bend and train young trees, though 
haply in the process some may be broken. My friend, nowhere on 
earth can you find a higher virtue than is-displayed by the stranger, 
who takes your children and gives them a faithful training, — a labor 
which parents very seldom perform, even for their own offspring. 
158. Luther on the Duty of compelling School Attendance 
(Martin Luther, Sermon on the Duty of Sending Children to School; trans. in Bar- 
nard’s American Journal of Education, vol. 1v, pp. 440-41) 
In a long sermon, written in 1530, to be preached in Lutheran 
churches throughout Germany, Luther admonishes the people to 
_ send their children to school. In the extract from this sermon 
given below Luther urges compulsion to attend, basing the right 
to compel attendance on the general right of the State to protect 
itself and advance its welfare. 
I hold it to be incumbent on those in authority to command their 
subjects to keep their children at school; for it is, beyond doubt, their 
duty to insure the permanence of the above-named offices and positions, 
so that preachers, jurists, curates, scribes, physicians, schoolmasters, 
and the like, may not fail from among us; for we cannot do without them. 
If they have the right to command their subjects, the able-bodied 
among them, in time of war, to handle musket and pike, to mount the 
walls, or to do whatever else the exigency may require; with how much 
the more reason ought they to compel the people to keep their children 
at school, inasmuch as here upon earth the most terrible of contests, 
wherein there is never a truce, is ever going on, and that with the devil 
himself, who is lying in wait, by stealth and unawares, if so be that he 
may drain city and kingdom, and empty quite out of them all the brave 
and good, even until he has removed the kernel utterly, and naught 
shall be left but a mere shell, full of idle mischief-makers, to be mere 
puppets in his hands to do his pleasure. Then will your city or your 
country suffer a true famine, and, without the smoke of conflict, will be 
silently destroyed from within, and that without warning. 7 Even the 
Turk manages in another way; for he takes every third child through- 
out his empire, and trains him to some calling perforce. How much 
more, then, ought our rulers to put at least some children to school; not 
that I would have a boy taken away from his parents, only that he 
should be educated, for his own good and the general welfare, to some 
calling that shall yield him abundant fruits of his industry. Where- 
fore, let magistrates lay these things to heart, and let them keep a 
vigilant look-out; and, wherever they see a promising lad, have him 
pledged at school.

159. An Example of a Lutheran Kirchenordnung 
(Hamburg Kirchenordnung of 1529; trans. by Robbins) 
After the Reformation in Germany it was necessary to reor- 
ganize the churches and schools in the cities and towns as Lu- 
theran churches and schools, and to provide a basis for such reor- 
ganizations a series of church and school ordinances were drawn 
up. These followed old established lines, but required changes 
to adapt themselves to the new faith. Several hundred of these 
Ordnungen are in existence, some being quite simple and others 
very comprehensive. An example of the latter is the one adopted 
for the city of Hamburg, in 1529. Its contents were as follows: 
1. Ofschools. 2. On the sifting of pupils by the teacher. 3. On the 
permanence of schools. 4. Public lectures. 5. The library. 6. Ger- 
man writing schools. 7. Girls’ schools. 8. Students. 9. Pastors, 
chaplains, and other clergymen. 10. The superintendent and his 
assistant. 11. Selection of teachers and predicants. 12. The recep- 
tion of such persons into the work of the church. 13. The work of

161. Melanchthon’s Saxony Plan 
(From Melanchthon’s Book of Visitation; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, vol. Iv, pp. 749-51) 
In 1527 Melanchthon was requested by the Elector of Saxony 
to head a commission of three to travel over the kingdom and 
report on its needs as to schools. It was probably the earliest of 
the school surveys. In 1528 the Report, or Book of Visitation, 
was published. This contained the following plan for the organ- 
ization of schools throughout the kingdom. The great impor- 
tance attached by Melanchthon to the Latin grammar school, and 
especially to the study of Latin grammar, will be evident to the 
reader. 
School Plan 
Preachers also should exhort the people of their charge to send their 
children to school, so that they may be trained up to teach sound doc- 
trine in the church, and to serve the state in a wise and able manner. 
Some imagine that it is enough for a teacher to understand German. 
But this is a misguided fancy. For he, who is to teach others, must 
have great practice and special aptitude; to 
-gain this, he must have studied much, and 
from his youth up... . 
...In our day there are many abuses in 
children’s schools. And it is that these abuses 
may be corrected, and that the young may 
have good instruction, that we have prepared 
this plan. In the first place, the teachers must 
be careful to teach the children Latin only, not 
German, nor Greek, nor Hebrew, as some have 
heretofore done, burdening the poor children 
with such a multiplicity of pursuits, that are 
not only unproductive, but positively injurious. 
Such schoolmasters, we plainly see, do not Goes 
think of the improvement of the children at Raines Meni ncn 
all, but undertake so many languages solely (1497-1560) 
to increase their own reputation. In the sec- 
ond place, teachers should not burden the children with too many 
books, but should rather avoid a needless variety. Thirdly, it is indis- 
pensable that the children be classified into distinct groups. 
The First Group. The first group shall consist of those children who 
are learning toread. With these the following method is to be adopted: 
They are first to be taught the child’s-manual, containing the alphabet, 
the creed, the Lord’s prayer, and other prayers. When they have 
   
-P-A-G-E-274
  248 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
learned this, Donatus and Cato may both be given them; Donatus for 
a reading-book, and Cato they may explain after the following manner: 
the schoolmaster must give them the explanation of a verse or two, and 
then in a few hours call upon them to repeat what he has thus said; and 
in this way they will learn a great number of Latin words, and lay up a 
full store of phrases to use in speech. In this they should be exercised 
until they can read well. Neither do we consider it time lost, if the 
feebler children, who are not especially quick-witted, should read Cato 
and Donatus not once only, but a second time. With this they should 
be taught to write, and be required to show their writing to the school- 
master every day. Another mode of enlarging their knowledge of 
Latin words is to give them every afternoon some words to commit to 
memory, as has been the custom in schools hitherto. These children 
must likewise be kept at music, and be made to sing with the others, as 
we shall show, God willing, further on. 
The Second Group. The second group consists of children who have 
learned to read, and are now ready to go into grammar. With these 
the following regulations should be observed: The first hour after noon 
every day all the children, large and small, should be practiced in music. 
Then the schoolmaster must interpret to the second group the fables 
of Aesop. After vespers, he should explain to them the Pedology of 
Mosellanus; and, when this is finished, he should select from the Collo- 
quies of Erasmus some that may conduce to their improvement and 
discipline. This should be repeated on the next evening also. When 
the children are about to go home for the night, some short sentence 
may be given them, taken perhaps from a poet, which they are to re- 
peat the next morning, such as, “‘ Amicus certus in re incerta cerniture.” 
— A true friend becomes manifest in adversity. Or “Fortuna, quem 
nimium foret, stultum facit.’’ — Fortune, if she fondles a man too much, 
makes him a fool. Or this from Ovid: “ Vulgus amicitias utilitate pro- 
bat.” — The rabble value friendships by the profit they yield. 
In the morning the children are again to explain A‘sop’s fables. 
With this the teacher should decline some nouns or verbs, many or few, 
easy or difficult, according to the progress of the children, and then ask 
them the rules and the reasons for such inflection. And at the same 
time when they shall have learned the rules of construction, they should 
be required to construe, (parse,) as it is called; this is a very useful exer- 
cise, and yet there are not many who employ it. After the children © 
have thus learned AZsop, Terence is to be given to them; and this they 
must commit to memory, for they will now be older, and able to work 
harder. Still the master must be cautious, lest he overtask them. 
Next after Terence, the children may take hold of such of the comedies 
of Plautus as are harmless in their tendency, as the Aulularia, the Tri- 
nummus, the Pseudolus, etc.
-P-A-G-E-275
  RESULTS AMONG LUTHERANS 249 
The hour before mid-day must be invariably and exclusively devoted 
to instruction in grammar: first etymology, then syntax, and lastly 
prosody. And when the teacher has gone thus far through with the 
grammar, he should begin it again, and so on continually, that the 
children may understand it to perfection. For if there is negligence 
here, there is neither certainty nor stability in whatever is learned be- 
side. And the children should learn by heart and repeat all the rules, so 
that they may be driven and forced, as it were, to learn the grammar well. 
If such labor is irksome to the schoolmaster, as we often see, then we 
should dismiss him, and get another in his place, — one who will not 
shrink from the duty of keeping his pupils constantly in the grammar. 
For no greater injury can befall learning and the arts, than for youth to 
grow up in ignorance of grammar... . 
The Third Group. Now, when these children have been well trained 
in grammar, those among them who have made the greatest proficiency 
should be taken out, and formed into a third group. The hour after 
mid-day they, together with the rest, are to devote to music. After 
this the teacher is to give an explanation of Vergil. When he has fin- 
ished this, he may take up Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and the latter part 
of the afternoon Cicero’s “Offices,” or “Letters to Friends.”’ In the 
morning, Vergil may, be reviewed, and the teacher, to keep up practice 
in the grammar, may call for constructions and inflections, and point 
. out the prominent figures of speech. 
The hour before mid-day, grammar should still be kept up, that the 
scholars may be thoroughly versed therein. And when they are per- 
fectly familiar with etymology and syntax, then prosody (metrica) 
should be opened to them, so that they can thereby become accustomed 
to make verses. For this exercise is a very great help toward under- 
standing the writings of others; and it likewise gives the boys a rich 
fund of words, and renders them accomplished in many ways. In 
course of time, after they have been sufficiently practiced in the gram- 
mar, this same hour is to be given to logic and rhetoric. The boys in 
the second and third groups are to be required every week to write 
compositions, either in the form of letters or of verses. They should 
also be rigidly confined to Latin conversation, and to this end the teach- 
ers themselves must, as far as possible, speak nothing but Latin with 
the boys; thus they will acquire the practice by use, and the more 
rapidly for the incentives held out to them. 
162. The School System established in Wurtemberg 
(Digest of an article by Karl von Raumer; trans. by Barnard, in his American 
Journal of Education, vol. v1, pp. 426-34) 
The first German State to organize a complete system of 
schools was Wiirtemberg, in southwestern Germany. This
-P-A-G-E-276
  250 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
marked the real beginning of the German system, and the example 
of Wiirtemberg was copied throughout Germany: The School 
Code, first issued in 1559 by the reigning Duke, and approved by 
the Diet of the State in 1565, provided for a state school system 
designed ‘‘to carry youth from the elements’ through the succes- 
sive grades to the degree of culture demanded for offices in the 
Church and in the State.’’ The Code, in outline, provided for 
the following schools: 
1. Teutsch (German) Schools 
Beginning school. Boys and girls separate. Instruction in reading 
and writing German, religion, and music. Such schools to be set up in 
every little village and hamlet. Teachers in such schools to be relieved 
from beadle and mass services in the churches. These schools free, and 
for the masses. . 
2. Latin Schools 
A fully equipped school to have six classes, but many had less. 
These known as private schools. They were divided into six classes, 
as follows: ‘ 
First or Lowest Class. (9 to 11 years of age.) Pupils in this class 
learned to pronounce and read Latin and began building up a vocabu- 
lary. Readings from Cato. i 
Second Class. (10 to 12 years of age.) Cato continued. Declen- 
sions and conjugations. Grammar studied. Vocabulary enlarged. 
Translation from the Latin catechism. Much drill on phrases. Music 
taught. 
Third Class. (11 to 13 years of age.) Much drill on phrases. Read- 
ing of fables and dialogues. Letters of Cicero begun. Readings from 
Terence for elegance and purity. Syntax begun. Music continued. 
At close of this year might be transferred to the Cloister Schools (3). 
Fourth Class. (12 to 14 years of age.) Cicero’s “Letters to his 
Friends”’; his treatises on “Friendship” and “Old Age”; and Terence 
to be read. Syntax finished; prosody begun. 
Music continued. 
Greek grammar begun, with readings from the smaller Greek cat- 
echism of Brentius. 
Fifth Class. (13 to 15 years of age.) All previous work to be per- 
fected. In this class read Cicero’s “Familiar Letters” and his “Off- 
ces.” Also Ovid’s de Tristibus, and the Gospels in Greek and Latin. 
Much attention to prosody and to exercises in style. Music continued. 
Sixth Class. (14 to 16 years of age.) Cicero’s “Speeches,” Sallust, 
and the Zneid of Vergil to be read. Much attention to the elegancies 
of the Latin tongue, and to pure poetical diction. Successful imitation 
of the idiom and phraseology of Cicero the aim.
-P-A-G-E-277
  RESULTS AMONG LUTHERANS 251 
In Greek to complete the grammar, and to read Xenophon’s Cyro- 
pedia and the larger catechism of Brentius. 
Music, especially sacred, to be practiced, and the recitations of the 
day to be begun by singing either the Veni sancte Spiritus or the Veni 
Creator Spiritus. 
Conversation, both in and out of school, to be in Latin. 
Logic and Rhetoric to be read in this class. 
3. The Lower Cloister or Grammar Schools 
Could be entered after completing the Third Class, at 12 to 14 years 
of age. Designed for selected boys, who were to be trained for the 
service of the Church. ' 
Course of study paralleled the three upper classes of the Latin 
Schools, but with much more emphasis on theological doctrine. 
4. The Higher Cloister Schools 
Entered at 15 to 16 years of age, to prepare for the University, which 
was usually entered at about 16 or 17. 
Read Cicero and Vergil. Continued emphasis on style and purity 
and elegance of diction. Phrase book constructed. 
Continue Greek grammar, and read Demosthenes. 
Continue music, and study musical theory. 
Continue Logic and Rhetoric. 
Begin Arithmetic and Astronomy. 
Disputations fortnightly on questions of grammar, logic, rhetoric, 
or the sphere. 
Strict discipline, and emphasis on theology. 
5. The State University at Tiibingen 
Studies: Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Logic, Rhetoric, Mathematics, and 
Theology. 
This Code laid the foundation for the school system which 
continued to the present century. For example, Barnard reports 
that, in 1832, there was in the State a complete system of ver- 
nacular elementary schools, eighty-three Latin schools, four 
cloister schools, and the University at Tiibingen. 
163. The Schulemethode of Duke Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha 
(Digest of a description by Barnard, in Am. Jour. of Educ., vol. xx, pp. 576-84) 
One of the most wonderful pieces of educational work carried 
out in any German State in the seventeenth century was that of 
Ernest the Pious, who was the ruling prince of the little state of 
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, in Thuringia, from 1640 to 1675. The Thirty
-P-A-G-E-278
  252 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Years’ War (1618-48) had practically destroyed the schools. In 
1641 he ordered a “‘school-visitation” to ascertain the condition 
of the schools and churches. Inviting to his little kingdom a 
schoolmaster by the name of Andreas Reyher, who was familiar 
with the work of Ratich (Ratke) and Comenius, the two drew up 
a School Code (Schulemethode) which was alike the making of 
the schools of Gotha and a matter of derision and astonishment 
to his people. First published in 1642, it was revised and repub- 
lished in 1648, 1653, 1662, 1672, and 1685. It contained minute 
regulations about everything that concerned schools and teachers, 
school government and superintendence, and the relations of par- 
ents and children to the schools. 
Duke Ernest obtained teachers, built schoolhouses, prepared 
school books, and sent the children to school, and in time trans- 
formed his kingdom into one of the most prosperous spots in all 
Europe. His became the best type of school system organized 
in German lands before the late eighteenth century. 
A digest of his Schulemethode shows the following organiza- 
tion: si

These are the contents of the school manual (methodus), the grandest 
work of the many grand creations of Ernes the Pious, and that in a 
time when life and property were trodden into the dust, and when 
licentious mobs stubbornly resisted the establishment of schools — a 
work which was destined to be the foundation of a new edifice in Ger- 
many, because A. H. Franké, (whose father was counselor to the 
duke,) carried into effect subsequently the principles of the school- 
methodus in Halle, and'rendered it thus available for all schools. The 
new regulations were received with laughter and derision in the prin- 
cipality of Gotha itself; yet the duke was not disconcerted. He first 
obtained better teachers, built twenty new school-houses as models, 
established a new school-inspection, and charged rector Reyher to get 
the necessary school-books for teachers and pupils. The German Horn- 
book and Speller for children of the principality of Gotha was published, 
1641; The German Reader, 1642; and both were given gratis to each 
child, an instruction which is still in force. Reyher published later the 
Arithmetica, and (1656) the Short Instruction in natural objects, in 
some useful sciences, in ecclesiastic and secular institutions of the 
country, and in some “ domestic prescripts”; and in 1655 he published 
some patterns of catechising on penitence, the virtues and vices spoken 
of in the Ten Commandments, on the value of: the holy communion, 
&c. When it was reported to the duke that some teachers did not 
study satisfactorily for their self-improvement, he issued an order that 
they should study arithmetic and writing more earnestly, either by 
themselves or with their pastors, or the inspectors of schools. To im- 
prove the domestic education of the children, a “short instruction” 
was published (1654) “on the behavior, &c., of children,” when going
-P-A-G-E-281

to school, at dinner, at home, in church, at play, at supper, when going 
to bed, when in company of strangers, on rising early, &c. This in- 
struction was not only posted in every village, but the duke decreed, 
May 1, 1654, that it should be read in every school on examination 
day, in presence of the mayor, citizens, and elders of every township, 
164. The Careful Supervision of the Teacher’s Acts and Religious 
Beliefs in England 
(Strype, John. (a) The History of the Life and Acts of the Most Reverend Father in 
God, Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury, p. 378. Oxford, 1821. (6) Ibid., 
The Life and Acts of Matthew Parker, vol. 11, p. 335. Oxford, 1821. Summarized 
by Stowe, in his Elizabethan Grammar Schools, p. 68) 
After the English Church had been separated from Rome and 
separately established by the Act of Supremacy (R. 153), and 
after the coming of Elizabeth to the throne (r. 1558-1603), the 
Engiish Church authorities began a very strict supervision of 
the manners, morals, and religious teachings and beliefs of the 
teachers in the schools. Two extracts will show the extent to 
which this was carried. 
(a) Letter of Queen’s Council to Archbishop Grindle, June 18, 1580 
... for as much as a great deal of the corruption in religion grown 
throughout the realm, proceedeth of lewd schoolmasters, that teach 
and instruct children as well publicly as privately in men’s houses; in- 
fecting each where the youth without regard had unto (a matter... 
chiefly to be looked into by every Bishop within his diocese) it is 
thought meet for redress thereof, that you cause all such schoolmasters 
as have charge of children, to be by the Bishop of the diocese, or such 
as he shall appoint, examined touching their religion: and if they shall 
be found corrupt and unworthy, to be displaced, and proceeded withal 
as other recusants; and fit and sound persons placed in their rooms. 
(b) Dismissal of a teacher for non-conformity 
In 1573 the mastership of the free school at Aylesham became va- 
cant. Of the three men who applied for the position, Mr. Harrison, 
M.A., Cambridge, appeared to be best qualified, and was highly recom- 
mended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Norwich. Rumor’s of Harri- 
son’s lack of complete conformity, however, had reached Archbishop 
Parker; who wrote and urged the Bishop of Norwich not to admit 
Harrison, who was finally admitted upon condition that he would keep 
and execute the statutes of the school, in reading the authors there ap- 
pointed (it had been asserted that he had condemned the reading of 
profane authors to children), that he would quarrel neither with his 
Pastor nor with his neighbors, that he would hold no “strange opin- 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
  256 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ions” nor defend them obstinately in prophesying, or any other con- 
ference, and that “he should use no unlawful games, neither vain nor 
disordered company.” Harrison’s term of office was not long. While 
acting as godfather to an infant about to be baptized he requested the 
Deacon “to change the word of the bok, viz. thou into you; and to leave 
out the sign of the cross: as for Dost thou forsake, he would have had 
him say, Do you forsake; for Dost thou believe, Do you believe; and when 
it was asked, Wilt thou be baptized in this faith ? it was answered, We do 
bring this child to be baptized into the faith of Christ.” Such signs of 
non-conformity could not be tolerated in a schoolmaster and the Bishop 
declared his position forfeited, and appointed or admitted a Mr. Sutton 
whose candidacy had been supported by Archbishop Parker. 
165. Penalties on Non-Conforming Schoolmasters 
(23 Elizabeth, 1580; c. 1. Statutes of the Realm, 1819 ed., vol. Iv, p. 656, s. 5) 
The following statute of 1580 carried the matter of penalizing 
non-conforming schoolmasters still further, and shows the type 
of penalty inflicted on those employing teachers not sound in the 
faith, and the emphasis placed on the proper form of religious 
teaching by the State Church in England after the Reformation.

166. The English Act of Conformity of 1662 
(14 Charles II, cap. 4; Transcript, Statutes of the Realm, vol. v, p. 364) 
This, the last and most exacting Act of Uniformity in religion in 
England, received the royal assent May 19, 1662. For two cen- 
turies it crushed the secondary schools of England. 
The Act begins by reciting that in the first year of the reign of 
Elizabeth (1558) there was compiled a uniform order of service 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  
RESULTS AMONG ANGLICANS 257 
and prayer for the realm, and that this was enjoined by Parlia- 
ment, and that “divers persons abstain from conforming to it” 
and ministers (Dissenters) neglect to use it, to rectify which sit- 
uation the present Act of Uniformity is proclaimed, and the 
appended Book of Common Prayer is ordered used uniformly 
throughout the realm. All clergymen must take oath, on a pre- 
scribed form, that they assent to it and will use it in their services, 
and those that neglect to do so within one month are to be de- 
prived of all religious offices and functions and thereafter for- 
bidden to officiate at any form of service. This was intended to 
drive out all non-conforming ministers, and to prohibit service 
by such. 
To make the Act still more onerous and effective, it was further 
provided: 
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every 
dean, canon, and prebendary of every cathedral or collegiate church, 
and all masters and other heads, fellows, chaplains, and tutors of or 
in any college, hall, house of learning or hospital, and every public 
professor and reader in either of the Universities and in every college 
elsewhere, and every parson, vicar, curate, lecturer, and every other 
person in Holy Orders, and every schoolmaster keeping any public or 
private school, and every person instructing or teaching any youth in 
any house or private family as a tutor or schoolmaster, who upon the 
first day of May, which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1662, or 
at any time thereafter, shall be incumbent or have possession of any 
deanery, canonry, prebend, mastership, headship, fellowship, profes- 
sor’s place or reader’s place, parsonage, vicarage, or any other ecclesi- 
astical dignity or promotion, or of any curate’s place, lecture, or school, 
or shall instruct or teach any youth as tutor or schoolmaster, shall 
before the feast-day of St. Bartholomew which shall be in the year of 
our Lord 1662, or at or before his or their respective admission to be 
incumbent or have possession aforesaid, subscribe the declaration or 
acknowledgment following, scilicet : 
“T, A.B. do declare that it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatso- 
ever, to take arms against the king; and that I do abhor that traitorous 
position of taking arms by his authority against his person or against 
those that are commissionated by him; and-that I will conform to the 
liturgy of the Church of England, as it is now by law established: and 
I do declare that I do hold there lies no obligation upon me, or on any 
other person, from the oath commonly called the Solemn League and 
Covenant, to endeavour any change or alteration of government either 
in Church or State; and that the same was in itself an unlawful oath,
-P-A-G-E-284
  258 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
and imposed upon the subjects of this realm against the known laws 
and liberties of this kingdom.” . . . 
And if any schoolmaster, or other person, instructing or teaching 
youth in any private house or family, as a tutor or schoolmaster, shall 
instruct or teach any youth as a tutor or schoolmaster, before license 
obtained from his respective archbishop, bishop, or ordinary of the 
diocese, according to the laws and statutes of this realm (for which he 
shall pay twelve pence only), and before such subscription and ac- 
knowledgment made as aforesaid; then every such schoolmaster and 
other, instructing and teaching as aforesaid, shall for the first offence 
suffer three months’ imprisonment without bail or mainprize; and for 
every second, and other such offence, shall suffer three months’ im- 
prisonment without bail or mainprize, and also forfeit to his majesty 
the sum of five pounds: and after such subscription made, every such 
parson, vicar, curate, and lecturer shall procure a certificate under 
the hand and seal of the respective archbishop, bishop, or ordinary of 
the diocese (who are hereby enjoined and required upon demand to 
make and deliver the same), and shall publicly and openly read the 
same, together with the declaration or acknowledgment aforesaid, 
upon some Lord’s day within three months then next following, in his 
parish church where he is to officiate, in the presence of the congrega- 
tion there assembled, in the time of divine service; upon pain that 
every person failing therin shall lose such parsonage, vicarage or 
benefice, curate’s place, or lecturer’s place respectively, and shall be 
utterly disabled and (ipso facto) deprived of the same; and that the 
said parsonage, vicarage or benefice, curate’s place, or lecturer’s place 
shall be void, as if he was naturally dead. 
This:Act was followed, in 1665 (17 Charles II, cap. 2), by what 
was known as “‘ The Five Mile Act,” which forbade any minister 
to preach or teacher to teach ‘“‘within five miles of any city or 
town corporate, or borough that sends burgesses to Parliament, 
within his majesty’s kingdom of England,” or ‘‘to teach any pub- 
lic or private school, or take boarders or tablers that are taught or 
instructed by him or her self, or any other,” under penalty of 
440 and six months in prison. 
These Acts were modified, in 1670, by the English Courts, so as 
not to apply to teachers in endowed elementary schools where the 
teacher was the appointee of the founder or the lay patron of the 
school, and the result was that between 1660 and 1730 approxi- 
mately r10o endowed elementary schools were created, largely 
to escape the stringent provisions of the above Acts. For sec- 
ondary education they remained unmodified until the second half
-P-A-G-E-285

of the nineteenth century, with the result that the secondary 
schools declined in influence, and for two centuries were virtually 
withdrawn from the national life. ‘Men would not become 
schoolmasters,”’ says Montmorency, “when only political or reli- 
gious hypocrites were allowed to teach.” 
167. Oath of a Grammar-School Master 
(Carlisle, N., A Concise Description of the Endowed Grammar Schools in England and 
Wales, vol. 0, p. 714. London, 1818) 
Each grammar-school master was required to take an oath of 
fealty. This was an old institution in the Church (R. 84 b), and 
probably goes back to Roman civic requirements. The following 
oath, as required by the foundation statutes of Kirby Stephen 
School (1566), is illustrative and typical. In the parish church, 
and in the presence of at least two Governors of the school, the 
Churchwardens, twelve men of the parish, and any surviving 
heirs of the founder, this oath had to be taken by each new Mas- 
ter. It likewise illustrates the close connection of the Church 
and education in England, the English National Church merely 
taking the place of the Romanish Church which it had displaced. 
I do swear by the contents of this book, that I will freely without 
exacting any money, diligently instruct and teach the children of this 
parish, and all others that shall resort to me, in Grammar and other 
humane doctrine, according to the statutes thereof made, — and I 
shall not read to them any corrupt or reprobate books or works set 
forth at any time contrary to the determination of the universal cath- 
olique church, whereby they may be infected in their youth in any 
kind of heresie or corrupt doctrine, or else to be indured to insolent 
manner of living: And further shall observe all the statutes and ordi- 
nances of this schoole now made, or hereafter to be made which con- 
cern me, and shall doe nothing in the prejudice thereof, but help to 
maintain the same from time to time during my aboad herein to the 
best of my power — so help my God, and the contents of this book. 
168. An English Elementary-School Teacher’s License 
(Strype, John, Life and Acts of John Whitgift, D.D., vol. 1, Appendix, p. 384. 
London, 1822) 
The following is a license granted by Archbishop Whitgift, of 
Canterbury, to one William Swetnam, of London, in 1599, li- 
censing him to teach the beginnings of learning to children.

John by divine providence Archbishop of Canterbury, of all England 
Primate and Metropolitan; to all Christian people to whom these pres- 
ents shall come, sendeth greetings in our Lord God everlasting. These 
are to let you understand, that upon receipt of sufficient testimony of 
the good life and conversation of William Swetnam, of the parish of 
Saint Margaret Patens in London, fishmonger; and upon further ex- 
amination of him, being first sworn in due form to the supremacy of 
the Queen’s most excellent Majesty, and subscribing to the Articles 
agreed upon by the Clergy in anno 1562, we have licensed, and by these 
presents do license the said William Swetnam, to teach and instruct 
children in the principles of reading, and introduction into the acci- 
dence; and also to write, and to cast accounts, in any parish within the 
city of London, or our peculiar Churches of Canterbury, within the 
said city. Enjoyning him, that every week he do instruct his children 
and scholars in the Catechism made and set forth by Mr. Alexander 
Nowel, now Dean of the cathedral church of Saint Paul in London: and 
that he with his scholars, so many as shall be of the parish where he 
shall teach, do usually and commonly resort and repair, on all sabbaths 
and festival days, to the church of the parish where he shall so teach- 
and he with his scholars do reverently hear Divine service and sermons, 
and dutifully and diligently attend ther unto, And also we will, this 
our license to endure, during his good behavior, and our pleasure; and 
no otherways. In witness whereof, we have caused this our seal of 
our office of principal registry to be put hereunto. Dated this 2oth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord 1599, and of our translation the 16th. 
In 1603 a new Statute made all schoolmasters in the realm 
subject to license by the Bishop, as a condition precedent to 
teaching. 
169. Grammar-School Statutes regarding Prayers 
(Cowper, H. S., Hawkshead, p. 475. London, 1899) 
Much emphasis has been laid upon religion in the English 
grammar schools. The boys have been required to attend both 
the services of the English Church and the devotional exercises 
of the school itself. Morning and evening prayers have been and 
still are an established feature of English grammar-school life. 
These prayers were usually prescribed by some church official, 
though they were sometimes appointed by the master, and some- 
times even placed in the Statutes of the school by the founder. 
The following extracts from the Statutes for the grammar school 
at Hawkshead, as laid down by the founder, are typical and illus- 
trate the character of the prayers required.

170. Effect of the Translation of the Bible into English 
(Green, J. R., Short History of the English People, pp. 460-62. London, 1888) 
The wonderful moral and educational influence of the transla- 
tion and setting up of the English Bible in the churches of Eng- 
land is described by Green, as follows: 
No greater moral change ever passed over a nation than passed over 
England during the years which parted the middle of the reign of 
Elizabeth from the meeting of the Long Parliament. England became 
the people of a book, and that book was the Bible. It was as yet the 
one English book which was familiar to every Englishman; it was read 
at churches and read at home, and everywhere its words, as they fell 
on ears which custom had not deadened, kindled a startling enthusi- 
asm. ... The popularity of the Bible was due to other causes beside 
that of religion. The whole prose literature of England, save the
-P-A-G-E-288
    262 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
lorgotten tracts of Wyclif, has grown up since the translation of the 
Scriptures by Tyndale and Coverdale. So far as the nation at large 
was concerned, no history, no romance, hardly any poetry, save the 
little-known verse of Chaucer, existed in the English tongue when the 
Bible was ordered to be set up in churches. Sunday after Sunday, day 
after day, the crowds that gathered round Bonner’s Bibles in the nave 
of Saint Paul’s, or thefamily group that hung on the words of the Geneva 
Bible in the devotional exercises at home, were leavened with a new 
literature. Legend and annal, war-song and psalm, State-roll and 
biography, the mighty voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, 
stories of mission journeys, of perils by the sea and among the heathen, 
philosophic arguments, apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast 
over minds unoccupied for the most part by any rival learning. The 
disclosure of the stores of Greek literature had wrought the revolution 
of the Renascence. The disclosure of the older mass of Hebrew liter- 
ature wrought the revolution of the Reformation. But the one revolu- 
tion was far deeper and wider in its effects than the other. No version 
could transfer to another tongue the peculiar charm of language which 
gave their value to the authors of Greece and Rome. ... But the 
tongue of the Hebrew, the idiom of the Hellenistic Greek, lent them- 
selves with a curious felicity to the purposes of translation. As a 
mere literary monument, the English version of the Bible remains the 
noblest example of the English tongue, while its perpetual use made 
it from the instant of its appearance the standard of our language. 
For the moment however its literary effect was less than its social. 
The power of the book over the mass of Englishmen showed itself in 
a thousand superficial ways, and in none more conspicuously than in 
the influence it exerted on ordinary speech. It formed, we must re- 
peat, the whole literature which was practically accessible to ordinary 
Englishmen. . . . 
But far greater than its effect on literature or social phrase was the 
effect of the Bible on the character of the people at large. Elizabeth 
might silence or tune the pulpits; but it was impossible for her to 
silence or tune the great preachers of justice, and mercy, and truth, who 
spoke from the book which she had again opened for her people. The 
whole moral effect which is produced now-a-days by the religious news- 
paper, the tract, the essay, the lecture, the missionary report, the ser- 
mon, was then produced by the Bible alone; and its effect in this way, 
however dispassionately we examine it, was simply amazing. . . . The 
whole temper of the nation felt the change. A new conception of life 
and of man superseded the old. A new moral and religious impulse 
spread through every class.

171. Ignorance of the Monks at Canterbury and Messenden 
(British Museum MSS., Arundel 68, f. 69; trans. by A. F. Leach) 
At the visitation of the monastery at Canterbury, made on 
September 9, 1511, by the Archbishop, the Most Reverend Father 
William Warham, a number of defects were noted in the monas- 
tery and ordered reformed. Two of these relate to the condi- 
tion of learning among the monks, and were set down as fol- 
lows: 
(5) Also a skilled teacher of grammar shall be provided to teach the 
novices and other youths grammar. For in default of such instruction 
it happens that most of the monks celebrating mass and performing 
other divine service are wholly ignorant of what they read, to the great 
scandal and disgrace both of religion in general and the monastery 
in particular. 
(6) Also provision shall be made that the novices and other monks 
may not henceforth be without books. 
Again, in 1531, we find another extract which shows that the 
monks of one of the northern monasteries had practically lost the 
use of the language of the Church. In that year the Bishop of 
Lincoln, in northern England, addressing the monks at the mon- 
astery of Messenden, wrote: 
And for that ye be ignorant and have small understanding of 
Laten, we have drawen our said Injunctions in our vulgare Englishe 
tong to the intent that ye shuld the better undyrstand and knowe 
them, and soo see them more surely observed and kepte in every 
parte. 
172. The Re-Foundation of the Cathedral School at Canterbury 
(Parker MS., Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, 120, f. 15; trans. by A. F. Leach) 
In 1541 Henry VIII re-founded the old Canterbury Cathedral 
School as a reformed-church grammar and song school, and for 
its government drew up and promulgated a long Statute, from 
which the following selections have been made. The course of 
study outlined shows the Renaissance influence in full force, and 
the influence of Colet’s school in London. ’

I. The whole number of those who shall be maintained in the cathedral 
and metropolitical church of Christ at Canterbury 
First we decree and ordain that there shall be for ever in the said 
church a Dean, 12 Canons, 6 Preachers, 12 Minor Canons, a deacon, a 
sub-deacon, 12 lay-clerks, a master of the choristers, 10 choristers, 
two Informators of boys in grammar, of whom one shall be the teacher 
and the other the under-teacher, 50 boys to be taught grammar, 12 
poor to be maintained at the expense of the church, 2 vergers (wand- 
bearers), 2 sextons (sub-sacrists), 4 servants in the church to ring the 
bells and arrange other things, two door-keepers who shall be also bara- 
bers, a maniciple, a butler and an under-butler, a cook and an under- 
cook; who shall to the number aforesaid each in his rank sedulously 
serve in the same church according to our statutes and ordinances. 
26. The Choristers and their [Master] number 
We decree and ordain that in our church aforesaid there shall be at 
the election or nomination of the Dean, or in his absence the Sub-dean, 
and Chapter, ten choristers, boys of tender age with clear voices and 
fit for singing, to serve the choir, minister and sing. For their instruc- 
tion and education, as well in good behaviour as in skill in singing, we 
will that besides the twelve clerks before-named one shall be elected 
by the Dean [etc.] and Chapter, of good character, upright life and 
skilled in singing and playing the organ, to diligently employ himself 
in teaching the boys, playing the organ at the proper time, and singing 
divine service. And if he shall be found negligent or idle in teaching 
he shall after three warnings be deposed from office. And he shall be 
bound by oath faithfully to discharge his office. 
27. The Grammar Boys and their Teachers 
That piety and good letters may in our church aforesaid for ever 
blossom, grow and flower and in their time bear fruit for the glory of 
God and the advantage and adornment of the commonwealth, we 
decree and ordain that there shall always be in our cathedral church 
of Canterbury, elected and nominated by the Dean or in his absence 
the Sub-dean and Chapter, 50 boys, poor and destitute of the help of 
their friends, to be maintained out of the possessions of the church, 
and of native genius as far as may be and apt to learn: whom however 
we will shall not be admitted as poor boys of our church before they 
have learnt to read and write and are moderately learned in the first 
rudiments of grammar, in the judgment of the Dean or in his absence 
the Sub-dean and the Head Master; 
And we will that these boys shall be maintained at the expense of 
our church until they have obtained a moderate knowledge of Latin 
grammar and have learnt to speak and to write Latin. The period of
-P-A-G-E-291
RESULTS AMONG ANGLICANS 265 
four years shall be given to this, or if it shall so seem good to the Dean 
or in his absence the Sub-dean, and the Head Master, at most five 
years and not more. 
33. The celebration of Divine Service 
. We will further that both teachers of-grammar shall be present 
in choir on feast-days clothed in garments befitting the choir; one of 
them having the seat in choir next above the minor canons; the other 
next after the minor canons. 
Moreover we will that the grammar boys who are maintained at the 
expense of the church shall be present in choir on feast-days, in a proper 
habit, and diligently do whatever duty is imposed on them by the 
Precentor; unless they have been otherwise directed by the Head 
Master. And these boys too we will shall on every day in the year 
when the sacred mysteries are performed at High Mass be present at 
the elevation of the body of the Lord, and stay there till the singing 
of the Agnus Dei is done; and meanwhile, two and two, meditate and 
say the Psalms “Have mercy on me, O Lord,” and “God, have mercy 
upon us,” and “O Lord Jesu Christ,” “Out of the deep I cried,” with 
the prayer ‘“‘Absolve, we beseech thee.” 
38. Alms and students 
The usual qualities which are found in an architect and other over- 
seers of works in pressing on their work, namely, industry and dili- 
gence, ought also to be found in pedagogues and teachers of the tender 
youth, that they may as it were enter into a friendly conspiracy and 
contention between themselves to imbue thoroughly the scholars com-, 
mitted to their trust with piety and good letters; and not to study their 
own advantage or indulge their own love of ease so much as to look 
to their proficiency and the public benefit, so that they may be seen 
to do their duty fairly in everything. And this they will be able to do 
much more successfully if they endeavor sedulously to follow the order 
we have prescribed. 
The whole number of the scholars shall be divided into five or six 
ranks or classes. The Under Master shall teach the three lower, and 
the Head Master the three upper classes. 
The Course of Study 
No one shall be admitted into the school who cannot read readily, or 
who does not know by heart in the vernacular the Lord’s Prayer, the 
Angelic Salutation, the Apostles’ Creed and the Ten Commandments. 
Those who are wholly ignorant of grammar shall learn the accidents 
of nouns and verbs, as it were out of class. When they have learnt 
these they shall be taken into the First Class. 
   
-P-A-G-E-292
266 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  In the First Class they shall learn thoroughly by heart the rudiments 
in English; they shall learn to put together the parts of speech; and to 
turn a short phrase of English into Latin; and gradually to approach 
other easy constructions. : 
In the Second Class they shall learn a little higher; they shall know 
the genders of nouns and the inflections of verbs written in Latin; they 
shall run through Cato’s: verses, Ausop’s Fables, and some familiar 
Colloquies. 
In the Third Class they shall endeavor to make right varyings on 
the nouns and anomalous verbs, so that no noun or verb may be found 
anywhere which they do not know how to inflect in every detail. 
In this form too they shall make Terence’s Comedies, Mantuanus’ 
Eclogues, and other things of that sort thoroughly familiar to them. 
These classes the Under Master shall take diligent care of, instilling 
and inculcating the lesser rudiments into his pupils so as to make them 
fit and prepared to receive higher instruction. 
The Under Master shall come into school at 6 A.m., and immedi- 
ately after saying the prayers to God which we have prescribed, shall 
make his scholars daily say by heart one of the eight parts of speech 
until they are ready in each. Nor shall he omit on any other day to 
dictate to his pupils an English sentence, and that a short one, which 
he shall teach them to turn exactly into Latin, and to write it carefully 
in their parchment note-books. 
In short, in anything to be done in the school the Under Master 
shall be subject to and shall obey the Head Master; and shall consult 
him on the method and plan of teaching; so that they may both agree 
in their great zeal for the profit of the scholars. Both too shall en- 
deavour to teach their pupils to speak openly, finely and distinctly, 
keeping due decorum both with their body and their mouth. 
In the Fourth Form the boys shall be taught to know the Latin syn- 
tax readily; and shall be practiced in the stories of poets, and familiar 
letters of learned men and the like. 
In the Fifth Form they shall commit to memory the Figures of Latin 
Oratory and the rules for making verses; and at the same time shall be 
practiced in making verses and polishing themes; then they shall be 
versed in translating the chastest Poets and the best Historians. 
Lastly, in the Sixth Form they shall be instructed in the formulas 
of “ Copiousness of Words and Things” written by Erasmus; and learn 
to make varyings of speech in every mood, so that they may acquire 
the faculty of speaking Latin, as far as is possible for boys. Mean- 
while they shall taste Horace, Cicero, and other authors of that class. 
Meanwhile they shall compete with one another in declamations so 
that they may leave well learned in the school of argument. 
These classes principally the Head Master shall try to polish in 
Latin.
-P-A-G-E-293

He shall come into school by 7 o’clock to perform his duty of teach- 
ing thoroughly. He too every other day shall ma 
tence into Latin and teach the flock committed to 
many forms. Moreover let him understand that 
whole school. 
So every week he ought to visit the whole flock, 
times, and diligently test the abilities of the sc ke some English sen- 
him to change it into 
he has charge of the 
once, twice, or three 
holars and ascertain 
their progress in learning. If he shall prove any of them, after testing 
them in every way, to be slow and wholly strangers to the Muses, he 
shall faithfully warn their friends not to let them, being wholly unfit 
for letters, waste their time in vain and fill the places of others. But 
those he shall find to be fit and industrious he shall, at least three times 
a year, call up to the higher forms, namely from the first to the second, 
from the second to the third, and so on as each shall be thought fit. 
This shall be done in the presence of and after consultation with the 
Under Master in the case of those who are entrusted to his care. 
Moreover at 6 p.m. the scholars shall return to school, and until 7 P.M. 
shall do their repetition and render to their fellow-pupils who have 
become ripe in learning, several masters also being present, whatever 
they have learnt through the day. 
When leave to play is given they shall play and sport together, lest, 
wandering about here and there, they incur some loss of character, and 
wanting to do other things their minds gradually become estranged 
from learning. And they shall not practice any games which are not 
of a gentlemanly appearance and free of all lowness. 
Lastly, whatever they are doing in earnest or in play they shall never 
use any language but Latin or Greek.   173. Origin of the English Poor Law of 1601 
(Nicholls, Sir George, History of the English Poor Law, vol. 1, pp. 192-93. 
London, 1860) 
The following selection, by the author of the standard history 
of English Poor-Law legislation, is of interest as revealing the 
gradual development of the idea of compulsory taxation for the 
care and education of the poor. On this precedent our early 
American educational legislation was based. 
The 43 Elizabeth was not, we have seen, the result of a sudden 
thought or a single effort, but was gradually framed upon the sure 
ground of experience; and it is curious to trace the successive steps by 
which its chief enactment, that of a compulsory assessment for the 
relief of the poor, came at length to be established. First, the poor 
were restricted from begging, except within certain specified limits. 
Next, the several towns, parishes, and hamlets were required to sup- 
port their poor by charitable alms, so that none of necessity might be 
 
-P-A-G-E-294

268 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
compelled “to go openly in begging,” and collections were to be made 
for them on Sundays, and the parson was to stir up the people to be 
bountiful in giving. Then houses and materials for setting the poor on 
work were to be provided by the charitable devotion of good people, and 
the minister was every Sunday specially to exhort the parishioners to 
contribute liberally. Next the collectors for the poor, on a certain Sun- 
day after divine service, were to set down in writing what each house- 
holder was willing to give weekly for the ensuing year; and if any 
should be obstinate and refuse to give, the minister was gently to ex- 
hort him, and, if he still refused, then to report him to the bishop, who 
was to send for and again gently exhort him; and if still refractory, the 
bishop was to certify the same to the justices in sessions, and bind him 
over to appear there, when the justices were once more gently to 
move and persuade him; and if he woyld not be persuaded, they were 
then to assess him in such sum as they thought reasonable. This pre- 
pared the way for the more general assessment authorized by 14 and 39 
Elizabeth, which again led to the complete and universal assessment 
of property established by the present Act (R. 174). 
174. The English Poor-Relief and Apprenticeship Law of 1601 
(43 Elizabeth, cap. 1.. Statutes at Large of England and Great Britain, 
vol. 1, pp. 603-04) 
This law marks the great turning point of English Poor-Law 
legislation, and is still the foundation of the English Poor-Law. 
It also contains the essential features embodied in subse- 
quent taxation for schools. Without the usual preamble, setting 
forth the evils to be corrected and the good expected from it, as 
in the case of most other Statutes, this one plunges at once into 
the matter at hand. The important sections of thé Act create a 
Board of Overseers of the Poor, give them the power of forcible 
taxation, empower them to apprentice certain children, and they 
may compel rich parishes to aid poor ones. The Act read as 
follows: 
AN ACT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE POOR 
I. Board of Overseers of the Poor created. Be it enacted by the Au- 
thority of this present Parliament, That the Churchwardens of every 
Parish, and Four, Three or Two substantial Householders there, as

more such Justices of Peace as is aforesaid, for setting to work the Chil-_ 
dren of all such whose Parents shall not by the said Churchwardens and

seers nominated as aforesaid, make and yield up to such Two Justices 
of Peace as is aforesaid, a true and perfect Account of all Sums of 
Money by them received, or rated and sessed and not received, and also 
of such Stock as shall be in their Hands, or in the Hands of any of the 
Poor to work, and of all other Things concerning their said Office; and 
such Sum or Sums of Money as shall be in their Hands shall pay and de- 
liver over to the said Churchwardens and Overseers newly nominated 
and appointedas aforesaid; upon Pain that every one of them absenting 
themselves, without lawful Cause as aforesaid, from such Monthly

  270 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
That if the said Justices of Peace do perceive that the Inhabitants of 
any Parish are not able to levy among themselves sufficient Sums of 
Money for the Purposes aforesaid, that then the said Two Justices 
shall and may tax, rate and assess as aforesaid any other of other Par- 
ishes, or out of any Parish, within the Hundred where the said Parish 
is, to pay such Sum or Sums of Money to the Churchwardens and Over- 
seers of the said poor Parish for the said purposes, as the said Justices 
shall think fit, according to the Intent of this Law: And if the said 
Hundred shall not be thought to the said Justices able and fit to relieve 
the said several Parishes not able to provide for themselves as afore- 
said, then the Justices of Peace at their General Quarter-Sessions, or the 
greater Number of them, shall rate and assess as aforesaid, any other of 
other Parishes, or out of any Parish, within the said County, for the 
Purposes aforesaid, as in their Discretion shall seem fit. 
IV. Enforcing the tax-levy. And that it shall be lawful, as well for 
the present as subsequent Churchwardens and Overseers, or any of

that shall refuse to contribute according as they shall be assessed, by 
Distress and Sale of the Offender’s Goods, as the Sums of Money or 
Stock which shall be behind upon any Account to be made as aforesaid, 
rendering to the Parties the Overplus; and in Defect of such Distress, it 
shall be lawful for any such Two Justices of the Peace to commit him 
or them to the Common Gaol of the County, there to remain without 
Bail or Mainprize until Payment of thesaid Sum, Arrearages and Stock; 
and the said Justices of Peace, or any one of them, to send to the House

Justices of Peace to commit to the said Prison every one of the said 
Churchwardens and Overseers which shall refuse to account, there to 
remain, without Bail or Mainprize, until he have made a true account, 
and satisfied and paid so much as upon the said Account shall be re- 
maining in his Hands. 
V. Apprenticing of children and erecting workhouses. And be it 
further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the said Churchwardens and 
Overseers, or the greater Part of them, by the Assent of any Two Jus- 
tices of the Peace aforesaid, to bind any such Children, as aforesaid, to 
be Apprentices, where they shall see convenient, till such Man Child 
shall come to the Age of Four and twenty Years, and such Woman 
Child to the Age of One and twenty Years, or the time of her Marriage; 
the same to be as effectual to all purposes, as if such Child were of full 
Age, and by Indenture of Covenant bound him or herself. And to the 
Intent that necessary Places of Habitation may more conveniently be

their Parish is or shall be parcel, and upon Agreement before with him 
or them made in Writing, under the Hands and Seals of the said Lord 
or Lords, or otherwise, according to any Order to be set down by the 
Justices of Peace of the said County at their General Quarter-Ses- 
sions, or the greater Part of them, by like leave and Agreement of the 
said Lord or Lords in Writing under his or their Hands and Seals, to 
erect, build and set up in fit and convenient Places of Habitation in 
such Waste or Common, at the general Charges of the Parish, or other- 
wise of the Hundred or County, as aforesaid, to be taxed, rated and 
gathered in manner before expressed, convenient Houses of Dwelling 
for the said impotent Poor; and also to place Inmates, or more Families 
than one in one Cottage or House; one Act made in the one and thir- 
tieth of her Majesty’s Reign, intituled, An Act against the erecting and 
maintaining of Cottages, or any Thing therein contained to the contrary 
notwithstanding: Which Cottages and Places for Inmates shall not at 
any Time after be used or employed to or for any other Habitation, but 
only for Impotent and Poor of the same Parish, that shall be there 
placed from Time to Time by the Churchwardens and Overseers of the 
Poor of the same Parish, or the most Part of them, upon the Pains and 
Forfeitures contained in the said former Act made in the said One and 
thirtieth Year of her Majesty’s Reign. 
VI. Appeal from decisions. Provided always, That if any Person or 
Persons shall find themselves grieved with any Sess or Tax, or other Act 
done by the said Churchwardens and other Persons, or by the said Jus- 
tices of Peace, that then it shall be lawful for the Justices of Peace, at 
their General Quarter-Sessions, or the greater Number of them, to take 
such Order therein, as to them shall be thought convenient; and the 
same to conclude and bind all the said Parties.

  CHAPTER XIV 
EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE PROTESTANT 
REVOLTS 
II. CALVINISTS AND CATHOLICS 
Tue Readings in this chapter illustrate the development of edu- 
cation, following the Protestant Revolt, among the Calvinists and 
the Catholics. 
Geneva, in Switzerland, from 1541 to 1565, during the control 
of Calvin, was the Rome of Protestantism. Calvin established 
there a typical Calvinistic college, of which there were many 
others in France, leading to the Huguenot universities there main- 
tained. Selection 175 gives an outline of the course of study pro- 
vided.at Geneva, and shows how closely humanism and a reformed 
religion were associated in northern lands. 
The interest of the Calvinistic Dutch in education is well set 
forth in the scheme of education adopted, in 1618, at the Synod 
of Dort (176), and the work of the Dutch in developing schools 
(177) and the character of the schools developed (178) are well 
set forth by the selections reproduced. The great educational 
law among the followers of John Knox, the Scotch Presbyterians, 
is reproduced in the next selection (179). 
The documents for the Catholics are long, and usually enter 
into minute detail as to the purpose and nature of the school or- 
ganization to be provided. The two most important were the 
Ratio Studiorwm of the Jesuits, concerning which a brief historical 
statement is inserted (180), the document itself being too long to 
reproduce; and the Rules framed by La Salle for his teaching or- 
ganization, the Brothers of the Christian Schools. The more im- 
portant educational regulations from the latter are reproduced 
in 182. Reading 181 is descriptive of the seventeenth-century 
religious purpose which dominated the education of girls in Cath- 
olic lands. 
175. Course of Study at the College of Geneva 
(Digest from Woodward, W. H., Studies in Education during the Renaissance, 
pp. 159-60. Cambridge, 19¢6) 
The following abstract of the course of study in the Collége de 
la Rive, at Geneva, as set forth in the Constitution of 1559, is that
-P-A-G-E-299

of the famous public school there which was inspired and gov- 
erned by Calvin himself. Like other Protestant foundations in 
northern lands, this shows clearly the influence of the Italian 
revival and the introduction of the humanistic learning. The 
school had seven classes, the seventh being the lowest. The work 
of each class was as follows: ‘ 
Class VII. In this class the pupils will learn the letters, and write 
them to form syllables, using a Latin-French reading book. ‘ Reading 
French, and afterwards Latin from a French-Latin Catechism. Draw- 
ing, and writing letters of the alphabet. 
Class VI. Declensions and conjugations are begun; these eceiny 
the first half year. Parts of speech learnt in French and Latin; more 
practice in hand-writing. Easy Latin sentences learnt orally, and 
tepeated as practice in conversation. 
Class V. Parts of speech finished: elements of syntax: the Eclogues 
of Vergil read: first steps in written Latin composition: Latin and 
French employed side by side. 
Class IV. Latin syntax continued. Cicero’s Letters begun; compo- 
sition exercises are based on these. Prosody, with reading of Ovid in 
illustration. Greek begun; declension and conjugation; elementary 
construing. 
Class III. Greek Grammar systematically learnt, with comparison 
of the two languages. Cicero, — Letters, De Amicitia, De Senectute, — 
these treatises to be turned into Greek. The 4ineid, Cesar, and Isoc- 
rates read. 
Class II. Chief stress laid upon reading: — Livy, Xenophon, Polyb- 
ius, Herodian and Homer. Logic begun: — propositions, syllogism; 
to be illustrated from Cicero’s orations.. Once a week the Gospel nar- 
rative in Greek. 
Class I. Logic systematically taught from approved compendium 
(such as Melanchthon’s); the elements of rhetoric in connection with 
it, and elocution. The whole doctrine of rhetoric illustrated from 
Cicero’s speeches, and from Demosthenes (the Olynthiacs and Phi- 
lippigs). Homer and Vergil also analysed for: rhetorical purposes. 
Two original “declamationes” are prepared monthly. Once a week 
an Epistle of Saint Paul or other apostle is read in Greek. 
The choice of authors and the place of logic deserve attention, not 
less than the acceptance of the vernacular in junior classes. 
176. Scheme of Christian Education adopted at the Synod of Dort 
(Scheme as adopted, November 30, 1618; trans. by Barnard, in American Journal 
of Education, vol. v, pp. 77-78) 
The Dutch Synod of Dort (1618-19) on November 30, 1618, 
adopted a regulation for the Christian education of children and 
 
-P-A-G-E-300

youth, jointly in the family, the school, and the church, as follows: 
In order that the Christian youth may be diligently instructed in the 
principles of religion, and be trained in piety, three modes of cate- 
chising should be employed. I. IN tHE House, By Parents. II. IN 
THE ScHOOLS, BY ScHootmasteRS. III. IN tHe Cuurcues, By MIN- 
ISTERS, ELDERS, AND CATECHISTS, ESPECIALLY APPOINTED FOR THE 
PURPOSE. That these may diligently employ their trust, the Christian 
magistrates shall be requested to promote, by their authority, so sa- 
cred and necessary a work; and all who have the oversight of churches 
and schools shall be tequired to pay special attention to this matter. 
I. Parents. The office of PARENTS is diligently to instruct their 
children and their whole household in the principles of the Christian 
religion, in a manner adapted to their respective capacities; earnestly

and carefully to admonish them to the cultivation of true piety; to 
engage their punctual attendance on family worship, and take them 
with them to the hearing of the Word of God. They should require 
their children to give an account of the sermons they hear, especially 
those on the Catechism; assign them*some chapters of Scripture to 
read, and certain passages to commit to memory; and then impress and
-P-A-G-E-301
  RESULTS AMONG CALVINISTS 275 
illustrate the truths contained in them in a familiar manner, adapted to 
the tenderness of youth. Thus they are to prepare them for being 
catechised in the schools, and by attendance on these to encourage 
them and promote their edification. Parents are to be exhorted to the 
faithful discharge of this duty, by the public preaching of the Word; 
but specially at the ordinary period of family visitation, previous to 
the administration of the Lord’s Supper; and also at other times by the 
minister, elders, etc. Parents who profess religion, and are negligent 
in this work, shall be faithfully admonished by the ministers; and, if 
the case requires it, they shall be censured by the Consistory, that they 
may be brought to the discharge of their duty. 
II. Scuoors. Schools, in which the young shall be properly in- 
structed in the principles of Christian doctrine, shall be instituted, not 
only in cities but also in towns and country places where heretofore 
none have existed. The Christian magistracy shall be requested that 
well-qualified persons may be employed and enabled to devote them- 
selves to the service; and especially that the children of the poor may be 
gratuitously instructed, and not bé excluded from the benefit of the 
schools. In this office none shall be employed but such as are members 
of the Reformed Church, having certificates of an upright faith and 
pious life, and of being well versed in the truths of the Catechism. 
They are to sign a document, professing their belief in the Confession 
of Faith and the Heidelberg Catechism, and promising that they will 
give catechetical instruction to the youth in the principles of Christian 
truth according to the same. The schoolmasters shall instruct their 
scholars according to their age and capacity, at least two days in the 
week, not only causing them to commit to memory, but also by in- 
stilling into their minds an acquaintance with the truths of the Cate- 
chism. (An elementary small Catechism, the Compendium, and. the 
Heidelberg Catechism, are those specified to be used by the different 
grades of children and youth.) The schoolmasters shall take care 
not only that the scholars commit these Catechisms to memory, but 
that they shall suitably understand the doctrines contained in them. 
For this purpose, they shall suitably explain to every one, in a manner 
adapted to his capacity, and frequently inquire if they understand 
them. The schoolmasters shall bring every cne of the pupils com- 
mitted to their charge to the hearing of the preached Word, and par- 
ticularly the preaching on:the Catechism, and require from them an 
account of the same. 
III. MryisteRtAt SuPERVISION. In order that due knowledge may 
be obtained of the diligence of the schoolmasters, and the improvement 
of the youth, it shall be the duty of the Masters, wiTH AN ELDER, and, 
if necessary, with a magistrate, to visit all the schools, private as well 
as public, frequently, in order to excite the teachers to earnest diligence, 
to encourage and counsel them in the duty of catechising, and to fur-
-P-A-G-E-302
Ce eo erererrmr ee Tl 
276 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
nish an example by questioning them, addressing them in a friendly 
and affectionate manner, and exciting them to early piety and dili- 
gence. If any of the schoolmasters should be found neglectful or per- 
verse, they shall be earnestly admonished by the ministers, and, if 
necessary, by the Consistory, in relation to their office. The ministers, 
in the discharge of their public duty in the Church, shall preach on the 
Catechism. These sermons shall be comparatively short, and accom- 
modated, as far as practicable, to the comprehension of children as 
well as adults. The labors of those ministers will be praiseworthy who 
diligently search out country places, and see that catechetical in- 
struction be supplied and faithfully preserved. Experience teaches 
that the ordinary instruction of the Church, catechetical and other, is 
not sufficient for many, to instill that knowledge of the Christian reli- 
gion which should, among the people of God, be well grounded; and 
also testifies that the living voice has very great influence; that familiar 
and suitable questions and answers, adapted to the apprehension of 
each individual, is the best mode of catechising, in order to impress the 
principles of religion upon the heart. It shall be the duty of a minister 
to go, with an elder, to all capable of instruction, and collect them in 
their houses, the Consistory chamber, or some other suitable place, 
(a number particularly of those more advanced in years,) and explain 
familiarly to them, the articles of the Christian faith, and catechise 
them according to the circumstances of their different capacities, prog- 
ress, and knowledge. They shall question them on the matter of the 
public sermons on the Catechism. Those who desire to unite with the 
Church shall, three or four weeks before the administration of the 
Lord’s Supper, be more carefully and frequently instructed, that they 
may be better qualified, and be more free to give a satisfactory account 
of their faith. The ministers shall employ diligent care to ascertain 
those who give any hopeful evidence of serious concern for the salvation 
of their soul, and invite them to them; assembling those together who 
have like impressions, and encouraging to friendly intercourse and free 
conversation with each other. These meetings shall commence with ap- 
propriate prayer and exhortation. If all this shall be done by the minis- 
ters with that cordiality, faithfulness, zeal, and discretion that become 
those that must give an account of the flock committed to their charge, 
it is not to be doubted that in a short time abundant fruit of their 
labors shall be found in growth in religious knowledge, and holiness 
of life, to the glory of God, and the prosperity of the Church of Christ. 
177. Work of the Dutch in developing Schools 
(Kilpatrick, Wm. H., The Dutch Schools of New Netherland and Colonial New York, 
pp. 19-21. Washington, 1912) 
The following extract from Dr. Kilpatrick’s excellent study of 
the work of the Dutch in developing schools gives a good picture 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  RESULTS AMONG CALVINISTS 277 
of what was done in the Netherlands, during the time that coun- 
try was at the zenith of its prosperity and greatness as a nation. 
Among the institutions carried to the New World, few, if any, had 
deeper roots in the life of the Dutch than church and school. Devo- 
tion to the principles of the reformed religion had been, in great degree, 
the secret of the long and stubborn opposition to Spanish oppression. 
That same devotion had been the greatest single force in creating the 
new commonwealth. As a most important means of fixing and pre- 
serving the reformed faith, the parochial school had become an indis- 
pensable part of the organization of the new church. Interwoven thus 
with the very life of the church was a school system in which the school- 
master was an officer in the church, and the curriculum of the school 
included conscious preparation for participation in the service of the 
public worship. 
How the school came to occupy this unique relationship to the 
church can here be told only in barest outline, since the account of it 
would be the story of the growth of the church itself. Even before the 
reformers could assemble openly in the Netherlands, the first national 
synod of the Dutch Church, held ‘‘in exile” at Wezel, in 1568, had seen 
the strategic value of the parochial school. Music, it declared, must be 
introduced into the church schools, of which some were already in exist- 
ence. Schoolmasters as well as parents must train the children in the 
catechism. Deacons were specifically charged with “the care and 
founding of schools”; and schoolmasters were reckoned along with the 
. ministers, elders, and deacons as “public persons” of the church. The 
second national synod at Emden, in 1571, likewise ‘“‘in exile,” to the 
same end, required all classes in their regular meetings, to ask of each 
church “whether the care of the poor and of schools is maintained.” 
The provincial Synod of Dort (1574), the first on Netherland soil, 
treated schools in yet greater detail, emphasizing, among other things, 
the careful selection by the church of proper places for schools, ade- 
quate salaries for schoolmasters to be furnished by the secular authori- 
‘ties, and subscription to the creed by all schoolmasters. Limitations 
of space forbid the presentation of all the acts relating to schools of the 
successive national synods. The Synods of Dort (1578), Middelburg 
(1581), and The Hague (1586), all treated of schools and of the duty of 
the church to support them. The great Synod of Dort (1618-19), as 
the last of the national synods, gave final form to the creed and practice 
of the Dutch Reformed Church. In the matter of schools, it substan- 
tially summed up the preceding synodal enactments. Schools must be 
instituted in country places, towns, and cities. Religious instruction 
must be given. The Christian magistracy should see to it that well- 
qualified persons taught, with suitable compensation. The children of 
the poor should be instructed free. In all schools only orthodox Chris-   
   
-P-A-G-E-304

tians might teach. To secure these ends suitable means of church in- 
spection of schools were devised. By the-time of this synod the church 
had not only thoroughly organized its system of parochial schools, but 
  
  Fic. 38. A Dutcu ScHooL OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
through the requirement of creed subscription had reached out its hand 
to all educational institutions of whatever grade. 
But it must not be supposed that the Church alone was interested in 
education. From an early date the Dutch had taken an increasing in- 
terest in the public control and support of education. In Haarlem the 
“city school” existed certainly as early as 1461. In the same city, in 
1522, we find the burgomasters guaranteeing a salary of 200 carolus 
guilders to the rector of the school. The Hague in 1536 had a “great 
school” with a rector and three masters, supported in part by a per” 
capita levy of 2 carolus guilders upon all the pupils in the private 
schools of the city. To this income the city added for the rector “a 
yearly pension of four or five great pounds.” Utrecht, both city and 
Province, may be taken as typical of public secular interest in schools. 
As early as 1522 is found a payment by the municipal authorities to the 
“rector scolarium” on account of a chorus. In 1567 the city paid an 
item of 4 pounds for “the benches for the school children in Jesus 
School.’”’ Some years later a similar appropriation was made for the 
free instruction of poor young children. In 1576 it was resolved by the 
city thenceforth to maintain the Saint Jerome School “with adequate 
salaries.” Numerous records of instructions issued in the seventeenth

century to rectors and masters of this school give a very good account 
of the inner working of the Latin school among the Dutch of that pe- 
riod. A church order for the whole Province of Utrecht was issued in 
1590, and another in 1612. In the latter were included directions for 
schools, schoolmasters, and sextons. Schools of four kinds were recog- 
nized, public or trivial, parochial, private, and schools for the country 
districts. The selection of instructors, the fixing of curricula, and the 
general supervision were given to the municipal authorities, with vary- 
ing degrees of participation in control granted to the church. In 1644 
the city of Utrecht adopted a detailed plan for the free instruction of 
the poor by apportioning them among its four parochial schools. The 
country schools of the Province were regulated separately in an order of 
18 sections, issued in 1654, one of the best available accounts of Dutch 
school management of the seventeenth century. In matters of educa- 
tion, there is no reason to suppose that Utrecht was in advance of other 
Provinces of the United Netherlands. Before the Reformation public 
schools were found in individual cities. Beginning about 1580 the Prov- 
inces took up the work, making general regulations for the control of 
schools everywhere. By the middle of the seventeenth century the 
whole country.— rural districts as well as cities and towns — appears 
to have been well provided with schools of various grades, controlled 
and often also supported by the public secular authorities. 
178. Character of the Dutch Schools of 1650, as shown by the 
Textbooks used 
(Kilpatrick, Wm. H., The Dutch Schools of New Netherland and Colonial New York, 
p. 34. Washington, 1912) 
The great purpose of all vernacular schooling, following the 
Reformation, was the teaching of religion. The ordinary sub- 
jects of the elementary school were taught from books the content 
of which was almost entirely religious. This may be illustrated 
by the following list and description of the texts adopted for the 
Dutch province of Utrecht, in 1650. 
The textbooks used in the better elementary schools are probably 
pretty well represented by the list officially promulgated at Utrecht, 
in 1650.

De sendbrieven van de nieuwe editie met eenige stichtelyke dichten 
daar achter. 
The first three of these are sufficiently indicated by their translated 
titles: The Great and Small A B C Book, the Heidelberg Catechism, 
and the Gospels and Epistles. The alphabet books were generally 
called “cock books,” from the picture of a crowing cock found thereon. 
On the title page of one of these appeared: 
“We must know the alphabet very well 
Before we can readily read any book.” 
In addition to the alphabet, these books contained the Lord’s 
Prayer, the commandments, and the prayers. The Heidelberg Cate- 
chism was the authoritative catechism of the Reformed Dutch Church. 
The Gospels and the Epistles served as a reading book. “De Trap der 
Jeugt”’ means literally “The Stairway of Youth,’ but the writer has 
not been able to find any indication of its contents. The Proverbs of 
Solomon is again a reading book. ‘De Spiegel der Jeugt,” literally 
“The Mirror of Youth,” treated of the wars of the Dutch people. “De 
Sendbrieven,” etc., are the Epistles of the New Testament. 
179. The Scotch School Law of 1646 
(Acts of Parliaments of Scotland, 11 Februarii, 1646. Repori of Record Commission, 
vol. VI, p. 216) 
The Reformation in Scotland dates from 1560. In 1616 the 
Privy Council ordered each church parish to assume the obliga- 
tion of supporting a school. This was ratified by an Act of the 
Scotch Parliament in 1633, and in 1646 more definite legislation 
was approved, the important portions of which read: 
The Estates of Parliament now conveened, in the fifth session of this 
first Triennall Parliament, Considering how prejudiciall the want of 
Schools in many congregations hath been, and how beneficiall the 
founding thereof in every congregation will be to this Kirk and King- 
dom; Do therefore Statute and Ordain, That there be a Schoole 
founded, and a Schoole master appointed in every Parish (not already 
provided) by advice of the Presbyterie: And to this purpose, that the 
Heritors in every congregation meet among themselves, and provide a 
commodious house for a Schoole, and modifie a stipend to the Schoole 
master, which shall not be under Ane hundred Merks, nor above Tua 
hundred Merks, to be paid yeerly at two Terms: And to this effect that 
they set down a stent upon every ones rent of stock and teind in the 
Parish, proportionally to the worth thereof, for maintenance of the 
Schoole, and payment of the Schoole masters stipend; Which stipend 
is declared to be due to the Schoole masters by and attour the casuali-

ties which formerly belonged to Readers and Clerks of Kirk Sessions. 
And if the Heritors shall not conveene, or being conveened shall not 
agree amongst themselves, Then, and in that case the Presbyterie shall 
nominate twelve honest men within the bounds of the Presbyterie, who 
shall have power to establish a Schoole, modifie a stipend for the 
Schoole master, with the latitude before expressed, and set down a 
stent for payment thereof upon the Heritors, which shall be as valide 
and effectuall as if the same had been done by the Heritors themselves. 
180. The Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits 
(Pachtler, G. M., Ratio Studiorum; in Monumenta Germania Pedagogica, 4 vols. 
Berlin, 1886-1900) 
Great care was exercised by the Jesuits in working out their 
outlines of instruction, known as the Ratio Studiorum. The So- 
ciety was sanctioned in 1540, and the first Constitution of the 
Order was issued that year. The first edition of the Ratio, how- 
ever, was not issued until 1586, and this was subject to experiment 
and trial until 1599, when the final Ratio was issued. This then 
remained unchanged until 1832, when some modern studies were 
added. 
Their schools were divided into two courses, the studia in- 
feriora, covering six years, beginning at about the age of ten; and 
the studia superiora, or philosophical course, covering two to 
three years, A theological course of four to six years completed 
the program. For all these years the Ratio made detailed provi- 
sion; allowed for the adjustment of the instruction to meet local 
needs; enjoined the use of Latin as the language of the classroom 
and the school; regulated the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly 
programs of work; provided for the careful regulation of the lives 
of the students; declared Saint Thomas Aquinas the true teacher 
to be followed; and instructed the teachers to draw their history 
from unadulterated sources, to defend the Vulgate Bible, and to 
refute the errors of all other translations. 
A brief digest of the 1686 edition may be found in Barnard’s 
American Journal of Education, vol. xxvii, pp. 165-75; and a digest 
of the more important educational regulations of the 1699 edition 
in F. V. N. Painter’s Great Pedagogical Essays (American Book 
Company, New York, 1905), pp. 188-202. Both are too long to

181. The Dominant Religious Purpose in the Education of 
French Girls 
(Gréard, V. C. O., Mémoire sur Venseignement secondaire des filles, p. 55; trans. by 
Compayré) 
The following description of the oversight of the education of 
girls at Port Royal (1643-60), which bears on the training of girls 
generally in the seventeenth century, reveals something of the 
intense religious nature of school and conventual education of 
that time. The chief education of girls in Catholic lands was 
given in the convents, where the emphasis was laid on preparation 
for another world than this. 
A strange emotion, even at the distance of centuries, is caused by 
the sight of those children keeping silent or speaking in a whisper from 
rising till retiring, never walking except between two nuns, one in front 
and the other behind, in order to make it impossible, by slackening 
their pace on the pretext of some indisposition, for them to hold any 
communication; working in such a way as never to be in companies of 
two or three; passing from meditation to prayer, and from prayer to 
instruction; learning, beside the catechism, nothing but reading and 
writing; and, on Sunday, “a little arithmetic, the older from one to 
two o’clock, and the younger from two to half past two”; the hands 
always busy to prevent the mind from wandering; but without being 
able to become attached to their work, which would please God as 
much the more as it pleased themselves the less; opposing all their 
natural inclinations, and despising the attentions due the body “des- 
tined to serve as food for worms’’; doing nothing, in a word, except in 
the spirit of mortification. Imagine those days of fourteen and sixteen 
hours, slowly succeeding one another, and weighing down on the heads 
of those poor little sisters, for six or eight years in that dreary solitude, 
where there was nothing to bring in the stir of life, save the sound of the 
bell announcing a change of exercise or of penance, and you will com- 
prehend Fénelon’s feeling of sadness when he speaks of the shadows 
of that deep cavern in which was imprisoned and, as it were, buried 
the youth of girls. 
182. Rules of the Order ‘‘ Brothers of the Christian Schools ” 
(From The Conduct of Schools, 1811 edition; trans. by Barnard, in American Journal 
of Education, vol. Xxx, pp. 930-31) 
The Conduct of Schools, based on rules originally drawn up by 
La Salle in 1681, and originally issued in 1720, was to this Order 
what the Ratio Studiorum was to the Jesuits. The details were 
so wisely drawn that but little change is noted between the 1720 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  RESULTS AMONG CATHOLICS 283 
and the 1811 editions. Perhaps the most important occurs in 
regulation 20, in which Latin, for the more advanced pupils, is 
added to the original instruction in French 
alone. The more important regulations 
relating to the school work are as follows: 
1. The Institution des Fréres des Ecoles 
Chrétiennes is a society which professes to 
conduct schools gratuitously. The design of 
this institution is to give a Christian educa- 
tion to children. With this object in view, 
the Fréres conduct schools where children 
may be placed under the management of mas- 
ters from morning until evening, so that the 
masters may be able to teach them to live 
honestly and uprightly, by instructing them 
in the principlesof our holy religion, by teach- Fyg, 39. J. B.pE LA SALLE 
ing them Christian precepts, and by giving (1651-1719) 
them suitable and sufficient instruction. 
2. The spirit of the institution is a spirit of faith which ought to 
encourage its members to attribute all to God, to act as continually 
in the sight of God, and in perfect conformity, to His orders and His 
will. The members of this association should be filled with an ardent 
zeal for the instruction of children, for their preservation in innocence 
and the fear of God, and for their entire separation from sin. 
  19. The Fréres shall instruct their pupils after the method prescribed 
to them by the institution. 
20. They shall teach their scholars to read French and Latin, and 
to write. 
21. They shall teach them also orthography, and arithmetic, the 
matins and vespers, le Pater, l’Ave Maria, le Credo et le Confiteor, and 
the French translations of these prayers, the Commandments of God 
and of the Church, the responses of the holy mass, the Catechism, the 
duties of a Christian, and the maxims and precepts that our Lord has 
left us in the holy Testament. 
22. They shall teach the Catechism half an hour daily. 
27. The Fréres shall not receive from the scholars, or their parents, 
either money or any other present, at any time. 
30. They shall exhibit an equal affection for all their poor scholars, 
and more for the poor than for the rich; because the object of the in- 
stitution is the instruction of the poor. 
31. They shall endeavor to give their pupils, by their conduct and 
manners, a continual example of modesty, and of all the other virtues 
which they ought to be taught, and which they ought to practice.  
-P-A-G-E-310
  ‘284. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
37. The Fréres shall take the greatest care that they very rarely 
punish their children, as they ought to be persuaded that, by refraining 
as much as possible from punishment, they will best succeed in prop- 
erly conducting a school, and in establishing order in it. 
38. When punishment shall have become absolutely necessary, they 
shall take the greatest care to punish with the greatest moderation and 
presence of mind, and never to do it under the influence of a hasty 
movement, or when they feel irritated. 
39. They shall watch over themselves that they never exhibit the 
least anger or impatience, either in their corrections, or in any of their 
words or actions; as they ought to be convinced, that if they do not 
take these precautions the scholars will not profit from their correction, 
(and the Fréres ought never to correct except with the object of bene- 
fiting their children) and God will not give the correction His blessing. 
40. They shall not at any time give to their scholars any injurious 
epithet or insulting name. 
41. They shall also take the greatest care not to strike their scholars 
with hand, foot, or stick, nor to push them rudely. 
42. They shall take great care not to pull their ears, their hair, or 
their noses, nor to fling any thing at them; these kinds of corrections 
ought not to be practiced by the Fréres, as they are very indecent 
and opposed to charity and Christian kindness. 
43. They shall not correct their scholars during prayers, or at the 
time of catechising, except when they cannot defer the correction. 
44. They shall not use corporal punishment, except when every 
other means of correction has failed to produce the right effect. 
58. The Frére-director shall be inspector over all the schools in his 
town; and when more than one inspector is necessary for one house of 
Fréres, the other inspector shall report to the Frére-director twice a 
week on the conduct of each Frére, on the condition of his class, and 
on the progress of his scholars.

  CHAPTER XV 
EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF THE PROTESTANT 
REVOLT 
III]. THE REFORMATION AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 
TuE Readings contained in this chapter illustrate the period of 
transplanting the characteristic European institutions, forms of 
government, and religious attitudes to American shores. The 
settlement of America was in large part a phase of the movement 
of Protestant sects to the new world to establish there homes 
and churches where they might enjoy a degree of religious free- 
dom not possible in the old home-lands. Each sect or nationality 
so migrating to America took with it the characteristic forms of 
church and school observances known in the old home-lands, and 
these were faithfully reproduced in the new colonies. As a result 
we find established in America, in the seventeenth century, the 
main types of schools existing-at the time of the migration in the 
mother-land from which the settlers came. They were also dom- 
inated by the same deep religious purpose as the home-land 
schools. 
The first selection (183) reveals the Puritan attitude, and shows 
one reason why they desired to go somewhere where they could 
rear their children amid better surroundings. The second (184) 
describes their leaving England for Holland, and exhibits the 
motives which eventually led them to emigrate to America. Once 
on American soil their deep solicitude for education showed itself 
in the founding of an English-type college (185), for which rules 
and requirements, typical of the time, were drawn up (186 a-d), 
and to which the customary European privileges (187) were 
granted. They also showed their interest in education in the 
creation of typical English-type Latin grammar schools in the 
new towns they founded, as is shown by the agreement (188) for 
the founding of the grammar school at Roxbury, Massachu- 
setts, and the rules for the government of the grammar school at 
New Haven (189). 
Still more, finding that some parents and masters of appren- 
tices were negligent, the Massachusetts Bay Puritans enacted the
-P-A-G-E-312
  286 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
two famous laws of 1642 (190) and 1647 (191), laws which laid 
the foundations upon which state school systems in the United 
States have since been created. Selection 192 shows how the 
courts compelled the towns to enforce these laws for schools. Tops- 
field, Massachusetts, here being cited for violating the Law of 
1642. These laws deeply influenced legislation in the other Puri- 
tan colonies of New England, the Connecticut Law of 1650 (193) 
being clearly inspired by the two Massachusetts laws, and the 
Plymouth Colony legislation (194 a-d) also showing clear evi- 
dence of.similar inspiration. 
The Calvinistic Dutch, who settled New Amsterdam and sur- 
rounding places, also brought tc the new world the practices of 
their home-land, setting up here Dutch parochial schools which 
were clearly copies of those at home. The character of the home 
schools is shown by selections 176-78, given in the preceding 
chapter, and in. this chapter are reproduced selections (195, 196) 
which indicate the nature of the instruction given and the com- 
bined church-and-school duties of the teacher. We here see the 
elementary teacher in the process of being evolved from the 
church precentor and sexton fo the Middle Ages. 
In the central colonies the different sects established church 
schools of the types known at home, and assumed the regular 
home attitude toward schools and learning. The selection from 
the rules of discipline of the Quakers (199) reveals their attitude, 
and the minutes from the proceedings of the governing council 
(198) reproduce the order creating the first school in Philadel- 
phia, the year the colony was settled. Selection 197 gives the 
law regarding the establishment of schools proposed by the 
Quaker governors for the colony, but which was so contrary to 
all English precedents that it was vetoed by William and Mary. 
In all the colonies another typical English educational idea was 
set up — that of the apprenticing of orphans and poor children 
to learn a trade, and to be taught to read and write and to be 
instructed in religion. In the Puritan colonies this was purely 
supplemental to the creation of schools, but in Virginia and the 
southern colonies it for long formed almost the only type of edu- 
cation provided. The chief Virginia laws relating to the appren- 
ticing of the children of the poor and vagrant and dissolute young 
people are given in selection 200 a, and three extracts from North
-P-A-G-E-313
  RESULTS IN AMERICA 287 
Carolina court records are given in selection 200 b. Selection 201 
reproduces a Massachusetts apprenticeship agreement of 1727. 
Selection 202 gives a digest of the most celebrated school text- 
book used in the colonies, The New England Primer. For a cen- 
tury and a half this was the important introductory school reading 
book in all the non-Anglican American colonies. 
183. The Puritan Attitude 
(Josiah Nichols, ‘“‘The Plea for the Innocent”; a pamphlet of 1602. From Han- 
bury’s Historical Memorials, vol. 1, p. 3) 
The following selection gives a good idea as to the Puritan atti- 
tude toward the character of the Reformation which had taken 
place in England, and the Puritan demand for further improve- 
ments in Christian life and in church oversight of the morals of 
the people. 
In the beginning of her Majesty’s most happy reign, the gospel being 
published and preachers ordained to teach the people, many people, 
within a while feeling some taste of the heavenly comfort, began to 
delight in hearing of sermons, singing of psalms, in reading, and godly 
talk of Holy Scriptures which they were taught; and therewithal did 
somewhat refrain profane and unprofitable customs; and sometimes 
they admonished their neighbors if they did swear, and pray them to 
go with them to the sermon; the greater sort of the people, being old 
barrels which could hold no new wine, addicted partly to popery and 
partly to licentiousness, having many of them no other God but their 
bellies, would deride and scoff at them, and called them “holy breth- 
ren” and “holy sisters”; saying, “He is one of the pure and unspotted 
brethren!” 
184. The Puritans leave England 
‘(William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation. Reprint, Boston, 1856) 
The following extracts from the History by Governor Bradford 
(1590-1657) cover the period from the beginnings of the persecu- 
tions of the Separatists, as those who did not conform to the 
practices of the Church of England were termed, through the 
period of their exile in Holland, and show the motives which 
finally induced them to emigrate to America. 
But, after these things, they could not long continue in any peaceable 
condition; but were hunted and persecuted on every side; so as their 
former afflictions were but as flea-bitings in comparison of these which 
now came upon them. For some were taken and clapt up in prison. 
‘
-P-A-G-E-314
  288 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Others had their houses beset and watched, night and day; and hardly 
escaped their hands: and the most were fain to fly and leave their 
houses and habitations, and the means of their livelihood. Yet these 
and many other sharper things which afterwards befell them were no 
other than they looked for; and therefore were they the better pre- 
pared to bear them by the assistance of God’s grace and spirit. 
Yet seeing themselves molested; and that there was no hope of their 
continuance there as a church; by a joint consent, they resolved to go 
into the Low Countries, where they heard was freedom of religion for 
all men; as also how sundry, from London and other parts of the land 
of England, had been exiled and persecuted for the same cause, and 
were gone thither, and lived at Amsterdam and in other places of the 
land of Holland. 
So, after they had continued together about a year; and kept their 
meetings every Sabbath in one place or another, exercising the worship 
of God amongst themselves, notwithstanding all the diligence and 
malice of their adversaries; they, seeing they could no longer continue 
in that condition, resolved to get over in Holland as they could. 
Which was in the years 1607 and 1608... . 
Being now come into the Low Countries, they saw many goodly and 
fortified cities strongly walled and guarded with troops of armed men. 
Also they heard a strange and uncouth language; and beheld the dif- 
ferent manners and customs of the people, with their strange fash- 
ions and attires; all so far differing from their plain country villages, 
wherein they were bred and had lived so long, as it seemed they had 
come into a new world. ... 
And when they had lived at Amsterdam about a year, Master Rob- 
inson, their pastor, and some others of best discerning, seeing how 
Master John Smith and his company were already falling into conten- 
tion with the church that was there before them; and no means they 
could use, would do any good to cure the same: and also that the 
flames of contention were likely to break out in the ancient church 
itself, as afterwards lamentable came to pass. 
For these, and some other reasons, they removed to Leyden, a fair 
and beautiful city, and of a sweet situation: but made more famous by 
the university wherewith it is adorned: in which, of late, has been so 
many learned men. But wanting that traffic by sea which Amsterdam 
enjoys, it was not so beneficial for their outward means of living and 
estates. But being now here pitched, they fell to such trades and im- 
ployments as they best could; valuing peace and their spiritual com- 
fort above any other riches whatsoever; and at length they came to 
raise a competent and comfortable living; but with hard and continual

society and spiritual comfort together in the ways of God, under the 
able ministry and prudent government of Master John Robinson and 
Master William Brewster, who was an assistant unto him, in the place 
of an elder, unto which he was now called and chosen by the church. 
So as they grew in knowledge and other gifts and graces of the spirit 
of God, and lived together in peace and love and holiness. 
And many came unto them, from divers parts of England; so as they 
grew to a great congregation. ... 
Our reverend pastor, Master John Robinson of late memory; and 
our grave elder, Master William Brewster, now both at rest with the 
Lord; considering, amongst many other inconveniences; how hard the 
country was where we lived; how many spent their whole estate in it, © 
and were forced to return for England; how grievous it was to live 
from under the protection of the state of England; how likely we were 
to lose our language and our name of English; how little good we did, 
or were likely to do, to the Dutch, in reforming the sabbath; how un- 
able there to give such education to our children as we ourselves had 
received; in their grave wisdoms they thought we might more glorify 
God, do more good to our country, better provide for our posterity, 
and live to be more refreshed by our labours than ever we could do in 
Holland where we were... . 
Now these their private thoughts, upon mature deliberation they 
imparted to the brethren of the congregation which, after much private 
discussion, came to public agitation, till at length the Lord was sol- 
emnly sought in the congregation by fasting and prayer to direct us. 
Who moving our hearts more 
and more to the work, we sent 
some of good abilities over into 
England, to see what favour or 
acceptance such a thing might 
find with the king. 
These also found God going 
along with them, and got Sir 
Edwin Sandys, a religious gen- 
tleman then living, to stir in it. 
Who procured Sir Robert Naun- 
ton, then principal secretary of 
state to King James of famous     Fic. 40. THE MAyFLowER

by a private motion, to give way

Majesty’s dominions and the enlargement of the gospel by all due 
means. 
This, his Majesty said, was a good ail honest motion: and asking 
what profits might arise in the part we intended (for our eye was on 
the most northern parts of Virginia) it was answered “fishing.” To 
which he replied with his ordinary asservation, “So God have my 
soul! ’t is an honest trade! It was the apostles’ own calling!” 
But afterwards he told Sir Robert Naunton, who took all occasions 
to further it, that we should confer with the Bibobs of Canterbury 
and London. . 
After this, ey who stayed accompanied us to Delfshaven, (about 
twenty-four miles from Leyden) where we were to embark; and there 
feasted us again. And after prayer performed by our pastor; where a 
flood of tears was poured out, they accompanied us to the ship, but 
were not able to speak one to another for the abundance of sorrow to 
part. But we only going aboard the ship lying to the quay and ready 
to set sail, the wind being fair, we gave them a volley of small shot and 
three pieces of ordnance; and so lifting up our hands to each other, and 
our hearts for each other to the Lord our God, we departed and found 
his presence with us in the midst of our manifold straits that he 
carried us through. . . . 
185. The Founding of Harvard College 
(New England’s First Fruits. London, 1643. Mass. Hist. Col., 1792, vol. 1, pp. 242-46) 
The following extract from a pamphlet published in London in 
1643, records the founding (in 1636) of the “new colledge”’ for 
the colony. .It was originally a letter dated ‘‘Boston, Sept. 26, 
1642.” 
After God had carried us safe to New England, and wee had builded 
our houses, provided necessaries for our liveli-hood, rear’d convenient 
places for Gods worship, and setled the Civill Government: One of the 
next things we longed for, and looked after was to advance Learning, 
and perpetuate it to Posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate Ministery 
to the Churches, when our present Ministers shall lie in the Dust. And 
as wee were thinking and consulting how to effect this great Work; it 
pleased God to stir up the heart of one Mr. Harvard (a godly Gentleman 
and a lover of Learning, there living amongst us) to give the one halfe of 
his Estate (it being in all about 1700. 1.) towards the erecting of a 
Colledge, and all his Library: after him another gave 300. |. others 
after them cast in more, and the publique hand of the State added the 
rest: the Colledge was, by common consent, appointed to be at Cam- 
bridge, a place very pleasant and accommodate and is'called (accord- 
ing to the name of the first founder) Harvard Colledge. 
The Edifice is very faire and comely within and without, having in it 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
RESULTS IN AMERICA 291 
  a spacious Hall; (where they daily meet at Commons, Lectures, Exer- 
cises) and a large Library with some Bookes to it, the gifts of diverse of 
our friends, their Chambers and studies also fitted for, and possessed by 
the Students, and all other roomes of Office necessary and convenient, 
with all needfull Offices thereto belonging: And by the side of the Col- 
ledge a faire Grammar Schoole, for the training up of young Schollars, 
and fitting of them for Academicall Learning, that still as they are 
judged ripe, they may be received into 
the Colledge of this Schoole. Master 
Corlet is the Mr., who hath very well 
approved himselfe for his abilities, dex- 
terity and painfulnesse in teaching and 
education of the youth under him. 
Over the Colledge is master Dunster 
placed, as President, a learned con- 
scionable and industrious man, who has 
so trained up his Pupills in the tongues 
and Arts, and so seasoned them with 
the principles of Divinity and Chris- 
tianity that we have to our great com- 
fort, (and in truth) beyond our hopes, 
beheld their progresse in Learning and , i (1607-38) godlinesse also; the former of these 2 i : 
hath appeared in their publique decla- (rom Gene i 
mations in Latine and Greeke, and Dis- 
putations Logicall and Philosophicall, which they have beene wonted 
(besides their ordinary Exercises in the Colledge-Hall) in the audience 
of the Magistrates, Ministers, and other Schollars, for the probation 
of their growth in Learning, upon set dayes, constantly once every 
moneth to make and uphold: The latter hath been manifested in 
sundry of them by the savoury breathings of their Spirits in their godly 
conversation. Insomuch that we are confident, if these early blos- 
somes may be cherished and warmed with the influence of the friends 
of Learning, and lovers of this pious worke, they will by the help of 
God, come to happy maturity in a short time. 
Over the Colledge are twelve Overseers chosen by the generall Court, 
six of them are of the Magistrates, the other six of the Ministers, who 
are to promote the best good of it, and (having a power of influence into 
all persons in it) are to see that every one be diligent and Ca in 
his proper place.

interesting as revealing the great religious purpose of the institu- 
tion, the limited and European-Renaissance character of the in- 
struction, and the medieval university type of requirements for 
degrees. 
(a) Entrance Requirements 
1. When any Schollar is able to understand Tully, or such like classi- 
_ call Latine Author extempore, and make and speake true Latine in Verse

according to his ability; seeing the entrance of the word giveth light, it 
giveth understanding to the simple, Psalm 119. 130. 
4. That they eschewing all profanation of Gods Name, Attributes, 
Word, Ordinances, and times of Worship, doe studie with good con- 
science, carefully to retaine God, and the love of his truth in their mindes 
else let them know, that (notwithstanding their Learning) God may 
give them up fo strong delusions, and in the end to a reprobate minde, 
2; hes. 2: 1,12: . Rom::1; 28. 
5. That they studiously redeeme the time; observe the generall

187. Extracts from the Charters of Harvard and Brown Colleges 
(Charter of Harvard College, 1650; Brown College, 1764) 
The two extracts which follow show the influence of earlier 
European university foundations on the beginnings of American 
colleges, in the matter of privileges and exemptions. Compare 
with Readings 103-105. 
(a) The Harvard College Charter of 1650 
(Act of the Massachusetts General Court, creating the College a Corporation, 1650) 
And, further, be it ordered by this Court and the authority thereof, 
that all the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, houses, or revenues,

taining, not exceeding the value of five hundred pounds per annum, 
shall from henceforth be freed from all civil impositions, taxes, and 
rates; all goods to the said corporation, or to any scholars thereof, 
appertaining, shall be exempted from all manner of toll, customs, and 
excise whatsoever; and that the said President, Fellows, and scholars, 
together with the servants, and other necessary officers to the said 
President or College appertaining, not exceeding ten, — viz. three to

the President and seven to the College belonging, — shall be exempted 
from all personal civil offices, military exercises or services, watchings 
and wardings; and such of their estates, not exceeding one hundred 
pounds a man, shall be free from all country taxes or rates whatsoever, 
and none others. 
(6) The Brown College Charter of 1764 
(Act of the General Assembly of the English Colony of Rhode Island in Providence

American colleges, and European universities, We do grant, enact, or- 
dain, and declare, and it is hereby granted, enacted, ordained, and 
declared, That the College estate, the estates, persons, and fami- 
lies of the President and Professors, for the time being, lying, and

188. Founding of the Free School of Roxburie (Massachusetts) 
(Dillaway, C. K., A History of the Grammar School in Roxburie, pp. 7-8. 
Roxbury, 1860) 
In 1645 a large number of the inhabitants of Roxbury signed an 
agreement to provide for the maintenance of a school for the 
town, which read as follows: 
Whereas, the Inhabitantes of Roxburie, in consideration of their 
relligeous care of posteritie, have taken into consideration how neces- 
sarie the education of theire children in Literature will be to fitt them 
for public service, both in Churche and Commonwealthe, in succeeding 
ages. They therefore unanimously have consented and agreed to 
erect a free schoole in the said Towne of Roxburie, and to allow Twenty 
pounds per annum to the Schoolemaster, to bee raised out of the Mes- 
suages and part of the Lands of the severall donors (Inhabitantes of the 
said Towne) in severall proportions as hereafter followeth under their 
handes. And for the well ordering thereof they have chosen and elected 
some Feoffees who shall have power to putt in or remove the Schoole- 
master, to see to the well ordering of the schoole and schoolars, to re- 
ceive and pay the said twenty pounds per annum to the Schoolemaster, 
and to dispose of any other gifte or giftes which hereafter may or 
shall be given for the advancement of learning and education of chil- 
renee 4 ¢  
-P-A-G-E-322
      296 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
In consideration of the premises, the Donors hereafter expressed for 
the severall proportions or annuities by them voluntarily undertaken 
and underwritten, Have given and granted and by these presents doe 
for themselves their heires and Asignees respectively hereby give and 
grant unto the present Feoffees ...the severall rents and summes 
hereafter expressed under their handes. . . . To have and to hould re- 
ceive and enjoy the said annual rents or summes to the only use of the 
Free Schoole in Roxburie. 
In 1666 it was proposed that the whole town, as a town, unite 
in maintaining the school, but a meeting called to consider the 
matter resulted in no positive action. In 1671 a citizen of the 
town, dying in London, willed to the board of trustees of the 
school nearly two hundred acres of land in Roxbury, and this 
was used to endow the school. 
In 1770 the enumeration of pupils in the Roxbury school 
showed an attendance of 85, distributed as follows: 
Latin scholars 9 Testament Io 
Cypherers 20 Psalter Io 
Writers 17 Spellers 85

(Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, 
vol. 11, pp. 6-7. Boston, 1853) 
This earliest colonial law regarding education, under date of 
April 14, 1642, reads as follows: 
This Co't, taking into consideration the great neglect of many par- 
ents & masters in training up their children in learning, & labo", & 
other implyments which may be proffitable to the common wealth, do 
hereupon order and decree, that in euery towne y* chosen men ap-

191. The Massachusetts Law of 1647 
(Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, 
vol. 11, p. 203. Boston, 1853) 
This famous Act, often spoken of as “the old deluder, Satan, 
Act,” was enacted under date of November 11, 1647, and reads 
as follows: 
It being one cheife proiect of y* ould deluder, Satan, to keepemen from 
the knowledge of y® Scriptures, as in form" times by keeping y™ in an 
unknowne tongue, so in these latt" times by perswading from y® use of

192. Presentment of the Town of Topsfield, for Violating the 
Law of 1642 
(Records and Files of Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, 1636-1671, 
vol. Iv, p. 212. Salem, 1911-14) 
That the courts were insistent that the Law of 1642 be enforced 
may be seen from the following court order, issued to be served
-P-A-G-E-326
    300 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
on the Selectmen of Topsfield, Massachusetts, for not properly 
enforcing the law. 
Warrant to the constable of Topsfield, dated Mar. 2, 1668: 
Whereas the law published by the Honered Generall Court lib. I, 
pag 76, doe require all Townes from time to time to dispose of all single 
persons and inmates within their Towns to service or otherwise and in 
pag. 16, tit. children & youth, It is required of the selectmen that they 
see that all youth under family Government be taught to read perfectly 
the english tongue, have knowledge in the capital laws, and be taught 
some orthodox catechism, and that they be brought up to some hon- 
est employment, profitable to themselves and to the commonwealth, 
and in case of neglect, on the part of famaly Governours, after admoni- 
tion given them, the sayd selectmen are required, with the helpe of two 
magistrates, or next court of that shire, to take such children or ap- 
prentices from them, and place them forth with such as will looke more 
straitly to them. The neglect wherof, as by sad experience from 
court to court abundantly appears, doth occasion much sin and pro- 
phanes to increase among us, to the dishonor of God, and the ensueing 
of many children and servants, by the dissolute lives and practices of 
such as doe live from under family Government and is a great dis- 
couragement to most family governours, who consciently indeavour to 
bring up their youth in all christian nurture, as the laws of God and this 
commonwealth doth require; [said constable was ordered to acquaint 
selectmen of the town that] the court doth expect and will require that 
the sayd laws be accordingly attended, the prevalency of the former 
neglect notwithstanding, and you are also required to take a list of the 
names of those young persons within the bounds of your Town, and all 
adjacent farmes, though out of all Towne bounds, who do live from 
under family government viz. doe not serve their parents or masters, as 
children apprentices, hired servants, or journeymen ought to do, and 
usually did in our native country, being subject to there commands & 
discipline and the same you are to returne to the next court to be held 
at Ipswich the 30 day of this month, etc. ; signed by Robert Lord, cleric; 
and served by Thomas Dorman, constable of Topsfield, who returned 
that he had made the selectmen acquainted with Mathew Hooker, who 
was all that he found in the town. 
193. The Connecticut Law of 1650 
(Codification of 1650; in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. 1v, p. 660) 
Connecticut here follows the Massachusetts legislation. After 
the law reproduced below, Connecticut also added and enacted, 
under the heading of ScHoors, the Massachusetts “old deluder, 
Satan, law” of 1647 in full. This legislation remained unchanged 
in Connecticut until 1792.

Children 
Forasmuch as the good Education of Children is of singular behoofe 
and benefitt to any Commonwealth; and whereas many parents and 
masters are too indulgent and negligent of theire duty in that kind; 
It is therefore ordered by this Courte and Authority thereof, that the 
Select men of euery Towne in the several precincts and quarters where 
they dwell, shall have a vigilant eye over their brethern and neighbors, 
to see, first, that none of them shall suffer so much barbarism in any of 
their families, as not to endeavor to teach by themselves or others, 
their children and apprentices so much learning as may enable them 
perfectly to read the English tongue, and knowledge of the capital laws, 
upon penalty of twenty shillings for each neglect therein; also, that all 
masters of families, do, once a week, at least catechise their children and 
servants, in the grounds and principles of religion; and if any be unable 
to do so much, that then, at the least, they procure such children or 
apprentices to learn some short orthodox catechism, without book, that 
they may be able to answer to the questions that shall be propounded 
to them out of such catechisms by their parents or masters, or any 
selectmen, when they shall call them to a‘trial of what they have learned 
in this kind; and further, that all parents and masters do breed and 
bring up their children and apprentices in some honest lawful [calling,] 
labor, or employment, either in husbandry or some other trade profita- 
ble for themselves and the commonwealth, if they will not nor can not 
train them up in learning, to fit them for higher employments, and if 
any of the selectmen, after admonition by them given to such masters of 
families, shall find them still negligent of their duty, in the particulars 
aforementioned, whereby children and servants become rude, stub- 
born and unruly, the said selectmen, with the help of two magistrates, 
shall take such children or apprentices from them, and place them with 
some masters for years, boys until they come to twenty-one, and girls to 
eighteen years of age complete, which will more strictly look unto and 
force them to submit unto government, according to the rules of this 
order, if by fair means and former instructions they will not be drawn 
unto it. 
Here follows the Massachusetts Law of 1647, as given in the 
preceding selection.   
194. Plymouth Colony Legislation 
(Plymouth Colony Records, vol. x1, Laws) 
Plymouth Colony was not joined to that of Massachusetts Bay 
to form Massachusetts until 1692, and previous to that date 
Plymouth Colony enacted the following legislation regarding

195. Contract with a Dutch Schoolmaster, Flatbush, New York 
(Trans. by Platt, D. J., Annals of Public Education in the State of New York, 1626- 
1746, pp. 65-67. Albany, 1872) 
Specific and very particular agreements were made by the 
Dutch with their early schoolmasters, as the following document 
of 1682 shows. It also reveals the multiple nature of the school- 
master’s duties, — teacher, chorister, janitor, and sexton, and is 
of importance as showing the elementary schoolmaster in the 
process of evolution out of the church sexton. 
ScHoot Service. I. The School shall begin at eight o’clock, and go 
out at eleven; and in the afternoon shall begin at one o’clock and end at 
four. The bell shall be rung when the school commences.

304. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
II. When the school begins, one of the children shall read the morn- 
ing prayer, as it stands in the catechism, and close with the prayer be- 
fore dinner; in the afternoon it shall begin with the prayer after dinner, 
and end with the evening prayer. The evening school shall begin with 
the Lord’s prayer, and close by singing a psalm. 
III. He shall instruct the children on every Wednesday and Sat- 
urday, in the common prayers, and the questions and answers in the 
catechism, to enable them to repeat them the better on Sunday before 
the afternoon service, or on Monday, when they shall be catechised 
before the congregation. Upon all such occasions, the schoolmaster 
shall be present, and shall require the children to be friendly in their 
appearance and encourage them to answer freely and distinctly. 
IV. He shall be required to keep his school nine months in succes- 
sion, from September to June, in each year, in case it should be con- 
cluded upon to retain his services for a year or more, or without limita- 
tion; and he shall then be required to be regulated by these articles, and 
to perform the same duties which his predecessor, Jan Thibaud, above 
named, was required to perform. In every particular therefore, he 
shall be required to keep school, according to this seven months agree- 
ment, and shall always be present himself. 
Cuurcy Service. I. He shall keep the church clean, and ring the 
bell three times before the people assemble to attend the preaching and 
catechism. Also before the sermon is commenced, he shall read a 
chapter out of the Holy Scriptures, and that, between the second and 
third ringing of the bell. After the third ringing he shall read the ten 
commandments, and the twelve articles of our faith, and then take the 
lead in singing. In the afternoon after the third ringing of the bell, he 
shall read a short chapter, or one of the Psalms of David, as the congre- 
gation are assembling; and before divine service commences, shall intro- 
duce it, by the singing of a Psalm or Hymn. 
II. When the minister shall preach at Brooklyn, or New-Utrecht, he 
shall be required to read twice before the congregation, from the book 
commonly used for that purpose. In the afternoon he shall also read a 
sermon on the explanation of the catechism, according to the usage and 
practice approved of by the minister: The children as usual, shall re- 
cite their questions and answers out of the catechism, on Sunday, and 
he shall instruct them therein. He, as chorister, shall not be required 
to perform these duties, whenever divine service shall be performed 
in Flatlands, as it would be unsuitable, and prevent many from attend- 
ing there. 
Ill. For the administration of Holy Baptism, he shall provide a 
basin with water, for which he shall be entitled to receive from the par- 
ents, or witnesses, twelve styvers.'_ He shall, at the expense of the

(Minutes of the Orphan Masters of New Amsterdam, vol. , p. 115; trans. by 
B. Fernow. New York, 1907) 
The following instructions given Evert Pietersen, a school- 
master employed in New Amsterdam in 1661, by the public 
authorities, are probably typical of those given other schoolmas- 
ters. They are reproduced as showing the nature and the fee 
basis of the Dutch elementary schools.

N.N., November 4, 1661. 
197. The Pennsylvania Law of 1683 
(Laws of the 2d General Assembly of Pennsylvania Colony, chap. cxm. From 
Wickersham, J. P., History of Education in Pennsylvania, p. 39. Lancaster, 1886) 
William Penn received his charter from the King, in 1681, and 
arrived in 1682. The first Colonial Assembly met that year, and 
the second a year later. This second Assembly enacted a law 
which for the time marked a very progressive attitude for this 
colony. It was enforced here and there, as the court records 
show, but was later vetoed by William and Mary as being opposed 
to English traditions and practices. It was reénacted in 1693, 
but soon became a dead letter, and Pennsylvania’s opportunity 
to follow in the footsteps of Massachusetts was lost. The law 
reads: 
And to the end that poor as well as rich may be instructed in good 
and commendable learning, which is to be preferred before wealth, 
Be it enacted, etc., That all persons in this Province and Territories 
thereof, having children, and all guardians and trustees of orphans, 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  RESULTS IN AMERICA 307 
shall cause such to be instructed in reading and writing, so that they 
may be able to read the Scriptures and to write by the time they attain 
to twelve years of age; and that then they be taught some useful trade 
or skill, that the poor may work to live, and the rich if they become 
poor may not want: of which every County Court shall take care. And 
in case such parents, guardians, or overseers shall be found deficient in 
this respect, every such parént, guardian, or overseer shall pay for every 
such child, five pounds, except there should appear an incapacity in 
body or understanding to hinder it. 
198. The First School in Philadelphia 
(Minutes of the Pennsylvania Colonial Council, 1683. From Wickersham, J. P., 
History of Education in Pennsylvania, p. 41. Lancaster, 1886) 
The first attempt to carry out the Pennsylvania law of 1683 
was made in Philadelphia, that same year, as is shown by the 
following minutes of the Colonial Council. Flower opened a 
school there in October, 1683. 
At a Council held at Philadelphia, y° 26th of y® roth month, 1683. 
Present: Wm. Penn, Propor & Govr.,; Theo. Holmes, Wm. Haigue, 
Lasse Cock, Wm. Clayton. 
The Govr and Provll Councill having taken into their Serious Con- 
sideration the great Necessity there is of a School Master for y® in- 
struction & Sober Education of youth in the towne of Philadelphia, 
Sent for Enock flower, an Inhabitant of the said Towne, who for twenty 
Year past hath been exercised in that care and imployment in England, 
to whom haveing Communicated their Minds, he Embraced it upon 
the following Terms: to Learne to read English 4s by the Quarter, to 
Learne to read and write 6s by y® Quarter, to learne to read, Write and 
Cast accot 8s by y® Quarter; for Boarding a Scholler, that is to say, 
dyet, Washing, Lodging, & Scooling, Tenn pounds for one whole year. 
199. Early Quaker Injunctions regarding Schools 
(Rules of Discipline of the Yearly Meeting of Friends. Quoted by Murray, David; 
: History of Education in New Jersey, p. 23) 
The following extracts, quoted by Murray, relate to the period 
between 1746 and 1787 (the colony of Pennsylvania was founded 
in 1683), and illustrate the interest of the Quakers in the estab- 
lishment of parochial schools. 
Schools. The education of our youth in piety and virtue, and giving 
them useful learning under the tuition of religious, prudent persons, 
having for a great number of years enjoyed the solid attention of this 
meeting, advices thereon have from time to time been issued to the 
several subordinate meetings. It is renewedly desired that quarterly,
-P-A-G-E-334
    308 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
monthly, and preparative meetings may be excited to proper exertions 
for the institution and support of schools, there being but little doubt 
that as Friends are united and cherish a disposition of liberality for 
the assistance of each other in this important work, they will be en- 
abled to make such provision for the accommodation and residence of a 
teacher with a family as would be an encouragement to well-qualified 
persons to engage in this arduous employment. . . . 
It is therefore proposed: (1) That a lot of ground be provided in each 
monthly or preparative meeting, sufficient for a garden, orchard, grass 
for a cow, etc., and a suitable house erected thereon. (2) That funds 
be raised by contribution, bequests, etc., in each meeting; the interest 
of which to be applied either in aid of the tutor’s salary or lessening the 
expenses of Friends in straitened circumstances, in the education of 
their children. (3) That a committee be appointed in each monthly or 
preparative meeting to have the care of schools and the funds for their 
support, and that no tutor be employed but with their consent. 
200. Apprenticeship Laws in the Southern Colonies 
A. IN VIRGINIA 
(Hening’s Statutes of Virginia, vol. 1, pp. 260, 336-37, and vol. 11, p. 298) 
All of the early Virginia legislation relating to education refers 
either to William and Mary College, founded in 1693, or to the 
education of orphans and the children of the poor. The three 
laws relating to the apprenticeship of the latter, under date of 
1643, 1646, and 1672, provide: 
(1) Law of 1643 
The guardians and overseers of all orphants shall carefully keep and 
preserve such estates as shall be committed to their trusts either by 
order of court or otherwise. And shall likewise render an exact accompt 
once everie year to the commissioners of the several county courts, re- 
spectively, of the said estates and of the increase and improvement, 
who are hereby to keep an exact register thereof. And all overseers 
and guardians of such orphants are enjoyned by authority aforesaid to 
educate and instruct them according to their best endeavors in Chris- 
tian religion and in the rudiments of learning and to provide for their 
necessaries according to the competents of their estate. 
(2) Law of 1646 
Commissioners of the several counties shall make choice of two chil- 
dren, male or female, eight or seven years at least, to be sent to James 
City (Jamestown) to be employed in the public flax factory work un- 
der such master and masters as shall thus be appointed, in carding,
-P-A-G-E-335
  RESULTS IN AMERICA 309 
knitting, spinning, and so on, and that said children shall be furnished 
from the counties with six barrels of corn, two coverlids, one rugg, one 
blanket, one bed, one wooden bowl or tray, two pewter spoons, a sow 
shote of six months, and two laying hens, convenient apparel, both 
linen and woolen, with hose and shoes. That there be two houses 
built by the first of April next, forty feet long apeace with good sub- 
stantial timber. The houses to be twenty feet broad apeace, eight foot 
high in the pitche, and a stack of brick chimney standing in the midst 
of each house, and that they be lofted with sawne boards and made 
with convenient partitions, commissioners have caution not to take up 
children from such parents who by reason of their poverty are disable 
to maintain and educate them. That the governor hath agreed with 
the Assembly for the sum of ten thousand pounds of to-bo to be paid 
him the next crop to build such houses. 
(3) Law of 1672 
That the justices of the peace in every county doe put the laws of 
England against vagrants, idlers, and dissolute persons, in strict execu- 
tion, and the respective county courts shall and are hereby empowered 
and authorized to place out all the children whose parents are not able 
to bring them up apprentices to tradesmen, the males tillone and twenty 
years of age and the females to other necessary employment till eight- 
een years of age and no longer, and the church wardens of every parish 
shall [be] strictly enjoyned by the courts to give them an account at 
their Orphans Courts of all such children within their parish. 
B. IN NORTH CAROLINA 
(Colonial Records of North Carolina, vol. 1, pp. 448, 577, and vol. 11, p. 266) 
The English practice of apprenticing orphans and poor chil- 
dren, best exemplified by Virginia, extended into the other south- 
ern colonies, as the following selected North Carolina court 
records, dated 1695, 1703, and 1716, clearly show.

  201. A New England Indenture of Apprenticeship 
(Stiles, H. R., The History of Ancient Windsor, Connecticut, vol. 1, p. 442. 
New York, 1859.) 
Such agreements as the following were very common in all the 
colonies in colonial days. This shows well the relations which 
existed between master and apprentices in Connecticut. 
This Indenture witnesseth that Jonathan Stoughton, son of Thomas 
Stoughton of Windsor in the county of hartford and Coloney of Con- 
necticut in new england, with his father’s consent hath put him selfe an 
apprentice to Nathan day of the aboue sd windsor county and coloney:

  202. The New England Primer 
(Abstract of a reprint of an edition of about 1785-90 reproduced recently by Ginn 
& Co., Boston. Original in the library of Mr. G. A. Plimpton, of New York) 
This famous little schoolbook first appeared about 1690, and 
for the next century and a quarter it was the chief school and 
reading book in use among the Dissenters and Lutherans in 
America. It went through many editions, and was altered some- 
what from time to time to suit the peculiar religious views of the 
publisher’s patrons. A little book of but eighty-eight pages, 
three and a quarter by four and a half inches in size, it expressed 
so well the gloomy religious atmosphere of Calvinistic New Eng- 
land that it was retained in use long after better reading matter 
had appeared. 
Unlike the early Protestant Primer of Melanchthon (Witten- 
berg, 1524), or the Orbis Pictus of Comenius (1654), both of which 
had contained some secular reading matter, The New England 
Primer was religious throughout. Even the illustrated alphabet, 
which in early editions was secular in tone, was later revised so 
as better to express the prevailing religious conceptions of the 
period. A brief analysis of the contents of this famous Primer 
will prove interesting, as showing the nature of the instruction 
in reading and religion given in the colonial schools. 
Each copy contained on its first leaf a rude woodcut of the rul- 
ing monarch, and later of some Revolutionary hero, and a page 
of Proverbs relating to filial duty and serving God. Sometimes 
a religious poem was printed for the latter. Then followed the 
title-page. In the edition at hand this was followed by a poem 
on “Good Boys at their Books” (1 page); the letters, vowels and 
consonants (1 page); two pages of easy syllables (ab, abs); words 
of one syllable (1 page); words of two to six syllables (2 pages); 
the Lord’s Prayer and the Creed (1 page); an illustrated alphabet 
(2 pages); the rhymed alphabet (4 pages, of which the first is 
given in the illustrated page printed here); ten half-page pictures 
of animals, with a rhyme under each, of which the following is an 
example: 
“The Butterfly in gaudy dress, 
The worthless Coxcomb doth express.” 
Next comes a two-page poem of “Praise for Learning”’ to read, 
the first page of which is reproduced here. Then follows an al-
-P-A-G-E-338
312 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
phabet of ‘‘Lessons for Youth,” of three pages, the first of which 
is also reproduced. The next two and a half pages contain 
Watt’s beautiful “Cradle Hymn,” beginning: 
“Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber, 
Holy angels guard thy bed.”

  This is followed by three and a half pages of Verses for Children, 
and four pages of rhymed prayers and admonitions, among which 
one finds the old familiar 
“Now I lay me down to sleep.” 
Next comes a seven-page rhymed “‘ Advice to Children,” writ- 
ten by John Rogers, a London minister, who was burned at the 
stake at Smithfield, in 1554, and which was bequeathed by him
-P-A-G-E-339
  RESULTS IN AMERICA 313 
to the wife and nine children he was about to leave. After a page 
picture, showing the event, the poem begins: 
“Give Ear my Children to my Words, 
whom God hath dearly bought, 
Lay up his Laws within your Heart, 
and point them in your thought. 
I leave you here a little book, 
for you to look upon, 
That you may see your father’s face, 
when he is dead and gone.” 
This was evidently a much-prized poem. 
Next comes a page of ‘“‘Instructive Questions and Answers,” of 
which the following are illustrative: 
Who was the first Man? Adam. 
Who was the first Woman? Eve. 
Who was the first Murderer? Cain. 
Who was the first Martyr? Abel. 
Who was the first Translated? Enoch. 
Who was the oldest Man? Methuselah. 
Who built the Ark? Noah. 
This was followed by the piéce de résistance of the whole book, 
“The Shorter Westminster Catechism,” the first page of which is 
reproduced as Figure 131 in the accompanying History. This 
required twenty-four pages of the book. Next comes a famous 
native production of nine and a half pages, by John Cotton, the 
first page of which is reproduced on page 315. The volume is now 
concluded with a nine and a half page rhymed dialogue between 
Christ, a Youth, and the Devil, which also was a great favorite 
in New England. The Youth declares: 
“Those days which God to me doth send, 
In pleasure I’m resolved to spend.” 
The Devil expresses great pleasure at the decision, while Christ 
entreats the Youth not to obey the Devil’s voice. - The Youth, 
though, will not listen until too late. After a long argument, 
Christ finally, out of patience, calls Death to come and take the 
Youth “before he has half lived out his days.”’ The Youth, ter- 
rified, now begs to be spared, but Christ is obdurate; Death takes 
him; and the poem ends with the following words:
-P-A-G-E-340
314. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  DratH 
“Youth, I am come to fetch thy breath, 
And carry thee to th’ shades of death, ( 
No pity on thee can I show, 
Thou hast thy God offended so. 
Thy soul and body I’ll divide, 
Thy body in the grave I'll hide, 
And thy dear soul in hell must lie 
With Devils to eternity. 
THE CONCLUSION 
“Thus ends the days of woful youth, 
Who won’t obey nor mind the truth; 
Nor hearken to what preachers say, 
But do their parents disobey. 
They in their youth go down to hell, 
Under eternal wrath to dwell. 
Many don’t live out half their days 
For cleaving unto sinful ways.” 
This Primer exercised a great influence on the New England 
character. It was used by both church and school, the school- 
master drilling on the Catechism in the school, and the peo- 
ple reciting it yearly in the churches. Every home possessed 
copies of the book, and it was for sale at all bookstores, even in 
the smaller places, for a century and a half. It was also used 
extensively outside of New England, it being essentially the book 
of the Dissenters in the American colonies. Sometimes it was 
printed under the title of The Columbian Primer, The American 
Primer, or, The New York Primer, but the public preferred The 
New England Primer to any other title. Its total sales have been 
estimated to have been at least three million copies.1_ It was 
used in the Boston Dame Schools as late as 1806, and in the 
country districts still later. The cities abandoned it first, and 
gradually it was replaced everywhere by a new type of secular 
reading book which developed in America, after the rise of a na- 
1 “For one hundred years this Primer was the schoolbook of the dissenters of 
America, and for‘another hundred, it was frequently reprinted. In the unfavorable 
locality (in a sectarian sense) of Philadelphia, the accounts of Benjamin Franklin 
and David Hall show that, between 1749 and 1766, that firm sold 37,100 copies of 
it. Livermore stated, in 1840, that within the last dozen years ‘ 100,000 copies of 
modern editions have been circulated.’ An over-conservative claim for it is to 
estimate an annual average sale of 20,000 copies during a period of one hundred 
and fifty years, or a total sale of 3,000,000 copies.” (Ford, The New England Primer,

CHAPTER XVI 
THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 
Tue Readings contained in this chapter deal with the rise of the 
study of the modern mathematical, astronomical, and physical 
sciences as a still further expression of the new critical, question- 
ing spirit awakened by the Revival of Learning; the beginnings of 
modern scientific method, and its application to the problems of 
the universe; and the formulation of this method and its fruitful- 
ness in the hands of modern investigators. 
The first selection (203) is from Macaulay, and not only sets 
forth the fundamental defects of all ancient science, but also shows 
how the ancient scientific purpose differed from the modern. The 
seconds election (204), from an old German chronicle, is a good 
illustration of the wonderful and miraculous, which flourished 
throughout the whole Middle Ages and made scientific progress 
impossible. The third selection (205) is an extract from the dedi- 
catory letter of Copernicus, prefixed to his revolutionary volume 
(1543) on the motions of the heavenly bodies. Modern scientific 
methods and discovery clearly date from the publication of this 
book. The extract reveals the new method of thinking, and is as 
clear an example of the modern attitude and way of thinking as 
was the work of Petrarch. The next extract (206), describing 
how Galileo discovered the satellites of Jupiter (1610), also is a 
wonderfully clear example of modern scientific reasoning. 
Modern scientific investigation was unfortunate in its birth, in 
that it was ushered into the world just as the growing tolerance 
of the Church, which had marked the latter half of the fifteenth 
century and the opening years of the sixteenth, was changing to 
an attitude of suspicion and critical reaction as a result of the 
Protestant Revolts then sweeping Europe. In lands strongly 
Protestant this reaction manifested itself but slightly, and in 
England scarcely at all, but in strong Catholic countries, and 
especially in Italy, it strove to suppress new thinking as dangerous 
to orthodoxy. The Spanish Inquisition, a sort of mediaeval in- 
quisitorial grand jury, was revived, and became zealous in track- 
ing down and punishing offenders. One of these was Galileo 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 317 
Galilei, a professor at Pisa, who had made many remarkable sci- 
entific discoveries. For defending the Copernican theory he was 
called to Rome (1615), compelled to recant his “error” (1616) to 
escape the stake, and for daring later (1632) again to write on the 
theory was compelled to ‘‘abjure his error” (207), and was made 
a virtual prisoner of the Inquisition for the remainder of his life. 
The selection is introduced to show how far the forces of reaction 
were stimulated, a century after Magellan’s voyage, spurred on 
by the religious hatreds and warfare then raging in Europe. 
The two selections which conclude the chapter deal with the 
organizing work of Lord Francis Bacon. ‘The first (208) is an 
extract from his famous Novwm Organum, in which he sets forth 
some of the difficulties the new scholars of the time had to face. 
The second (209) is Lord Macaulay’s estimate as to the impor- 
tance for modern thought of the organizing work of Bacon. 
203. Attitude of the Ancients toward Scientific Study 
(T. B. Macaulay, Essay on Lord Bacon; Edinburgh Review, July, 1837. Also in his 
collected Essays) 
Macaulay, in setting forth how completely Bacon’s work was 
dominated by the desire that philosophy and science should bear 
fruit, draws the following contrast between the ideas as to scien- 
tific study held by the ancients and those aimed at by Bacon. 
. .. The ancient philosophy disdained to be useful, and was content 
tobe stationary. It dealt largely in theories of moral perfection, which 
were so sublime that they never could be more than theories; in attempts 
to solve insoluable enigmas; in exhortations to the attainment of un- 
attainable frames of mind. It could not condescend to the humble 
office of ministering to the comfort of human beings. All the schools 
contemned that office as degrading; some censured it as immoral. 
The ancient philosophers did not neglect natural science; but they 
did not cultivate it for the purpose of increasing the power and amelior- 
ating the condition of man. The taint of barrenness had spread from 
ethical to physical speculations. Seneca wrote largely on natural phi- 
losophy, and magnified the importance of that study. But why? Not 
because it tended to assuage suffering, to multiply the conveniences of 
life, to extend the empire of man over the material world; but solely 
because it tended to raise the mind above low cares, to separate it from 
the body, to exercise its subtility in the solution of very obscure ques- 
tions. Thus natural philosophy was considered in the light merely of a 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
    | 
318 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
mental exercise. It was made subsidiary to the art of disputation; and 
it consequently proved altogether barren of useful discoveries. 
To sum up the whole, we should say that the aim of the Platonic 
philosophy was to exalt man into a god. The aim of the Baconian ° 
philosophy was to provide man with what he requires while he con- 
tinues tobe man. The aim of the Platonic philosophy was to raise us 
far above vulgar wants. The aim of the Baconian philosophy was to 
supply our vulgar wants. The former aim was noble; but the latter 
was attainable. Plato drew a good bow; but, like Ascestes in Vergil, he 
aimed at the stars; and therefore, though there was no want of strength 
or skill, the shot was thrown away. His arrow was indeed followed by 
a track of dazzling radience, but it struck nothing. . . . Bacon fixed his 
eye on a mark which was placed on the earth, and within bow shot, and 
hit it in the white. The philosophy of Plato began in words and ended 
in words, noble words indeed, words such as were to be expected from 
the finest of human intellects exercising boundless dominion over the 
finest of human languages. The philosophy of Bacon began in obser- 
vations and ended in arts. 
The boast of the ancient philosophers was that their doctrine formed 
the minds of men to a high degree of wisdom and virtue. This was 
indeed the only practical good which the most celebrated of those 
teachers even pretended to effect; and undoubtedly, if they had effected 
this, they would have deserved far higher praise than if they had dis- 
covered the most salutary medicines or constructed the most powerful 
machines. But the truth is that, in those very matters in which alone 
they professed to do any good to mankind, in those very matters for 
the sake of which they neglected the vulgar interests of mankind, they 
did nothing, or worse than nothing. They promised what was im- 
practicable; they despised what was practicable; they filled the world 
with long words and long beards; and they left it as wicked and as ig- 
norant as they found it. 
204. The Credulity of Medieval People 
(Sebastian Franck’s Chronica, published in 1531; trans. in Bax’s German Society 
at the Close of the Middle Ages, pp. 268-71. London, 1894) 
The following selection from this important German chronicle 
gives the reader a good illustration of the ready credulity of 
medieval peoples, and their excessive excitability. Dating, as 
the extract does, from 1516, the year before the outbreak of the 
Protestant heresy, it presents an interesting picture of the mind 
of the later Middle Ages. 
Anno 1516, Dr. Balthasar Hubmeyer did preach with vehemence 
against the Jews at Regensburg, showing how great an evil doth arise 
|    
-P-A-G-E-345
  THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 319 
to the whole German nation, not alone from their faith, but also from 
their usury, and how unspeakable a tribute their usury doth bear away 
withal. Then was there a Council held that they should pray the Em- 
peror to the end that Jews might be driven forth. Therefore did they 
(the people) break their synagogue in pieces, also many of their houses, 
and did build in the place thereof a Temple in honour of Mary, to which 
they gave the name of The Fair Mary. This did some visit privily, and 
told that from that hour was their prayer fulfilled. So soon, therefore, 
as the matter became noised abroad, even then was there a running 
from all parts thither, as though the people were bewitched, of wife, of 
child, of gentlemen, some spiritual, some worldly, they coming a long 
way, it might be having eaten nothing. Certain children who knew 
not the road did come from afar with a piece of bread, and the people 
came with so manifold an armoury, even such as it chanced that each 
had, the while he was at his work, the one with a milking-pail, the other 
with a hay fork. Some there were that had scarce aught in the greatest 
cold, wherewith to cover them in barest need. Some there were that 
did run many miles without speaking, as they might be half-possessed 
or witless; some did come barefoot with rakes, axes and sickles; these 
had fled from the fields and forsaken their lords; some caméd in a shirt 
they had by chance laid hands on as they arose from their bed; some 
did come at midnight; some there were that ran day and night; and 
there was in all such a running from all lands that, in the space of but 
one day, many thousands of men had come in. 
One there was that saw miracles from so much and so divers silver, 
gold, wax, pictures and jewels that were brought thither. There were 
daily so many masses read that one priest could scarce but meet the 
other, as he departed from the altar. When one did read the Com- 
munion (Commun), the other did kneel before the altar with his Con- 
fiteor. These things came to pass daily till well-nigh beyond noon, and 
although many altars were set up both within and without the Temple, 
yet nevertheless could not one priest but encounter the other. 
The learned did sing many Carmina in praise of Fair Mary,andmany 
and divers offices were devised of signs, of pipes and of organs. Much 
sick folk did they lead and bear hither, and also, as some do believe, 
dead men whom they brought home again restored and living. There 
befel also many great signs and wonders, the which it would not be fit- 
ting to tell of, and whereof an especial cheat was rumoured, in that 
what any brought thither, did he but vow himself with his offering, 
straightway he was healed, not alone from his sickness, but the living 
did also receive also their dead again, the blind saw, the halt ran, did 
leave their crutches in the Temple, and walked right from thence. 
Some ran hither from the war; yea, wives from their husbands, children 
from the obedience and will of their fathers would hither, saying that 
they might not remain away, and that they had no rest day nor night.  
-P-A-G-E-346

Some as they entered into the Temple and beheld the image straight- 
way fell down as though the thunder had smote them. As the mad 
tabble beheld how such did fall, they bethought them that it were the 
power of God, and that each must needs fall in this place. Thus there 
came to pass such a falling (such as was a foolishness and unrestrained 
and of the devils likeness) that well-nigh each that came to these places 
did fall and many from the rabble, who did not fall, believed themselves 
to be unholy and did enforce themselves straightway to fall, till the 
Council (Rath) was moved, as they say, to forbid such, and then did the 
signs and falling cease. 
It is wondrous to relate with what strange instruments the people 
caméd thither; as one was seized in the midst of his labour, he took not 
the time to lay aside that which he held in his hand but bore it with 
him, and each ran unshrived away, being driven by his own spirit. 
But whether the great Holy Spirit did move to such ill-considered 
tumult against obedience, did drive the mother from the child, the wife 
from the husband, the servant and the child contrary to the obedience 
to be rendered to the master and father, I will leave to others to de- 
termine. Many do even believe as I do, that it cannot be the work of 
God inasmuch as it is contrary to His word, work, manner, nature and 
the interpretation of the Scriptures. 
Now this running toward hath held a goodly season, as it may be six 
or eight years, but hath now ceased, albeit not wholly. 
205. How Copernicus arrived at the Theory he set forth 
(From the Dedicatory Letter of his De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium, to Pope 
Paul II, 1543; trans. by Adams, Yale Review, vol. 1, p. 141) 
In a long dedicatory letter, in which he says that he has had the 
completed manuscript of his book in his study for thirty-six 
years, but has not published it because he has wished to “avoid 
theories altogether foreign to orthodoxy,” and only does so now 
at the urgent solicitation of his friends, Copernicus explains to 
His Holiness how he came to evolve such a theory as he now ad- 
vances. The steps in his thinking and arriving at his conclusions 
are well set forth in the following extract from the dedicatory 
letter, and form an excellent example of a new method of thinking 
and reasoning, itself thoroughly modern in character. 
When I had for a long time thought upon the uncertainty of the 
traditional mathematical doctrine concerning the paths of the heavenly 
bodies it seemed to me very lamentable that still no more correct theory 
had been advanced by philosophers for the movements in that universe 
which the best and most perfect Architect had made for us, while they 
have so accurately investigated many relatively unimportant things.
-P-A-G-E-347
  THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 321 
Therefore I took the pains to read through the writings of all the philos- 
ophers that I could get together in order to find out if some one of them 
had not stated the opinion that the movements of the heavenly bodies 
might be other than the professional mathematicians had asserted. 
And I did find in reality first in Cicero that 
Nicetas had thought that the earth moves. 
Afterwards I read in Plutarch that some others 
also had been of this opinion. I will quote this 
passage that all may see it. Plutarch says: The 
common opinion is that the earth stands still; but 
Philolaus the Pythagorean supposes that it moves 
about the Fire in an oblique circle like the sun 
and moon. Heraklides of Pontus and Exphan- 
tus also teach that the earth moves, not advancing 
however, but turning like a wheel so that from 
evening to morning it turns about its own center. 
  When I had received this suggestion I began Fic. 44. 
myself also to meditate upon a motion of the NycHotas CopERNICUS 
earth. And although this theory might seem (1473-1543 
nonsensical, yet because I knew that to others 
before me the liberty had been allowed to suppose all sorts of circles 
in order to explain the phenomena in the heavens, so it would be 
permitted me also to try whether on the theory of the motion of the 
earth more satisfactory explanations than heretofore might not be 
found for the movements of the heavenly bodies. 
After I had then assumed the motions which I assign to the earth 
in the following work, I found, after careful investigation extending 
through years, that if the movements of the other planets were referred 
to the motion of the earth in its orbit and reckoned according to the 
revolution of each star, not only could their observed phenomena be 
logically explained, but also the succession of the stars, and their size, 
and all their orbits, and the heavens themselves would present such a 
harmonious order that no single part could be changed without disar- 
ranging the others and the whole universe. In accordance with this 
theory I have drawn up the plan of my work. 
206. Galileo’s Discovery of the Satellites of Jupiter 
(Brewster, David, Martyrs of Science. London, 1841) 
The following selection is illustrative of the work of the early 
scientists, and shows the new basis for the study of phenomena 
and the methods of arriving at truth. Galileo was a professor at 
the University of Pisa, in Italy. Such discoveries were ill re- 
ceived by the followers of Aristotle.

On the 7th of January, 1610, at one o’clock in the morning, when 
Galileo directed his telescope to Jupiter, he observed three stars near 
the body of the planet, two being to the east and one to the west of him. 
They were all in a straight line, and parallel to the ecliptic and appeared 
brighter than other stars of the same magnitude. Believing them to be 
fixed stars, he paid no great attention to their distances from Jupiter 
and from one another. On the 8th of January, however, when, from 
some cause or other, he had been led to observe the stars again, he found 
a very different arrangement of them; all the three were on the west 
side of Jupiter, nearer one another than before and almost at equal dis- 
tances. Though he had not turned his attention to the extraordinary 
fact of the mutual approach of the stars, yet he began to consider how 
Jupiter could be found to the east of the three 
stars, when but the day before he had been 
to the west of two of them. The only expla- 
nation which he could give of this fact was 
that the motion of Jupiter was direct, con- 
trary to the astronomical calculations, and 
that he had got before these two stars by his 
own motion. 
In this dilemma between the testimony of 
his senses and the results of calculation, he 
waited for the following night with the utmost 
anxiety, but his hopes were disappointed, for 
the heavens were wholly veiled in clouds. On 
  Fic. 45 the roth, two only of the stars appeared, and 
GatiLeo GALILEI both on the east side of the planet. As it was 
(1564-1642) obviously impossible that Jupiter could have 
advanced from west to east on the 8th of Jan- 
uary, and from east to west on the roth, Galileo was forced to conclude 
that the phenomenon which he had observed arose from the motion of 
the stars, and he set himself to observe diligently their change of place. 
On the 11th there were still only two stars, and both to the east of 
Jupiter, but the more eastern star was now twice as large as the other 
one, though on the preceding night they had been perfectly equal. 
This fact threw a new light on Galileo’s difficulties, and he imme- 
diately drew the conclusion, which he considered to be indubitable, 
“that there were in the heavens three stars which revolve around Jupi- 
ter, in the same manner as Venus and Mercury revolve around the sun.” 
On the 12th of January he again observed them in new positions, and of 
different magnitudes; and on the 13th he discovered a fourth star, 
which completed the four secondary planets with which Jupiter is sur- 
rounded.

THE. RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY. 323 
  207. The Abjuration of Galileo 
(Routledge, R., History of Science, p. 123. London, 1881) 
The Copernican theory made a strong appeal to Galileo, and 
he expounded it with much fervor. For this he was called to 
Rome by the Cardinals of the Inquisition, in 1615, who pro- 
nounced sentence (Routledge, pp. 119-22) against him; con- 
demned the Copernican theory as “absurd in philosophy” and 
“expressly contrary to Holy Scripture”; and compelled him to 
recant (1616). On the election of a new Pope who had _ been 
Galileo’s friend he thought that, under the changed conditions, 
he might now be permitted larger liberty, and in 1632 he pub- 
lished his celebrated Dialogue on the Two Chief Systems of the 
World, the Ptolemaic and the Copernican, in which he took the 
Ptolemaic side, but upheld it only feebly. For this he was again 
called to Rome, and compelled by the Inquisitorial body to recant 
and abjure, as follows: 
I, Galileo Galilei, son of the late Vicenzo Galilei of Florence, aged 
seventy years, being brought personally to judgment, and kneeling 
before you, Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lords Cardinals, Gen- 
eral Inquisitors of the universal Christian Republic against heretical 
depravity, having before my eyes the Holy Gospels, which I touch with 
my own hands, swear, that I have always believed, and now believe, 
and with the help of God will in future believe, every article which the 
Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of Rome holds, teaches, and 
preaches. But because I had been enjoined by this Holy Office al- 
together to abandon the false opinion which maintains that the sun is 
the center and immovable, and forbidden to hold, defend, or teach the 
said false doctrine in any manner, and after it had been signified to me 
that the said doctrine is repugnant with the Holy Scripture, I have 
written and printed a book, in which I treat of the same doctrine now 
condemned, and adduce reasons with great force in support of the same, 
without giving solution, and therefore have been judged grievously sus- 
pected of heresy; that is to say, that I held and believed that the sun is 
the center of the world and immovable, and that the sun is not the cen- 
ter and moveable. 
Wishing, therefore, to remove from the mindsof your Eminences, and 
of every Catholic Christian, this vehement suspicion rightfully enter- 
tained towards me, with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith, I abjure, 
curse, and detest the said errors and heresies, and generally every other 
error and sect contrary to the said Holy Church; and I swear that I 
will never more in future say or assert anything verbally, or in writing, 
which may give rise to a similar suspicion of me; but if I shall know any

may be. 
I swear, moreover, and promise, that I will fulfil, and observe fully, 
all the penances which have been or shall be laid to me by this Holy 
Office. But if it shall happen that I violate any of my said promises, 
oaths, and protestations (which God avert!), I subject myself to all the 
pains and punishments which have been decreed and promulgated by 
the sacred canons, and other general and particular constitutions, 
against delinquents of this description. So may God help me, and 
His Holy Gospels, which I touch with my own hands.

and bound myself, as above, and in witness thereof with my own hand 
have subscribed this present writing of my abjuration, which I have

208. Francis Bacon on Scientific Progress 
(Francis Bacon, Novum Organum, book 1, Ixxxviii-xc) 
The great service of Francis Bacon to modern science lay in the 
formulation and statement of the inductive method of work and 
thinking, and in pointing out the vast 
field of usefulness of such a method in 
discovering truth. This he did in his 
Novum Organum, published in 1620, so 
named because he regarded it as a great 
improvement over the deductive Orga- 
non of Aristotle, which had dominated 
all thinking during the later Middle 
Ages. In the following extract from this 
’ work Bacon sets forth the difficulties 
encountered by those who propose the 
use of new means of arriving at truth. 
  Fic. 46. Francis BAcoN 
(1561-1626) We cannot, therefore, wonder that no 
magnificent Discoveries, worthy of man- 
kind, have been brought to light, whilst men are satisfied and delighted 
with such scanty and puerile tasks, nay even think that they have 
pursued or attained some great object in their accomplishment. 
lxxxix. Nor should we neglect to observe that Natural Philosophy 
has, in every age, met with a troublesome and difficult opponent: I 
mean Superstition, and a blind and immoderate zeal for Religion. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY ~ 325 
we see that among the Greeks those who first disclosed the natural 
causes of Thunder and Storms to the yet untrained ears of man, were 
condemned as guilty of impiety towards the Gods. Nor did some of 
the old Fathers of Christianity treat those much better who showed by 
the most positive proofs (such as no one now disputes) that the Earth is 
spherical, and thence asserted that there were Antipodes. 
Even in the present state of things the condition of discussions on 
Natural philosophy is rendered more difficult and dangerous by the 
Summaries and Methods of Divines, who, after reducing Divinity into 
such order as they could, and bringing it into a Scientific form, have 
proceeded to mingle an undue proportion of the contentious and 
thorny Philosophy of Aristotle with the Substance of Religion. 
xc. Again, in the habits and regulations of Schools, Universities, 
and the like Assemblies, destined for the abode of learned men, and the 
improvement of learning, everything is found to be opposed to the 
progress of the Sciences. For the Lectures and Exercises are so or- 
dered, that any thing out of the common track can scarcely enter the 
thoughts and contemplations of the mind. If, however, one or two 
have perhaps dared to use their liberty, they can only impose the labour 
on themselves, without deriving any advantage from the association of 
others: and if they put up with this, they will find their industry and 
spirit of no slight disadvantage to them in making their fortune. For 
the Pursuits of men in such situations are, as it were, chained down to 
the writings of particular Authors, and if any one dare to dissent from 
them, he is immediately attacked as a turbulent and revolutionary 
spirit. Yet how great is the difference between Civil Matters and the 
Arts; for there is not the same danger from new activity and new light. 
In Civil matters even a change for the better is suspected on account of 
the commotion it occasions; for Civil government is supported by au- 
thority, unanimity, fame, and public opinion, and not by demonstra- 
tion. In the Arts and Sciences, on he contrary, every department 
should resound, as in mines, with new Works and advances. And this 
is the Rational, though not the actual, view of the case: for that ad- 
ministration and Government of Science we have spoken of, is wont too 
rigorously to repress its growth. 
209. The Importance of Bacon’s Work 
(T. B. Macaulay, Essay on Lord Bacon; Edinburgh Review, July, 1837) 
The following summary states well the importance of the work 
done by Bacon in formulating the inductive method of study. 
. .. Bacon was not, as we have already seen, the inventor of the in- 
ductive method. He was not even the person who first analyzed the 
inductive method correctly, though he undoubtedly analyzed it more  
-P-A-G-E-352
    _$26 “READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
minutely than any who preceded him. He was not the person who first 
showed that by the inductive method alone new truth could be dis- 
covered. But he was the person who first turned the minds of spec- 
ulative men, long occupied in verbal disputes, to the discovery of new 
and useful truth; and, by doing so, he at once gave to the inductive 
method an importance and dignity which had never before belonged to 
it. He was not the maker of that road; he was not the discoverer of 
that road; he was not the person who first surveyed and mapped that 
road. But he was the person who first called the public attention to an 
inexhaustible mine of wealth, which had been utterly neglected, and 
which was accessible by that road alone. By doing so, he caused that 
read, which had previously been trodden only by peasants and higglers, 
to be frequented by a higher class of travellers. 
By stimulating men to the discovery of new truth, Bacon stimulated 
them to employ the inductive method, the only method, even the an- 
cient philosophers and the schoolmen themselves being judges, by 
which new truth can be discovered. By stimulating men to the dis- 
covery of useful truth, he furnished them with a motive to perform the 
inductive process well and carefully. His predecessors had been, in his 
phrase, not interpreters, but anticipators of nature. They had been 
content with the first principles at which they had arrived by the most 
scanty and slovenly induction. And why was this? It was, we con- 
ceive, because their philosophy proposed to itself no practical end, be- 
cause it was merely an exercise of the mind. A man who wants to con- 
trive a new machine or a new medicine has a strong motive to observe 
accurately and patiently, and to try experiment after experiment. But 
aman who merely wants a theme for disputation or declamation has no 
such motive. He is therefore content with premises grounded on as- 
sumption, or on the most scanty and hasty induction. Thus, we con- 
ceive, the schoolmen acted. On their foolish premises they often 
argued with great ability; and as their object was “assensum subju- 
gare, non res,” to be victorious in controversy, not to be victorious over 
nature, they were consistent. For just as much logical skill could be 
shown in reasoning on false as on true premises. But the followers of 
the new philosophy, proposing to themselves the discovery of useful 
truth as their object, must have altogether failed of attaining the object 
if they had been content to build theories on superficial induction. 
What Bacon did for inductive philosophy may, we think, be fairly 
stated thus. The objects of preceding speculators were objects which 
could be attained without careful induction. Those speculators, there- 
fore, did not perform the inductive process carefully. Bacon stirred up 
men to pursue an object which could be attained only by induction, and
-P-A-G-E-353
  THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 327 
by induction carefully performed; and consequently induction was 
more carefully performed. We do not think that the importance of 
what Bacon did for inductive philosophy has ever been overrated. 
But we think that the nature of his services is often mistaken, and 
was not fully understood even by himself. It was not by furnishing 
philosophers with rules for performing the inductive process well, but 
by furnishing them with a motive for performing it well, that he con- 
ferred so vast a benefit on society.

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE NEW SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND. THE SCHOOLS 
Tue Readings contained in this chapter illustrate the application 
of the new scientific method to the theory and practice of the 
school, and show the influence exerted by it upon education. 
Before the eighteenth century this was not large, as the schools 
remained centers for the preservation of orthodoxy, and conserv- 
atively clung to religious instruction as their chief work. _ Still, 
some beginnings of importance were made, and these the Read- 
ings of this chapter have been selected to illustrate. 
The influence of the new thinking manifested itself in three 
different stages, classified as: 
1. Humanistic realism; that is, the attempt so to study the 
classics as to obtain useful knowledge from them. 
2. Social realism, which largely rejected the learning of the 
schools as pedantic, and erected an ideal for the education of a 
gentleman in the affairs of the world by means of the new modern 
languages, studies, and travel. 
3. Sense realism, which tried to turn the instruction in the 
schools to a study of real things, and the teaching of useful 
information. 
Rabelais and Milton stand as examples of the first stage. The 
selection from Rabelais (210) shows him in sympathy with the 
* best ideas of the age, though prudence compelled him to write as 
a clown and a fool. The two extracts from Milton give first 
(211) his statement of the new civic-religious aim of education, 
and second (212) the program of study he would follow to impart 
useful knowledge. 
Social realism represents the reaction of the nobility and landed 
gentry against the education of the time. The selection from 
Adamson (213) states well the reasons for the discontent of these 
classes with the existing schools. Montaigne and Locke stand 
as the two most important exemplars of social realism. Both 
wrote at some length on the education of a gentleman’s son, and 
the three extracts (214, 215, 216) serve well to give the point of 
view of each. Locke also later wrote an important report on the
-P-A-G-E-355
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 329 
workhouse education of pauper children. His plan (217) was 
thoroughly typical of English practices, and can be read almost 
as well in connection with the English attitude as described in 
chapter xu or chapter Xvi. 
The great exponent of sense realism as applied to education 
was the Moravian teacher and bishop, Johann Amos Comenius. 
He was the dominating educational thinker of the seventeenth 
century, as well as one of the great figures in the history of all 
education. In a large volume entitled The Great Didactic he 
attempted an organization of the aim, purpose, principles, method, 
and desirable scope of education, and of this the title-page (218) 
and table of contents (219) are reproduced. To show still better 
the very modern character of his ideas, his plan for the organiza- 
tion of a gymnasium, outlined for the authorities at Saros-Patak, 
in Hungary (1650-54), is reproduced (220) in abbreviated form. 
Compared with the schools of his contemporaries in Europe this 
was modern in the extreme. 
For the schools Comenius wrote a series of textbooks, by means 
of which the pupil learned not only Latin by a far better method, 
but also learned about the world of things besides. These text- 
books were highly realistic in character. The introductory book, 
a primer and first reader known as the Orbis Pictus, was cele- 
brated for two centuries and was translated into almost all lan- 
guages. To show the character of this first illustrated school- 
book, a few sample pages, from three different editions of it, are 
reproduced (221). The commanding position of Comenius in 
the history of education has been well summed up by President 
Butler, from whose notable address a brief extract (222) is taken. 
The attempt to introduce the new scientific studies into the 
schools made but slow headway. In the elementary schools 
little was done before the nineteenth century, and the same was 
largely true of the secondary schools, outside of Teutonic lands. 
In Germany a notable development came in the early establish- 
ment of realschulen, the need for which is set forth in the extract 
from Gesner (223). In the universities the new scientific learning 
obtained but little hearing before about the beginning of. the 
eighteenth century. One of the early centers for mathematical 
and scientific studies was the University of Cambridge, concern- 
ing which two selections are introduced. One is a small handbill, 
under date of 1693 (225), in which an instructor offers to give  
-P-A-G-E-356
  330 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
certain scientific and mathematical courses privately; and the 
other is a scheme of study (224), printed in 1707, in which the 
mathematical and scientific courses then offered are listed. 
210. Rabelais on the Nature of Education 
(Rabelais, Francois, Heroic Deeds of Pantagruel, book 11, chap. vu; trans. by 
Urquhart. London, 1890) 
Frangois Rabelais was a French monk, curé, physician, and 
university scholar who was out of touch with his times, and who 
keenly satirized the medizval follies and formalism of his age. 
In a satirical story of a giant and the education of his son, which 
he called the Life of Gargantua (1535) and the Heroic Deeds of 
Pantagruel (1533), he has given us, under the form of a letter 
from the giant to his son, his ideas as to the character of the edu- 
cation he thought desirable. This letter classifies Rabelais as a 
humanistic realist, in sympathy with the best ideas of the scholars 
of the Italian Renaissance. After a long introduction, the letter 
concludes as follows: 
My dear son: . . . Thou art at Paris, where the laudable examples of 
many brave men may stir up thy mind to gallant actions, and hast 
likewise for thy tutor and pedagogue the learned Epistemion, who by 
his lively and vocal arguments may instruct thee in the arts and sci- 
ences. ; 
I intend, and will have it so, that thou learn the languages perfectly; 
first of all, the Greek, as Quintilian will have it; secondly, the Latin; 
and then the Hebrew, for the Holy Scripture- 
sake; and then the Chaldee and Arabic likewise, 
and that thou frame thy style in Greek in imita- 
tion of Plato; and for the Latin, after Cicero. 
Let there be no history which thou shalt not 
have ready in thy memory; — unto the prose- 
cuting of which design, books of cosmography 
will be very conducible, and help thee much. 
) Of the liberal arts of geometry, arithmetic, and 
music, I gave thee some taste when thou wert 
yet little, and not above five or six years old. 
Proceed further in them, and learn the remain- 
der if thou canst. As for astronomy, study all 
the rules thereof. Let pass, nevertheless, the

(1483-1553) divining and judicial astrology, and the arts of 
Lullius, as being nothing else but plain abuses 
and vanities. As for the civil law, of that I would have thee to know 
the fair texts by heart, and then to confer them with philosophy.
-P-A-G-E-357
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 331 
Now, in the matter of the knowledge of the works of nature, I would 
have thee study that exactly; that so there be no sea, river, nor foun- 
tain, of which thou dost not know the fishes; all the fowls of the air; 
all the several kinds of shrubs and trees, whether in forest or orchards; 
all the sorts of herbs and flowers that grow upon the ground; all the 
various metals that are hid within the bowels of the earth; together with 
all the diversity of precious stones, that are to be seen in the orient and 
south parts of the world. Let nothing of all these be hidden from thee. 
Then fail not most carefully to peruse the books of the Greek, Arabian, 
and Latin physicians, not despising the Talmudists and Cabalists; and 
by frequent anatomies get thee the perfect knowledge of that other 
world, called the microcosm, which is man. And at some of the hours 
of the day apply thy mind to the study of the Holy Scriptures; first, in 
Greek, the New Testament, with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then 
the Old Testament in Hebrew. In brief, let me see thee an abyss, and 
bottomless pit of knowledge; for from henceforward, as thou growest 
great and becomest a man, thou must part from this tranquillity and 
rest of study, thou must learn chivalry, warfare, and the exercises of the 
field, the better thereby to defend my house and our friends, and to 
succor and protect them at all their needs, against the invasion and 
assaults of evil-doers. 
Furthermore I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast 
profited, which thou canst not better do, than by maintaining publicly 
theses and conclusions in all arts, against all persons whatsoever, and 
by haunting the company of learned men, both at Paris and other- 
where. .. . Reverence thy preceptors: shun the conversation of those 
whom thou desirest not to resemble; and receive not in vain the graces 
which God hath bestowed upon thee. And, when thou shalt see that 
thou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that 
part, return unto me, that I may see thee, and give thee my blessing 
before I die. My son, the peace and grace of our Lord be with thee, 
Amen. Thy Father 
GARGANTUA From Utopia, the t7th day of the month of March 
211. Milton’s Statement of the Aim and Purpose of Education 
(John Milton, Tractate on Education. London, ed. of 1673) 
John Milton (1608-74), the English poet and friend of human- 
ity, science, and education, published, in 1644, a little book of 
twenty-three pages which he called a Tractate on Education. In 
it he defined education, both as to aim and means and scope, as 
follows: 
The end then of Learning is to repair the ruines of our first Parents 
by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love  
-P-A-G-E-358
  
  332 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
him, to imitate him, to be like him, as we may the neerest by possessing 
our souls of true vertue, which being united to the heavenly grace of 
faith makes up the highest perfection. 
But because our understanding cannot in this body found it self but 
on sensible things, nor arrive so clearly to the knowledge of God and 
things invisible, as by orderly conning over the visible and inferior 
creature, the same method is necessarily to be followed in all discreet 
teaching. 
And seeing every Nation affords not experience and tradition enough 
for all kinds of Learning, therefore we are chiefly taught the Languages 
of those people who have at any time been most industrious after Wis- 
dom; so that Language is but the Instrument conveying to us things 
usefull to be known. 
And though a Linguist should pride himself to have all the Tongues 
that Babel cleft the world into, yet, if he have not studied the solid 
things in them as well as the Words & Lexicons, he were nothing so 
much to beesteem’d a learned man, as any Yeoman or Tradesman com- 
petently wise in his Mother Dialect only. . 
I call therefore a compleat and generous Education that which fits 
a man to perform justly, skilfully and magnanimously all the offices 
both private and publick of Peace and War. 
| 
212. Milton’s Program for Study 
(John Milton, Tractate on Education. London, ed. of 1673) 
In the Tractate Milton outlines his ideas as to the content of a 
humanistic-realistic course of instruction for “noble and gentle 
youth,” covering the years from twelve to twenty-one, as follows: 
For their Studies, First they should begin with the chief and neces- 
sary rules of some good Grammar, either that now us’d (Lily’s), or any 
better. . . . Next to make them expert in the usefullest points of Gram- 
mar, .. . some easie and delightful Book of Education would be read 
to them; whereof the Greeks have store, as Cebes, Plutarch, and other 
Socratic discourses. But in Latin we have none of classic authority 
extant, except the two or three first Books of Quintilian, and some se- 
lect pieces elsewhere. .. . At the same time, some other hour of the 
day, might be taught to them the rules of Arithmetick, and soon after 
the Elements of Geometry even playing, as the old manner was. After 
evening repast, till bed-time their thoughts will be best taken up in the 
easie grounds of Religion, and the story of the Scriptures. 
The next step (13 to 16) would be to the Authors of Agriculture, 
Cato, Varro, and Columella, for the matter is most easie, and if the 
language be difficult, so much the better, it is not a difficulty above 
their years. And here will be an occasion of inciting and inabling them
-P-A-G-E-359
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 333 
hereafter to improve the tillage of their Country, to recover the bad 
Soil, and to remedy the waste that is made of good; for this was one of 
Hercules praises. Ere half these Authors be read they cannot chuse 
but be masters of any ordinary prose. So that it will be then season- 
able for them to learn in any modern Author, the use of Globes, and all 
the Maps; first with the old names, and then with the new: or they 
might be then capable to read any compendious method of natural 
Philosophy. And at the same time might be entering the Greek 
tongue, after the same manner as was before 
prescrib’d in the Latin; whereby the diffi- 
culties of Grammar being soon overcome, all 
the Historical Physiology of Aristotle and 
Theophrastus are open before them, and as I 
may say, under contribution. The like access 
will be to Vitruvius, to Seneca’s natural ques- 
tions, to Mela, Celsus, Pliny, or Solinus.' 
And having thus past the principles of Arith- 
metick, Geometry, Astronomy and Geography 
with a general campact of Physicks, they 
may descend in Mathematicks to the instru- 
mental science of Trigonometry, and from 
thence to Fortification, Architecture, Engin- yg. 48. Joun M1LTon 
ry, or Navigation. And in Natural Philoso- (1608-76) 
phy they may proceed leisurely from the His- 
tory of Meteors, Minerals, plants and living Creatures as far as Anatomy 
(Aristotle). Then also in course might be read to them out of some 
not tedious Writer the Institution of Physic; that they may know the 
tempers, the humours, the seasons, and how to manage a crudity: 
which he can wisely and timely do, is not only a great Physitian to him- 
self, and to his friends, but also at some time or other, save an Army by 
this frugal and expenseless means only; and not let the healthy and 
stout bodies of young men rot away under him for want of this disci- 
pline; which is a great pity, and no less a shame to the Commander. 
To set forward all these proceedings in Nature and Mathematicks, 
what hinders, but that they may procure, as oft as shal be needful, the 
helpful experiences of Hunters, Fowlers, Fishermen, Shepherds, Gar- 
deners, Apothecaries; and in other sciences, Architects, Engineers, 
Mariners, Anatomists; who doubtless would be ready some for reward, 
and some to favour such a hopeful Seminary. And this will give them 
such a real tincture of natural knowledge, as they shall never forget, 
but daily augment with delight. Then also those poets which are 
now counted most hard, will be both facil and pleasant, Orpheus, Hesiod,    
  1 Vitruvius wrote on architecture, Seneca on natural philosophy, Mela wrote a 
geography, Celsus wrote eight books on medicine, Pliny wrote thirty-seven books 
on natural history, and Solinus wrote an abridged Pliny.

By this time (z5 or 16)... they may with some judgment contem- 
plate upon moral good and evil. Then will be requir’d a special rein- 
forcement of constant and sound endoctrinating to set them right and 
firm, instructing them more amply in the knowledge of Vertue and the 
hatred of Vice; while their young and pliant affections are led through 
all the moral works of Plato, Xenophon, Cicero, Plutarch, Laertius, and 
those Locrian remnents; but still to be reduct in their nightward studies 
wherewith they close the dayes work, under the determinate sentence of 
David or Solomon, or the Evange(l)s and Apostolic Scriptures. Being 
perfect in the knowledge of personal duty, they may then begin the 
study of Economics. And either now, or before this, they may have 
easily learnt at any odd hour the Italian Tongue. And soon after, but 
with wariness and good antidote, it wou d be wholesome enough to let 
them taste some choice Comedies, Greek, Latin, or Italian; Those 
Tragedies also that treat of Household matters, as Trachinie, Alcestis, 
and the like. The next remove must be to the study of Politicks; to 
know the beginning, end, and reason of Political Societies; that they 
may not in a dangerous fit of the Common-wealth be such poor, shaken, 
and uncertain Reeds, of such a tottering Conscience, as many of our 
great Counsellers have lately shewn themselves, but stedfast pillars of 
the State. 
After this they are to dive into the grounds of Law, and legal Justice; 
deliver’d first, and with best warrant by Moses, and as far as humane 
prudence can be trusted, in those extoll’d remains of Grecian Law- 
givers. Licurgus, Solon, Zaleucus, Charondas, and thence to all the 
Roman Edicts and Tables with their Justinian; and so down to the 
Saxon and common Laws of England, and the Statutes. Sundayes also 
and every evening may be now understandingly spent in the highest 
matters of Theology, and Church History ancient and modern: and ere 
this time the Hebrew Tongue at a set hour might have been gain’d, 
that the Scriptures may be now read in their own original; whereto it 
would be no impossibility to add the Chaldey, and the Syrian Dialect. 
When all these employments are well conquer’d, then will the choice 
Histories, Heroic Poems, and Attic Tragedies of stateliest and most 
regal argument, with all the famous Political Orations offer themselves; 
which if they were not only read; But some of them got by memory, 
and solemly pronounc’t with right accent,and grace,as mightbe taught, 
would endue them even with the spirit and vigor of Demosthenes or 
Cicero, Euripides, or Sophocles. 
And now lastly will be the time to read with them those organic arts 
which inable men to discourse and write perspicuously, elegantly, and 
according to the fitted stile of lofty, mean, or lowly. Logic therefore 
so much as is useful, is to be refer’d to this due place with all her well

coucht Heads and Topics, untill it be time to open her contracted palm 
into a gracefull and ornate Rhetorick taught out of the rule of Plato, 
Aristotle, Phalareus, Cicero, Hermogones, Longinus. ‘To which Poetry 
would be made subsequent, or indeed rather precedent, as being suttle 
and fine, but more simple, sensuous and passionate. I mean not here 
the prosody. of verse, which they could not but have hit on before 
among the rudiments of Grammar; but that sublime Art which in 
Aristitles Poetics, in Horace, and the Italian Commentaries of Castel- 
vetro, Tasso, Mazzoni, and others, teaches what the laws are of a true 
Epic Poem, what of a Dramatic, what of a Lyric, what Decomum is, 
which is the grand master-piece to observe. This would make them 
soon perceive what despicable creatures our comm(on) Rimers and 
Playwriters be, and shew them, what religious, what glorious and mag- 
nificent use might be made of Poetry both in divine and humane things. 
From hence and not till now will be the right season of forming them to 
be able Writers and Composers in every excellent matter, when they 
shall be thus fraught with an universal insight into things. Or whether 
they be to speak in Parliament or Counsel, honour and attention would 
be waiting on their lips. There would then also appear in Pulpits 
other Visages, other gestures, and stuff otherwise wrought then what we 
now sit under, oft times to as great a trial of our patience as any other 
that they preach to us. These are the Studies wherin our noble and 
our gentle youth ought to bestow their time in a disciplinary way from 
twelve to one and twenty; unless they rely more upon their ancestors 
dead, then upon themselves living. 
213. Discontent of the Nobility with the Schools 
(Adamson, J. W., Pioneers of Modern Education, pp. 177-79. Cambridge, 1905) 
The following extract from a recent English writer gives an ex- 
cellent brief statement as to why the nobility and gentry of the 
latter part of the sixteenth, and the beginning of the seventeenth, 
century, turned away from the humanistic schools of their time 
to the tutor-in-the-home, and to a finishing education in the 
courtly Academies which characterized the seventeenth and early 
eighteenth centuries in France, Italy, and German lands. 
. .. The discontent with conventional education felt by Montaigne, 
a recluse when public life was turbulent, was shared by many of his order 
when more peaceful days arrived and, with them, opportunities to en- 
joy the elegancies of life. 
At a time when travel had become familiar to the leisured class, and 
the grand tour constituted the crown of a wealthy man’s education, 
the schools did not concern themselves with modern tongues. They 
exhibited as little interest in those scientific studies, experiments, and
-P-A-G-E-362

336 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
inventions, which were so generally in men’s thoughts during the six- 
teen-hundreds, that it became almost ‘‘the mode” to dabble in anat- 
omy, chemistry, or some branch of physics. The schools left the fu- 
ture soldier ignorant of mathematics as pure seience very frequently, 
and almost always in its practical application to engineering, fortifica- 
tion, and the like; at school and university the future statesman re- 
ceived from the official round of studies no express training in jurispru- 
dence, politics, or state-craft generally, regarded as an actual science to 
be applied, there and then, to life and government. Certain arts, as 
drawing, painting, music, carving, and other forms of manual skill, were 
highly esteemed as accomplishments throughout European society in 
the mid-seventeenth century; the schools did nothing to make their 
attainment easy. The courtier aimed at a high standard of skill in 
riding, fencing, and dancing; the ordinary round of instruction gave 
him no help in these, nor in genealogy and heraldry, nor in the more 
scholastic studies of history and geography. As for the courtier’s all- 
important study of conduite, the art of conversation, compliment, bear- 
ing, and dress, it was usually supposed that the schools fostered an in- 
tolerable pedantry quite incompatible with any such elegancies. The 
collocation of “scholar and gentleman”’ was a later and an English 
conception; for the time we are considering Montaigne represents the 
common opinion in his antithesis of logician (or grammarian) and man 
of birth. 
Courtly education and scholastic education, therefore, fell apart, and 
the rift grew wider as the seventeenth century advanced and the court 
of Louis XIV became the model for all courts. The children of the 
great and noble ceased to attend school, and received their education 
from private tutors at home, completing the course, in the case of young 
men, at special establishments called Academies, in which the ideals of 
the courtly education were finally embodied. 
The demand for “accomplishments,” chiefly of a martial kind, first 
brought these Academies into being in France, where, during the clas- 
ing years of the sixteenth century, they began as schools of arms and 
horsemanship. . . . 
214. Montaigne ridicules the Humanistic Pedants 
(Michel Seigneur de Montaigne, Essay on the Education of Children, 1580; Essays 
book 1, chap. xxtv. Florio’s translation, 1632) 
In 1580 Montaigne published the first volume of his famous 
Essays in French; the first English edition being that of 1603. In 
the essay on Pedantry (chap. xxiv) he ridicules the humanistic 
type of education which had become common in his time, and the 
intellectual stupidity which resulted from such training. The 
following is a typical extract.
-P-A-G-E-363

If a man passe by, crie out to our people; Ok what a wise man goeth 
yonder! And of another: Oh what a good man is yonder! He will not 
faile to cast his eyes and respect toward the former. A third crier were 
needful, to say, Oh what blocke-heads are those! We are ever readie to 
aske, Hath he any skill in the Greeke and Latine tongue? can he write 
well? doth hee write in prose or verse? But whether hee be growne better 
or wiser, which should be the chiefest of his drift, that isnever spoken of, 
we should rather enquire who is better wise, than who is more wise. 
We labour, and toyle, and plod to fill the memorie, and leave both un- 
derstanding and conscience emptie. Even as birds flutter and skip 
from field to field to pecke up corne, or any graine, and without tasting 
the same, carrie it in their bils, therewith to feed their little ones; so 
doe our pedants gleane and picke learning from bookes, and never lodge 
it further than their lips, only to degorge and cast it to the wind. 
215. Montaigne’s Conception of Education 
(Montaigne, Essay on the Education of Children, 1580; Essays, book 1, chap. xxv) 
In the next essay, which is in the form of a letter to a lady 
friend who desired his advice on the Education of Children, Mon- 
taigne sets forth in some detail his con- 
ception of a practical education for a youth 
of noble birth. In this essay he broke 
completely with the humanists, and stood 
clearly for an education of the judgment 
and understanding — one that would pre- 
pare for proper life in the world of things 
and men. The following extracts from 
this essay are typical. 
A friend of mine then, having read the pre- 
ceding chapter, the other day told me, that I 
should a little longer have insisted upon the 
  és ; 3 Fic. education of children. . . . But, in truth, all MnGrEn Soe ane 
I understand as to that particular is only (x 533-92) 
this, that the greatest and most important 
difficulty of human science is the education of children. . . . 
For a boy of quality, then, who pretends to letters not upon account 
of profit, nor so much for outward ornament, as for his own proper and 
peculiar use, and to furnish and enrich himself within, having rather a 
desire to go out an accomplished cavalier and a fine gentleman, than a 
mere scholar and a learned man; for such a one, I say, I would also 
have his friends solicitous to find him out a tutor, who has rather a 
well-made than a well-filled head; seeking, indeed, both if such a person 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
    338 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
can be found, but rather to prefer his manners and his judgment before 
mere learning, and that this man should exercise his charge after a new 
method. 
°T is the custom of schoolmasters to be eternally thundering in their 
pupils’ ears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst their business is 
only to repeat what others have said before: now I would have a tutor 
to correct this error, and that at the very first, he should, according to 
the capacity he has to deal with, put it to the test, permitting his pupil 
to taste and relish things, and of himself to choose and discern them, 
sometimes opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving him to 
break the ice himself; that is, I would not have him alone invent and 
speak, but that he should also hear his pupil speak in turn. Let him 
make him examine and thoroughly sift every thing he reads, and lodge 
nothing in his fancy upon simple authority and trust. Aristotle’s 
principles will then be no more principles to him than those of Epicurus 
and the Stoics: let this diversity of opinions be propounded to and laid 
before him, he will himself choose, if he is able; if not, he will remain in 
doubt. For if he embraces the opinions of Xenephon and Plato by his 
own reason, they will no more be theirs, but become his own. Who fol- 
lows another follows nothing, finds nothing, nay, is inquisitive after 
nothing. Let him, at least, know what he knows. It will be necessary 
that he imbibe their knowledge, not that he be corrupted by their pre- 
cepts; and no matter if he forget where he had his learning, provided 
he know how to apply it to his own use. Truth and reason are com- 
mon to eyery one, and are no more his who spake them first, than his 
who speaks them after. . . . To know by rote is no knowledge, and sig- 
nifies no more but only to retain what one has entrusted to one’s 
memory. That which aman rightly knows and understands, he is 
free dispenser of at his own full liberty, without any regard to the 
author from whom he had it, or fumbling over the leaves of his book. 
A mere bookish learning is both troublesome and ungraceful; and 
though it may serve for some kind of ornament, there is yet no foun- 
dation for any superstructure to be built upon it. ... 
They begin to teach us to live when we have almost done living. The 
boy we would breed has a great deal less time to spare; he owes but the 
first fifteen or sixteen years of his life to education; the remainder is due 
to action: let us therefore employ that short time in necessary instruc- 
tion. Away with logical subtleties, they are abuses, things by which 
our lives can never be amended: take the plain philosophical discourses, 
learn first how rightly to choose, and then rightly to apply them; they 
are more easy to understand than one of Boccaccio’s novels; a child 
from nurse is much more capable of them than of learning to read and 
write. Philosophy has discourses equally proper for childhood as for 
the decrepit age of man... . 
I would not have this pupil of ours imprisoned and made a slave to
-P-A-G-E-365
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 339 
his book; nor would I have him given up to the morosity and melan- 
cholic humor of a sour, ill-natured pedant. I would not have his spirit 
cowed and subdued by applying him to the rack and tormenting him, 
as some do, fourteen or fifteen hours a day, and so make a pack-horse of 
him. . . . I would have his outward fashion and mein, and the disposi- 
tion of his limbs, formed at the same time as his mind. ’T is not a soul, 
*t is not a body that we are training up, but a man, and we ought not 
to divide him. And, as Plato says, we are not to fashion one without 
the other, but make them draw together like two horses hitched to a 
Coach: 3°... 
With such a one, after fifteen or sixteen years’ study, compare one of 
our college (secondary school) Latinists, who has thrown away so 
much time in learning nothing but to speak. The world is nothing but 
babble; and I hardly ever yet saw that man who did not rather prate 
too much, than speak too little; and yet half our age is embezzled this 
way. Weare kept four or five years to learn words only, and to tack 
them together into clauses; as many more to form them into long dis- 
course, divided into four or five parts; and other five years at least to 
learn succinctly to mix and interweave them after a subtle and intricate 
manner. Let us leave all this to those who make a profession of it. . . . 
We do not pretend to breed a grammarian or a logician, but a gentle- 
man; let us leave them to throw away their time at their own fancy: our 
business lies elsewhere. . . . ‘ 
No doubt but Greek and Latin are very great ornaments, and of 
very great use, but we buy them too dear: Not that fine speaking is not 
a very good and commendable quality; but not so excellent and so nec- 
essary as some would make it; and I am scandalized that our whole life 
should be spent in nothing else. I would first understand my own lan- 
guage, and that of my neighbors with whom most of my business and 
conversation lies. . 
To return to my eabiece there is nothing like alluring the appetite 
and affections; otherwise you make nothing but so many asses laden. 
with books, and by dint of your lash, you give them their pocketful of 
learning to keep; whereas, to do well, you should not only lodge it with 
them, but make them espouse it. 
216. Locke’s Thoughts on Education 
(Locke, John, Some Thoughts Concerning Education. London, 1693) 
The English philosopher, John Locke, a B.A. from Christ’s 
Church College at Oxford, had for a time (1677-83) served as a 
tutor to two boys of noble birth. For his political activity he was 
exiled (1683-89) during the latter days of the reign of Charles II, 
and went to Holland to live. While there he corresponded
-P-A-G-E-366
  340 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
with his friend, William Clark, an English M.P., on the bringing- 
up of a boy of good birth and station in life, and after his return 
to England the letters were edited and published (1693) under the 
title of Some Thoughts on Education. He wrote exclusively on 
the education of a gentleman by the private-tutor method, and 
described the practices of English upper-class society rather than 
the practices of the schools. 
The treatise is quite lengthy, and deals with such subjects as 
clothing, diet, habits, punishments, re- 
wards, manners, good_breeding, recrea- 
tions, requisites of a gentleman, intellec- 
tual education, the mother tongue, Latin 
and Greek, recreation, and travel. The 
following extract is typical and illustrative 
of Locke’s point of view. 
As the Father’s Example must teach the 
Child Respect for his Tutor, so the Tutor’s 
Example must lead the Child into those Ac- 
tions he would have him do. His Practice 
must by no means cross his Precepts, unless 
Fic. 50. Jonn Locxe _ he intend to set him wrong. It will be to no 
(1632-1704) Purpose for the Tutor to talk of the Restraint 
of the Passions whilst any of his own are let 
loose; and he will in vain endeavour to reform any Vice or Indecency 
in his Pupil, which he allows in himself. Ill Patterns are sure to be 
follow’d more than good Rules; . . . 
In all the whole Business of Education, there is nothing like to be 
less hearken’d to, or harder to be well observ’d, than what I am now 
going to say; and that is, that Children should, from their first begin- 
ning to talk, have some discreet, sober, nay, wise Person about them, 
whose Care it should be to fashion them aright, and keep them from all 
Ill, especially the infection of bad company. I think this province re- 
quires great Sobriety, Temperance, Tenderness, Diligence, and Discre- 
tion; Qualities hardly to be found united in Persons that are to be had 
for ordinary Salaries, nor easily to be found any where. . . . 
The Consideration of Charge ought not to deter those who are able. 
The great Difficulty will be where to find a proper Person: For those of 
small Age, Parts, and Vertue, are unfit for this Employment, and those 
that have greater, will hardly be got to undertake such a Charge. You 
must therefore look out early, and enquire every where; for the World 
has People of all Sorts... . 
. +. one fit to educate and form the Mind of a young Gentleman is 
   
-P-A-G-E-367
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 341 
not every where to be found, and more than ordinary Care is to be 
taken in the Choice of him, or else you may fail of your End. 
The Character of a sober Man and a Scholar is, as I have above ob- 
serv’d, what every one expects ina Tutor. This generally is thought 
enough, and is all that Parents commonly look for: But when such an 
one has Empty’d out into his Pupil all the Latin and Logick he has 
brought from the University, will that Furniture make him a fine Gen- 
tleman? Or can it be expected, that he should be better bred, better 
skill’d in the World, better principled in the Grounds and Foundations 
of true Virtue and Generosity, than his young Tutor is? 
To form a young Gentleman as he should be, ’t is fit his Governor 
should himself be well-bred, understanding the Ways of Carriage and 
Measures of Civility in all the Variety of Persons, Times, and Places; 
and keep his Pupil, as much as his Age requires, constantly to the Ob- 
servation of them. This is an Art not to be learnt nor taught by 
Books. Nothing can give it but good Company and Observation 
join’d together. The Taylor may make his Clothes modish, and the 
Dancing-master give Fashion to his Motions; yet neither of these, tho’ 
they set off well, make a well-bred Gentleman: No, tho’ he have Learn- 
ing, to boot, which, if not well manag’d, makes him more impertinent 
and intolerable in Conversation. Breeding is that which sets a Gloss 
upon all his other good Qualities, and renders them useful to him, in 
procuring him the Esteem and Good-will of all that he comes near. 
Without good Breeding his other Accomplishments make him pass but 
for proud, conceited, vain, or foolish. 
Courage in an ill-bred Man has the Air and escape not the Opinion 
of Brutality: Learning becomes Pedantry; Wit, Buffoonry Plainness, 
Rusticity; good Nature, Fawning. And there cannot be a good Qual- 
ity in him, which Want of Breeding will not warp and disfigure to his 
Disadvantage. 
Besides being well-bred, the Tutor should know the World well; the 
Ways, the Humours, the Follies, the Cheats, the Faults of the Age he is 
fallen into, and particularly of the Country he lives in. These he should 
be able to shew to his Pupil, as he finds him capable; teach him skill in 
Men, and their Manners; pull off the Mask which their several Callings 
and Pretences cover them with, and make his pupil discern what lies 
at the Bottom under such Appearances. ... that when he comes to 
launch into the Deep himself, he may not be like one at Sea without a 
Line, Compass, or Sea-Chart; but may have some Notice before-hand 
of the Rocks and Shoals, the Currents and Quick-sands, and know a 
little how to steer, that he sink not before he get Experience. .. . 
A great Part of the Learning now in Fashion in the Schools of Eu- 
rope, and that goes ordinarily into the Round of Education, a Gentle- 
man may in a good Measure be unfurnish’d with, without any great 
   
-P-A-G-E-368
  342 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Disparagement to himself or Prejudice to his Affairs. But Prudence 
and good breeding are in all the Stations and Occurrences of Life neces- 
sary; and most young Men suffer in want of them, and come rawer and 
more awkwa d into the World than they should, for this very Reason, . 
because these Qualities, which are of all other the most necessary to be 
taught, and stand most in need of the Assistance and Help of a Teacher, 
are generally neglected and thought but a slight or no Part of a Tutor’s 
Business. Latin and Learning make all the Noise; and the main 
Stress is laid upon his Proficiency in Things a great Part whereof belong 
not to a Gentleman’s Calling; which is to have the Knowledge of a Man 
of Business, a Carriage suitable to his Rank, and be eminent and useful 
in his Country, according to his Station... . 
The great Work of a Governor, is to fashion the Carriage, and form 
the Mind; to settle in his Pupil good Habits and the Principles of Vir- 
tue and Wisdom; to give him by little and little a View of Mankind, 
and to work him into a Love and Imitation of what is excellent and 
praise-worthy; and, in the Prosecution of it, to give him Vigour, Activ- 
ity, and Industry. The Studies which he sets him upon, are but as it 
were the Exercises of his Faculties, and Employment of his Time, to 
keep him from Sauntering and Idleness, to teach him Application, and 
accustom him to take Pains, and to give him some little Taste of what 
his own Industry must perfect. For who expects, that under a Tutor a 
young Gentleman should be an accomplish’d Critick, Orator, or Logi- 
cian? go to the Bottom of Metaphysicks, natural Philosophy, or Mathe- 
maticks? or be a Master in History or Chronology? though something 
of each of these is to be taught him: But it is only to open the Door, 
that he may look in, and as it were begin an acquaintance, but not to 
dwell there: And a Governor would be much blam’d that should keep 
his Pupil too long, and lead him too far in most of them. But of good 
Breeding, Knowledge of the World, Virtue, Industry, and a Love of 
Reputation, he cannot have too much: And if he have these, he will not 
long want what he needs or desires of the other. 
. .. We learn not to live, but to dispute; and our Education fits us 
rather for the University than the World. But ’t is no wonder if those 
who make the Fashion suit it to what they have, and not to what their 
Pupils want. The Fashion being once establish’d, who can think it 
strange, that in this, as well as in all other Things, it should prevail? . . . 
Reason, if consulted with, would advise, that their Children’s Time 
should be spent in acquiring what might be useful to them when they 
come to be Men, rather than to have their heads stuff’d with a deal of 
Trash, a great Part whereof they usually never do (’t is certain they 
never need to) think on again as long as they live; and so much of it as 
does stick by them they are only the worse for. This is so well known, 
that I appeal to Parents themselves, who have been at Cost to have
-P-A-G-E-369
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 343 
their young Heirs taught it, whether it be not ridiculous for their Sons 
to have any Tincture of that Sort of Learning, when they come abroad 
into the World? whether any Appearance of it would not lessen and 
disgrace them in Company? And that certainly must be an admirable 
Acquisition, and deserves well to make a Part in Education, which Men 
are asham’d of where they are most concern’d to shew their Parts and 
’ Breeding. 
217. Locke’s Plan for Working-Schools for Poor Children 
(Fox Bourne, H. R., Life of John Locke, vol. u, p. 383. London, 1876) 
When the English philosopher, John Locke, was sixty-four 
years old (1696), his high sense of duty induced him to accept 
an appointment from the King, as Commissioner of Trade and 
Plantations. In connection with his work in this office he pre- 
pared a plan for bringing up the children of paupers. While the 
plan as proposed was never adopted, it is nevertheless so typical 
of English attitudes and practices with reference to the education 
of the children of the poor, and states so clearly the ideas of com- 
pulsory education and compulsory taxation, that it is included 
here as an important document relating to the education of the 
children of the poor and compulsory taxation therefor. 
The children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the par- 
ish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour is gen- 
erally lost to the public till they are twelve or fourteen years old. 
The most effectual remedy for this that we are able to conceive, and 
which we therefore humbly propose, is, that, in the fore-mentioned 
new law to be enacted, it be further provided that working schools be 
set up in every parish, to which the children of all such as demand re- 
lief of the parish, above three and under fourteen years of age, whilst 
they live at home with their parents, and are not otherwise employed 
for their livelihood by the allowance of the overseers of the poor, shall 
be obliged to come. 
By this means the mother will be eased of a great part of her trouble 
in looking after and providing for them at home, and so be at the more 
liberty to work; the children will be kept in much better order, be 
better provided for, and from infancy be inured to work, which is of 
no small consequence to the making of them sober and industrious all 
their lives after; and the parish will be either eased of this burden or 
at least of the misuse in the present management of it. For, a great 
number of children giving a:poor man a title to an allowance from the 
parish, this allowance is given once a week or once a month to the 
father in money which he not seldom spends on himself at the alehouse, 
whilst his children, for whose sake he had it, are left to suffer, or perish

under the want of necessaries, unless the charity of neighbours relieve 
them. 
We humbly conceive that a man and his wife in health may be able 
by their ordinary labour to maintain themselves and two children. 
More than two children at one time under the age of three years will 
seldom happen in one family. If therefore all the children above 
three years old be taken off from their hands, those who have never so 
many, whilst they remain themselves in health, will not need any 
allowance for them. 
We do not suppose that children of three years old will be able at 
that age to get their livelihoods at the working school, but we are sure 
that what is necessary for their relief will more effectually have that 
use if it be distributed to them in bread at that school than if it be 
given to their fathers in money. What they have at home from their 
parents is seldom more than bread and water, and that, many of them, 
very scantily too. If therefore care be taken that they have each of 
them their belly-full of bread daily at school, they will be in no danger 
of famishing, but, on the contrary, they will be healthier and stronger 
than those who are bred otherwise. Nor will this practice cost the 
overseers any trouble; for a baker may be agreed with to furnish and 
bring into the school-house every day the allowance of bread necessary 
for all the scholars that are there. And to this may be also added, 
without any trouble, in cold weather, if it be thought needful, a little 
warm water-gruel; for the same fire that warms the room may be made 
use of to boil a pot of it. 
From this method the children will not only reap the fore-mentioned 
advantages with far less charge to the parish than what is now done 
for them, but they will be also thereby the more obliged to come to 
school and apply themselves to work, because otherwise they will have 
no victuals, and also the benefit thereby both to themselves and the 
parish will daily increase; for, the earnings of their labour at school 
every day increasing, it may reasonably be concluded that, computing 
all the earnings of a child during that whole time will cost the parish 
nothing; whereas there, is no child now which from its birth is main- 
tained by the parish but, before the age of fourteen, costs the parish 
£50 or £60. 
Another advantage also of bringing children thus to a working 
school is that by this means they may be obliged to come constantly 
to church every Sunday, along with their schoolmasters or dames, 
whereby they may be brought into some sense of religion; whereas 
ordinarily now, in their idle and loose way of breeding up, they are as 
utter strangers both to religion and morality as they are to industry. 
In order therefore to the more effectual carrying on of this work to 
the advantage of this kingdom, we further humbly propose that these 
schools be generally for spinning and knitting, or some other part of
-P-A-G-E-371
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND THE SCHOOLS 345 
the woolen manufacture, unless in countries (that is, districts) where 
the place shall furnish some other materials fitter for the employment 
of such poor children; in which places the choice of those materials for 
their employment may be left to the prudence and direction of the 
guardians of the poor of that hundred. And that the teachers in these 
schools be paid out of the poor’s rate, as can be agreed. 
This, though at first setting up may cost the parish a little, yet we 
humbly conceive (the earnings of the children abating the charge of 
their maintenance, and as much work being required of each of them 
as they are reasonably able to perform) it will qaey pay its own 
charges with an overplus. 
That, where the number of the poor children of any aneets is greater 
than for them all to be employed in one school they be there divided 
into two, and the boys and girls, if thought convenient, taught and 
kept to work separately. 
That the handicraftsmen in each hundred be bound to take every 
other of their respective apprentices from amongst the boys in some 
one of the schools in the said hundred without any money; which boys 
they may so take at what age they please, to be bound to them till the 
age of twenty-three years, that so the length of time may more than 
make amends for the usual sums that are given to handicraftsmen 
with such apprentices. 
That those also in the hundred who keep in their hands land of their 
own to the value of £25 per annum, or upwards, or who rent £50 per 
annum, or upwards, may choose out of the schools of the said hundred 
what boy each of them pleases, to be his apprentice in husbandry on 
the same condition. 
That whatever boys are not by this means bound out apprentices 
before they are full fourteen shall, at the Easter meeting of the guard- 
ians of each hundred every year, be bound to such gentlemen, yeo- 
men, or farmers within the said hundred as have the greatest number 
of acres of land in their hands, who shall be obliged to take them for 
their apprentices till the age of twenty-three, or bind them out at their 
own cost to some handicraftsmen; provided always that no such gen- 
tlemen, yeomen, or farmer shall be bound to have two such apprentices 
at one time. 
That grown people also (to take away their pretence of want of 
work) may come to the said working schools to learn, where work shall 
accordingly be provided for them. 
That the materials to be employed in these schools and among other 
the poor people of the parish be provided by a common stock in each 
hundred, to be raised out of a certain portion of the poor’s rate of each 
parish as requisite; which stock, we humbly conceive, need be raised 
but once, for, if rightly managed, it will increase.

219. Table of Contents of Comenius’s Great Didactic 
(First English edition, from the original Latin edition. Edited by M. W. Keatinge. 
London, 1896) 
The chapter titles indicate well the plan and scope of this cele- 
brated manual of school organization and instruction. To show 
still better the five important divisions into which the treatise is 
divided, these are stated as division headings, though such do 
not appear on the Contents page. 
Division 1. The aim and purpose of education. 
Chapter I. Man is the highest, the most absolute, and the 
most excellent of things created. 
II. The ultimate end of man is beyond this life. 
II. This life is but a preparation for eternity. 
IV. There are three stages in the preparation for 
eternity: to know oneself (and with oneself all 
things); to rule oneself; and to direct oneself to 
God. 
V. The seeds of these three (learning, virtue, reli- 
gion) are naturally implanted in us. 
    Division 2. The necessity for the education of all. 
   Chapter VI. If a man is to be produced, it is necessary that 
he be formed by education. 
VII. A man can most easily be formed in early youth, 
and cannot be formed properly except at this age. 
VIII. The young must be educated in common, and 
for this schools are necessary. 
IX. All the young of both sexes shouldbe sent to 
school. 
X. The instruction given in schools should be 
universal.     
    
    
    
  Division 3. The principles underlying school reform. 
   Chapter XI. Hitherto there have been no perfect schools. 
XII. It is possible to reform schools. 
XIII. The basis of school reform must be exact order 
in all things. 
XIV. The exact order of instruction must be borrowed 
from nature. 
XV. The basis of the prolongation of life.

XXII. The method of languages. 
XXIII. The method of morals. 
XXIV. The method of instilling piety. 
XXV. If we wish to reform schools in accordance with 
the laws of true Christianity, we must remove 
from them books written by pagans, or, at any 
rate, must use them with more caution than 
hitherto. 
XXVI. Of school discipline. 
Division 5. The organization of instruction. 
Chapter XXVII. Of the four-fold division of schools, based on age 
and acquirements. 
XXVIII. Sketch of the Mother-School.

(Abridged from the outline given in the Introduction to Keatinge’s edition of 
The Great Didactic, pp. 140-47) 
The following is an abridged outline of Comenius’s plan for the 
gymnasium at Saros-Patak, in Hungary, drawn up by him for the 
authorities during his stay there, covering the years 1650-54. 
Compared with the celebrated plans of Sturm (R. 137) and Calvin 
(R. 175), or the schools of the Jesuits, the modern character of 
Comenius’s proposal is evident. We also find here the new scien- 
tific studies receiving due recognition,

In 1658 there appeared, from the presses at Nuremberg, the 
first school picture-book ever printed. It was an introductory 
reader for learning Latin, and was entitled Orbis Sensualium 
Pictus, or “The World of Sense Objects Pictured.” In it Co- 
menius not only simplified greatly the teaching of Latin, but he 
shifted the whole emphasis from words to things, and made the 
teaching of scientific knowledge and useful information a key-

note of the book. The success of the book was immediate. 
was reprinted in all European lands, and was used as an intro- 
ductory Latin textbook for nearly two centuries. An Americ 
edition was issued in New York as late as 1810. 
The following sample pages (Figures 51, 52, 53) illustrate the 
nature of the book. The page opposite is from a Nuremberg Latin- 
German edition of 1740; the two pages below reproduce, in re-

222. The Place of Comenius in the History of Education 
(Butler, N. M., An Address; Proc. N.E.A., 1892, pp. 723-28) 
The year 1892 marked the three hundredth anniversary of the 
birth of Comenius, and at the meeting of the National Education 
Association of that year Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler gave a very 
able address on his place in history. From this address the 
following concluding paragraphs have been selected. 
The robust and practical character of the proposals of Comenius is 
most apparent when they are contrasted with the educational doctrines 
of those who have come after him, particularly Locke, Rousseau, Pes- 
talozzi, and Froebel. Frail as the psychology of Comenius was, it was 
truer than that of Locke. He knew that the human mind was an or- 
ganism, an activity, a seed with wonderful potency of growth and de- 
velopment, and not a mere sheet of wax, as the Englishman taught, on 
whose passive surface the environment merely leaves certain impres- 
sions or traces. Locke’s thought was of the education of the gentleman; 
Comenius proclaimed that education was for the race. The single 
point in which Locke corrected Comenius was in exalting character 
rather than knowledge as the chief aim in education. 
Of Rousseau one may say with Mr. Quick, “His writings and the 
results produced by them are among the strangest things in history; 
and especially in matters of education it is more than doubtful if the 
wise man of the world Montaigne, the Christian philanthropist Come- 
nius, or that ‘slave of truth and reason’ Locke, had half as much in- 
fluence as this depraved serving-man.” Rousseau’s enthusiasm took 
the form of theory run mad, and the practical impossibility of his edu- 
cational plans was only exceeded by their philosophical unsoundness. 
Comenius had been himself a teacher and an organizer of schools. He 
knew the practical limitations under which any theory is put when re- 
duced to practice. He asked of the school and the pupil nothing that 
was impossible. He accepted society as he found it and would teach it 
to reform itself. Rousseau would blow it into a million atoms and deify 
each. 
There is nothing in the history of education so touching as the story 
of the life of Pestalozzi. His own immortal words, “TI lived like a beg- 
gar to teach beggars to live like men,” only half reveal the story of his 
unwearied patience, his intense suffering, his self-sacrifices for child- 
ood. His life gave reality to his half-mystical principle that ‘‘the 
ssential principle of education is not teaching; it is love.” Yet his 
hought is relatively unimportant. Pestalozzi gave himself to educa-

             peats the thought on which all the work of Comenius was based. With- 
out that principle, which Comenius had made familiar more than a 
century before, the work of Pestalozzi would have been of little impor- 
tance in the history of education. Indeed, it would have been philan- 
thropy merely, not education. 
Nor does it detract from the estimate tobeput upon Froebel’s teach- 
ings to say that in almost every important particular they were built 
upon the foundations laid by the Moravian bishop. Froebel himself 
was. strangely deficient in masculinity and in practical capacity. His 
exaggerated and absurd symbolism and his unbalanced religiosity, 
give a certain curious interest and stimulus to his doctrines, but add 
nothing to their force or their permanent value. His seed-thought is 
again that of Comenius — Educate by developing the pupil’s own ac- 
tivity. Out of it and its corollaries the new education has grown. 
The place of Comenius in the history of education, therefore, is one of 
commanding importance. He introduces and dominates the whole 
modern movement in the field of elementary and secondary education. 
His relation to our present teaching is similar to that held by Coper- 
nicus and Newton toward modern science, and Bacon and Descartes 
toward modern philosophy. Yet he was not, in a high sense, an origi- 
nal mind. But his spirit was essentially modern and remarkably re- 
ceptive. He assimilated the ideas that were inspiring the new civiliza- 
tion and applied them to the school. 
223. The Need for Realschulen for the New Classes to be 
educated , 
(Gesner, J. M., Minor German Works, p. 355) 
The following extract from a pamphlet entitled Thoughts on the 
Organization of a Gymnasium, published in 1756, by Johann Mat- 
thias Gesner (1691-1761), a famous professor of the classics at 
the new University of Gottingen, is illustrative of the feeling of 
need which had at that time come to be felt in German lands for 
a separate type of education for those boys not destined for a 
scholarly career. 
   It is a common fault of most of our schools, that in them provision is 
made only for such as intend to become what are called learned men by 
profession; and thus a complete acquaintance with Latin is required of 
all young people, without any distinction. On the contrary, those 
things are for the most part neglected, which would be indispensable, or 
at least useful, in common civil life, in the arts and professions, at 
court and in war... . A well-organized gymnasium should, on the con- 
trary, be soarranged that youth, of every extraction, age, character, and 
distinction, may find their account there, and be taught in them for th

common good. Youth may be, with reference to their future life, di- 
vided into three classes. 1. Those who are to learn trades, arts, or 
to be merchants; 2. Those who are to seek their fortune at court or 
in war; and, 3. Those who are to remain students, and to go to the 
university.     
          
                                     224. A Cambridge Scheme of Study of 1707 
(Wordsworth, Chr., Schole Academice, Appendix 1v. Cambridge, 1877) 
In 1707, one Robert Green, a fellow of Clare College (B.A., 
1699; M.A., 1703), printed A Scheme of Study, which contained 
advice as to what and when and how to study. In addition to 
the study of Latin, Greek, Ancient History, the Gospels, Ser- 
mons, Religious History, and Christian Evidences, with practice 
in writing and disputing in Latin, he also advised a very liberal 
program of mathematics and scientific study, which is given be- 
low. The program is very interesting as revealing the hold the 
new scientific learning had obtained at Cambridge by 1707. In 
few universities at that time could so liberal an offering be 
found. 
The mathematical and scientific studies recommended were 
as follows:

the way in which the new scientific and mathematical studies 
first found their way into the universities. Vince was an in- 
structor at the time, and offered the courses as extras.’ Three 
years later he was made a professor, and continued to lecture on 
the same subjects.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THEORY AND PRACTICE BY THE MIDDLE OF THE 
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
  Tue Readings of this chapter have been selected first to illustrate 
the development of educational theory up to the time of Rous- 
seau, and second to illustrate the conditions and practices in the 
vernacular schools as they had developed up to about 1750. 
In the preceding chapters Readings have been given to illus- 
trate ancient and medizval educational theories; the theories of 
the Reformation leaders have also been set forth at some length; 
and in the chapter just before this one the development of educa- 
tional theory in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was illus- 
trated. In this chapter the work of Mulcaster is illustrated by 
reproducing the table of contents of his Positions (226), to show 
what he attempted to set forth; and the ideas as to education of 
John Locké are further illustrated by two additional selections, 
one on the method of teaching Latin (227) and one on the use of 
the Bible as a reading book (228). 
All the remaining Readings of the chapter are given to illus- 
trate the status of elementary education by about the middle of 
the eighteenth century. The first (229) reproduces the title- 
pages of two of the earliest spellers, as these show quite well the 
nature of the volumes and the rather broad purpose they were 
designed to serve. The next five selections are contemporary pen- 
pictures of schools and school work, R. 230 describing a common 
type of American school of about 1760; R. 231 the teachers in the 
famous Duchy of Gotha (R. 163), as they were in 1741; R. 232 
gives a picture of popular education in Sweden during the 
eighteenth century; R. 233 is an interesting comment on school 
conditions and the proprietary rights of teachers in the city of 
Frankfurt-am-Main; R. 234 gives an interesting description o: 
an examination for a teacher’s position, in 1793, in Switzerland 
and R. 235 reproduces a number of literary descriptions of tha 
famous English institution — the Dame School. Reading 236 i 
an agreement with a parochial-school teacher, and indicates th 
nature of his duties and the sources of his emoluments. 
The five Readings which follow relate to the establishment
-P-A-G-E-387
  THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 361 
the English religious charity-schools. The first (237) gives the 
Minutes relating to the establishment of one of the earliest of 
these schools. The second reproduces first (238 a) the qualifica- 
tions for a master in such a school and the next (238 b) describes 
the purpose and nature of the instruction. The third Reading 
(239) gives a list of the textbooks used in the S.P.C.K. schools, 
and reproduces the title-pages of two of these books. The fourth 
(240) is a subscription form for maintaining a charity-school. 
This subscription form also is illustrative of the means of support 
for many semi-public schools, in the latter part of the eighteenth 
century and the early nineteenth as well. The fifth selection 
(241) is typical of many charity-schools for girls established by 
the church parishes in England during the eighteenth century. 
The Indenture of Apprenticeship (242) is an eighteenth-century 
document, and shows the form these had taken by 1708. Com- 
pare this with Readings 99, 200 a-b, and 201. Reading 243, 
which follows, shows that the apprenticeship idea was followed 
even in the training of schoolmasters. The next Reading (244) 
is an interesting description of the instruction and discipline in 
the schools of Germany in the eighteenth century, while the one 
which follows (245) is illustrative of English discipline in the same 
century, and shows its impartial nature in the careful classifica- 
tion of offenses and punishments. Reading 246, together with 
236, describes early methods of school support. 
226. Table of Contents of Mulcaster’s Positions 
(Mulcaster, Richard, Positions. London, 1581. Reprint, edited by R. H. Quick. 
London, 1887) 
In 1581 there appeared in London a book of more than ordinary 
importance, “Written by Richard Mulcaster, Master of the 
Schools erected in London Anno. 1561, in the parish of Sainct 
Laurence Povvntneie, by the vvorshipfull Companie of the Mer- 
chaunt Tailers of the said Citie.” It was entitled 
POSITIONS 
WHERIN THOSE 
PRIMITIVE CIRCUMSTANCES

NECESSARIE FOR THE TRAINING 
vp of children, either for skill in their 
booke, or health in their bodie.

   The book was written in a heavy, stilted style, and in rather 
prolix English, and awakened but little interest. The ideas 
which Mulcaster advanced, though, were so far in advance of his 
age that, as Quick well says, educational progress would have 
been advanced materially had the world listened to this London 
schoolmaster. The most remarkable ideas of the book are con- 
tained in chapters 4-6, 36-38, and 41. 
The table of contents of the volume give a rather good idea as 
to the reforms he proposed. Summarized, these are: 
CHAPTER 
1- 3. The occasion of the discourse; why it was penned in English; 
“wherefore these Positions serve’; introductory material. 
4. What time were best for the childe to begin to learne. What 
matters some of the best writers handle eare they determine 
this question. Of letes and libertie, whervnto the parentes 
are subiect in setting their children to schoole. Of the 
difference of wittes and bodies in children. That exercise 
must be ioyned with the booke, as the schooling of the bodie. 
5. What thinges they be, wherin children are to be trained, eare 
they passe to the Grammar. That parentes, and maisters 
ought to examine the naturall abilities in children, whereby 
they become either fit, or vnfit, to this, or that kinde of life. 
The three naturall powers in children, Witte to conceiue by, 
Memorie to retaine by, Discretion to discerne by. That the 
training vp to good manners, and nurture, doth not belong to 
the teacher alone, though most to him, next after the parent, 
whose charge that is most, bycause his commaundement is 
greatest, ouer his owne childe, and beyond appeale. Of Read- 
ing, Writing, Drawing, Musicke by voice, and instrument: 
and that they be the principall principls, to traine vp the 
minde in. A generall aunswere to all obiections, which arise 
against any, or all of these. 
6. Of exercises and training the body. How necessarie a thing 
exercise is. What health is, and how it is maintained: what 
sicknesse is, how it commeth, and how it is preuented. What a 
parte exercise playeth in the maintenaunce of health. Of the 
student and his health. That all exercises though they stirre| 
some one parte most, yet helpe the whole bodie. 
7. The braunching, order, and methode, kept in this discourse o! 
exercises.

many learned be burdenous: to few to bare: wittes well sorted 
ciuill: missorted seditious. That all may learne to write and 
reade without daunger. The good of choice, the ill of confu- 
sion. The children which are set to learne hauing either rich 
or poore freindes, what order and choice is to be vsed in ad- 
mitting either of them to learne. Of the time to chuse. 
The meanes to restraine the ouerflowing multitude of scholers. 
The cause why euery one desireth, to haue his childe learned, 
and yet must yeilde ouer his owne desire to the disposition of 
his countrie. That necessitie and choice be the best restrain- 
ers. That necessitie restraineth by lacke and law. Why it 
may be admitted that all may learne to writ and reade that 
can, but no further. What is to be thought of the speaking 
and vnderstanding of latine, and in what degree of learning 
that is. That considering our time, and the state of religion 
in our time law must needes helpe this restraint, with the aun- 
swere to such obiections as are made to the contrarie. That in 
choice of wittes, which must deale with learning, that wit is 
fittest for our state which aunswereth best the monarchie, and 
how such a wit is to be knowne. That choice is to helpe in 
schooling, in admission into colledges, in proceding to degrees, 
in preferring to liuings, where the right and wrong of all the ~ 
foure pointes be handled at full. 
That yong maidens are to be set to learning, which is proued 
by the custome of our countrie, by our duetie towardes them, 
by their naturall abilitie, and by the worthie effectes of such, 
as haue bene well trained. The ende whereunto their educa- 
tion serueth, which is the cause why and how much they learne.

both excellent teachers and cunning professours in all kindes 
of learning: by the diuision of colledges according to profes- 
sions: by sorting like yeares into the same rowmes: by bettering 
the studentes allowance and liuing: by prouiding and main- 
taining notable well learned readers. That for bringing learn- 
ing forward in her right and best course, there would be seuen 
ordinarie ascending colledges for tounges, for mathematikes, 
for philosophie, for teachers, for physicians, for lawyers, for 
diuines. And that the generall studie of law, would be but one

   227. Locke on the Teaching of Latin 
(Locke, John, Some Thoughts concerning Education. London, 1693) 
In the Introduction to Reading 216 we gave a statement as to 
the origin of Locke’s Thoughts, which see. The following selec- 
tion, on the teaching of Latin, gives a good idea as to the reforms 
Locke proposed in the teaching of the secondary-school subjects 
of his time. 
§ 162. As soon as he can speak English, ’t is time for him to learn 
some other Language. This no body doubts of, when French is pro- 
pos’d. And the reason is, because People are accustomed to the right 
Way of teaching that Language, which is by talking it into Children 
in constant Conversation, and not by grammatical Rules. The Latin 
Tongue would easily be taught the same Way, if his Tutor, being con- 
stantly with him, would talk nothing else to him, and make him an- 
swer still in the same Language. ; 
§ 164. Latin I look upon as absolutely necessary to a Gentleman; 
and indeed Custom, which prevails over every thing, has made it so 
much a Part of Education that even those Children are whipp’d to it, 
and made spend many Hours of their precious Time uneasily in Latin, 
who, after they are once gone from School, are never to have more to do 
with it as long as they live. Can there be any thing more ridiculous. 
than that a Father should waste his own Money and his Son’s Time i 
setting him to learn the Roman Language, when at the same time h 
designs him for a Trade, wherein he having no use of Latin, fails not t 
forget that little which he brought from School, and: which ’t is ten t 
one he abhors for the ill Usage it procured him? Could it be believed|
-P-A-G-E-391
THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 365 
unless we had every where amongst us Examples of it, that a Child 
should be forced to learn the Rudiments of a Language which he is 
never to use in the Course of Life that he is designed to, and neglect all 
the while the writing of a good Hand and casting Accounts, which are 
of great Advantage in all Conditions of Life, and to most Trades indis- 
pensably necessary? But though these Qualifications, requisite to 
Trade and Commerce and the Business of the World, are seldom or 
never to be had at Grammar-Schools, yet thither not only Gentlemen 
send their younger Sons, intended for Trades, but even Tradesmen and 
Farmers fail not to send their Children, though they have neither In- 
tention nor Ability to make them Scholars. If you ask them why they 
do this they think it as strange a Question as if you should ask them, 
Why they go to Church. Custom serves for Reason, and has, to those 
who take it for Reason, so consecrated this Method, that it is almost 
religiously observed by them, and they stick to it, as if their Children 
had scarce an orthodox Education unless they learned Lilly’s Grammar. 
§ 165. But how necessary soever Latin be to some, and is thought 
to be to others to whom it is of no manner of Use and Service; yet the 
ordinary Way of learning it in a Grammar-School is that which having 
had Thoughts about I cannot be forward to encourage. The Reasons 
against it are so evident and cogent, that they have prevailed with 
some intelligent Persons to quit the ordinary Road, not without Suc- 
cess, though the Method made use of was not exactly what I imagine 
the easiest, and in short is this. To trouble the Child with no Grammar 
at all, but to have Latin, as English has been, without the Perplexity of 
Rules, talked unto him; for if you will consider it, Latin is no more un- 
known to a Child, when he comes into the World, than English: and 
yet he learns English without Master, Rule, or Grammar; and so might 
he Latin too, as Tully did, if he had somebody always to talk to him 
in this Language. 
       
     228. The Bible as a Reading Book 
(Locke, John, Some Thoughts concerning Education. London, 1693) 
In this selection Locke describes the course of study and the 
textbooks for the elementary education of children in his day, 
and sets forth some very sensible advice, for the time, regarding 
the common practice of using the Bible as a school reading-book 
for children. 
§ 157. The Lord’s Prayer, the Creeds, and Ten Commandments, 
’t is necessary he should learn perfectly by heart; but, I think, not be 
reading them himself in his Primer, but by somebody’s repeating them 
o him, even before he can read. But learning by heart, and learning 
‘0 read, should not I think be mix’d, and so one made to clog the other.
-P-A-G-E-392
366 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
But his learning to read should be made as little Trouble or Business 
to him as might be. 
What other Books there are in English of the Kind of those above- 
mentioned, fit to engage the Liking of Children, and tempt them to 
read, I do not know: But am apt to think, that Children being generally 
delivered over to the Method of Schools, where the Fear of the Rod is 
to inforce, and not any Pleasure of the Employment to invite them to 
learn, this Sort of useful Books, amongst the Number of silly ones that 
are of all Sorts, have yet had the Fate to be neglected; and nothing that 
I know has been considered of this Kind out of the ordinary Road of 
the Horn-Book, Primer, Psalter, Testament, and Bible. 
§ 158. As for the Bible, which Children are usually employ’d in to 
exercise and improve their Talent iz reading, I think the promiscuous 
reading of it through by Chapters as they lie in Order, is so far from 
being any Advantage to Children, either for the perfecting their Read- 
ing, or principling their Religion, that perhaps a worse could not be 
found. For what Pleasure or Encouragement can it be to a Child to 
exercise himself in reading those Parts of a Book where he understands 
nothing? And how little are the Law of Moses, the Song of Solomon, 
the Prophecies in the Old, and the Epistles and A pocalypse in the New 
Testament, suited to a Child’s Capacity? And though the History of 
the Evangelists and the Acts have something easier, yet, taken alto- 
gether, it is very disproportional to the Understanding of Childhood. 
I grant that the Principles of Religion are to be drawn from thence, and 
in the Words of the Scripture; yet none should be propos’d to a Child, 
but such as are suited to a Child’s Capacity and Notions. But ’t is far 
from this to read through the whole Bible, and that for reading’s sake. 
And what an odd jumble of Thoughts must a Child have in his Head, 
if he have any at all, such as he should have concerning Religion, who 
in his tender Age reads all the Parts of the Bible indifferently as the 
Word of God without any other Distinction! I am apt to think, and 
this in some men has been the very Reason why they never had clear 
and distinct Thoughts of it all their Lifetime.

Under the general name of ‘‘Spellers” the first of the school- 
books which departed from the religious Primer type were classi- 
fied. On the opposite page the title-pages of two of these early 
books are given. The book by Edmund Coote, first issued in 
1596, was a schoolmaster’s general manual and guide. Its very 
general nature may be seen from the following statement as to it 
contents.

  368 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The book by Thomas Dilworth appeared in 1740, and at once 
became very popular in both Old and New England. It was 
more secular in character than any of its predecessors and con- 
tained numerous graded lists of words for spelling, a series of 
graded reading lessons, and some illustrations. The title-page 
gives the outline of contents of the book. 
In an edition of Dilworth’s Schoolmaster’s Assistant in the pos- 
session of the author, published in 1797, there appears, after the 
title-page and two long dedicatory prefaces, two poems eulogizing 
the author for his great services. One, signed by William Deane, 
dated at Halifax, October 20, 1765, and addressed ‘‘To Mr. 
Thomas Dilworth, on his Schoolmaster’s Assistant,” is as follows: 
Ditworts, the man by gracious Heaven design’d, 
A friend, a father to the human kind; 
Whose active diligence, and warmer zeal 
United, center in the public weal! 
Fain would my muse discharge the debt of praise, 
With fresh addition to thy circling bays. 
Learning, the glory of Britannia’s isle, 
Within thy fav’rite leaves are taught to smile; 
No more perplexed in error’s maze we run, 
And meet the danger which we sought to shun: 
Since, drawn by thee, now shines before our eyes, 
The path where virtue and fair knowledge lies: 
There waits a Guide by nicest model plann’d, 
Here stands an Usher with assisting hand; 
A work so clear, delighted we pursue, 
And think the pleasing prospect ever new. 
So the kind sun, with all reviving ray, 
Cheers the dark world with an approaching day; 
Before his light the empty shadows fly, 
And nature glows with a serener sky. 
230. Noah Webster’s Description of Pre-Revolutionary Schools 
(Letter, in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. XXVI, pp. 195-96) 
In response to a request, Noah Webster sent Mr. Barnard th 
following letter. Mr. Webster was born in Connecticut, in 1758 
so that the schools he describes are those of the decade precedin; 
the outbreak of the American Revolution.

  THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 369 
New Haven, March 10, 1840 
Mr. BARNARD: 
Dear Sir — You desire me to give you some information as to the 
mode of instruction in common schools when I was young, or before 
the Revolution. .. . 
When I was young, the books used were chiefly or wholly Dilworth’s 
Spelling Books, the Psalter, Testament, and Bible. No geography 
was studied before the publication of Dr. Morse’s small books on that 
subject, about the year 1786 or 1787. . No history was read, as far as 
my knowledge extends, for there was no abridged history of the United 
States. Except the books above mentioned, no book for reading was 
used before the publication of the Third Part of my Institute, in 1785. 
In some of the early editions of that book I introduced short notices of 
the geography and history of the United States, and these led to more 
enlarged descriptions of the country. In 1788, at the request of Dr. 
Morse, I wrote an account of the transactions in the United States, 
after the Revolution; which account fills nearly twenty pages in the 
first volume of his octavo editions. 
Before the Revolution, and for some years after, no slates were used 
in common schools: all writing and operations in arithmetic were on 
paper. The teacher wrote the copies and gave the sums in arithmetic; 
few or none of the pupils having any books as a guide. Such was the 
condition of the schools in which I received my early education. 
The introduction of my Spelling Book, first published in 1783, pro- 
duced a great change in the department of spelling; and, from the in- 
formation I can gain, spelling was taught with more care and accuracy 
for twenty years or more after that period, than it has been since the 
introduction of multiplied books and studies. 
No English grammar was generally taught in common schools when 
I was young, except that in Dilworth, and that to no good purpose. In 
short, the instruction in schools was very imperfect, in every branch; 
and if I am not misinformed, it is so to this day, in many branches. 
Indeed there is danger of running from one extreme to another, and in- 
stead of having too few books in our schools, we shall have too many. 
Iam, sir, with much respect, your friend and obedient servant, 
N. WEBSTER 
       
   
                                                        
      
     231. Teachers in Gotha in 1741 
(From the German of Karl von Raumer; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, vol. xx, p. 584) 
Though Duke Ernest the Pious (1640-75) had raised little 
otha to a place of first importance by his educational reforms 
R. 163), the reforms he instituted were not carried forward after 
is death, and by 1741 we find the school conditions there as in-
-P-A-G-E-396

dicated by the following “Circular of the Consistory of Gotha” 
regarding teachers, under date of September 11, 1741. 
   
   
                                     
   
    
    
    
     We have, with great displeasure, perceived that a great many pet- 
sons make teaching their profession without sufficient cultivation of 
their faculties. Many of the teachers have employed incapable mas- 
ters to teach them a little instrumental and vocal music, which is not 
an important requisite, but they are unable to awaken in the children’s 
heads a true understanding of the Catechism, unable to jot down the 
sermon, to hear the children recite, much more unable to give instruc- 
tion about any thing in nature. They know little of penmanship and 
arithmetic, and yet, in spite of their ignorance, twenty apply for one 
vacancy in a school, because, as they say, they have learned nothing 
else by which to make a living. They do so from love of a comfortable 
life, and from fear of the plough; but this must and shall be stopped, 
and our most gracious duke has therefore pleased to decree that you 
(superintendents) are required to select teachers from young men of 
ability, who will devote themselves for life and with enthusiasm to 
this work, and to reject bungling boys, &c. 
How little such decrees effected, and how little power the con- 
sistory possessed to give force to such decrees, is shown by the 
number of monitory decrees of October 11, 1746; July 7, 1750; 
October 2, 1750; April 16, 1760. The chairs of the teachers 
remained occupied by the poorest pupils of the gymnasium, dis- 
charged corporals, bankrupt tradesmen, and, above all, by serv- 
ants of the household of a count (patron of a school) who had 
outlived their usefulness in the family. These brought the once- 
celebrated Gotha schoois into discredit. 
232. Description of an Eighteenth-Century Swedish, People’s 
School 
(From the German of Karl von Raumer; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. XXII, p. 701) 
The following selection, taken from an article on the history of 
education in Sweden, describes the elementary vernacular school 
of that country at the close of the seventeenth century. ‘The de- 
scription also remained true of such schools well through the 
eighteenth century. - Educational reform in Sweden did not begin| 
until after 1800, and came in part as a result of the introduction 
of the English monitorial system into the schools of neighborin, 
Denmark. 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
  THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 371 
The leaders of the so-called Period of Freedom manifested much 
interest in popular enlightenment. In a letter dated February 109, 
1768, the governors of the provinces and the consistories were called on 
to suggest how the instruction of the peasant children could be better 
organized, how school-houses could be erected, the support of school- 
teachers obtained, and good school regulations generally could be 
drawn up. These suggestions, such as they were, were not carried out, 
for during the whole eighteenth century not more than one hundred 
and sixty-five stationary schools were established; the instruction out- 
side of their localities being imparted in village schools (Dorfschulen) 
which had no abiding place, the teachers being often very ignorant, 
and not unfrequently graceless scamps, drunkards, or ruined people, 
and both subjects and methods being extremely limited and defective. 
However, the school fees were very small, being two, three, or four 
skillings a week for children learning to read, and six to eight for those 
who studied writing and ciphering. A Swedish popular school in the 
seventeenth century presented a peculiar aspect. The discipline was 
rough, the punishments barbarous. The school was gathered in an 
ordinary peasant’s room, where the occupants carried on their domes- 
tic occupations; at the end of the great dining-table sat the teacher, 
called “‘master,” and near by sat the little children, or “A B C pupils,” 
on stools or. benches without any backs, while a little farther away, 
according to their proficiency, sat the other scholars with their books 
in their laps; only the few who were learning to cipher and write sat at 
the master’s table. The text-books consisted of the Horn-Book, the 
Greater and the Lesser Catechisms, together with the Hymn-Book. 
When the pupil had mastered the art of reading in these three books, 
and had learned the Catechism by heart — without any test of his un- 
derstanding it he was ready to graduate, and the teacher was dispensed 
with. Occasionally children of bright parts or whose parents were in 
better circumstances, were taught to write and cipher, but copies and 
manuals, with the proper solutions, were not used, which occasioned 
great waste of time. This picture is dark, but accurate, even far into 
the present century.   
233. Schools of Frankfurt-am-Main during the Eighteenth Century 
(From the German of Karl von Raumer; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, vol. Xxu, p. 736) 
The following extract from a history of education in Frankfurt- 
am-Main, one of the “Free Hanseatic German Cities,” gives an 
interesting picture of the schools and of the limited educational 
conditions which must have existed in the eighteenth century in 
one of the important cities in German lands. 
In this form (1591) the Frankfort school system remained, in all 
   
-P-A-G-E-398
372, READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
essential points unchanged till the re-organization of Frankfort as a 
free city, in 1815. During this time the number of teachers varied 
from sixteen to thirty-two, each school being limited to a single assist- 
ant and hence restricted to a moderate number of scholars. The 
schools were sometimes under the charge of female teachers, which is 
explained by the fact that the school privilege was a real right, trans- 
ferable by inheritance or sale. The course of study was probably ex- 
tended so as even sometimes to include French, but there were special 
charges for instruction in all branches beyond the elementary ones of 
reading and writing. 
That this arrangement, as carried out, was by no means satisfactory, 
is evident from a reform document by one of the teachers, J. M. 
Schirmer, in the middle of the r8th century. He proposed that the 
number of schools should be limited, the teachers paid by the State, a 
revival of the regulation requiring visitation of the schools, and that all 
teacherships should be made hereditary. He was especially opposed 
to the numerous “‘hedge” schools which had again arisen, kept by 
“school disturbers” and various kinds of strollers, “lackeys, tailors, 
shoemakers, stocking weavers, wig makers, journeymen printers, in- 
valid soldiers, and sewing and knitting women,” who managed to gain 
a subsistence by means of instruction in German and the Catechism. 
But his criticism met with slight response and no attempt at a re- 
organization was made until within the present century. 
234. A Swiss Teacher’s Examination, in 1793 
(Kriisi, Hermann, Recollections of my Pedagogical Life, pp. 2-4. Stuttgart, 1840. 
Trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. v, pp. 162-63) 
Hermann Kriisi (1775-1844), who became a schoolmaster at 
eighteen, and at twenty-five joined Pestalozzi and was for sixteen 
years his main reliance and helper, has left the following account 
of how he happened to become a teacher, and the nature of the 
examination he was required to pass to obtain the appointment. 
It throws much light on the character of popular education in 
German Switzerland near the close of the eighteenth century. 
At the highest point of the pass, where the road turns away from 
toward Trogen, my life also took another direction. While earning my 
living as day laborer and errand-man, I was carrying, one warm day in 
1793, to the establishment of Zellweger, with which I afterward came 
into very different relations, a great bundle of yarn from the mountain. 
As I stopped to rest, all dripping with sweat, at the very summit, a 
relative met me, who was then treasurer of the town, one Herr Gruber. 
After the usual greetings, the following conversation ensued, which I 
yet remember as the turning point of my life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
    THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 373 
Gruber. “Tt is warm.” 
Myself. “Very warm.” 
Gruber. “Now that schoolmaster Horler is going away from Gais, 
you have a chance to earn your bread a little more easily. Have you 
no desire to offer yourself for his place!” 
Myself. “Wishing will not help me much. A schoolmaster must 
have knowledge; and I have none.”’ 
Gruber. “What a schoolmaster among us needs to know, you at your 
age can very soon learn.” 
Myself. “But how, and where? I see no possibility of it.” 
Gruber. “Tf you wish it, the means will be easily found. Consider 
the matter and decide upon it.” 
He left me. I now had abundance of matter for reflection. But no 
ray of light came into my mind, although the natural sunlight sur- 
rounded my body with brightness and warmth. I scarcely felt my 
load as I proceeded along the ascents and steeps of the road. What- 
ever has fallen to my lot since that moment, I look upon as the fruit of 
this conversation. 
Since my leaving the day school, where I had learned and practiced 
only reading, learning by rote, and mechanical copying, and while I 
was growing up to adult age, I had so far forgotten to write that I no 
longer knew how to make all the capital letters; my friend Sonderegger 
therefore procured me a copy from a teacher in Altstattin, well known 
as a writing-master. This single copy I wrote over as often as a hun- 
dred times, for the sake of improving my handwriting. I had no other 
special preparation for the profession; but, notwithstanding, I ven- 
tured, when the notice was given from the pulpit, to offer myself as a 
candidate for the place. with but small hopes of obtaining it, but con- 
soling myself with the thought that at least I should come off without 
shame. 
The day of examination came. An elder fellow-candidate was first 
called before the committee. To read a chapter in the New Testament 
and to write a few lines, occupied him a full quarter of an hour. My 
turn now came. The genealogical register, from Adam to Abraham, 
from the first book of Chronicles, was given me to read. After this, 
chairman Schlipfer gave me an uncut quill, with the direction to write 
a few lines. “What shall I write?” I said. “Write the Lord’s Prayer, 
or whatever you like,” was the answer. As I had no knowledge of . 
composition or spelling, it may be imagined how my writing looked. 
However, I was told to retire. After a short consideration, I was, to 
my wonder and pride, recalled into the room. Here chairman Schlip- 
fer informed me that the whole committee were of the opinion that 
both candidates knew little; that the other was best in reading, and I 
in writing. 
The other, however, being over forty years old, and I only eighteen,
-P-A-G-E-400
  374 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
they had come to the conclusion that I should learn what was necessary 
sooner than he, and as moreover my dwelling-house (the commune had 
then no school-house of their own) was better adapted for a school- 
house than his, I should receive the appointment. I was dismissed 
with friendly advice, and encouraging hopes of increased pay, if my 
exertions should be satisfactory. 
Much attention was excited by the fact that my fellow-candidate, 
eight days afterward, took a situation as policeman, in which he re- 
ceived three gulden a week, while the schoolmaster, who was obliged to 
furnish his own school-room, had to satisfy himself with two and a half. 
235. The English Dame School described 
(Poems by the Reverend George Crabbe, 1754-1832; Henry Kirke White, 1785- 
1806; and William Shenstone, 1714-63) 
The English poet Crabbe was essentially a poet of the homely 
life of the people. In his description of the Borough, in speaking 
of the “Poor and their Dwellings,” he pays a passing tribute of 
respect and gratitude to his first teacher, in the following lines 
describing the Dame School he attended: 
At her old house, her dress, her air the same, 
I see mine ancierit letter-loving dame: F 
“Learning, my child,” said she, “shall fame command; 
Learning is better than house or land — 
For houses perish, lands are gone and spent; 
In learning then excel, for that’s most excellent.” 
“And what her learning?” — ’T is with awe to look 
In every verse throughout one sacred book 
From this her joy, her hope, her peace is sought; 
This she has learned, and she is nobly taught. 
If aught of mine have gained the public ear; 
If Rurianp deigns these humble Tales to hear, 
If critics pardon, what my friends approved; 
Can I mine ancient Widow pass unmoved? 
Shall I not think what pains the matron took, 
When first I trembled o’er the gilded book? 
How she, all patient, both at eve and morn, 
Her needle pointed at the guarding horn; 
And how she soothed me, when with study sad, 
I labored on to reach the final zad? 
Shall I not grateful still the dame survey, 
And ask the Muse the poet’s debt to pay? 
Nor I alone, who hold a trifler’s pen, 
But half our bench of wealthy, weighty men, 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
    
    
                                                                            
     THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 375 
Who rule our Borough, who enforce our laws; 
They own the matron as the leading cause, 
And feel the pleasing debt, and pay the just applause: 
To her own house is borne the week’s supply; 
There she in credit lives, there hopes in peace to die. 
In another poem, describing ‘‘The Schools of the Borough”’ 
where he became a curate, he pictures the Dame School in the 
following words: 
To every class we have a school assign’d, 
Rules for all ranks and food for every mind: 
Yet one there is, that small regard to rule 
Or study pays, and still is deem’d a School; 
That where a deaf, poor, patient widow sits, 
And awes some thirty infants as she knits; 
Infants of humble, busy wives, who pay 
Some trifling price for freedom through the day. 
At this good matron’s hut the children meet, 
Who thus becomes the mother of the street. 
Her room is small, they can not widely stray, — 
Her threshold high, they can not run away: 
Though deaf, she sees the rebel-heroes shout, — 
Though lame, her white rod nimbly walks about; 
With band of yarn she keeps offenders in, 
And to her gown the sturdiest rogue can pin; 
Aided by these, and spells, and tell-tale birds, 
Her power they dread and reverence her words. 
Another English poet, Henry Kirke White (1758-1806), also 
describes his school in a somewhat similar vein: 
In yonder cot, along whose mouldering walls, 
In many a fold the mantling woodbine falls, 
The village matron kept her little school — 
Gentle of heart, yet knowing well to rule. 
Staid was the dame, and modest was the mien, 
Her garb was coarse, yet whole and nicely clean; 
Her neatly border’d cap, as lily fair, 
Beneath her chin was pinn’d with decent care; 
And pendent ruffles of the whitest lawn, 
Of ancient make her elbows did adorn. 
Faint with old age, and dim were grown her eyes; 
A pair of spectacles their want supplies.

    These does she guard secure in leather case, 
From thoughtless wights in some unweeted place. 
Here first I entered, though with toil and pain, 
The low vestibule of learning’s fane — 
Entered with pain, yet soon I found the way, 
Though sometimes toilsome, many a sweet display. 
Much did I grieve on that ill-fated morn 
When I was first to school reluctant borne; 
Severe I thought the dame, though oft she tried 
To soothe my swelling spirits when I sighed, 
And oft, when harshly she reproved, I wept — 
To my lone corner broken-hearted crept — 
And thought of tender home, where anger never kept; 
But, soon inured to alphabetic toils, 
Alert I met the dame with jocund smiles — 
First at the form, my task for ever true, 
A little favorite rapidly I grew; 
And oft she strok’d my head, with fond delight 
Held me a pattern to the dunce’s sight; 
And, as she gave my diligence its praise, 
Talked of the honors of my future days. 
The English poet, William Shenstone, has immortalized, in a 
poem of three hundred and fifteen lines entitled The School- 
mistress, his early dame-school teacher, and has also given a de- 
tailed description of the school. This has been said to rank in 
poetry with the paintings of Teniers and Wilkie for its truthful- 
ness of portrayal. The poem! opens with the following lines: 
Ah, me! full sorely is my heart forlorn, 
To think how modest worth neglected lies; 
While partial fame doth with her blasts adorn 
Such deeds alone as pride and pomp disguise; 
Deeds of ill-sort and mischievous emprize; 
Lend me thy clarion, goddess! let me try 
To sound the praise of merit ere it dies; 
Such as I oft have chanced to espy, 
Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity. 
In every village mark’d with little spire, 
Embowered in trees, and hardly known to fame, 
There dwells, in lowly shed and mean attire, 
A matron old, whom we schoolmistress name, 
Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame;

Awed by the power of this relentless dame, 
And oft-times, on vagaries idly bent, 
For unkempt hair, or task unconn’d, are sorely shent. 
236. A Parochial-School Teacher’s Agreement 
(Ruttenber, Edw. M., History of the Town of Newburgh, p. 245. Newburgh, 1859) 
The following agreement, under date of 1790, between the 
trustees of this Church-of-England school, located at Newburgh, 
New York, and the minister and teacher, is interesting as showing 
the support of the school from the income of old endowment 
lands and tuition fees, and also as picturing the church-charity 
type of education provided for the poor of the parish. 
(The Trustees) Agreed that the Reverend George H. Sperin shall be 
entitled to receive the whole of the rents and benefits arising from the 
Glebe lands, while he continues to officiate as minister, and teaching 
the inhabitants of the German patent on the following terms, viz.: 
Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, History and English Gram- 
mar at 12 shillings per quarter; Reading, Writing and Arithmetic at 
8 shillings per quarter. 
Provided always that no children incapable of studying the above 
branches shall be admitted or received into the school. 
And should a poor child come properly recommended as such, he 
shall be received into the English school gratis. 
And if a youth of strong natural ability of the like description offer, 
he shall be received into the Classical school, also gratis. 
Provided also that should the rents and privileges of the Glebe 
hereafter become more valuable, that then, in such cases, the terms of 
teaching the children living in the patent shall be reduced in such 
manner as to be equivalent to said advantages, so far as may relate 
towards supporting of a school and as the trustees shall deem proper. 
237. The Beginnings of an Early English Charity-School 
(Minutes of Meetings of Managers. Reproduced in Cardwell, J. H., The Story of 
a Charity School, Appendix A. London, 1899) 
The school of Saint Anne, Soho, was founded in 1699 by five 
earnest laymen for the ‘“‘Poore Boys of the Parish.” This was 
the sixth such school in England, the first having been founded 
in Whitechapel, in 1680. The following extracts from the Min- 
utes give the early history of the school, and the reasons actuating 
the founders in establishing it. 
Certain persons of this Parish understanding the Reasons, that first

induc’d the promoters of the late Erected Free School in Westminster 
to Attempt it, (w‘ briefly were the pernicious consequences y* arise 
from the too great Liberty w™ is given to the poorer Sorte of Youth) 
& observing the great Likelihood of its answering their Design, from 
the great Change they see already wrought in the Mafiers & Carriage of 
the Said poor Children, & the further happy Results w"" may reason- 
ably be hop’d for from them, under their Intended Education, (com- 
paratively with what they woud otherwise have had) & withall con- 
sidering how greatly this Parish aboundeth with such poor Children, 
who for want of being better engag’d were seldom out of the Feilds, 
where from the Company that frequents those places, they generally 
learn & contract such evil Customs & Acquaintance whereby they be- 
come not onely a perpetual Grief & Vexation to their friends, & Annoy- 
ance to all about them, but often bring their own lives also, by their 
wicked Actions, to Shamefull and Untimely Ends. Hereupon Com- 
municating their Minds to some of their Acquaintance, who approving 
the thing, & Spontaneously offering their Assistance towards the Erect- 
ing the like in this Parish, not onely by their Purses, but by their Time,

they should think would incline them thereto; D* Hern also upon our 
Application to him for his Advice therein giving many Wishes to it, 
we quickly procurd Subscriptions amounting to eighteen Pounds p. An.

were most probable to Effect their Design, or bring their Purpose to-

   241. The Charity-School of Saint John’s Parish, Southwark 
(From an account of the school printed by the Parish, and reproduced in the Amer- 
. ican Journal of Education, vol. 1, pp. 314-15. Boston, 1826) 
The following account of a parish-supported charity-school for 
training girls for domestic service is an interesting and typical 
example of many English eighteenth-century charitable schools, 
organized for the education of a limited number of “children of 
the industrious poor of the parish.” 
This school was established for the purpose of maintaining, instruct- 
ing, clothing, qualifying for useful servants, and putting out to service, 
the female children of the industrious poor of the parish. 
The school dates its existence from the year 1735, when, in conse- 
quence of the increasing population, this parish was taken out of the 
adjoining one of Saint Olave: among the first acts of the inhabitants 
of the newly-established Parish was the formation of a school similar 
in many respects to that which had, already, for many ages, existed in 
the mother parish; it provided for the instruction and clothing of a 
certain number of the female children of the parish, with a view to fit 
them for service when they arrived at the age for leaving the school; 
but there was one alteration made in the system of the then infant 
school, which the experience of now nearly one hundred years proves to 
the committee to have been most wise and beneficial, viz. the reception 
of a certain portion of the children so educated into the house, wholly 
to be maintained, constantly to be under the eye of a vigilant mistress, 
and the regulations of a domestic family. The obvious tendency of 
this arrangement is, besides the benefit afforded to the parents, by 
taking their child entirely off their hands, to secure to the child the full 
advantage of the instruction, to rescue her from an exposure to vice 
and temptation, (by which exposure at home, too frequently, all the 
good derived at school is lost,) and by the blessing of Providence to  
-P-A-G-E-411
  THEORY AND PRACTICE BY 1750 385 
train her up in that moral and religious way from which when she is old 
she may not depart. 
The accommodations of the school-house will allow eighteen children 
to be thus wholly received into it, and maintained; and though this 
number has for the last few years been necessarily reduced to fifteen, 
the present committee have now the pleasure to report that the full 
number will in a few weeks be put into the establishment, and they 
indulge the hope that long will be the time before that full number is 
again obliged to be curtailed. The number of children, therefore, now 
in the school is as follows: — Forty children educated and clothed, of 
whom eighteen, besides education and clothing, are wholly maintained. 
This number is certainly small when compared with the size of the 
parish, and much it is to be wished that more of the female population 
could derive the benefit of gratuitous instruction; happily, females are 
the only children for whom provision need be made, on account of the 
royal and munificent foundation of the grammar school of Queen Eliza- 
beth, which not only holds out the advantage of a classical education 
to those whose parents are desirous that they should avail themselves 
of it, but extends to some hundreds of the children of a lower class of - 
persons, that measure of useful learning which, were it not for the ex- 
istence of this institution, the parishioners of Saint John would, un- 
doubtedly, feel the expediency of providing for them.

The following is a transcript of the record of an Indenture of 
Apprenticeship preserved at Corsham, England, and dated 
January 16, 1708." Its similarity to the thirteenth-century docu- 
ment, given in Reading No. 99, will be evident by comparison 
of the two, and will reveal how little the regulations of appren- 
ticeship changed during five hundred years.

was the apprenticeship plan in use, that at times even the school- 
master served an apprenticeship to learn his calling.

244. The Schools of Germany before Pestalozzi 
(Diesterweg, Adolph; trans. in Barnard’s Am. Jour. of Educ., vol. Iv, pp. 343-45) 
One of the schoolmen of Prussia most deeply influenced by the 
reform work of Pestalozzi was Adolph Diesterweg, who has often 
been called “der deutsche Pestalozzi.” In an address in Berlin 
at the celebration of the centennial of the birth of Pestalozzi, in 
1846, Dr. Diesterweg contrasted the schools of Germany before 
the days of Rousseau and Pestalozzi with the modern schools. 
That part of his address which described the old schools is given 
below. 
Our present system of common or public schools — that is schools 
which are open to all children under certain regulations — date from 
the discovery of printing, in 1436, when 
books began to be furnished so cheaply 
that the poor could buy them. Especially 
after Martin Luther had translated the 
Bible into German, and the desire to pos- 
sess and understand that invaluable book 
became universal, did there also become 
universal the desire to know how to read. 
Men sought to learn, not only for the sake 
of reading the Scriptures, but also to be 
able to read and sing the Psalms, and to 
learn the Catechism. For this purpose 
schools for children were established, ; 
which were essentially reading schools. 
Reading was the first and principal study; 
next came singing, and then memorizing Fic. 58 
texts, songs, and the Catechism. At first )Najentin Dynan 
the ministers taught; but afterward the (1790-1860) 
duty was turned over to the inferior 
church officers, — the choristers and sextons. Their duties as choris- 
ters and sextons were paramount, and as schoolmasters only secondary. 
The children paid a small monthly fee; no more being thought neces- 
sary, since the schoolmaster derived a salary from the church. 
Nobody either made or knew how to make great pretensions to edu- 
cational skill. If the teacher communicated to his scholars the ac- 
quirements above mentioned, and kept them in order, he gave satis- 
faction; and no one thought any thing about separate institutions for 
school children. There were no school books distinctively so called; 
the children learned their lessons in the Bible or the Psalter, and read 
ither in the Old or the New Testament. 
Each child read by himself; the simultaneous method was not known.     
     
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  388 READINGS.IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
One after another stepped up to the table where the master sat. He 
pointed out one letter at a time, and named it; the child named it after 
him; he drilled him in recognizing and remembering each. Then they 
took letter by letter of the words, and by getting acquainted with 
them in this way, the child gradually learned to read. This was a 
difficult method for him; a very difficult one. Years usually passed 
before any facility had been acquired; many did not learn in four years. 
It was imitative and purely mechanical labor on both sides. To under- 
stand what was read was seldom thought of. The syllables were pro- 
nounced with equal force, and the reading was without grace or ex- 
pression. 
Where it was possible, but unnaturally and mechanically, learnin; 
by heart was practiced. The children drawled out texts of Scripture, 
Psalms, and the contents of the Catechism from the beginning to end; 
short questions and long answers alike, all in the same monotonous 
manner. Anybody with delicate ears who heard the sound once, would 
remember it all his life long. There are people yet living, who were 
taught in that unintelligent way, who can corroborate these state- 
ments. Of the actual contents of the words whose sounds they had 
thus barely committed to memory by little and little, the children 
knew absolutely almost nothing. They learned superficially and un- 
derstood superficially. Nothing really passed into their minds; at 
least nothing during their school years. 
The instruction in singing was no better. The master sang to them 
the psalm-tunes over and over, until they could sing them, or rather 
screech them, after him. 
Such was the condition of instruction in our schools during the six- 
teenth, seventeenth, and two-thirds of the eighteenth centuries; con- 
fined to one or two studies, and those taught in the most imperfect 
and mechanical way. 
It was natural that youth endowed, when healthy, with an ever in- 
creasing capacity for pleasure in living, should feel the utmost reluc- 
tance at attending school. Tobe employed daily, for three or four 
hours, or more, in this mechanical toil, was no light task; and it there- 
fore became necessary to force the children to sit still, and study their 
lessons. During all that time, especially in the seventeenth century, 
during the fearful Thirty Years’ War, and subsequently, as the age 
was sunk in barbarism, the children of course entered the schools ig- 
norant and untrained. “As the old ones sung, so twittered the young.” 
Stern severity and cruel punishments were the order of the day; and by 
them the children were kept in order. Parents governed children, too 
young to attend, by threats of the schoolmaster and the school; and 
when they went, it was with fear and trembling. The rod, the cane, 
the raw-hide, were necessary apparatus in each school. The punish. 
ments of the teacher exceeded those of a prison. Kneeling on peas,

246. A New Jersey School Lottery 
(Murray, David, History of Education in New Jersey, pp. 123-24. Washington, 1899) 
The lottery was a very common means, during the latter half 
of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the nineteenth, 
for obtaining money to found or endow churches, colleges, and 
schools. The following advertisement, under date of July 2, 
1753, to establish and maintain a school at Trenton, in New 
Jersey, is typical of these early means for raising money for a 
common school. 
We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, sons of some of the prin- 
cipal families in and about Trenton, being in some measure sensible of 
the advantages of learning, and desirous that those who are deprived of 
it through the poverty of their parents might taste the sweetness of it 
with ourselves, can think of no better or other method for that purpos 
than the following scheme of a Delaware-Island lottery! for raising 22 
pieces of eight (Spanish dollars) toward building a house to accommo: 
1 Lotteries were at that time forbidden in New Jersey, and in order to evade th 
law they were held on Fish Island, in the river, and were termed Fish-Island, oj

such children whose parents are unable to pay for schooling. It is pro- 
posed that the house be 30 feet long, 20 feet wide, and one story high,

under the direction of Messrs. Benjamin Yard, Alexander Chambers,

ware, opposite to the town of Trenton, and the money raised by this 
lottery shall be paid into the hands of Moore Furman, of Trenton, who 
is under bond for the faithful laying out the money for the uses above. 
And we, the managers, assure the adventurers, upon our honor, that 
this scheme in all its parts shall be as punctually observed as if we were 
under the formalities used in lotteries; and we flatter ourselves the pub- 
lic, considering our laudable design, our age, and our innocence, will 
give credit to this, our public declaration.

  CHAPTER XIX 
THE EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 
Tue Readings of this chapter deal with the great transition move- 
ments which characterized the eighteenth century and made of 
it a transition century. They cover the political and religious 
conditions obtaining at the time; the attack on the ancient 
privileges of both Church and State; the liberalizing movements 
of the century; the demands for reform in France; the rise of 
democratic government in England and America; and the sweep- 
ing away of the old abuses in France. Only a few of the large 
number of possible Readings illustrative of eighteenth-century 
conditions are reproduced in this chapter. 
The first (247) gives an interesting picture of the results of 
ecclesiastical despotism on a nation fast attaining a national con- 
sciousness, and contrasts well the outcome of larger religious free- 
dom in England with the lack of it in France. The eighteenth 
century became one of open rebellion in France. In England 
reforms were granted, and the evolution in consequence was 
slower but more peaceful. 
The outstanding intellectual genius of the eighteenth century 
was Voltaire. He attacked privilege in every direction, but par- 
ticularly the privileges and abuses of the greatest and most power- 
ful institution of his day —the Church. He contributed many 
articles to the famous Encyclopédie edited by Diderot, and one of 
these, setting forth what he conceived to be the proper relations 
between Church and State, is here (248) reproduced. 
The two extracts from the Social Contract of Rousseau (249 a-b) 
are given to show the nature of the warfare he declared on or- 
ganized society, and also the fervid character of his reasoning. 
This book depicted so well the abuses of his age age it became 
“the Bible of the French Revolutionists.” 
The writings of Buckle represent extended research, and the 
selection reproduced (250) from his great history gives an inter-| 
esting description of the eighteenth-century intellectual progres: 
of the English people.

Constitution (251) is one of the shorter of these early documents, 
but compares fairly well with similar provisions incorporated into 
present-day constitutions. An interesting comparison may be 
made between this, the American Declaration of Independence 
of the same year, and the French Declaration of the Rights of 
Man of 1791 (253). 
The Cahier reproduced in part (252) represents one of the more 
conservative of these famous documents, and is interesting for 
the conception of education which it gives. 
The final selection (253) reproduces the famous French ‘“ Decla- 
ration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,? a very influential 
document clearly modeled after Jefferson’s famous Declaration. 
247. Ecclesiastical Tyranny in France 
(Dabney, R. H., Causes of the French Revolution, pp. 190-93. New York, 1888. 
By permission of the publishers, Henry Holt & Co.) 
The following extract from a very interesting volume describes 
well conditions existing during the eighteenth century in France, 
and contrasts the situation there and the results with the larger 
religious freedom of England. 
... France had been brought by Louis XIV to the brink of ruin. 
Ecclesiastical tyranny had been exercised in England, it is true, as well 
as in France, and in every other country. But nothing had taken place 
in England in the seventeenth century which could at all bear compari- 
son, for instance, with the frightful persecution of the Huguenots by 
Louis XIV. Of pauperism and misery among the lower classes there 
was also no lack in England. But the rich were taxed to support the 
paupers of their parish; they lived among them; and performed duties 
in return for their power. Bad as was the condition of the English 
masses, it could bear no comparison whatever with the abject misery of 
the French. The numerous bread-riots which broke out in various 
parts of France all during the eighteenth century were ominous signs of 
the inflammable state of the lower classes. ‘They themselves were too 
grossly ignorant to organize a revolution; but when the educated and 
thinking men of the country had been driven by ecclesiastical and goy- 
ernmental tyranny into determined hostility to the existing social sys- 
tem, the Old Régime was doomed. For they found the downtrodden 
masses eager to be led against their oppressors. In England the condi- 
tion of the lowest class was far from perfect; but the great body of the 
middle class was contented enough. The intellectual tyranny of the 
Established Church was sufficient, in a rationalistic age, to create 
among thinking men that anti-clerical movement which showed itself in 
   
-P-A-G-E-420
  394 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the formation of new sects, and in a literature hostile to the Christian 
religion. But it was not sufficient to drive the great body of the people 
into radical opposition. 
In France, however, the abuses in the Church were at that time so 
great as to arouse the opposition of even the conservative classes. 
Hating the bishops and their privileges, men who, under free institu- 
tions, would probably have been on the side of religious conservatism, 
were eager to read the revolutionary literature that was directed, first, 
against the priests, and then against Christianity itself. Even the 
ignorant peasants, the most conservative class in religion, as in all 
things, were predisposed to hostility to the Church. For although 
their mental stage of development was far more likely to incline them 
to fetichism than to philosophic deism or atheism, they nevertheless 
hated at least the upper clergy on account of the tithes and other ec- 
clesiastical taxes. 
. .. Ecclesiastical tyranny in an age of rationalism produced the 
writings of Bolingbroke and Voltaire, and the eager reception of these 
writings by the French people was a symptom of the fatal rottenness of 
the French church. The literature of any age is, indeed, in the first 
instance, a symptom and a result of the intellectual tendencies of the 
age, and only secondarily a cause of them, in that it may accelerate and 
strengthen the movement by which it is itself produced. Probably no 
writer has ever exercised so great an influence upon his own age as Vol- 
taire did upon his. But even when this has been said, it must be re- 
membered that Voltaire was, after all, but a product of the intellectual 
tendencies of his day; and the secret of his prodigious success was that 
he gave utterance, in a style of wonderful clearness and classic simpli- 
city, to the thoughts which, though less distinctly, were already in the 
minds of his readers. The old edifice of French society had become 
rotten from top to bottom, and therefore the strokes that were dealt it 
by the writers of the eighteenth century were sufficient to overturn it. 
But in England religious radicalism was confined to the intellectual 
classes; the broad base of society standing firm, because the condition 
of the middle and lower classes was more favorable than in France. 
In France, too, there was political as well as ecclesiastical tyranny; 
and about the middle of the century the French writers began to attack 
the State as well as the Church. In England,on the contrary, whatever 
occasional abuses there may have been, there was more political free- 
dom than in any other country at that time. Since the expulsion of 
James II, in 1688, the country had ceased to be a monarchy except in 
name, and had become an aristocratic republic. Representative gov- 
ernment in Parliament, local administration of justice in the counties, 
and other free institutions were safety-valves by which the steam of 
revolutionary ideas could gradually escape. In France, on the con- 
trary, literature was the only such valve; and literature was ruthlessly
-P-A-G-E-421
  EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 395 
persecuted. What wonder, then, that in 1789 the boiler burst, and the 
long pent-up steam rushed forth with terrific force? 
248. Voltaire on the Relations of Church and State 
(Voltaire, Dictionnaire philosophique portatif; art. Loi; trans. by Robinson, in his 
Readings in Eurofean History, vol. u, p. 380. Ginn & Co., Boston. Repro- 
duced by permission) 
Under the title Law, in a dictionary published anonymously in 
1764, Voltaire outlined what he conceived to be proper relation- 
ships, and indicated the reforms which ought to be made. 
No law made by the Church should ever have the least force unless 
expressly sanctioned by the government. It was owing to this precau- 
tion that Athens and Rome escaped all religious quarrels. 
Such religious quarrels are the trait of 
barbarous nations or such as have become 
barbarians. 
The civil magistrate alone may permit or 
prohibit labor on religious festivals, since it 
is not the function of the priest to forbid 
men to cultivate their fields. 
Everything relating to marriage should 
depend entirely upon the civil magistrate. 
The priests should confine themselves to the 
august function of blessing the union. 
Lending money at interest should be reg- 
ulated entirely by the civil law, since trade 
is governed by civil law. 
All ecclesiastics should be subject in every Hies6o Vor 
case to the government, since they are sub- (1694-1778) 
jects of the state. 
Never should the ridiculous and shameful custom be maintained of 
paying to a foreign priest the first year’s revenue of land given to a 
priest by his fellow-citizens. 
No priest can deprive a citizen of the least of his rights on the ground 
that the citizen is a sinner, since the priest — himself a sinner — should 
pray for other sinners, not judge them. 
Officials, laborers, and priests should all alike pay the taxes of the 
state, since they all alike belong to the state. 
There should be but one standard of weights and measures and one 
system of law: 
Let the punishment of criminals be useful. A man when hanged is 
good for nothing: a man condemned to hard labor continues to serve 
his country and furnish a living lesson.

Every law should be clear, uniform, and precise. To interpret law 
is almost always to corrupt it. 
Nothing should be regarded as infamous except vice. 
The taxes should never be otherwise than proportional to the re- 
sources of him who pays. 
; ’ 249. The Social Contract of Rousseau 
(Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, Contrat social. Paris, 1762) 
Probably no single book did more to undermine the authority 
of the French Government and make the French Revolution pos- 
sible than did the Social Contract of Rous- 
seau, published in 1762. It has been said 
that it became the Bible of the French 
Revolutionists. In it Rousseau declared 
open warfare upon the Government of his 
day, though much that he described were 
but the phantoms of his own brain. Burn- 
ing with a desire to overthrow society and 
carry men back to his imaginary state of 
“Nature,” he conjured up in his imagina- 
tion much of what he wrote. _ Still, con- 
aegcdues Rameieat ditions in France in his day were so bad 
(1712-78) that an element of truth ran through it all 
and gave the book its great popularity. 
The following extracts, the first dealing with political inequality 
and the second with ecclesiastical intolerance, are illustrative of 
the character of the volume. 
  Fic. 61. 
(a) Political Inequality 
Are not all the advantages of society for the benefit of the powerful 
and the rich? Are not all lucrative employments filled by them alone? 
And is not public authority entirely in their favor? When one of them 
robs his creditors or commits other rascalities, is he not sure of impu- 
nity? Are not the clubbings that he administers, the acts of violence 
that he commits, the murders and assassinations of which he is guilty, 
mere matters that are hushed up, and after six months no longer men- 
tioned? — But let this same man be robbed, and the entire police force 
is immediately on the alert; and woe to the innocent man whom he 
chances to suspect. — A rich man has to pass a dangerous place? See 
how many escorts he has. — The axle of his carriage breaks? Every 
one flies to his assistance. — There is a noise at his door? He speaks a 
word, and silence reigns. — The crowd incommodes him? He makes a
-P-A-G-E-423
  EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 397 
sign, and the road is clear. — A waggoner gets in the way of his car- 
riage? His flunkeys are ready to beat the waggoner to death, and fifty 
honest pedestrians would be crushed under the wheels rather than that 
the gorgeous equipage of one puppy should be retarded. . . . How dif- 
ferent is the picture of him who is poor! The more humanity owes him, 
the more society refuses him. All doors are closed to him, even when 
he has the right to have them opened; and if he sometimes obtains jus- 
tice, he does so with more difficulty than another would have in obtain- 
ing pardon fora crime. If there is a corvée to be undertaken, or militia 
to be levied, he is selected to do it. In addition to his own burden, he 
bears that which is shifted upon him by his richer neighbor. At the 
least accident that befalls him, every one deserts him. Let his poor 
cart upset, and I hold him lucky if he escapes the outrages of the brisk 
lackeys of some young duke. In a word, all free assistance flies him in 
time of need, for the very reason that-he has nothing with which to pay 
for it. But I regard him as a ruined man if he is so unfortunate as to 
have an honorable spirit, an attractive daughter, and a powerful neigh- 
bor. — Let us sum up briefly the relations between the ich man and 
the poor man: You have need of me, for I am rich and you are poor. Let 
us then make a bargain. I will vouchsafe you the honor of being my serv- 
ant, on condition that you give me what little you have left, to repay me for 
the trouble I take in lording it over you. 
. .. The whole occupation of kings and their ministers has but two 
aims, to extend their domination without, and to make it more absolute 
within. When they allege other aims, they make false pretexts. The 
expressions public good, welfare of our subjects, glory of the nation, so 
stupidly employed in public edicts, are ever the harbingers of disas- 
trous measures; and the people groan in advance when their masters 
allude to their paternal solicitude. 
(b) Theological and Civil Intolerance 
Christianity is a purely spiritual religion, occupied solely with heav- 
enly things; the country of a Christian is not of this world. He does 
his duty, it is true, but he does it with a profound indifference as to the 
good or ill success of his efforts. Provided he has nothing to reproach 
himself with, it matters little to him whether things go well or ill here 
below. If the state is flourishing, he scarcely dares enjoy the public 
felicity; he fears to become proud of the glory of his country. If the 
state degenerates, he blesses the hand of God which lies heavy upon his 
people. ... 
Should the depository of this [political] power abuse it, he regards 
this abuse as the rod with which God punishes his children. People 
would have scruples about driving out the usurper: it would be neces- 
sary to disturb the public repose, to use violence, to shed blood; all this 
accords ill with the gentleness of the Christian, and, after all, what mat-
-P-A-G-E-424
a ee ee eT ae: 
398 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ters it whether one is a slave or free in this vale of misery? The essen- 
tial thing is to go to paradise, and resignation is but one more means 
to accomplish it. 
There is, however, a profession of faith purely civil, of which it is the 
sovereign’s [i.e. the people’s] duty to decide upon the articles, not pre- 
cisely as dogmas of religion, but as sentiments of sociality without 
which it is impossible to be a good citizen or a faithful subject. Without 
being able to oblige any one to believe them, the sovereign can banish 
from the state whoever does not believe them; the sovereign should 
banish him, not as impious, but as unsocial, as incapable of loving law 
and justice sincerely, and of sacrificing at need his life to his duty. If 
. any one, having publicly acknowledged these dogmas, conducts him- 
self as if he did not acknowledge them, he should be punished with 
death; he has committed the greatest of crimes, — he has lied before 
the law. 
The dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, an- 
nounced with precision, without explanation or commentary. The ex- 
istence of a powerful, intelligent, benevolent, prescient, and provident 
Divinity, the life to come, the happiness of the just, the punishment of 
the wicked, the sacredness of the social contract and the law, — these 
are the positive dogmas. 
As to the negative dogmas, I limit them to one, — intolerance: it 
enters into the religions which we have excluded. Those who make a 
distinction between civil intolerance and theological intolerance de- 
ceive themselves, tomy mind. . These two intolerances are inseparable. 
It is impossible to live in peace with people whom one believes to be 
damned; to love them is to hate God, who punishes them; they must be 
redeemed or else tortured. Wherever theological intolerance is ad- 
mitted, it must have some civil effects; and as soon as it has them the 
sovereign is no more a sovereign, even in temporal matters. From that 
time priests are the true masters; kings are but their officers. 
250. Changes in English Thinking in the Eighteenth Century 
(Buckle, H. T., History of Civilization in England, vol. 1, pp. 309-15. 2d ed., 
. London, 1858) 
The eighteenth century was a period of profound change in 
English thinking, and many alterations in the life and habits and 
opportunities of the people took place. The result was enlight- 
ening, and paved the way for the emancipation of government 
from religious control. Buckle traces the more important of 
these changes, in the following extracts taken from his great 
work, 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
      EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 399 
In the meantime, an immense change had begun, not only among 
speculative minds, but also among the people themselves. The increase 
of scepticism stimulated their curiosity; and the diffusion of educa- 
tion supplied the means of gratifying it. Hence, we find that one of 
the leading characteristics of the eighteenth centurys and which pre- 
eminently distinguished it from all that preceded, was a craving after 
knowledge on the part of those classes from whom knowledge had hith- 
erto been shut out. It was in that great age, that there were first es- 
tablished schools for the lower orders on the only day they had time to 
attend them, and newspapers on the only day they had time to read 
them. It was then that there were first seen, in our country, circulat- 
ing libraries; and it was then, too, that the art of printing, instead of 
being almost confined to London, began to be generally practiced in 
country towns. It was also in the eighteenth century, that the earliest 
systematic efforts were made to popularize the sciences, and facilitate 
the acquisition of their general principles, by writing treatises on them 
in an easy and untechnical style; while, at the same time, the invention 
of Encyclopedias enabled their results to be brought together, and di- 
gested in a form more accessible than any hitherto employed. Then, 
too, we first meet with literary periodical reviews; by means of which 
large bodies of practical men acquired information, scanty indeed, but 
every way superior to their former ignorance. The formation of so- 
cieties for purchasing books now became general; and, before the close 
of the century, we hear of clubs instituted by reading men among the 
industrious classes. In every department, the same eager curiosity 
was shown. In the middle of the eighteenth century, debating socie- 
ties sprung up among tradesmen; and this was followed by a still 
bolder innovation, for, in 1769, there was held the first public meeting 
ever assembled in England, the first in which it was attempted to en- 
lighten Englishmen respecting their political rights. About the same 
time, the proceedings in our courts of law began to be studied by the 
people, and communicated to them through the medium of the daily 
press. Shortly before this, political newspapers arose, and a sharp 
struggle broke out between them and the two Houses of Parliament 
touching the right of publishing the debates; the end of which was, 
that both houses, though aided by the crown, were totally defeated; 
and, for the first time, the people were able to study the proceedings of 
the national legislature, and thus gain some acquaintance with the 
national affairs. . . . Finally, it was reserved for the eighteenth century, 
to set the first example of calling on the people to adjudicate upon those 
solemn questions of religion in which hitherto they had never been con- 
sulted, though it is now universally admitted that to their growing in- 
telligence these, and all other matters, must ultimately be referred. 
The extension of knowledge being thus accompanied by an increased 
simplicity in the manner of its communication, naturally gave rise to a

      greater independence in literary men, and a greater boldness in literary 
inquiries. As long as books, either from the difficulty of their style, or 
from the general incuriosity of the people, found but few readers, it was 
evident that authors must rely upon the patronage of public bodies, or 
of rich and titled individuals. And, as men are always inclined to 
flatter those upon whom they are dependent, it too often happened that 
even our greatest writers prostituted their abilities, by fawning upon 
the prejudices of their patrons. The consequence was, that literature, 
so far from disturbing ancient superstitions, and stirring up the mind to 
new inquiries, frequently assumed a timid and subservient air, natural 
toits subordinate position. But now all this was changed. Those ser- 
vile and shameful dedications; that mean and crouching spirit; that 
incessant homage to mere rank and birth; that constant confusion be- 
tween power.and right; that ignorant admiration for every thing which 
is old, and that still more ignorant contempt for every thing which is 
new; — all these features gradually became fainter; and authors, rely- 
ing upon the patronage of the people, began to advocate the claims of 
their new allies with a boldness upon which they could not have ven- 
tured in any previous age. 
From all these things there resulted consequences of vast importance. 
From this simplification, independence, and diffusion of knowledge, it 
necessarily happened, that the issue of those great disputes to which I 
have alluded, became, in the eighteenth century, more generally known 
than would have been possible in any preceding century. It is now 
known that theological and political questions were being constantly 
agitated, in which genius and learning were on one side, and orthodoxy 
and tradition on the other. It became known that the points which 
were mooted, were not only as to the credibility of certain facts, but 
also as to the truth of general principles, with which the interests and 
happiness of Man were intimately concerned. Disputes which had 
hitherto been confined to a very small part of society, began to spread 
far and wide, and suggest doubts that served as materials for national 
thought. The consequence was, that the spirit of inquiry became every 
year more active, and more general; the desire for reform constantly in- 
creased; and if affairs had been allowed to run on in their natural course, 
the eighteenth century could not have passed away without decisive 
and salutary changes both in the church and the state. 
251. The Bill of Rights of the Constitution of Pennsylvania 
(Constitution of Pennsylvania, framed in 1776. Poore, B. P., Federal and State 
Constitutions, vol. 11, p. 1541. Washington, 1877)    
Practically all the early state constitutions included a long Bill 
of Rights, and this often contained many of the items and state- 
ments of the Declaration of Independence. The following, from    
-P-A-G-E-427
    EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY. or 
the first Pennsylvania constitution, is one of the simplest of these 
Bills, and is illustrative of what they contained. 
A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the State of Pennsylvania 
I. That all men are born equally free and independent, and have cer- 
tain natural, inherent, and inalienable rights, amongst which are, the 
enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and pro- 
tecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. 
II. That all men have a natural and inalienable right to worship Al- 
mighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences and un- 
derstanding: And that no man ought or of right can be compelled to at- 
tend any religious worship, or to erect or support any place of worship, 
or maintain any ministry, contrary to, or against, his own free will and 
consent: Nor can any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be 
justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of 
his religious sentiments or peculiar mode of religious worship: And that 
no authority can or ought to be vested in, or assumed by any power 
whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner con- 
troul, the right of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship. 
III. That the people of this State have the sole, exclusive and inher- 
ent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same. 
IV. That all power being originally inherent in, and consequently 
derived from, the people; therefore all officers of government, whether 
legislative or executive, are their trustees and servants, and at all times 
accountable to them. 
V. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common 
benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation, or community; 
and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any single man, 
family, or sett of men, who are a part only of that community; And 
that the community hath an indubitable, unalienable and indefeasi- 
ble right to reform, alter, or abolish government in such manner as 
shall be by that community judged most conducive to the public weal. 
VI. That those who are employed in the legislative and executive 
business of the State, may be restrained from oppression, the people 
have a right, at such periods as they may think proper, to reduce their 
public officers to a private station, and supply the vacancies by certain 
and regular elections. 
VII. That all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having 
a sufficient evident common interest with, and attachment to the com- 
munity, have a right to elect officers, or be elected into office. 
VIII. That every member of society hath a right to be protected in 
the enjoyment of life, liberty and property, and therefore is bound to 
contribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and 
yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent thereto: 
But no part of a man’s property can be justly taken from him, or ap-
-P-A-G-E-428
  402 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
plied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of his legal repre- 
sentatives: Nor can any man who is conscientiously scrupulous of bear- 
ing arms, be justly compelled thereto, if he will pay such equivalent, 
nor are the people bound by any laws, but such as they have in like 
manner assented to, for their common good. 
IX. That in all prosecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a 
right to be heard by himself and his council, to demand the cause and 
nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses, to call for 
evidence in his favour, and a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury 
of the country, without the unanimous consent of which jury he can- 
not be found guilty; nor can he be compelled to give evidence against 
himself; nor can any man be justly deprived of his liberty except by the 
laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers. 
X. That the people have a right to hold themselves, their houses, 
papers, and possessions free from search or seizure, and therefore war- 
rants without oaths or affirmations first made, affording a sufficient 
foundation for them, and whereby any officer or messenger may be com- 
manded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person 
or persons, his or their property, not particularly described, are con- 
trary to that right, and ought not to be granted. 
XI. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between 
man and man, the parties have a right to trial by jury, which ought to 
be held sacred. 
XII. That the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writ- 
ing, and publishing their sentiments; therefore the freedom of the press 
ought not to be restrained. 
XIII. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of 
themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace 
are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the 
military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, 
the civil power. 
XIV. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles, and a 
firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, industry, and fru- 
gality are absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty, and 
keep a government free: The people ought therefore to pay particular 
attention to these points in the choice of officers and representatives, 
and have a right to exact a due and constant regard to them, from their 
legislators and magistrates, in the making and executing such laws as 
are necessary for the good government of the state. 
XV. That all men have a natural inherent right to emigrate from one 
state to another that will receive them, or to form a new state in vacant 
countries, or in such countries as they can purchase, whenever they 
think that thereby they may promote their own happiness. 
XVI. That the people have a right to assemble together, to consult 
for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply   
 
-P-A-G-E-429
    EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 403 
to the legislature for redress of grievances, by address, petition, or re- 
monstrance. 
In later times, when framing constitutions, it became common 
to leave out much of the matter contained in the Declaration of 
Independence, and to make what was retained an introduction to 
the constitution. The following heading, taken from the present 
constitution of Ohio, is illustrative of what may to-day be found 
in nearly all our state constitutions: 
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF OHIO 
We, the people of the State of Ohio, grateful to Almighty God for our 
freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare, do 
establish this constitution. 
ARTICLE I 
BILL OF RIGHTS 
(Here follows a Bill of Rights of twenty Sections) 
252. The Cahiers of 1789 
(Archives Parlementaires, vol. 1, pp. 373-78; trans. by Whitcomb) 
When the States-General was summoned to meet, in 1789, it 
was to be composed of representatives of the three orders — 
Clergy, Nobility, and the Third Estate. Each was to select its 
representatives, and to guide them sels of instructions, called 
cahiers, were drawn up in each locality. These were often long 
and detailed, and represented the wishes or grievances of each 
group. The following extract from the cahier of the clergy of 
Blois, digesting the first five divisions and reproducing the sixth, 
is interesting as revealing the nature of the clerical conception 
as to the need for and the character of the education that should 
be provided for the nation. 
CAHIER OF THE CLERGY OF BLOIS 
Containing the grievances of the order of the clergy of the bailliage of 
Blois and of the secondary bailliage of Remorantin. 
FIRST DIVISION — RELIGION 
This relates to the affairs of the Church, and deplores the extension of 
religious liberty to non-catholics and the growing freedom of the press. 
SECOND DIVISION — CONSTITUTION 
Does not see the need for constitutional reform; recognizes the right 
of the king to rule and to call the States-General; thinks this should meet

periodically, that each Order should vote separately, and that no action 
should be taken except by unanimous consent of all three Orders; that 
no tax should be laid without the consent of the nation; and that pro- 
vincial assemblies should be re-created to provide for local government. 
THIRD DIVISION — TAXES 
The rights of the clergy as to taxation, ancient, but in future willing 
to bear their proper share; financial ministers should be responsible; 
and recommends the suppression of some of the most objectionable 
taxes. 
FOURTH DIVISION — JUSTICE 
Various recommendations for the reform of the principal abuses and 
the simplification of legal procedure. 
FIFTH DIVISION — THE NOBILITY; THE CHASE 
Recommends curtailment of the abuse of the chase over the agricul- 
tural lands of peasants, and the establishment of regulations as to the 
keeping of certain kinds of game. 
SIXTH DIVISION — EDUCATION 
Impressed as we are with the great influence of public education upon 
the religion, morals and prosperity of the state, we beseech His Majesty 
to favor it with all his power. We desire: 
1. That public instruction shall be absolutely gratuitous, as well in 
the universities as in the provincial schools; 
2. That the provincial colleges shall be entrusted by preference to the 
corporations of the regular clergy; 
3. That many corporations of the regular clergy, which at present 
are not occupied with the instruction of youth, shall apply themselves 
to this work, and thereby render themselves more useful to the state; 
4. That in towns too small to support a college there shall be at least 
one or more masters, according to the importance of the place, who shall 
be able to teach the principles of Latinity or the humanities, and that 
their salaries shall be sufficient to allow of absolutely gratuitous in- 
struction; 
5. That this instruction shall be under the supervision of the parish 
priests and municipal officers; 
6. That each candidate seeking permission to teach shall be obliged 
to produce proofs of correct life and habits, and to give evidence of his 
capacity in an examination before the principal and professors of the 
nearest college. 
7. That masters of schools shall not employ as assistants persons 
from other localities, unless such persons shall have pursued the same 
vocation for at least two years in the place where they have studied,
-P-A-G-E-431
   
  EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 405 
and shall be furnished with references and recognized as competent by 
means of an examination, as above indicated; 
8. That, for the purpose of facilitating the education of girls, com- 
munities of religious women, whatever may be their institution, shall be 
obliged to open free public schools for girls under the supervision of the 
parish priests. 
We beseech His Majesty that after the examination, which shall be 
made in the States General of the cahiers of the various bailliages of the 
kingdom, this work shall be made public by means of the press, both for 
the satisfaction of constituents and for the honor of the deputies. 
(This document, recorded in the clerk’s office of the bailliage of Blois is 
signed: Abbé Ponthéves, President. Then follow the signatures of 53 
parish priests, 14 priors, 8 canons, 8 priests, 3 deans, 3 abbots, 3 curates, 
one chaplain, one friar, one deacon, and 27 persons unclassified.) 
253. The French ‘‘ Declaration of the Rights of Man ” 
(Buchez et Rouz, Histoire parlementaire, vol. x1, p. 404; trans. by Robinson, in 
his Readings:in European History, vol. 1, p. 409. Ginn & Co., Boston. Repro- 
duced by permission) 
The “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,” 
which had been demanded as a charter of liberties by many of the 
cahiers, was framed and adopted by the Constituent Assembly 
and made a part of the first French Constitution of 1791. Al- 
most all the articles in the Declaration seek to remedy some an- 
cient French abuse. The document is a clear imitation of Amer- 
ican precedents, and the comparison of it with the American 
Declaration of Independence and the Bills of Rights in various 
American state constitutions is interesting. This French Decla- 
ration exercised great influence in Europe during the nineteenth 
century, its main ideas being found in many subsequent consti- 
tutions. 
The representatives of the French people, organized as a National 
Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the 
rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the corrup- 
tion of governments, have determined to set forth in a solemn declara- 
tion the natural, inalienable, and sacred rights of man, in order that 
this declaration, being constantly before all the members of the social 
body, shall remind them continually of their rights and duties; in order 
that the acts of the legislative power, as well as those of the executive 
power, may be compared at any moment with the objects and purposes 
of all political institutions and may thus be more respected; and, lastly, 
in order that the grievances of the citizens, based hereafter upon sim- 
ple and incontestable principles, shall tend to the maintenance of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  406 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
constitution and redound to the happiness of all. Therefore the Na- 
tional Assembly recognizes and proclaims, in the presence and under 
the auspices of the Supreme Being, the following rights of man and 
of the citizen: 
ARTICLES 
1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinc- 
tions may be founded only upon the general good. 
2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the nat- 
ural and’ imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, 
property, security, and resistance to oppression. 
3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. 
No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not 
proceed directly from the nation. 
4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no 
one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no 
limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the 
enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by 
law. 
5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. 
Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one 
may be forced to do anything not provided for by law. 
6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a 
right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its 
formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. 
All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all 
dignities and to all public positions and occupations, according to their 
abilities, and without distinction except that of their virtues and 
talents. 
7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the 
cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. Any one solicit- 
ing, transmitting, executing, or causing to be executed, any arbitrary 
order, shall be punished. But any citizen summoned or arrested in 
virtue of the law shall submit without delay, as resistance constitutes 
an offense. 
8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly 
and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it 
be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before 
the commission of the offense. 
g. As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been de- 
clared guilty, if arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all harshness not 
essential to the securing of the prisoner’s person shall be severely 
repressed by law. 
to. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, provided 
their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.
-P-A-G-E-433
    EIGHTEENTH A TRANSITION CENTURY 407 
tz. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most 
precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, 
write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses 
of this freedom as shall be defined by law. 
12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires 
public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the 
good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they 
shall be entrusted. 
13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the 
public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be equit- 
ably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their means. 
14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by 
their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; 
to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the pro- 
portion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of 
the taxes. 
15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account 
of his administration. 
16. A society in which the observance of law is not assured, nor the 
separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all. 
17. Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one shall be 
deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, 
shall clearly demand it, and then only on condition that the owner 
shall have been previously and equitably indemnified.

  CHAPTER XX 
THE BEGINNINGS OF NATIONAL EDUCATION 
Tue Readings of this chapter deal with the beginnings of national 
education in France and the United States, and relate to the work 
of the French revolutionary theorists and statesmen, and to the 
beginnings of state education in the new American States. 
The first selection (254) is a good brief extract setting forth the 
great influence in France of the critical writings of Rousseau, itself 
one of the strange things in history. The second (255) gives an 
outline of the argument and proposals for national education 
made in France in 1763, by the parlementarian La Chalotais, and 
is interesting as revealing the national conception which the phi- 
losophers of France had by that time reasoned out. The third 
selection (256) is a synopsis of the famous bill of Condorcet, in 
which he proposed (1792) to organize a system of public instruc- 
tion for France. The next (257) outlines the educational work of 
the National Convention (1792-95) in France, and shows how 
far the French statesmen were able to carry out the ideas of the 
political reformers of the time. The final selection relating to 
French effort (258) describes the foundation and early work of 
the Polytechnic Schoo] at Paris. \ 
The remaining selections deal with American state beginnings. 
The first (259) reproduces the important early constitutional 
provisions of the American States; the next (260) shows the very 
progressive ideas as to state education which were embodied in 
the first Ohio Constitution; and the next (261) the broad scope 
of the system of public instruction proposed for the new State of 
Indiana. Selection (262) gives a digest of the early state legisla- 
tion as to public education in those American States which en- 
acted the most significant early school laws, and shows what it 
was proposed to enforce. The final selection (263) gives a digest 
of Jefferson’s plan of 1799 for the organization of a system of 
public instruction for Virginia — a plan French in its ideas and 
scope.

    BEGINNINGS OF NATIONAL EDUCATION 409 
254. The Far-reaching Influence of Rousseau’s Writings 
(Dabney, R. H., The Causes of the French Revolution, pp. 277-79. New York, 
1888. Reproduced by permission of the publishers, Henry Holt & Co.) 
Among the strangest things in history is the enormous and far- 
reaching influence exercised by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Of him 
Dabney writes: 
The plebeian Rousseau, living from hand to mouth, by turns valet, 
clerk, tramp, tutor, copyist, author, fugitive, was filled with unquench- 
able hatred of the rich and powerful. This hatred, together with an 
ardent love of humanity, made him burn with the desire to overthrow 
society and carry men back to that state of “nature” which he con- 
jured up in his imagination. 
Summarizing his work, Dabney writes: 
It was, of course, an absurd exaggeration in Napoleon to say that 
but for Rousseau the Revolution would not have taken place; for Rous- 
seau, like every other individual, was a product of his time, and his 
writings a result of that revolutionary movement which they merely 
hastened and strengthened. Still, their influence, in a way, was 
prodigious. A letter written by Grimm, in 1754, says that the Dijon 
prize-essay produced a species of revolution at Paris. ‘‘It is impossible 
to express or imagine,’ says Hume, writing from Paris in 1765, “the 
enthusiasm of this nation in his favor; . . . no person ever so much en- 
gaged their attention as Rousseau. Voltaire and everybody else are 
quite eclipsed by him.” ‘The circulation of his books was enormous. 
When La Nouvelle Héloise appeared, the booksellers were unable to 
meet the demand, but lent copies of it at so much a day or so much an 
hour. At first, as much as twelve sous an hour was paid per volume 
for the privilege of reading it. Painted with all the hues of a fervid 
imagination, and flaming with the fire of deep conviction, the romances 
of Rousseau produced upon all sentimental natures, and especially 
upon women, an indescribable effect. To him, more than to any other 
individual, it was due that the joys of domestic life were revealed anew 
to the upper classes in France, and that aristocratic mothers resumed 
that most beautiful of all maternal duties, the suckling of their own 
children. The brilliant salons no longer exercised such undisputed 
sway, but the pleasures of country life came into vogue, and even 
some of the upper nobles began to spend a part of the year upon their 
country estates. Return to nature and simplicity became the watch- 
word. The style of architecture became simpler, and the old style of 
landscape gardening, with its long rectilinear avenues of artificially 
trimmed box-bushes and trees, gave place to the more natural English 
style with irregular groups of trees growing with their natural rugged- 
ness and strength. Thus the whole aspect of society became tinged

with the ideas of Rousseau. For Rousseau gave utterance, with amaz- 
ing eloquence, to the thoughts that were suited to the radical spirit of 
the age.     
   
   
                              
           
                
                    
        
                     255. La Chalotais’s Essay on National Education 
(Paris, 1763. Extracts taken from Compayré) 
Louis René de Caradeuc de la Chalotais was a French magis- 
trate and statesman, and one of the strik- 
ing personalities of the pre-revolutionary 
period. In 1763 appeared La Chalotais’s 
Essai d@’éducation nationale, a practical and 
philosophical discussion of the problem of 
the education of a, people. The volume 
was warmly approved by the political phi- 
losophers of the period; was translated into 
several languages; and was deeply influ- 
ential later on in France in shaping the atti- 
tude of the State toward education. The 
following brief extracts give some idea as 
to La Chalotais’s reasoning and proposals. 
  Fic. 62. La CHALorars 
(1701-85) 
TEACHERS AND PURPOSE 
I do not presume to exclude ecclesiastics, but I protest against the 
exclusion of laymen. I dare claim for the nation an education which 
depends only on the State, because it belongs essentially to the State; 
because every State has an inalienable and indefeasible right to instruct 
its members; because, finally, the children of the State ought to be 
educated by the members of the State. 
It is certain that in the education which was given at Sparta, the 
prime purpose was to train Spartans. It is thus that in every State the 
purpose should be to enkindle the spirit of citizenship; and, in our case, 
to train Frenchmen, and in order to make Frenchmen, to labor to 
make men of them. 
    MORAL AND POLITICAL IDEAS 
The greatest vice of education, and perhaps the most inevitable, 
while it shall be entrusted to persons who have renounced the world, 
is the absolute lack of instruction on the moral and political virtues. 
Our education does not affect our habits, like that of the ancients. 
After having endured all the fatigues and irksomeness of the college, 
the young find themselves in the need of learning in what consist the 
duties common to all men. They have learned no principle for judging 
actions, evils, opinions, customs. They have everything to learn on    
-P-A-G-E-437
BEGINNINGS OF NATIONAL EDUCATION 4II 
  matters that are so important. They are inspired with a devotion 
which is but an imitation of religion, and with practices which take the 
place of virtue, and are but the shadow of it. 
NATURAL INSTRUCTION 
I wish nothing to be taught children except facts which are attested 
by the eyes, at the age of seven as at the age of thirty. 
The principles for instructing children should be those by which 
nature herself instructs them. Nature is the best of teachers. 
Every method which begins with abstract ideas is not made for 
children. 
Let children see many objects; let there be a variety of such, and 
let them be shown under many aspects and on various occasions. The 
memory and the imagination of children cannot be overcharged with 
useful facts and ideas of which they can make use in the course of their 
lives. 
Most young men know neither the world which they inhabit, the 
earth which nourishes them, the men who supply their needs, the ani- 
mals which serve them, nor the workmen and citizens whom they em- 
ploy. They have not even any desire for this kind of knowledge. No 
advantage is taken of their natural curiosity for the purpose of in- 
creasing it. They know how to admire neither the wonders of nature 
nor the prodigies of the arts. 
Education, according to La Chalotais, should be divided into 
two periods — the first from five to ten years, and the second 
from ten to seventeen. For these two periods he would have 
studies, as follows: 
  STUDIES 
First period. The exercises proposed for the first period are as fol- 
lows: learning to read, write, and draw; dancing and music, which 
ought to enter into the education of persons above the commonalty; 
historical narratives and the lives of illustrious men of every country, 
of every age, and of every profession; geography, mathematical and 
physical recreations; the fables of La Fontaine, which, whatever may 
be said of them, ought not to be removed from the hands of children, 
but all of which they should be made to learn by heart; and besides 
this, walks, excursions, merriment, and recreations; I do not propose 
even the studies except as amusements. 
Second period. The course of study for the second period should con- 
sist of French and Latin literature, or the humanities; a continuation of 
history, geography, mathematics, and natural history; criticism, logic, 
and metaphysics; the art of invention; and ethics. He would also add 
“the English language for science, and the German for war.”

TEXTBOOKS 
I would have composed for the use of the child histories of every 
nation, of every century, and particularly of the later centuries, which 
should be written with greater detail, and which should be read before 
those of the more remote centuries. I would have written the lives of 
illustrious men of all classes, conditions, and professions, of celebrated 
heroes, scholars, women, and children. 
La Chalotais put great dependence on elementary books, which 
might, he thought, be composed within two years, if the king 
would encourage the publication of them, and if the Academies. 
would put them up for competition. 
These books would be the best instruction which the masters could 
give, and would take the place of every method. Whatever course we 
may take, we cannot dispense with new books. These books, once 
made, would make trained teachers unnecessary, and there would then 
be no longer any occasion for discussion as to their qualities, whether 
they should be priests, or married, or single. All would be good, pro- 
vided they were religious, moral, and knew how to read; they would 
soon train themselves while training their pupils. 
THE STATE AND EDUCATION 
It is the State, it is the larger part of the nation, that,must be kept 
principally in view in education; for twenty millions of men ought to be 
held in greater consideration than one million, and the peasantry, who 
are not yet a class in France, as they are in Sweden, ought not to be neg- 
lected in a system of instruction. Education is equally solicitous that 
letters should be cultivated, and that the fields should be plowed; that 
all the sciences and the useful arts should be perfected; that justice 
should be administered and that religion should be taught; that there 
should be instructed and competent generals, magistrates, and ecclesi- 
astics, and skillful artists and citizens, all in fit proportion. It is for 
the government to make each citizen so pleased with his condition that 
he may not be forced to withdraw from it. 
We do not fear to assert, in general, that in the condition in which 
Europe now is, the people that are the most enlightened will always 
have the advantage over those who are less so.

      Instruction on the need for organizing a complete democratic 
system of public instruction for France, to insure the perpetua- 
tion of liberty and equality, together with a detailed bill (Projet 
de Décret) for carrying out the plan. The bill is long, but the 
following synopsis of it gives a very good idea as to the nature of 
the proposals. 
The plan instituted five grades of schools, in which the instruction 
was to be progressive: (1) Primary Schools; (2) Secondary Schools; 
(3) Institutes; (4) Lyceums; (5) a National Society of Arts and Sciences. 
The Primary School receives children at the age of six years. Every 
village containing over four hundred inhabitants must be provided 
with one. Tuition will be given in the rules of arithmetic, the first 
elements of morality, the rudimentary knowledge of natural science 
and economy, essential either to agriculture, arts, or commerce, accord- 
ing to the rural or manufacturing occupations 
of the population. Religion will be taught in 
the churches by the respective ministers of 
their different creeds. A small collection of 
books will be furnished to each school for the 
use of the children. 
In Secondary Schools, the tuition compre- 
hends grammar; the history and geography of 
France, and the neighboring countries; draw- 
ing; the principles of the mechanical arts; some 
instruction in moral and social science, with 
the explanation of the chief laws and regula- vi 
tions of agreements and contracts; the ele- Fyg, 63. ConpoRcET 
ments of mathematics, natural philosophy, (1743-94) 
natural history applied to the arts, manufac- 
tures, and commerce. Every secondary school will have a library, 
some models of machinery, and some philosophical instruments. There 
will be one at least in every district, or a school for every four thousand 
inhabitants. 
Institutes. The studies are divided into four classes, 1. Mathematical 
and physical sciences. 2. Moral and political science. 3. Application 
of the sciences to the arts. 4. Literature and the fine arts. Every in- 
stitute is furnished with a library and a collection of machines and 
scientific instruments, with a botanic, and agricultural garden; these 
three collections are public. There will be at least one institute in each 
department. 
Lyceums. The same plan and arrangements as in the Institutes, 
ut on a grander scale, in the extent and profundity of the studies. 
here should be nine lyceums in France, distributed in different parts 
f its territory.

National Society of Arts and Sciences. It was actually the Institute 
enlarged and connected by a close and direct link to instruction and 
practical science. Its duty was to direct, oversee, simplify, and in- 
crease general education. This supervision and directorship was to 
transmit from the highest to the lowest, from grade to grade, to the 
inferior ranks of the hierarchy. The law recognized beside these estab- 
lishments, five societies to encourage the progress of science, letters, 
and art, but with limited range. 
Ways and Means. Instruction in all its degrees outlined was to be 
gratuitous, and the appropriations necessary for this purpose were 
estimated at twenty-nine millions of francs. From this sum a peri- 
odical allowance of one million three hundred thousand francs was 
to be devoted to the Eléves de la patrie. Condorcet ranks under 
this term, those penniless children who distinguish themselves, at the 
beginning, or at any point whatever in their studies, and to whom the 
state furnished aid in the form of a stipend, in order to permit them to 
pursue, sheltered from need, the degrees of scientific apprenticeship 
remaining to be overcome. 
257. Founding of the Polytechnic School at Paris 
(Report of English Commissioners on Military Education. London, 1857. Compiled 
from a Report and Appendix) 
Of the more permanent fruits of the educational work of the 
Convention (179295), the founding of a number of higher tech- 
nical institutions and bureaus, many of which have continued to 
the present time, stand as memorials. Among these, the Poly- 
technic School, founded October 22, 1795, was one of the most 
important creations. The following story of its founding and 
work gives an interesting picture of this early technical school. 
The origin of the Ecole Polytechnique dates from a period of disorder 
and distress in the history of France which might seem alien to all in- 
tellectual pursuits, if we did not remember that the general stimulus 
of a revolutionary period often acts powerfully upon thought and edu- 
cation. It is, perhaps, even more than the Institute, the chief scien- 
tific creation of the first French Revolution. . . . 
The school and its plan were both owing to an immediate and press: 
ing want. It was to be partly military and partly civil. Military, a 
well as civil education, had been destroyed by the revolutionists. Th 
committee of public safety had, indeed, formed a provisional schoo 
for engineers at Metz, to supply the immediate wants of the army 0} 
the frontier, and at this school young men were hastily taught the el 
ments of fortification, and were sent direct to the troops, to learn 
they best could, the practice of their art. “But such a method,” say 
the report accompanying the law which founded the school, “does n

form engineers in any true sense of the term and can only be justified by 
the emergency of the time. The young men should be recalled to the 
new school to complete their studies.” ... Such was the immediate 
motive for the creation of this school. At first, it only included the 
engineers amongst its pupils. But the artillery were added within a 
year. 
When the school first started there was scarcely another of any de- 
scription in France. For nearly three years the revolution had de- 
stroyed every kind of teaching. The attack upon the old schools, in 
France as elsewhere, chiefly in the hands of the clergy, had been begun 
by a famous report of Talleyrand’s, presented to the legislative assem- 
bly in 1791, which recommended to suppress all the existing academies 
within Paris and the provinces, and to replace them by an entirely 
new system of national education through the country. In this plan 
a considerable number of military schools were proposed, where boys 
were to be educated from a very early age. When the violent revolu- 
tionists were in power, they adopted the destructive part of Talley- 
rand’s suggestions without the other. All schools, from the university 
downwards, were destroyed; the large exhibitions or Bowrses, number- 
ing nearly 40,000, were confiscated or plundered by individuals, and 
even the military schools and those for the public works (which were 
absolutely necessary for the very roads and the defense of the country) 
were suppressed or disorganized. The school of engineers at Méziéres 
(an excellent one, where Monge had been a professor) and that of the 
artillery at La Fére, were both broken up, whilst the murder of Lavoi- 
sier, and the well-known saying in respect to it, that “the Republic had 
no need of chemists,” gave currency to a belief, which Fourcroy ex- 
pressed in proposing the Polytechnic, “that the late conspirators had 
formed a deliberate plan to destroy the arts and sciences, and to estab- 
lish their tyranny on the ruins of human reason.” 
Thus it was on the ruin of all the old teaching, that the new institu- 
tion was erected; a truly revolutionary school, as its founders delighted 
to call it, using the term as it was then commonly used, as a synonym 
for all that was excellent. And then for the first time avowing the 
principle of public competition, its founders, Monge and Fourcroy, 
began their work with an energy and enthusiasm which they seem to 
have left as a traditional inheritance to their school. It is curious to 
see the difficulties the bankruptcy of the country threw in their way, 
and the vigor with which, assisted by the summary powers of the re- 
ublican government, they overcame them. ‘They begged the. old 
alais Bourbon for their building; were supplied with pictures from the 
ouvre; the fortunate capture of an English ship gave them some uncut 
iamonds for their first experiments; presents of military instruments 
ere sent from the arsenals of Havre; and even the hospitals con-

    tributed some chemical substances. In fine, having set their school in 
motion, the government and its professors worked at it with such zeal 
and effect, that within five months after their project was announced, 
they had held their first entrance examination, open to the competition 
of all France, and started with three hundred and seventy-nine pupils. 
During the first years after its foundation the Polytechnic grew and 
flourished in the general dearth of public teaching, being indeed not 
merely the only great school, but, until the Institute was founded, 
the only scientific body in France. Working on its first idea of high 
professorial lectures, practically applied and explained by répétiteurs, 
its success on its own purely scientific line was, and has continued to 
be, astonishing. ... All the great engineers and artillerymen of the 
Empire belonged to it, and the long pages in its calendar of distin- 
guished men are the measure of its influence on the civil and military 
services of France. In fact its pupils, at a time of enormous demands, 
supplied all the scientific offices of the army, and directed all the chief 
public works, fortresses, arsenals, the improvement of cities, the great 
lines of roads, shipbuilding, mining, — carried out, in a word, most of 
the great improvements of Napoleon. He knew the value of his school, 
“the hen” as he called it, “that laid him golden eggs”’ — and perhaps 
its young pupils were not improved by the excessive official patronage 
bestowed by him upon “the envy of Europe,” “the first school in the 
world.” It can not, however, be a matter of surprise, that its vigor 
: and success should have caused Frenchmen, even those who criticise 
its influence severely, to regard it with pride as an institution unrivaled 
for scientific purposes.   
  258. The Work of the National Convention in France 
(Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. xx, pp. 227-20) 
The National Convention, which was in existence from Sep- 
tember 21, 1792, to October 26, 1795, in France, was the third 
legislative body following the States-General of 1789. It mani- 
fested great interest in the organizing of primary education, and 
many types of projected laws for the organization of a state sys- 
tem of public instruction were discussed by it. The following is 
a digest of its educational activities in so far as these relate to 
elementary education, and of the main provisions of the Law of 
1795 which it finally enacted. 
(a) Various Legislative Proposals 
The National Convention, by decrees, dated December 12, 1792, 
May 30, 1793, and October 21, 1793, ordered and provided for th
-P-A-G-E-443

establishment of primary schools. Every neighborhood, with 400 in- 
habitants, “must have a public school, in which children of all classes 
could receive that first education, — physical, moral, and intellectual, 
— the best adapted to develop in them republican manners, patriotism, 
and the love of labor, and to render them worthy of liberty and equal- 
ity.” Pupils must be taught to speak, read, and write correctly the 
French language; the geography of France; the Rights and Duties of 
- Men and Citizens; the first notions of natural and familiar objects; 
the use of numbers, the compass, the level, the system of weights and 
measures, the mechanical powers, and measurement of time. They 
were to be taken often into the fields and the workshops where they 
might see agricultural and mechanical operations going on, and take 
part in the same so far as their age would allow. 
By a subsequent decree (October 29, 1793,) a local commission of 
intelligent, public-spirited, and moral persons was to be appointed to 
locate the school, and hold a public examination of all candidates for 
the position of teachers, as to their acquirements, aptitude for instruc- 
tion, and moral character. From a list of the successful candidates, 
the parents and guardians of the district in which a school was to be 
opened, if any vacancy existed, might in public meeting choose a 
teacher. For the teacher thus examined, approved, and selected, the 
law fixed a minimum salary of 1200 francs, to be paid out of the public 
treasury. This salary could be increased by the liberality of the dis- 
trict and of the parents. By a decree of December roth of the same 
year (1793), “liberty of instruction is proclaimed, — citizens and citi- 
zenesses, who can produce a certificate of civism and good morals, can 
inform the municipal authorities of their intention to teach, and of the 
subjects which they propose to teach, and open a school where they 
please.’”’ This liberty was abridged by a law passed November 17, 1794, 
so far as to subject the teacher and his school to the approbation of a 
“jury of instruction to be chosen by the district administration from 
among the fathers of families.” This law, which was repealed August 
31, 1797, provided that the residence of the clergyman, if not already 
sold for the benefit of the republic under the decree of March 8, 1793, 
should be assigned to the schoolmaster for a dwelling and a school. 
(The same law added to the penalty (in the law of 1793), of a fine on 
arents who failed to send their children to school, a requirement “that 
hose young citizens who have not attended school shall be examined, 
in the presence of the people, at the Feast of the Young, and if they 
hall be found not to have the requirements necessary for French citi- 
ens, shall be excluded from all public functions until they have at- 
ained them.” To the course of instruction laid down in the decree of 
793, the law of 1794 added “gymnastics, military exercises, and swim-     
       
   
                                                     
       
    
          
There is much that is extravagant in these requirements of a public

school to be set up in every neighborhood of 400 inhabitants, poor as 
the entire rural population of France had been made by exactions of 
the privileged few, and ignorant as the great majority of parents had 
been left by all the previous agencies and facilities of education. And 
yet in these enactments we find expressed the highest aspirations of the 
most advanced educators of this age, and much that is now realized in 
the best public schools of Germany and the United States. Just be- 
cause the law required more than could be performed, or than the - 
existing instrumentalities of administration could educate the public 
mind to appreciate and sustain, it remained a dead letter, or gave way 
to enactments less exacting and less salutary. 
      
    
       
      
   
      
     
     
    
       
    
    (b) The Law of 1795 organizing Primary Instruction 
The only permanent contribution of this period of French legis- 
lation to the system of elementary schools was a chapter of eleven 
articles in the Decree concerning the Organization of Public Instruc- 
tion, October 25, 1795 (3 Brumaire, year IV), founded on a re- 
markable report of Daunau, in which the whole subject of public 
instruction is ably discussed. 
This decree was the sole legacy of the conventions of the people 
which legislated for France in the matter of primary instruction. 
The following are the provisions respecting primary schools: 
Art. 1. There shall be established in every canton of the republic 
one or more primary schools, whose territorial limits shall be deter- 
mined by the departmental authorities. 
2. There shall be established in every department several juries or 
committees of instruction, the members not to exceed six, and each to 
be composed of three members appointed by the departmental authori- 
ties. 
3. The teachers of the primary schools shall be examined by one of 
the juries of instruction, and upon the presentation of the municipal 
authorities, shall be appointed by the departmental administration. 
4. They shall be dismissed only on the concurrence of the same 
authorities, at the proposal of a jury of instruction, and after having 
had a hearing. 
5. In every primary school shall be taught reading, writing, cypher- 
ing, and the elements of Republican morals. 
6. Every primary teacher shall be furnished by the republic wit 
a residence, (with school-room for his pupils,) anda garden. Instead o: 
a residence and garden, the teacher may be paid an equivalent in money, 
7. They, as well as the professors of the central and special schools 
may perform other duties, not incompatible with teaching, and receiv

8. They shall receive from each pupil an annual fee, to be fixed by 
the departmental administration. 
g. The school fee may be remitted to one-fourth of the pupils of 
each school, on account of poverty. 
to. The regulations of the primary schools shall be decided by the 
departmental administration, subject to the approbation of the Execu- 
tive Directory. 
ir. The municipal authorities shall exercise direct supervision over 
the primary schools, and shall see to the execution of the laws and 
decrees of the higher administrations relating to the same. 
250. Early Constitutional Provisions relating to Education in the 
United States 
(Selected from the early state constitutions, as given in Poore, B. P., Charters and 
Constitutions. 2 vols., Washington, 1877) 
Between 1776 and 1800 all the original States, except Connecti- 
cut and Rhode Island, framed written state constitutions, and 
some of the States revised them one or more times before 1800. 
Of the thirteen original States and Vermont (admitted in 1791), 
seven of the fourteen had considered education of sufficient im- 
portance to warrant the incorporation of a section or article con- 
cerning it in their constitutions. 
The constitutions of the seven States which had made some 
constitutional provision regarding education fall into three 
classes. The first, represented by Delaware and the first Georgia 
constitution, merely briefly direct the establishment of schools; 
the second, represented by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and 
ermont, have good sections directing the encouragement of 
earning and schools; while the third, represented by North Caro- 
ina and the first Pennsylvania constitution, direct the establish- 
ent of schools wherein tuition shall be cheap. In its second 
constitution, Pennsylvania went over completely to the mainten- 
nce only of a pauper-school system. 
The constitutional provisions relating to education in these 
leven early state constitutions were as follows: 
VERMONT, 1. Constitution of 1777 
Sec. xt. A school or schools shall be established in every town, by 
e legislature, for the convenient instruction of youth, with such sala- 
les to the masters, paid by each town; making proper use of school 
ds in each town, thereby to enable them to instruct youth at low

    prices. One grammar school in each county, and one university in this 
State, ought to be established by direction of the General Assembly. 
Sec. x1. Laws for the encouragement of virtue and prevention of 
vice and immorality, shall be made and constantly kept in force; and 
provision shall be made for their due execution; and all religious socie- 
ties or bodies of men, that have or may be hereafter united and incor- 
porated, for the advancement of religion and learning, or for other 
pious and charitable purposes, shall be encouraged and protected in 
the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities and estates which they, in 
justice ought to enjoy, under such regulations, as the General Assembly 
of this State shall direct. 
2. Constitution of 1787 
Chap. u, Sec. 38. Laws for the encouragement of virtue, and pre- 
vention of vice and immorality, ought to be constantly kept in force, 
and duly executed; and a competent number of schools ought to be 
maintained in each town for the convenient instruction of youth; and 
one or more grammar schools be incorporated, and properly supported 
in each county in this State. And all religious societies, or bodies of 
men, that may be hereafter united or incorporated, for the advance- 
ment of religion and learning, or for other pious and charitable pur- 
poses, shall be encouraged and protected in the enjoyment of the priv- 
ileges, immunities, and estates, which they in justice ought to enjoy 
under such regulations as the General Assembly of this State shall 
direct. 
This section was also incorporated in the constitution of 1793 
unchanged, and is still in force.

of Harvard College, or to the said college by some other description, 
under several charters successively, it is declared that all the said gifts, 
grants, devises, legacies, and conveyances are hereby forever confirmed 
unto the president and fellows of Harvard College, and to their suc- 
cessors, in the capacity aforesaid, according to the true intent and 
meaning of the donor or donors, grantor or grantors, devisor or

act described, constituted the overseers of Harvard College, and it 
being necessary, in this new constitution of government, to ascertain 
who shall be deemed successors to the said governor, deputy governor, 
and magistrates, it is declared that the governor, lieutenant-governor,

The first constitution of Ohio, framed by a convention meeting 
Chillicothe, November 1~29, 1803, the year after its admission 
a State, contained two sections which were noteworthy, for the 
e, for the strong stand taken for religious freedom and against 
discrimination against children of the poor in the new schools

Sec. 3. That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship 
Almighty God according to the dictates of their conscience; that no 
human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with 
the rights of conscience; that no man shall be compelled to attend, 
erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, 
against his consent; and that no preference shall ever be given by law 
to any religious society or mode of worship; and no religious test shall 
be required as a qualification to any office of trust or profit. But re- 
ligion, morality, and knowledge being essentially necessary to the good 
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of 
instruction shall forever be encouraged by legislative provision, not in- 
consistent with the rights of conscience. 
Sec. 25. That no law shall be passed to prevent the poor in the sev- 
eral counties and townships within this State, from an equal partici- 
pation in the schools, academies, colleges, and. universities within this 
State, which are endowed, in whole or in part, from the revenues arising 
from the donations made by the United States for the support of schools 
and colleges; and the doors of the said schools, academies, and univer- 
sities shall be open for the reception of scholars, students, and teachers 
of every grade, without any distinction or preference whatever, con- 
trary to the intent for which the said donations were made.

and spreading the opportunities and advantages of education throug| 
the various parts of the country being highly conducive to this end,

                                      said, shall be and remain a fund for the exclusive purpose of promoting 
the interest of literature and the sciences, and for the support of semi- 
naries and the public schools. The general assembly shall, from time 
to time, pass such laws as shall be calculated to encourage intellectual, 
scientifical, and agricultural improvement by allowing rewards and 
immunities for the promotion and improvement of arts, sciences, 
commerce, manufactures, and natural history; and to countenance and 
encourage the principles of humanity, industry, and morality. 
Src. 2. It shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as cir- 
cumstances will permit, to provide by law for a general system of edu- 
cation, ascending in a regular graduation from township schools to a 
State university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to 
all. 
Sec. 3. And for the promotion of such salutary end, the money 
which shall be paid as an equivalent by persons exempt from military 
duty, except in times of war, shall be exclusively, and in equal propor- 
tions, applied to the support of county seminaries; also, all fines 
assessed for any breach of the penal laws shall be applied to said 
seminaries, in the counties wherein they shall be assessed. 
Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as cir- 
cumstances will permit, to form a penal code, founded on the principles 
of reformation, and not of vindictive justice; and also to provide one or 
more farms to be an asylum for such persons who, by reason of age, in- 
firmity, or other misfortunes, may have a claim upon the aid and bene- 
ficence of society, on such principles that such persons may therein find 
employment and every reasonable comfort, and lose by their usefulness 
the degrading sense of dependence. : 
Sec. 5. The general assembly, at the time they lay off a new county, 
shall cause at least ro per cent to be reserved out of the proceeds of the 
sale of town-lots in the seat of justice of such county for the use of a 
public library for such county; and at the same session they shall in- 
corporate a library company, under such rules and regulations as will 
best secure its permanence and extend its benefits. 
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      
   262. Early American State School Legislation 
(Digest of legislation, compiled from state histories) 
       The States making the best provision for schools early in their 
national history were the four Calvinistic-Puritan States in New 
England, and the State of New York, which early became a vir- 
tual westward extension of New England. Beside supporting 
the three colony colleges — Harvard, Dartmouth, ‘and Yale — 
and maintaining grammar schools and academies, the laws of 
ese five States made, for the time, good provisions for the man-

  agement and support of a state system of elementary. schools. 
Summarized briefly by States the laws enacted provided as 
follows: 
Vermont. First general state school law in 1782. District system 
authorized. Support of schools by district tax or rate bill on parents 
optional. State aid granted. 1797 — Districts failing to provide 
schools to receive no state assistance. Reading, writing, and arithme- 
tic to be taught in all schools. 1810 — Town school tax obligatory, 
and gradually increased from 1 per cent to 3 per cent by 1826. 1825 — 
State school fund created. 1827 — New school law required towns to 
build school buildings; required certificates of teachers; made the be- 
ginnings of school supervision; and added spelling, grammar, history, 
geography, and good behavior to the list of required school subjects. 
New Hampshire. First general state school law in 1789. Town tax 
required, and rate fixed; teachers’ certificates required: English schools 
and Latin schools required in the larger towns. 1791 — Town taxes 
for schools increased. 1821 — State school fund created. 1827 — 
Poor children to be provided with schoolbooks free. 
Massachusetts. First general state school law in 1789. This legal- 
ized the practices in education of the past hundred and fifty years, and 
changed them into state requirements. A six-months elementary 
school required in every town, and twelve-months if having too fami- 
lies. Also a six-months grammar school required of every town having 
150 families, and twelve-months if 200 families. All teachers to be 
certificated, and all grammar school teachers to be college graduates 
"or certificated by the minister as skilled in Latin. These laws also 
applied to Maine, which was a part of Massachusett§ until 1820. 
Connecticut. Laws of 1700 and 1712 required all parishes or school 
societies operating schools to maintain an elementary school for from 
six to eleven months a year, varying with the size of the parish. Law of 
1714 required inspection of schools and teachers. These laws continued 
in force by the new State. A permanent school fund had been created 
in 1750 by the sale of some Connecticut lands, and in 1795, on the sale} 
of the Western Reserve in Ohio for $1,200,000, this was added to the| 
permanent school fund. 1798 — School visitors and overseers ordered] 
appointed. 
New York. Little of an educational nature had been done in thi: 
State before the Revolution, except in the matter of church charit 
schools. In 1795 a law, valid for five years, was enacted which distrib 
uted $100,000 a year to the counties for schools. By 1798 there wer 
1352 schools in 16 of the 23 counties, and 59,660 children were enrolled 
On the expiration of the law, in 1800, it could not be reénacted. B:

on the basis of school census, and the first State Superintendent of

263. Jefferson’s Plan for Education in Virginia 
(Jefferson, Thomas, Notes of the State of Virginia, pp. 243-40) 
In 1799 Jefferson, then a member of the Virginia Legislature, 
submitted to that body a comprehensive bill “For the more 
general diffusion of knowledge” in the State, through the organ- 
ization of a complete state system of 
schools. The plan! was not approved, 
but in the following statement Jeffer- 
son gives the more important pro- 
visions of his bill. 
This bill proposes to lay off every 
county into small districts of five or six 
miles square, called hundreds, and in 
each of them to establish a ‘school for 
teaching reading, writing, and arithme- 
tic. The tutor to be supported by the 
hundred, and every person in it entitled 
to send their children three years gratis, 
and as much longer as they please, pay- Fyg. 64, Tuomas JEEFERSON

a visitor, who is annually to chuse the 
boy, of best genius in the school, of those whose parents are too poor to 
give them further education, and to send him forward to one of the 
grammar schools, of which twenty are proposed to be erected in differ- 
ent parts of the country, for teaching Greek, Latin, geography, and the 
higher branches of numerical arithmetic. Of the boys thus sent in any 
me year, trial is to be made at the grammar schools one or two years, 
nd the best genius of the whole selected, and continued six years, and 
he residue dismissed. By this means twenty of the best geniuses will 
e raked from the rubbish annually, and be instructed, at the public 
xpence, so far as the grammar schools go. At the end of six years’ in- 
truction, one half are to be discontinued (from among whom the gram- 
ar schools will probably be supplied with future masters); and the 
ther half, who are to be chosen for the superiority of their parts and

disposition, are to be sent and continued three years in the study of 
such sciences as they shall chuse, at William and Mary college, the plan 
of which is proposed to be enlarged, . . . and extended to all the useful 
sciences. The ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would 
be the teaching of all the children of the state reading, writing, and 
common arithmetic: turning out ten annually of superior genius, well 
taught in Greek, Latin, geography, and the higher branches of arith- 
metic: turning out ten others annually, of still superior parts, who, to 
those branches of learning, shall have added such of the sciences as 
their genius shall have led them to: the furnishing to the wealthier part 
of the people convenient schools, at which their children may be edu- 
cated, at their own expense. . . . Of all the view of this law none is 
more important, none more legitimate, than that of rendering the people 
safe, as they are the ultimate guardians of their own liberty. For this 
purpose the reading in the first stage, where they will receive their 
whole education, is proposed, as has been said, to be chiefly historical. 
History by apprising them of the past will enable them to judge of the 
future.

CHAPTER XXI 
NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER FOR THE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
    
      
    
      
    
              
    
         Tue Readings of this chapter deal with the work of Rousseau, 
Basedow, Pestalozzi, and Fellenberg, and the influence of their 
work in redirecting and reshaping the elementary vernacular school. 
Largely out of their labors, coming at a time when the democratic 
theory of education was fast superseding the religious, the elemen- 
tary school of the nineteenth century was given form and direction. 
The first selection (264) gives a series of illustrative extracts 
from the Emile of Rousseau, extracts which are characteristic of 
Rousseau’s thought and form of treatment. The second and third 
selections deal with the work of the German educational reformer, 
Basedow. The second (265) outlines the course of instruction 
given to each class in the institution he established at Dessau, and 
the third (266) being a page from his famous Elementarwerk. 
The remainder of the Readings deal with the work of the more 
celebrated German-Swiss reformer, Pestalozzi. The first of these 
(267) is an explanation from Pestalozzi’s own pen, made toa 
Society supporting his work, in which he tells them the ob- 
jects he had in mind in his work. The three selections which 
follow are appreciative estimates of Pestalozzi’s labors. The 
first (268) is by Professor John Griscom, of New York; the second 
(269) by the New England educator, Woodbridge; and the third, 
(270) by the English Dr. Mayo. The Reading following these 
(271) is a careful comparison of the work of Basedow and Pesta- 
lozzi, pointing out the comparative merits of the work of each. 
The final selection of the chapter (272) is a description and esti- 
mate of the agricultural and mechanical and literary Institute of 
Emmanuel Fellenberg, at Hofwyl, the prototype of all such insti- 
tutions in the nineteenth century. 
264. The Emile of Jean-Jacques Rousseau 
(Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, Emile. Paris, 1762. Trans. in Barnard’s American 
Journal of Education, vol. v) 
In 1762 there appeared in Paris, from the pen of a man who had 
declared war on organized society, two of the most influential 
   
-P-A-G-E-456
  430 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
books of the eighteenth century. One was the Contrat social 
(R. 249), and the other the Emile. The first dealt with the condi- 
tions under which organized government should continue, and the 
second with the education of an imaginary boy and his future 
wife. The Emile was divided into five books, as follows: 
Book I. Infancy, or education to the age of five. 
Book If. Childhood, or education from five to twelve. 
Book III. Boyhood, or education from twelve to fifteen. 
Book IV. Adolescence, or education from fifteen to eighteen. 
Book V. Youth, or education from eighteen to twenty, and the 
education of his future wife, Sophie. 
The volume was written in charming literary style, but pre- 
sented no workable plan for education. Instead it set forth 
Rousseau’s criticisms of the education of his time and his ideas, 
largely drawn from the Thoughts of John Locke (Rs. 216, 217, 
228, 229), as to needed reforms in educational procedure. He 
popularized the best ideas of Locke and scattered them over 
Europe, thus awakening an interest in the education of children 
before unknown. 
The following extracts from the Emile give some idea as to 
Rousseau’s style, method of treatment, and ideas. 
(a) The Preface. 
The book was originally written for a thoughtful mother. Even if 
the thoughts contained in it are of no value in themselves, they ought 
to serve to awaken valuable thoughts in others. Every body writes 
and cries out against the usual methods of instruction, but no one sug- 
gests a better one. The knowledge of our century serves much more 
for destroying than for building up. 
Childhood is not understood. The most judicious, in their teaching, 
confine themselves to that which it is necessary for a man to know; 
without considering what children are fit to learn. “They are always 
seeking for a man in the child, without ever thinking what the child is 
before it becomes a man. 
My system is nature’s course of development. This term will be 
mistaken by many of my readers. They will take my book to be, not a 
work upon education, but the dreams of a visionary. I do not see as 
others do; but can I give myself others’ eyes? I can not change my; 
views; I can only suspect them. It has been often said to me, Propose| 
only what can be accomplished. This means, propose something which| 
is done now; or, at least, something good, of such a kind that it will] 
come into agreement with prevalent evils. Such a collocation woul  
-P-A-G-E-457
  NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 431 
destroy the good without healing the bad. I would rather adhere 
entirely to what is already received than to try any half measures. 
(b) The Three Teachers of Men. 
We come weak into the world, and need strength; bare of every 
thing, and need assistance. All which we have not at our birth, and 
have when we grow up, we acquire by education. This education we 
receive either from nature, from man, or from things. The inner de- 
velopment of our powers and organs is the education of nature; the use 
which we are taught to make of this development, is education by man; 
and what we learn by our own experience of the circumstances which 
have an influence over us, the education by things. 
The natural man is complete within himself; his is the numerical 
unity; an absolute whole; which has relations only with itself, or with 
its like. The man of society is only a fraction, which depends on its 
denominator, and whose value is determined by its relations to the 
whole; to the social body. Those modes of education are best for so- 
ciety, which are most efficient in perverting man from nature; in rob- 
bing him of his absolute existence, in giving him the relative one, such 
that after it he will feel and act only as a member of society. 
This opposition between education for a citizen and for a man, cor- 
responds with the opposition between public education together, and 
private education in the family. The former existed in Sparta; but 
exists no longer, for there is no longer any fatherland, or any citizens. 
Thus, there remains for us only private education, or that of nature. 
But what would the man educated only for himself become afterward, 
among others? To know this, it is necessary to know the completely 
educated man; and also the natural man. This book is intended to 
assist in gaining such knowledge. 
What now is necessary to be done to educate the natural man? 
Much, no doubt; chiefly in order to hinder any thing from being done. 
The child should be educated for the common human vocation, not 
for any special situation; he must merely live, in good or evil, as life 
should bring them; and should learn more by experience than by teach- 
ing. Considering the instability of human affairs, and the restless, 
rebellious spirit of the present century, which is overturning every 
thing, no more unnatural method of education could be devised than. 
that which deals with a child as if he were never to leave home, or the 
companionship of his own friends. As soon as the unhappy pupil has , 
gone a step away, he is lost. 
(c) Handling Children properly. 
Ever since children have been instructed, no other means have been 
invented of managing them, but emulation, energy, jealousy, covetous- 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  432 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ness, and debased fear; those easily-excited, most dangerous and soul- 
destroying passions. At every injudicious lesson, you plant a vice 
deep within the heart. Foolish teachers think they have done wonders, 
when they have made the children bad, in order to communicate to 
them the idea of goodness. Then they say gravely, “Such is human 
nature.” Such is your discipline, rather. 
Let children be children. If we choose to reverse the order of things, 
we shall get premature and flavorless fruits, which soon decay; we 
shall have young doctors and old children. We might as well expect 
children to be five feet high, as to have judgment in their tenth year. 
(d) Education Negative to the Twelfth Year. 
The usual education is such as if children leaped, at one bound, from 
the mother’s breast to the age of reason. An entirely opposite method 
is the necessary one; an entirely negative one; which does not teach 
virtue and truth, but seeks to preserve the heart from vices, and the 
understanding from error. If you can bring your pupil to his twelfth 
year healthy and strong, even if he could not distinguish his right hand 
from his left, the eyes of his understanding would open to your first 
lesson in reason; for he would have no prejudices, habits, or any thing 
to stand in the way of the efficacy of your efforts. He would soon be- 
come, under your hands, the wisest of men; and although you began 
with doing nothing, you would have accomplished a wonder of educa- 
tion. 
Do the opposite of what is usual and you will almost always do right. 
From the efforts to make the child not a child, but a doctor, come the 
multiplied fault-findings, flatteries, threats, and reasonings of fathers 
and teachers. Be reasonable enough not to reason with your pupil. 
Make him practice his body, his limbs, his senses, his faculties; but 
keep his soul as inactive as possible; let the character of childhood 
ripen in the child. By such delay you gain time to learn the gradually 
developing character of your pupil, before you undertake to guide it, 
and make precipitate mistakes. 
(e) Emile’s Character at the Age of Twelve. 
His exterior indicates self-possession and ease; he speaks with sim- 
plicity, and does not talk unnecessarily. His ideas are confined and 
clear; he knows nothing by rote, but much by experience. If he does 
not read so well in books, he reads better in the book of nature; he has 
less memory than power of judgment; he speaks but one language, but 
understands what he says. If he does not speak so well as others, he is 
much more capable of doing. He knows nothing of routine, custom, 
or habit; and what he did yesterday does not indicate what he will do 
to-day. Neither authority nor example impose upon him; he does and
-P-A-G-E-459
      NEW. THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 433. 
says only what seems good to him. He knows nothing of study, 
speech, or manners; but his language corresponds with his ideas, and 
his behavior arises from his wishes. 
He has few moral ideas, but they are such as correspond to his age. 
Speak to him of duty or obedience, he does not know what you mean; 
order him, he does not understand you; but say to him, if you will do 
this to please me, I will sometime do something to please you, and he 
will instantly exert himself to comply with your wish; for nothing will 
please him more than to add to his legitimate influence over you, 
which he holds inviolable. 
If he needs help himself, he makes use of the first that comes to hand, 
whether it be a king or a servant; for all men are alike to his sight. He 
shows to him whom he asks, that he does not consider any one bound 
to grant his request. He is simple and laconic in his expressions, and 
neither servile nor arrogant. Grant his request, and he does not thank 
you, but feels that he is your debtor; refuse it,and he does not complain 
nor urge you, but lets the matter drop. 
Lively, active, he undertakes nothing too great for his powers, but 
which he has tried and understands. He has an observing and intel- 
ligent eye; and asks no useless questions about what he sees, but ex- 
amines it himself. As his imagination is yet inactive, and nothing has 
been done to stimulate it, he sees only what really exists, does not over- 
estimate danger, and is always cool. 
Business and play are the same to him, his play is his business; he 
finds no difference between them. Among city children, there is none 
more dextrous than he, and all are weaker; he is equal to country chil- 
dren in strength, and surpasses them in dexterity. He is fit to lead his 
companions, by his talent and experience, without any other authority, 
without wishing to command; he is at the head of the rest, and they 
obey him without knowing it. 
He is a mature child, and has lived a child’s life; his happiness has 
not been exchanged for his education. If he dies young, his death is 
to be mourned, but not his life. 
Ordinary men would not understand a boy so trained; they would 
see in him nothing but a scapegrace. A teacher could make no parade 
with him, could ask him no show questions; and those are the chief of 
the education of the day. 
    (f) Emile in his Fifteenth Vear. 
Being obliged to learn by means of himself, he uses his own under- 
standing, not that of other men; and yields nothing to authority. For 
most of our errors come less from ourselves than from others. By this 
continual practice, his mind has acquired a strength like that which is 
given to the body by labor and hardship. For the same reason his 
powers develop themselves only in proportion to his growth. He re- 
    
-P-A-G-E-460
         434 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  members only what has commended itself to his understanding. Thus 
he has little knowledge, but no half knowledge. He knows that his 
knowledge is not great; his mind is open, decided, and, if not instructed, 
at least capable of instruction. Of all that he does he knows the use, 
and of all he believes, the reason. He proceeds slowly, but thoroughly. 
He possesses only natural knowledge; none of history; and none of 
mathematics and ethics. He knows little of generalizing and forming 
abstractions; he observes properties common to many bodies, without 
reasoning upon the existence of these properties. What is strange to 
him he values only by its relations to himself, but this valuation is 
sufficient and certain. What is most useful to him he values most, and 
cares nothing for opinion. 
Emile is laborious, moderate, patient, persevering, and courageous. 
His fancy, not heated in any way, never magnifies danger; he can en- 
dure sorrow with fortitude, for he has not been trained to oppose him- 
self to fate. What death is, he does not rightly know, but, being accus- 
tomed to submit without resistance to the laws of necessity, he will die, 
when he must, without sighing and without pretense. Nature does 
not require more of us, in that moment, so abhorred by all. To live 
free, to set the heart as little as possible upon human things, is the 
surest means of learning to die. 
Emile is destitute of the social virtues. He acts without respect to 
others; and it is right in his eyes that others should have no regard to 
him. He makes no demands upon others, he thinks himself under no 
obligation to any one. Standing alone in society, he counts only upon 
himself, and is capable of more than others at his age. He has no errors 
or vices, except such as are unavoidable. His body is healthy, his 
members are disciplined, his understanding correct and without preju- 
dices, his heart free and without passions. Self-esteem, first and most 
natural of all the passions, has scarcely awakened in him. Without 
destroying the peace of any one, he has lived as peacefully, happily, and 
freely as nature will permit. Do you find that the child, thus educated 
to his fifteenth year, has wasted his earliest years? 
(g) Emile, a Natural Man. 
Emile now for the first time appears upon the theater of the world; 
or rather he stands behind the scenes, sees the players dress and un- 
dress themselves; and by what coarse means the spectators are de- 
ceived. It will elevate him to see how the human race makes sport of 
itself. Educated in entire freedom, he will sorrow over the misery of 
kings, those slaves of all. those who obey them; false wise men, in the 
chains of their vain honors; rich fools, the martyrs to their own luxury. 
He will be in danger of thinking himself wise, and all others fools; and 
only mortifying experience can protect him from such vanity. 
I shall be thought a visionary, and Emile a phantasy, because he is
-P-A-G-E-461
    NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 435 
so different from ordinary youths. It is overlooked that he is a natural 
man, but that other youths are brought up according to the notions of 
men. 
Others, at Emile’s age, are already philosophers and theologians; 
while he does not know yet what philosophy is, and even has not yet 
heard God spoken of. 
I am no visionary; my pedagogy is based upon experience; since 
without regard to rank, nation, &c., I have found what is proper to all 
men, and have educated Emile according to that; not as a savage for 
the woods, but as a man who will have to maintain himself independent 
in the whirlpool of society. 
(h) Religious Instruction. 
We are brought up in close connection with the natural world; and 
for the abstract, the purely intellectual, we have scarcely any com- 
prehension. God withdraws our senses from themselves; the word 
mind has a meaning only for the philosophers. Monotheism has come, 
by a process of generalization, from material polytheism. 
In his fifteenth year, Emile does not yet know that he has a soul; and 
perhaps he will find it out too early in his eighteenth. 
A child, it is said, must be brought up in the religion of his father; 
and he must be taught that this alone is true; and that others are ab- 
surd. But if the power of this instruction extends only so far as the 
country in which it is given, and depends only upon authority, for 
which Emile has been taught to have no regard, what then? In what 
religion shall we educate him? To this there is only the simple answer, 
in none; we will only put him in a condition to choose for himself, that 
to which the best use of his own reason may bring him. 
(i) The Approaching Revolutions in Society. 
Your education of men should be adapted to what they are in them- 
selves; not to any thing external. By training him exclusively for one 
condition, you make him unfit for any other, and unfortunate, if his 
situation should ever change. How ridiculous is a great lord who has 
become a beggar, and who holds in his misery to the prejudices of his 
birth; how contemptible the rich man become poor, who feels himself 
completely degraded! 
You acquiesce in the social order of the present, without considering 
that this order is subject to unavoidable changes; and that it is impos- 
sible for you to foresee or to prevent the revolution which may come 
upon your children. The great will become small, the rich poor, the 
monarch a subject. We are approaching a crisis; the century of revo- 
lutions. It is impossible that the great monarchies of Europe can last 
long. And who can say what shall then happen to you? What men 
have made, men can destroy; only the character given by nature is in-
-P-A-G-E-462
  436 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
destructible; and nature makes neither princes, nor rich men, nor great 
lords. What will the satrap do in his debasement, who has been edu- 
cated only for his high position? What will the farmer-general do, in 
his poverty, who lives only upon his money? Happy will he be, then, 
who shall understand how to leave the condition which has left him, 
and to remain a man in spite of fate. 
265. The Instruction in Basedow’s ‘‘ Philanthropinum ” 
(Karl von Raumer, Geschichte der Pdédagogik; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal 
of Education, vol. v, pp. 519-20) 
In 1774 there was opened, in the town of Dessau, in the duchy 
of Anhalt, in northern Germany, and through the patronage of 
the prince of the village, a new type 
of school which was christened the 
“Philanthropinum.”’ The school was 
provided and endowed by the prince 
to enable a German by the name of 
Johann Bernard Basedow to put into 
actual practice certain ideas he had for 
some time been advocating as to a new 
method in education; the ideas being 
based largely on the work of Rousseau. 
‘ The school opened with Basedow and

group instruction, and the following outline of work.     For the First Class of Younger Scholars 
8-9 Reading German, with Jahn; the books being Von Rochow’s 
and Weissen’s Children’s Friend, Campe’s Manual of Morals for

266. Basedow’s Elementarwerk 
The same year that Basedow was enabled to open his Philan- 
thropinum at Dessau, he published two books upon which he had 
been at work for years, and the publication of which had been 
heralded throughout northern Europe. One was a Method-Book 
for Fathers and Mothers, and the second his famous Elementarwerk 
mit Kupfern, or illustrated Elementary Book for children. The 
latter was the first illustrated textbook prepared for the use of 
children since the publication (1654) of the Orbis Pictus (R. 221) 
-of Comenius. It contained a hundred pictures, and was issued 
 
-P-A-G-E-465
           
          NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 439 
in four volumes. Written in German, it was translated into 
Latin, and later into Russian, in which form it enjoyed an ex- 
tended popularity. 
It was intended to be a veritable encyclopedia for young people 
of all that was most worth knowing about natural objects, mor-

incomparable method, founded on experience, of teaching children 
to read without weariness or loss of time.” It became the Orbis

(The Method; a Report by Pestalozzi. Aix-la-Chapelle, 1828)            
        
    One does not get a very good idea of Pestalozzi’s work from his 
own writings. His impractical character showed in his attempts 
at writing as in his management of schools. Instead, it is from 
the writings of contemporaries that one gets the best picture of
-P-A-G-E-466
    440 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
his work and his ideas. His How Gertrude Teaches her Children 
is perhaps the best exponent of his work. 
In 1800 Pestalozzi made a Report in writing to a Society of 
Friends of Education, which had been formed to support his 
efforts at the time of his return from Stanz to Burgdorf. In this 
he gave a systematic statement of his conceptions as to method 
in education. The Report remained unprinted until 1828, when 
it was edited and published. The opening pages state the gen- 
eral outline of his method, and are reproduced below; the remain- 
der of the Report goes into detail as to the application. 
  I am trying to psychologize the instruction of mankind; I am trying 
to bring it into harmony with the nature of my mind, with that of my 
circumstances and my relations to others. I start from no positive 
form of teaching, as such, but simply ask myself: — 
“What would you do, if you wished to give a single child all the 
knowledge and practical skill he needs, so that by wise care of his best 
opportunities he might reach inner content?” 
I think to gain this end the human race needs exactly the same thing 
as the single child. 
I think, further, the poor man’s child needs a greater refinement 
in the methods of instruction than the rich man’s child. 
Nature, indeed, does much for the human race, but we have strayed 
away from her path. The poor man is thrust away from her bosom, 
and the rich destroy themselves both by rioting and by lounging on her 
overflowing breast. 
The picture is severe. But ever since I have been able to see I have 
seen it so; and it is from this view that the impulse arises within me, 
not merely to plaster over the evils in schools which are enervating the 
people of Europe, but to cure them at their root. 
But this can never be done without subordinating all forms of in- 
struction to those eternal laws by which the human mind is raised from 
physical impressions on the senses to clear ideas. 
I have tried to simplify the elements of all human knowledge ac- 
cording to these laws, and to put them into a series of typical examples 
that shall result in spreading a wide knowledge of Nature, general clear- 
ness of the most important ideas in the mind, and vigorous exercises of 
the chief bodily powers, even among the lowest classes. 
I know what I am undertaking; but neither the difficulties in the 
way, nor my own limitations in skill and insight, shall hinder me from 
giving my mite for a purpose which Europe needs so much. And, 
gentlemen, in laying before you the results of those labors on which my 
life has been spent, I beg of you but one thing. It is this: — Separate 
those of my assertions that may be doubtful from those that are indis-    
   
                                  
-P-A-G-E-467
       
   
      
    
               
    
     NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 441 
putable. I wish to found my conclusions entirely upon complete con- 
victions, or at least upon perfectly recognized premises. 
The most essential point from which I start is this: — 
Sense-impression of Nature is the only true foundation of human 
instruction, because it is the only true foundation of human knowledge. 
All that follows is the result of this sense-impression, and the process 
of abstraction from it. Hence in every case where this is imperfect, 
the result also will be neither certain, safe, nor positive; and in any case, 
where the sense-impression is inaccurate, deception and error follow. 
I start from this point and ask: — ‘What does Nature itself do in 
order to present the world truly to me, so far as it affects me? That is, 
— By what means does she bring the sense-impressions of the most 
important things around me to a perfection that contents me?” And I 
find, — She does this through my surroundings, my wants and my re- 
lations to others. 
Through my surroundings she determines the kinds of sense-impres- 
sions I receive. Through my wants she stimulates my activities. 
Through my relations to others she widens my observation and raises 
it to insight and forethought. Through my surroundings, my wants, 
my relations to others, she lays the foundations of my knowledge, my 
work, and my right-doing. 
And now I ask myself:— “ What general method of the Art of Teach- 
ing has the experience of ages put into the hands of humanity to 
strengthen this influence of Nature in developing intelligence, energy, 
and virtue in our race?” And I find these methods are speech, the 
arts of drawing, writing, reckoning, and measuring. 
And when I trace back all these elements of the human Art to their 
origin, I find it in the common basis of our mind, by means of which 
our understanding combines those impressions which the senses have 
received from Nature, and represents them as wholes, that is, as con- 
cepts. 
          
        
      
    
     And when I ask again: — What are the unmistakable consequences 
of thus rudely despising these laws, I cannot conceal from myself the 
physical atrophy, one-sidedness, warped judgment, superficiality, and 
presumptuous vanity that characterize the masses in this generation, 
are the necessary consequences of despising these laws, and of the iso- 
lated, unpsychological, baseless, unorganized, unconnected teaching, 
which our poor race has received in our lower schools. 
Then the problem I have to solve is this: — How to bring the ele- 
ments of every art into harmony with the very nature of my mind, by 
following the psychological mechanicalaws by which my mind rises 
from physical sense-impressions to clear ideas. 
Nature has two principal and general means of directing human ac- 
tivity towards the cultivation of the arts, and these should be employed, 
                                    
       
-P-A-G-E-468
      442 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
if not before, at least side by side with any particular means. They are 
singing, and the sense of the beautiful. 
With song the mother lulls her babe to sleep; but here, as in every 
thing else, we do not follow the law of Nature. Before the child is a 
year old, the mother’s song ceases; by that time she is, as a rule, no 
longer a mother to the weaned child. For him, as for all others, she is 
only a distracted, over-burdened woman. Alas! that it isso. Why has 
not the art of ages taught us to join the nursery lullabies to a series of 
national songs, that should rise in the cottages of the people from the 
gentle cradle song to the sublime hymn of praise? But I cannot fill 
this gap. I can only point it out. 
It is the same with the sense of the beautiful. All Nature is full of 
grand and lively sights, but Europe has done nothing to awaken in the 
poor a sense for these beauties, or to arrange them in such a way as to 
produce a series of impressions, capable of developing this sense. The 
sun rises for us in vain; in vain for us he sets. In vain for us do wood 
and meadow, mountain and valley spread forth their innumerable 
charms. They are nothing to us. 
Here, again, I can do nothing; but if ever popular education should 
cease to be the barbarous absurdity it now is, and put itself into har- 
mony with the real needs of our nature, this want will be supplied. 
I leave these means of directing the Art generally, and turn to the 
forms by which special means of education, speaking, reading, drawing, 
and writing should be taught. 
268. A Visit to Pestalozzi at Yverdon 
(Griscom, John, A Year in Europe, vol. 1, pp. 415-20. New York, 1823; 2 vols.)    
In 1818-19 Professor John Griscom (1774-1852), manager of a 
private school in New York City, and who later became a profes- 
sor in Queen’s (now Rutgers) College in New Jersey, visited 
Europe and made a study of the schools, colleges, and charitable 
institutions of Great Britain, France, Sweden, Italy, and Hol- 
land, and on his return published his observations in A Year in 
Europe (1819). This book had an important influence in the 
United States on the development of reformatory schools and in- 
stitutions for the training of defectives. The following extract 
from the report of his visit to Pestalozzi’s school at Yverdon gives 
an insight into the work and personal side of the school. 
Breakfast finished, our first and chief concern here was to visit the 
celebrated Institute of Pestalozzi. This establishment occupies a large 
castle the use of which was granted to Pestalozzi by the Canton of 
Berne, when the town of Yverdon was included in that Canton, and the 
government of the Pays de Vaud, to which it now belongs, continues

the grant. On entering the castle, we were invited into a private room. 
I gave my letters to the person in attendance, who took them immedi- 
ately to the chief. The good old man soon came in, seized me warmly 
by the hand, and seeing my hat on my head, he pointed to it in a sort of 
ecstacy, with his eyes almost filled with tears. I hardly knew how to 
interpret this emotion, and asked him if he wished me to take it off. 
He answered very earnestly, “‘No, no, no; keep it on; you are right.” 
He seemed very glad to see us, and as he speaks French very imper- 
fectly, and with an indistinct accent, he said he would call Monsieur 
Greaves to talk with us. This gentleman soon came and entered im- 
mediately into a detail of the institution, its principles, its spirit, its 
arrangement, etc. He is an Englishman, and as I found upon inquiry, 
brother to the lady I had seen at Lausanne. He has been some weeks 
with Pestalozzi, for the purpose of understanding his system thoroughly, 
in order to aid a sister in England in the education of her children. He 
enters warmly into its concern, and will be useful in making it better 
known. He explained to us very clearly the leading ideas and views of 
human nature which induced Pestalozzi to become an instructor of 
youth. ... 
His school consists at present of about 90 boys, — German, Prussian, 
French, Swiss, Italian, Spanish, and English. It is divided into four 
principal classes, according to the attainments of the pupils. These 
classes are subdivided into others. There are seven schoolrooms in 
the castle, and twelve teachers or professors. . . . 
We spent most of the day in the different schoolrooms witnessing the 
exercises of the scholars. Very few books are used, as it is expected the 
children can read well before they come there. But to describe the 
modes of teaching, so as to render them clearly intelligible, would re- 
quire much more time and space than I can possibly allot to it, were I 
ever so competent to make it known. We saw the exercises of arith- 
metic, writing, drawing, mathematics, lessons in music and gymnas- 
tics, something of geography, French, Latin, and German. To teach a 
school, in the way practiced here, without book, and almost entirely by 
verbal instruction, is extremely laborious. ‘The teacher must be con- 
stantly with the child, always talking, questioning, explaining, and re- 
peating. The pupils, however, by this process, are brought into very 
close intimacy with the instructor. Their capacities, all their faculties 
and propensities, become laid open to his observation. This gives him 
an advantage which. can not possibly be gained in the ordinary way in 
which schools are generally taught. The children look well, appear 
very contented, and apparently live in great harmony one with another; 
which, considering the diversity of national character and temper here

which sways the breast of the principal of the institution, and extends 
its benign influence throughout all the departments.

    444 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The success of this mode of instruction greatly depends upon the 
personal qualifications of those who undertake to conduct it. There is 
nothing of mechanism in it, as in the Lancastrian plan; no laying down 
of precise rules for managing classes, etc. It is all mind and feeling. Its 
arrangements must always depend on the ages, talents, and tempers of 
the scholars, and require on the part of the teachers the most diligent 
and faithful attention. Above all, it requires that the teacher should 
consider himself as the father and bosom friend of his pupils, and to be 
animated with the most affectionate desires for their good. Pestalozzi 
himself is allthis. His heart glows with such a spirit that the good old 
man can hardly refrain from bestowing kisses on all with whom he is 
concerned. He holds out his hands to his pupils on every occasion, and 
they love him as a child loves its mother. His plan of teaching is just 
fit for the domestic fireside, with a father or mother in the center, and a 
circle of happy children around them. He is aware of this, and wishes 
to extend the knowledge of his plan to every parent. Pestalozzi is 72 
years of age. It is quite unfortunate for the progress of his system on 
the continent, that he pays so little attention to exteriors, regarding 
dress, furniture, etc., as of no moment whatever, provided the mind 
and heart be right. 
  269. An Estimate of Pestalozzi’s Work 
(Woodbridge, Wm. C., American Annals of Education and Instruction, vol. vu, 
p- 14. January, 1837) 
William C. Woodbridge was a New England educator who 
spent the year 1820 and the years 1825-29 in Europe. In a 
series of letters he first really brought the work of Pestalozzi and 
Fellenberg to the attention of American teachers. In closing an 
article comparing the work of Basedow and Pestalozzi (271) he 
offers the following estimate of Pestalozzi’s work and influence. 
         
   
...as one of his admirers observed, it was his province to educate 
ideas and not children. He combated, with unshrinking boldness and 
untiring perseverance, through a long life, the prejudices and abuses of 
the age in reference to education, both by his example and by his nu- 
merous publications. He attacked with great vigor, and with no small 
degree of success, that favorite maxim of bigotry and tyranny that, 
obedience and devotion are the legitimate offspring of ignorance. He 
denounced that degrading system, which considers it enough to enable 
man to procure a subsistence for himself and his offspring — and i 
this manner, merely to place him on a level with the beast of the forest 
and which deems every thing lost whose value can not be estimated i 
money. He urged upon the consciences of parents-and rulers, with a: 
energy approaching that of the ancient prophets, the solemn dutie:      
   
        
        
-P-A-G-E-471
NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 445 
which Divine Providence had imposed upon them, in committing to 
their charge the present and future destinies of their fellow-beings. In 
this way, he produced an impulse, which pervaded the continent of 
Europe, and which, by means of his popular and theoretical works, 
reached the cottages of the poor and the palaces of the great. His in- 
stitution at Yverdon was crowded with men of every nation; not merely 
those who were led by the same impulse which inspired him, but by the 
agents of kings and noblemen, and public institutions, who came to 
make themselves acquainted with his principles, in order to become his 
fellow-laborers in other countries. 
270. Doctor Mayo on Pestalozzi 
(From a pamphlet issued by the Reverend Charles Mayo. London, 1826) 
The Reverend Charles Mayo (1792-1846), who, with his sister 
Elizabeth (1793-1865), did more than any one else to introduce 
Pestalozzian ideas and methods into England, spent the years 
1819-22 at Yverdon as a worker with Pestalozzi. In 1826 he 
delivered several lectures on the principles of the Pestalozzian 
system of education, and later published a summary of these in a 
pamphlet for more general distribution. The following on Pesta- 
lozzi’s school is an extract from this pamphlet. 
Some years ago an Irish gentleman, traveling through Yverdon, in 
the Pays de Vaud, was prevailed on to spend a couple of hours in the 
Institution of Pestalozzi. The first class he inspected was carried on 
in a language not familiar to him, yet was he much struck with the 
intelligence and vivacity portrayed in the features of the pupils. But 
when, the following hour, he witnessed the power of the method in its 
application to arithmetic, he discovered in the scholars a clear concep- 
tion of number and its relations, a precision and rapidity in mental 
calculation, and an animation and interest in their employment, which 
convinced him that a secret had been discovered by Pestalozzi, and he 
was resolved, if possible, to penetrate it. The proposed visit of two 
hours terminated at the expiration of three years; nor was his admira- 
tion of the method confined to a bare speculative reception of the prin- 
ciples; he transplanted into his own country the practical truths he had 
learned in Switzerland, and though Providence has interrupted the 
course of his more extended labors, he still, in the bosom of his own 
family, applies the lessons of Pestalozzi, and teaches his children to 
revere his name. It was not a theoretical examination of the method 
that effected this conviction and animated to these exertions; it was a 
ersonal view of the practical influence of the system, in scenes lit up 
y the genius and warmed with the benevolence of Pestalozzi himself. 
‘ould I transport you in thought to the scenes where Pestalozzi lived,

   and taught, and suffered with his scholars, the heart would feel even 
before the understanding discerned the beauty, the truth of his prin- 
ciples. A skeleton view of his system might lead you to a cold approba- 
tion of his views, but it must be the living, the breathing portraiture of 
the man, that must awaken your love, and dispose you to imitate what 
you have learned to admire. I have seen him surrounded by his pupils, 
have marked the overflowings of his tenderness; I have read in a thou- 
sand traits of good-nature the confirmation of his history. I have wit- 
nessed the affecting simplicity, the abandon with which he speaks of all 
he has done and essayed to do for humanity. Could I convey to others 
the sentiments I feel for him, Pestalozzi would be loved and honored 
as he deserves. Three years of intimate connection with him, every 
day marked with some proof of his affection, may well have knit my 
heart to his; and among the most cherished recollections of the past is, 
that Pestalozzi honored me with his friendship, and thanked me for 
cheering his decline. 
271. Work of Pestalozzi and Basedow compared 
(Woodbridge, Wm. C., American Annals of Education and Instruction, vol. vu, 
pp. 8-11. January, 1837) 
In the article previously referred to (269) Woodbridge gives a 
comparative estimate of the work and principles of Basedow and 
Pestalozzi, as follows: 
As the result of his investigations, Pestalozzi assumed, as a fundamen- 
tal principle, that education, in order to fit man for his destination, 
must proceed according to the laws of nature. To adopt the language 
of his followers — that it must not act as an arbitrary mediator be- 
tween the child and nature, between man and God, pursuing its own 
artificial arrangements, instead of the indications of Providence — that 
it should assist the course of natural development, instead of doing it 
violence — that it should watch and follow its progress, instead of at- 
tempting to mark out a path agreeably to a preconceived system. 
I. In view of this principle, he did not choose, like Basedow, to cul- 
tivate the mind in a material way, merely by inculcating and engrafting 
every thing relating to external objects, and giving mechanical skill. 
He sought, on the contrary, to develop, and exercise, and strengthen 
the faculties of the child by a steady course of excitement to self- 
activity, with a limited degree of assistance to his efforts. 
II. In opposition to the haste, and blind groping of many teachers 
without system, he endeavored to find the proper point for commenc- 
ing, and to proceed in a slow and gradual, but uninterrupted course, 
from one point to another — always waiting until the first should have 
a-certain degree of distinctness in the mind of the child, before entering 
upon the exhibition of the second. To pursue any other course would
-P-A-G-E-473
  NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 447 
only give superficial knowledge, which would neither afford pleasure to 
the child, nor promote its real progress. 
II. He opposed the undue cultivation of the memory and under- 
standing, as hostile to true education. He placed the essence of educa- 
tion in the harmonious and uniform development of every faculty, so 
that the body should not be in advance of the mind, and that in the 
development of the mind, neither the physical powers, nor the affec- 
tions, should be neglected; and that skill in action should be acquired 
at the same time with knowledge. When this point is secured, we may 
know that education has really begun, and that it is not merely super- 
ficial. 
IV. He required close attention and constant reference to the peculi- 
arities of every child, and of each sex, as well as to the characteristics 
of the people among whom he lived, in order that he might acquire the 
development and qualifications necessary for the situation to which 
the Creator destined him, when he gave him these active faculties, and 
be prepared to labor successfully for those among whom he was placed 
at his birth. 
V. While Basedow introduced a multitude of subjects of instruction 
(R. 265) into the schools, without special regard to the development 
of the intellectual powers, Pestalozzi considered this plan as superficial. 
He limited the elementary subjects of instruction to Form, Number 
and Language, as the essential condition of definite and distinct knowl- 
edge; and believed that these elements should be taught with the ut- 
most possible simplicity, comprehensiveness, and mutual connection. 
VI. Pestalozzi, as well as Basedow, desired that instruction should 
commence with the intuition or simple perception of external objects 
and their relations. He was not, however, satisfied with this alone, 
but wished that the art of observing should also be acquired. He 
thought the things perceived of less consequence than the cultivation 
of the perceptive powers, which should enable the child to observe com- 
pletely, — to exhaust the subjects which should be brought before his 
mind. 
VII. While the Philanthropinists attached great importance to 
special exercises of reflection, Pestalozzi would not make this a subject 
of separate study. He maintained that every subject of instruction 
should be properly treated, and thus become an exercise of thought; 
and believed that lessons in Number, and Proportion and Size, would 
give the best occasion for it. 
VIII. Pestalozzi, as well as Basedow, attached great importance te 
Arithmetic, particularly to Mental Arithmetic. He valued it, how- 
ever, in the limited view of its practical usefulness, but as an excellent 
means of strengthening the mind. He also introduced Geometry into 
the elementary schools, and the art connected with it, of modeling 
and drawing beautiful objects. He wished, in this way, to train the 
 
-P-A-G-E-474
  448 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
eye, the hand, and the touch, for that more advanced species of draw- 
ing which had not been thought of before. Proceeding from the simple 
and intuitive, to the more complicated and difficult forms, he arranged 
a series of exercises, so gradual and complete, that the method of teach- 
ing this subject was soon brought to a good degree of perfection. 
IX. The Philanthropinists introduced the instruction of language 
into the common schools, but limited it chiefly to the writing of letters 
and preparation of essays. But Pestalozzi was not satisfied with a 
lifeless repetition of the rules of grammar, nor yet with mere exercises 
for common life. He aimed at a development of the laws of language 
from within — an introduction into its internal nature and construc- 
tion and peculiar spirit — which would not only cultivate the intellect, 
but also improve the affections. . . . 
X. Like Basedow, Rochow, and others, Pestalozzi introduced vocal 
music into the circle of school studies, on account of its powerful influ- 
ence on the heart. But he was not satisfied that the children should 
learn to sing a few melodies by note or by ear. He wished them to 
know the rules of melody and rhythm, and dynamics — to pursue a 
regular course of instruction, descending to its very elements, and ren- 
dering the musical notes as familiar as the sounds of the letters. The 
extensive work of Nageli and Pfeiffer has contributed very much to 
give this branch of instruction a better form. 
XI. He opposed the abuse which was made of the Socratic method 
in many of the Philanthropinic and other schools, by attempting to 
draw something out of children before they had received any knowl- 
edge. He recommends, on the contrary, in the early periods of instruc- 
tion, the established method of dictation by the teacher and repetition 
by the scholar, with a proper regard to rhythm, and at a later period, 
especially in the mathematical and other subjects which involve rea- 
soning, the modern method, in which the teacher merely gives out the 
problems in a proper order, and leaves them to be solved by the pupils, 
by the exertion of their own powers. 
XII. Pestalozzi opposes strenuously the opinion that religious in- 
struction should be addressed exclusively to the understanding; and 
shows that religion lies deep in the hearts of men, and that it should 
not be enstamped from without, but developed from within; that the 
basis of religious feeling is to be found in the childish disposition to 
love, to thankfulness, to veneration, obedience and confidence toward 
its parents; that these should be cultivated and strengthened and di- 
rected toward God; and that religion should be formally treated of at a 
later period in connection with the feelings thus excited. As he re- 
quires the mother to direct the first development of all the faculties of 
her child, he assigns to her especially the task of first cultivating the 
religious feelings. 
XIII. Pestalozzi agreed with Basedow, that mutual affection ough’

     NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 449 
to reign between the educator and the pupil, both in the house and in 
the school, in order to render education effectual and useful. He was, 
therefore, as little disposed as Basedow, to sustain school despotism; 
but he did not rely on artificial excitements, such as those addressed 
to emulation. He preferred the children should find their best re- 
ward in the consciousness of increased intellectual vigor; and expected 
the teacher to render the instruction so attractive, that the delightful 
feeling of progress should be the strongest excitement to industry and 
to morality. 
XIV. Pestalozzi attached as much importance to the cultivation of 
the bodily powers, and the exercise of the senses, as the Philanthro- 
pinists, and in his publications, pointed out a graduated course for this 
purpose. But as Gutsmuths, Vieth, Jahn, and Clias treated this 
subject very fully, nothing further concerning it was written by his 
immediate followers. 
Such are the great principles which entitle Pestalozzi to the high 
praise of having given a more natural, a more comprehensive and 
deeper foundation for education and instruction, and of having called 
into being a method which is far superior to any that preceded it. 
272. Hofwyl as seen by an American 
(Griscom, John, A Year in Europe, vol. 1, pp. 382-08. New York, 1823; 2 vols.) 
The chief influence of Griscom’s book, previously referred to 
in the introduction to R. 268, was along the lines of reformatory 
and charitable education and the development of manual-labor 
schools, in both of which we were then just making a beginning. 
His description of his visits to Pestalozzi also awakened some 
interest. The following is selected from a rather long description 
of his visit to Fellenberg’s Institutions, at Hofwyl. 
Fellenberg, and his Principles of Education 
I was introduced to Mr. Fellenberg by three letters— two from 
Paris and one from Geneva, and was cordially received, having re- 
corded my name and residence in a book in the office, and sent in my 
card and letters. He is a man of middle age, of a mild and agreeable 
ountenance, and of polite and genteel manners. He seated me on a 
ofa, and entered upon an explanation of the principles of his establish- 
ent, and the particular views of education, which had induced him 
o engage in it. He considers society as divisible into three distinct 
arts; the higher (comprehending the noble and wealthy), the mid- 
ling, and the poor. The greatest defects of education he supposes to 
xist in the two extreme classes, and that these distinctions or classes 
ong men would always prevail in every civilized country he be-  
-P-A-G-E-476
  450 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
   
    
                    
    
                 lieved to be incontrovertible; and, of course, any attempt to break 
down the distinction would be fruitless. It is, therefore, of consequence 
that they should be each educated in a manner conformable to their 
situations, but in such a way as to develop, to the highest extent, the 
best faculties of their nature; and, while it preserves the proper relation 
between them, it should, at the same time, encourage the feelings of 
kindliness and sympathy on the one part, and of respect and love on the 
other. This, he thought, could be effected upon no plan so effectually 
as bringing them up side by side, so that they should have each other 
constantly in view, without any necessity whatever of mixing or asso- 
ciating. The rich, by observing the industry, the skill, and the im- 
portance of the laboring classes, would learn to entertain just senti- 
ments respecting them, and the poor, by feeling and experiencing the 
kindly influence of the rich, would regard them as benefactors. 
With respect to the best means of cultivating the faculties which, in 
their due operation, are to promote the permanent happiness of men, 
he considers agriculture as affording opportunities and advantages of 
the greatest importance, and next to this, the mechanic arts. Agree- 
ably to these leading views, his establishment consists of two distinct 
parts: a boarding-school of the sons of noblemen and gentlemen, in 
which no pains are spared to provide them with teachers in every useful 
science; and of a school of boys, taken from the poorest class, who are 
clothed and fed in a very plain, coarse, and farmer-like style, and who 
work diligently in the fields at employments adapted to their strength 
and skill. During two hours in the day in summer, and more in winter, 
these boys are instructed in letters, and in music. They are likewise 
introduced into the workshops, and taught the business of a black- 
smith, a carpenter, a whee 
maker, or a worker in brass

himself their friend and companion, as well as their instructor. He i

     take a lesson of one hour between supper and bed. This lesson is fre- 
quently confined to music. . . . The boys of this class appear to be very 
healthy and contented. They are taught to pay the utmost attention 
to cleanliness. Their clothing in summer is of coarse cotton, and, in 
winter, of woolen cloth. They go barefooted, except when they work 
in the fields, or when the state of the weather requires them to wear 
shoes and stockings; but their heads always remain uncovered. . . . In 
summer they rise at five, and in winter at six; and after having dressed 
themselves and said their prayers, they receive instruction for an hour. 
They then breakfast, after which they go to work until half-past eleven. 
They then have half an hour for dinner; after which Vehrly gives them 
a lesson of one hour. They work out till six, and after eating their sup- 
per, receive further instruction, which concludes with prayer, and they 
are generally in bed between eight and nine o’clock. But this distribu- 
tion of time varies according to the seasons. In winter five or six hours 
a day are devoted to sedentary instruction. The morning of the first 
day of the week is always devoted to exercises of piety, and after dinner 
some hours are given to instruction in sacred history. But their lessons 
are by no means confined to the school-room. Vehrly takes pleasure in 
questioning them on subjects of natural history, geography, religion, 
morals, or any other useful topic, while they are at work in the fields or 
shops; and it may readily be conceived, that, with this devotion to the 
improvement of his pupils, occasions will perpetually present them- 
selves of conveying instruction in every kind of knowledge calculated 
to expand the minds of children and to cultivate their best affections. 
Pestalozgian Methods 
With regard to the most effective means of eliciting the powers of 
the mind, and of conducting the literary exercises of young people, 
great credit is due to Pestalozzi, whose veteran labors, as one of the 
most enlightened teachers of the age, were well known and acknowl- 
edged long before the commencement of the Hofwy] Institution. His 
plans of communicating knowledge are in a great measure practiced by 
Vehrly. Much pains are taken to impress on the minds of the pupils a 
deep sense of the importance of time, and of habits of industry; and 
from the reports that have been published by commissioners appointed 
to examine the establishment, it is evident that the most favorable re- 
sults have attended these endeavors. . . . In a few years, or even in less 
time, they learn to read, write, and calculate with and without the use 
of pencil or pen; the elements of drawing become familiar to them; and 
they acquire good notions of geometry, especially in its relation to field 
surveying, and its application to descriptive drawing. Botany and 
ineralogy constitute part of their amusements. They become well 
cquainted with all the plants of Hofwyl, and their different qualities, 
oth the sanitary and noxious. Of the minerals also, they acquire

            the names and principal uses, and they make collections of all that is 
valuable and curious in minerals and vegetables. But the most admir- 
able trait in the character of this school is the tone of religious feeling 
which; it is said, pervades it. This could not be accomplished were not 
Fellenberg and Vehrly both strongly imbued with a sense of religious 
obligation and unremittingly attentive to awaken those sentiments in 
the minds of the pupils. . . . 
It will readily be conceived that a plan of instruction so admirable, 
and constantly directed to the best and purest affections of the mind 
and heart, can scarcely fail to redeem from indolence and vice those 
whose habits have been the most degraded. And it has accordingly 
happened that, notwithstanding the boys under Vehrly’s charge have 
been taken from the very lowest ranks, and some of them the children 
of beggars, but one instance has occurred of such inveterate vice as to 
render it eventually necessary to abandon the culprit to his corrupt 
propensities, and expel him from the school. 
In the religious exercises, which take place on the first day of the 
week, the boys of the poor school assemble with the superior class, but 
on no other occasion. 
The Schools for the Well-to-do 
The Hofwyl establishment, as I have before remarked, consists of 
two classes, the rich and the poor. The class of the rich contains at 
present about eighty. Twenty of these, consisting of children under 
ten years of age, are placed under the care of a respectable gentle- 
man and his wife, in a house belonging to Fellenberg, situated about a 
mile from his own residence. A teacher or two have the charge of their 
‘instruction both in and out of the house... . 
The other sixty, constituting the most prominent part of the Hofwyl 
institution, are provided with more than twenty teachers, or profes- 
sors. Among the pupils are several princes and the sons of ministers of 
state, &c. The price of board and tuition varies from £100 to £300 
sterling, perannum. We were not admitted to the interior of the build- 
ing occupied by these students. We saw none of the performances of 
their schools, or their exercises. .. . 
Besides the three schools already mentioned, he has another abou’ 
half a mile from Hofwyl, where young men attend, during the winter, 
to courses of instruction in those subjects which relate to agriculture 
and he lectures himself, I believe, on the practical operations of farm: 
ing. It is here, too, that the professor of chemistry has his laborator 
and lecture-room. We were introduced to him (Dr. Strobe), an 
judged him to be a good chemist. He is also the physician of the e 
tablishment, and his laboratory indicates an attachment to his profe 
sion, and judgment in its practical details. . .
-P-A-G-E-479
  NEW THEORY AND SUBJECT-MATTER 453 
The Superior School 
The superior class consisted of nearly roo pupils, taught by upward 
of thirty professors. The course of instruction embraces the Greek, 
Latin, German, and French languages and literature; history, civil and 
sacred; geography, mathematics, pure and mixed; natural and mental 
philosophy; chemistry; music; drawing; gymnastics, including riding, 
swimming, dancing, &c.; natural history in all its branches; and reli- 
gious instruction. 
The pupils rise at six in winter and five in summer; they breakfast 
at seven, eat a little at ten, dine at noon, take a luncheon at five, an 
sup at eight. Five hours are appropriated to study in the forenoon and 
four in the afternoon; the rest of the day being devoted to their gym- 
nastic, agricultural, and mechanical exercises. This arrangement, 
however, is not absolutely restrictive, but is made to conform to the 
varying circumstances of the establishment, the health and genius 
of the pupils, etc. The greatest pains are taken to cultivate their moral 
and religious sensibilities. ‘The language chiefly spoken is the German. 
The internal or civil government (if it may be so called) of the school is 
regulated by a constitution and by-laws administered by the pupils 
themselves, and for which object they have their legislative and execu- 
tive officers, under the supervision of the principal. The motives o 
emulation, as they are ordinarily excited by rewards, medals, honors, 
etc., or by a division into classes in the numerical order of first, second, 
third, etc., form no part of the Fellenberg system. His aim is to ad- 
dress his instructions to the more reasonable and noble principles o 
their nature, and by the number of his professors (for he has had as 
many as thirty-five with less than 100 pupils), to unite all the advan- 
tages of private with those of public instruction.   Unpopularity of Hofwyl at Home 
From the information we received from others, as well as from the 
statements of Fellenberg himself, it is evident that his plans have ever 
been regarded with jealousy by a great number of his most influential 
neighbors and fellow-countrymen. He was at first condemned as a 
visionary, but when he had fairly demonstrated the practicability and 
utility of his schemes for the improvement of education, they accused 
him of sinister views, and alleged against him that his motives were 
mercenary, having an eye chiefly to the profits of the establishment. , 
This narrow-minded spirit has not been content with mere expressions 
of disapprobation and condemnation. ‘The government of the can- 
ton has gone so far as to lay positive obstructions in his way, and to 
threaten him with the weight of their aristocratical authority. He had 
a few years ago devised a plan for diffusing some of the benefits of his 
experience in the government of youth, throughout the canton. He 
 
-P-A-G-E-480

invited the teachers of schools to repair to Hofwyl during the period of 
their vacation, and there to avail themselves of such information as the 
institution would afford, and their time would admit of. This offer 
was gladly accepted; but the next season the teachers of the canton 
were most arbitrarily interdicted by the government from resorting to 
Hofwyl. Fellenberg, thus very ungenerously thwarted in his wishes to 
do good, opened his establishment for the benefit of other cantons, and 
has thus had it in his power to extend still more widely the advantages 
of his system. His great desire is to introduce a taste for agricultural 
pursuits connected with an amelioration of the indigent classes. 
General Impression 
T have no hesitation in saying that, from all that I have read and all 
that I have seen of this establishment, it does appear to me to be con- 
ducted upon principles which are calculated to afford the very best 
kind of education which it is possible to confer upon a young man, 
whatever may be the situation he is to fill in active life. As it regards 
the poor, it is difficult to conceive how they could be brought up in a 
way which would better prepare them for filling the stations of indus- 
trious, skillful, and intelligent laborers. With respect to the rich, 
while they are cheerfully pursuing an excellent course of literary and 
scientific instruction, they are effectually preserved, by the principles of 
his institution, from those idle and vicious habits which so commonly 
esult from the vacant time of colleges and universities. By turning 
heir attention to agriculture and the mechanic arts; by inspiring them 
vith a love of labor, or at least of a useful application of their strength 
md muscular activities; by exercising their ingenuity in the use of 
tools and instruments; by familiarizing them to an attentive observance 
of nature in her different kingdoms, and in the revolution of seasons, — 
a foundation is laid for those more expanded feelings and generous 
sympathies which bind the upper to the lower classes of the community, 
and eventually tend to exalt the condition of humanity. 
The greatest recommendation of the Pestalozzian and Fellenberg 
plan of education is the moral charm which is diffused throughout all 
its operations. It cannot but happen ‘(all other things being equal) 
that pupils thus educated will become not only more intelligent men 
and better philosophers, but also more moral and dignified members of 
society. I cannot but cherish the hope that this scheme of education, 
of combining agricultural and mechanical with literary and scientific 
instruction, will be speedily and extensively adopted in the United 
Sbatesn. i! Sedan e,

CHAPTER XXII 
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 
Tue Readings of this chapter deal with the transfer of education 
from the Church to the State in Prussia, which took place in the 
century between the coming of King Frederick William I to the 
throne, in 1713, and the outbreak of the War of Liberation, in 
1813; the early School Codes promulgated; and the type of state 
school systems finally created. 
The first selection (2'73) describes the preparatory work of the 
Prussian King, Frederick William I, between 1713 and 1740. On 
the basis of the work done by this king, his son and successor, 
Frederick the Great (1740-86), laid the firm foundation of state 
control, though still working through the church authorities as 
agents for the State. These foundations he laid through his two 
detailed School Codes — that of 1763 for Prussia (274) and that 
of 1765 for the new Catholic province of Silesia (275). What he 
did waseclosely copied by Maria Theresa in her general Austrian 
School Code of-1774, which follows (276). A comparison of the 
three codes reveals a common plan for them all. 
In 1806 Napoleon routed the Prussian armies, took possession 
of Berlin, took from Prussia all her territory west of the Elbe, and 
completely humiliated the State. In the winter of 1807-08 the 
philosopher Fichte, in a series of Addresses, appealed to the lead- 
ers to regenerate the State, urging that the road to this lay 
through education. Selection 277 gives an illustration of his 
appeals, and shows the importance the leaders soon came to 
| attach to education as a reconstructive agent. His advice was 
followed; the State was regenerated; in the War of Liberation 
(1813-15) Napoleon was vanquished, and the Prussian territories 
were restored. 
That the work of transforming the teaching force into a capable 
and efficient body required hard work may be inferred from Din- 
ter’s description (279) of the conditions he found existing in East 
Prussia, as late as 1819. The work accomplished in a century in 
providing elementary education was well summarized in the abor- 
tive law of 1819, as described by Cousin (280).

In 1843 the American, Horace Mann, visited the schools of 
Prussia and wrote a report of his observations of them. From 
this Report two extracts are taken. The first (278) reveals the 
nature of the selection and training of the Prussian elementary 
teacher, from which we may infer the reason for the regeneration 
of the State. In the second (281) Mr. Mann points out the evils 
of militarism, then clearly evident in the schools, along with their 
many excellent qualities. 
      
   
   
   
   
                     
    
                    
           
273. The Organizing Work of Frederick William I 
(From Henry Barnard’s “Public Instruction in Prussia’; in Barnard’s American 
Journal of Education, vol. xx, pp. 338-42. 1870) 
In 1870 Henry Barnard, while acting as United States Com- 
missioner of Education, prepared a comprehensive Report on 
National Education in Europe. To the article on education in 
each country he prefixed a brief historical account. That for 
Prussia gives a good statement of the work done by the early 
kings in organizing schools, and from it we take the following 
account of the work of Frederick William I, who reigned from 
1713 to 1740. 
The reign of Frederic William I. was a period of collecting, pteparing, 
trying. The thrifty king did not only collect money and soldiers for 
the future great prince of battle, but he also bequeathed to the future 
great prince of peace a population, trained to be obedient to govern- 
ment, to fear God, to be industrious and thrifty. He alone had es- 
tablished eighteen hundred schools. . . . 
Having found during his frequent journeys through Prussia and 
Lithuania that the peasants, particularly in Lithuania, “were in a most 
deplorable state of ignorance” he directed the authorities at Konigsberg 
(July 2, 1718), to assist each other in their efforts, “in order to relieve 
this ignorance at last.” He himself sent for this purpose several 
commissioners to Lithuania, provided the larger villages with school- 
masters, and gave to each of them some land “free of rent and taxes”; 
he renewed his orders from time to time, and desired the increase of 
schools still more emphatically after having induced colonists from 
different countries, particularly from Salzburg, to settle in his domin- 
ions. A long time, however, passed, before he could publish and exe- 
cute his “ principia regulativa,” which were henceforth the fundamental 
laws of the province of Prussia. On their publication (February 21, 
1737) it was announced “that the King had not only seen with great 
pity the infidelity and darkness in which the youths in some portions of 
the kingdom had been living and grown up to their temporal and eter-
-P-A-G-E-483
  
    
       
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA (45 
nal danger, but that he had also issued instructions from time to time, 
how to remedy it. Having been unable to attain this end as yet, he had 
found it necessary to do all in his power to place the youths every 
where under the guidance of able individuals, and to order that the 
latter should be provided with the necessaries of life; and that he had 
been therefore most graciously pleased to give fifty thousand thalers, 
for all time to come, to be employed without diminution for the main- 
tenance of the empire of God.” The interests of this capital were to be 
employed for the proper assistance of those schools which could not 
raise the money necessary for the sustenance of a schoolmaster, or 
which from accidents were temporarily unable to do so, and lastly, for 
the purpose of rendering assistance in the rebuilding ei eer 
destroyed by fire. The administration of this Recreations known By 
the designation mons pietatis, was in the hands of trustees eeten over 
by a minister of State. The interests were distributed by parochial 
and school commissioners. The Principia embraced detailed instruc- 
tions for those who had to contribute to the building of schoolhouses, 
others concerning the schoolmaster’s income, and some remarks di- 
rected to the nobility and clergy, stating that they were expected to 
assist in providing for the sustenance of the schoolmaster; from this it 
may be inferred that those great social interests did not so heartily sup- 
port the royal intentions as would have been becoming in them. ... ——— 
It is certainly not necessary to demonstrate the importance of these 
school regulations, if properly carried out, being issued at a time when 
the government of scarcely any state of Europe had as yet given im- 
pulse to the awakening of an interest in public schools. It is clear, 
however, that a general and effective execution of these instructions 
could not be thought of, seeing the utter ignorance of the country peo- 
ple at that period, which prevented them from appreciating public 
instruction. Innumerable_ pobstaeles were t to -be ren removed; mugney was 
    adsaon alone their aadon to be made from among the trades- 
men, who, at that time, possessed very rarely the proper qualifications. 
Public education could, therefore, only gradually assert its claims by 
conquering the prejudices and the ignorance of the people, and an un- 
ceasing and energetic attention on the part of the government was re- 
quired to avoid suspension and to render progress possible. 
Frederic William I, having taken possession of an important portion 
of Pomerania, showed equal solicitude for this country; he provided by 
speciai orders for the salary of the schoolmasters; desired that a more 
regular attendance at school should be enforced; sent several teachers 
from the Berlin Real-School, and gave even some directions concerning 
the subject of instruction. “The clergyman shall regulate the method 
of instruction by the advice of the prepositus.” “The schoolmaster  
-P-A-G-E-484
ee te ee ne ete ne rn tere 458 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
   
     
    shall diligently rehearse the minister’s catechism at school, and the 
minister may cause him to catechise the children in his presence, if he 
considers him able to do so.” The instruction for visitations of town- 
schools in Pomerania directed the visitors to make such inquiries as 
would show an active interest in the improvement of the schools. 
Among others: “Whether unnecessary private primary schools were 
suffered to exist to the detriment of public schools?” “What sug- 
gestions for the improvement of the system of instruction might be 
offered?” “Whether the vacations were unnecessary and too long?” 
The “ prepositus” was required to make all necessary arrangements for 
the improvement of the system of instruction. 
The King issued at the request of the city authorities of Berlin, on 
October 16, 1738, a circular of instructions for the private schools in 
that town and its suburbs, which, having been approved by the highest 
dignitaries of the church, gives the most correct idea of the condition 
of schools in cities in that period. This circular is subdivided into five 
sections: the first treats on the method of instituting schoolmasters; 
the second on the requisite abilities and qualifications of schoolmasters; 
the third on their duties; the fourth on their salaries; the fifth on the 
relation of parents to schools. The ordinances of this able, well-mean- 
ing and often misapprehended prince are always in perfect harmony 
with the immediate wants of the young, with the pecuniary condition 
of the communities, and with the habits and customs of the country; 
they fix the salary of the teachers according to the pretensions which, 
in his life-time, they could have, as a recompense for their probably 
very moderate accomplishments. The price of a teacher must be nec- 
essarily low, when there is no strong popular inclination for learning, as 
was the case in that time. 
Though the King has shown so much earnest and well-meaning 
solicitude, and though the number of schools had been greatly in- 
creased, yet a real development of the system of instruction was not 
yet effected. The strict decrees of government had, however, accus- 
tomed the people to accommodate themselves in the matter of educa- 
tion to the expressed will of their sovereign, and to have a certain 
respect for schools. But the teachers, as a class, did their work me- 
chanically, following, as it were, a beaten track, so easily made; there 
was no genius as yet in the mechanism of school management. 
274. The Prussian School Code of 1763 
(Translation in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. xt, pp. 861-68) 
September 23, 1763, King Frederick the Great issued for Prus- 
' sia, what is known as the General-Land-Schiil-Reglement or Gen- 
eral Regulations for Elementary Schools and Teachers in Prussia. 
This famous document was prepared under the King’s direction,

and was the first general School e for the whole kingdom. It 
marks the real beginning of the Prussian state elementary-school 
system. The following quotations, and digest of sections, give 
the general nature of the Code. 
GENERAL REGULATIONS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS 
: August 12, 1763 
We Frederick, by the grace‘of God, King, etc.: 
Whereas, to our great displeasure, we have perceived that schools 
and the instruction of youth in the country have come to be greatly 
neglected, and that by the inexperience of many sacristans (castos) and 
schoolmasters, the young people grow up in stupidity and ignorance, it 
is our well-considered and serious pleasure, that instruction in the coun- 
try, throughout all our provinces, should be placed on a better footing, 
and be better organized than heretofore. For, as we earnestly strive 
for the true welfare of our country, and of all classes of people; now 
that quiet and general peace have been restored, we find it necessary 
and wholesome to have a good foundation laid in the schools by a 
rational and Christian education of the young for the fear of God, and 
other useful ends. Therefore, by the power of our own highest motive, 
of our care and paternal disposition for the best good of all our sub- 
jects, we command hereby, all governors, consistories and other col- 
legiates of our country; that they shall, on their part, contribute all 
they can, with affection and zeal, to maintain the following GENERAL 
ScHoor REGULATIONS, and in future to arrange all things in accordance 
with the law to the end that ignorance, so injurious and unbecoming to 
Christianity, may be prevented and lessened, and the coming time may 
train and educate in the schools more enlightened and virtuous sub- 
jects. 
1. School attendance age. First, it is our pleasure that all our sub- 
jects, parents, guardians or masters, whose duty it is to educate the 
young, shall send their children to school, and those confided to their 
care, boys and girls, if not sooner, certainly when they reach the age of 
five years; and shall continue regularly to do so, and require them to go 
to school until they are thirteen or fourteen years old, and know not 
only what is necessary of Christianity, fluent reading and writing, but 
can give answer in everything which they learn from the schools book, 
prescribed and approved by our consistory. 
2. Apprentices to be taught. Masters to whom children in Prussia, 
by custom are bound to render work for certain years, are seriously 
advised not to withdraw such children from school until they can read 
well, and have laid a good foundation in Christian knowledge; also 
made a beginning in writing, and can present a certificate from the 
minister and schoolmaster to this effect to the school-visitors. Parents   
   
-P-A-G-E-486
    460 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  and guardians ought much more to consider it their bounden duty that 
their children and wards receive sufficient instruction in the necessary 
branches. 
3. Leaving certificates. If children, by their own aptitude or by the 
care of the teacher are sufficiently advanced in the common studies 
before they attain their thirteenth or fourteenth year, even then the 
parents or guardians are not at liberty to retain them at home, but can 
do so only when the superintendents or inspectors, after a notice from 
the minister and a testimonial of the schoolmaster, that the pupil has 
acquired a sufficient knowledge, have issued a regular dismissal based 
on the above testimonial. Still such children must attend the Repeti- 
tion School, not only on Sundays, at the minister’s, but also on week- 
days at the schoolmaster’s. k 
4. Attendance required. As in many towns, parents do not send 
their children to school in summer, on the plea that they have to guard 
the cattle; our magistrates and judges in the districts containing towns 
and communes, shall see that a special shepherd is engaged, rather than 
allow the children to be kept from school. .. . 
5. School hours. In order to regulate definitely the summer and 
winter schools, we decree that winter schools must be held on all the 
six days of the week, from 8 to 11 o’clock in the forenoon, and from 1 to 
4.0’clock in the afternoon, except Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. 
The winter school must be continued from Michaelmas to the Easter- 
days. But the summer schools shall be open only in the forenoon or, if 
necessary by the location of the place, during three hours every week- 
day, when the ministers can best decide at what hour to commence. 
No vacations are to be given, not even during harvest time; the schools 
shall be kept in the prescribed manner, with this distinction, that in 
summer each lesson is to be of half an hour’s duration, and in winter of 
a full hour. 
6. Sunday instruction. On Sundays, beside the lesson of the Cat- 
echism or repetition school by the minister given in the Church, the 
schoolmaster shall give in the school a recapitulary lesson to the un- 
married people of the township. They shall there practice reading and 
writing. Reading should be from the New Testament or some other 
edifying book, and as an exercise in writing, the young people should 
write some passages, or the Epistle, or Gospel of the day. In towns 
where the schoolmaster is not likewise sexton, and not obliged to travel 
through the parish with the clergyman, he shall be bound to sing with 
the children in Church, either morning or afternoons, to hear them re- 
cite the catechism and address to them easy questions on the order of 
salvation. If the sacristan or schoolmaster has no experience in cat- 
echising, the minister shall write down for him the questions hé mus 
ask, that in this manner, together with their children, the people ma’ 
be edified and improved in scriptural knowledge. 
       
   
                         
    
      
-P-A-G-E-487
    NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 461 
7. Tuition fees. In regard to tuition fee, every child, until it can 
read, shall pay in winter six pennies, after it can read, nine pennies, and 
when it can write and read, one groschen a week. For the months of 
summer, however, they shall pay only two-thirds of this fee, so that 
those who paid six pennies in winter, after his proportion shall pay 
four; those who paid nine pennies shall pay six; and those who paid one 
groschen will pay eight pennies. If, in any place the schoolmaster has 
been paid better, he must continue to receive the customary fees. 
8. Children of the poor. Parents too poor to pay the tuition fee of 
their children, and orphan children who can not pay, must petition 
the magistrate, patron, minister or church-council for an allowance 
from any funds of the church or town at their disposal, that the 
schoolmaster may get his income, and teach the children of the poor 
and rich with equal diligence and fidelity. 
9. [Annual school sermon and collection. Provides for the general 
delivery of an annual sermon, on Saint Michael’s Sunday, on the sub- 
ject of Christian education and edification of youth. After the ser- 
mon, the collection to provide textbooks for the children of the poor.] 
to. Compulsory attendance. Having made good and sufficient pro- 
vision for the instruction of the young, all parents, guardians, and 
others, having children to educate, who act contrary to this ordinance, 
by withholding them from school, shall still be obliged to pay the com- 
mon school-fee for the term; and guardians shall not be permitted to 
charge the money thus paid to the account of their wards. And if, 
after earnest exhortation of the minister, they do not send their chil- 
dren regularly to school, then the magistrate of the town, in the last 
resort, shall direct execution against them. It is made the duty of the 
school-visitors to impose on such parents as have not made their chil- 
dren attend school regularly, a fine of sixteen groschen, to be paid into 
the school-treasury. 
We therefore command all officers and magistrates to ascertain with- 
out delay, after receiving notice from the schoolmaster, of the non- 
attendance of any child, from the parent or guardian of the same the 
cause of such absence, and if it is for other reason than sickness, they 
shall employ proper legal means to secure that child’s attendance. 
i. School census. To this end, and to enable him the better to con- 
trol the matter, the schoolmaster shall receive, from the register of the 
church or the town in which they are engaged, a list of all children of 
school age, that they may know who are due to the school; and the 
teacher shall also keep a monthly register, in which the children are 
enrolled as follows: (1) By their name and surname; (2) their age; (3) 
the names of their parents; (4) their residence; (5) the date when they 
enter school; (6) the lessons they study; (7) the degree of their diligence 
lor negligence; (8) their abilities of mind; (9) their morals and conduct; 
(ro) the day when they leave school,

This register, which no child should be suffered to read, is sent to the 
school-visitor before his annual inspection, and inspected by the min- 
ister during his weekly visits that he may know the delinquent chil- 
dren, and exhort them to greater diligence, and speak with their par- 
ents wa this regard. 
12. Requisities for a teacher. Since‘the chief requisite in a good 
school is a competent and faithful teacher, it is our gracious and earnest 
will, that one and all, who have the right of appointment, shall take 
heed to bring only well-qualified persons into office as teachers and 
sacristans. A schoolmaster should not only possess the necessary at- 
tainments and skill in instruction, but should be an example to the 
  
Fic. 67. A GERMAN LATE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY SCHOOL 
   children, and not tear down by his daily life what he builds up by his 
teaching. He should therefore strive after godliness, and guard against 
everything which might give offence or temptation to parents or chil- 
dren. Above all things, he should endeavor to obtain a correct knowl- 
edge of God and of Christ, thereby laying a foundation to honest life 
and true Christianity, and feeling that they are entrusted with their 
office from God, as followers of the Saviour, and in it have an oppor- 
tunity, by diligence and good example, not only to render the children 
happy in the present life, but also to prepare them for eternal blessedness.
-P-A-G-E-489
      NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 463 
13. Teacher’s habits. Though we intend to leave undiminished the 
privileges of the nobility and other patrons to select and appoint their 
sacristans and teachers, yet our superintendents, inspectors, and the 
clergy must see that no incompetent, unsuitable, nor reckless and 
wicked person is employed or continued in office. . . . All teachers are 
forbidden to keep tavern, to sell beer or wine, to engage in any other 
occupation by which their labor may be hindered or the children lured 
by their example into habits of idleness and dissipation, such as the 
hanging around taverns or making music at dinners and balls, which is 
prohibited under high fine and punishment. 
14. Examination of teachers. No sacristan or teacher can be installed 
into office before his qualifications, ascertained by actual examination, 
are certified to by the Inspector. No clergyman can admit any person 
to such position in church or school who does not produce said certifi- 
cate of a successful examination. .. . 
15. License to teach. No person shall assume to teach in any school of 
the country, village, or town, who has not regularly obtained a license 
to teach; and all schools, whether kept by man or woman, not duly au- 
thorized, are entirely prohibited. But parents of wealth may, as here- 
tofore, engage private teachers for their children, provided that the 
children of others who cannot yet be taught the higher branches, are 
not induced to withdraw from the regular school in order to share the 
private elementary instruction. 
16. Attendance to duty. As a schoolmaster is not permitted to em- 
ploy his pupils for his own work during school hours, neither shall he 
attend to his trade or other business during such hours, or entrust his 
wife with the duties of the school-room; though he may employ her or 
another person to assist when the school is too large for his personal 
instruction. If for any cause he neglects to teach the prescribed hours, 
the clergyman shall remind him of his duty; and, in case of persistent 
neglect, notice must be sent to the inspector that such irregularities may 
be corrected or punished. 
17. [School to open with prayer. Nature of.] 
18. [School hours. Eight to eleven, and one to four, unless ordered 
otherwise.] 
19. [Course of study. Rather detailed provision made as to each hour 
of instruction. Summarized, it is as follows:        
        
   
     
      Morning. 
ist Hour — Singing of a hymn, a different hymn to be learned 
each month. This followed by a prayer, and this in 
turn by instruction in the Catechism. Luther’s 
“Smaller Catechism” for younger children; the larger 
for the older. Saturday lesson to be preparatory for 
Sunday, the Epistle for that day being read and 
written. 
     
      
     
-P-A-G-E-490

  2d Hour — A B C class; reading from Old and New Testament; 
spelling; finding passages in the Scriptures; and 
memorizing verses from the Bible and learning Bib- 
ical names. 
3d Hour — Reading, writing, spelling; writing in copybooks; 
tules of reading. School closes with prayer, and 
reading of psalm. On Saturday children exhorted te 
ehave well on Sunday; to be quiet in church; and to 
treasure up the word of God for their salvation. 
Afternoon. 
4th Hour — Pupils sing verses, read a psalm, and are taught Bib- 
ical history from Rochow’s “ Manual for the Instruc- 
tion of Children in Country Schools.” 
5th Hour — Catechism, after method given in the “Berlin 
Reader.” Pupils commit to memory, reading it with 
the teacher. Interpretations for the larger children. 
Children to learn a Bible verse weekly. During 
second half of hour, larger children to learn to read; 
middle class to spell; and lower class to learn their 
etters, as in second hour. 
6th Hour — Upper class write and cipher; middle class spell; and 
ower class study their A B C.   In cities, where schools had more than one class, the local consistory 
could regulate the order of the lessons, and the method of instruc- 
tion.] 
20. Uniform textbooks. As the country has hitherto been deluged 
with all sorts of school-books, especially with interpretations of the 
Catechism, and so-called “orders of salvation,” because every preacher 
selects the books after his own pleasure, or writes some himself and has 
them printed, by which children, especially if parents change their 
residence, are much confused, it is our will, that henceforth no other 
books, than such as have been approved by our consistory, shall be used 
in any country-schools over which we have the right of patron. These 
books include, according to the wants of the country, the New Testa- 
ment, the book called “Exercise in Prayer,” in which not only are the 
contents of each book in the Bible, but the main subject of each chap- 
ter is framed into a prayer, to assist the young in expressing their in- 
vocations in the words of divine truths. Also the Halle or Berlin Bible,

21. Each pupil to have a book. Each class must not only have the 
same books, but the clergyman and teacher must see that every child 
has his own book, so that two pupils need not look over the same book. 
Children, whose books are furnished from the funds of the church or 
the commune, are not allowed to take them home, but will deliver them 
to the master, at the close of the lessons, who will take charge of them 
as the property of the school. 
22. Discipline. Lays down rules for.] 
23. [Church attendance. Parents on Sunday to send children to 
schoolmaster, who shall escort them to church and note conduct and 
absences, and on Monday question them on the sermon.]| 
24. Relations of schoolmaster and clergyman. In all other affairs of 
the school, the teacher must avail himself of the advice and suggestions 
of the clergyman, as his superior officer, and by his school-regulation 
the teachers are so directed. Of all that regards their office they must, 
on demand, give an account, and accept directions in reference to the 
prescribed method and discipline, because we have confidence in cur 
ministers and bind it upon their consciences that in their towns they 
will earnestly endeavor to abolish all abuses and defects, and improve 
the condition of the schools. In case however one or the other of the 
schoolmasters should neglect the duties of his office, after he is en- 
gaged, and be found unreliable, the pastor’s duty will be, earnestly to 
remind him of his duty, with kindness once or twice, and if he still con- 
tinues in his negligence, to apply for a remedy to the nearest justice; at 
the same time to inform the Superintendent or Inspector, and if their 
warning is not heeded, make a report to the consistory, that, according 
to the circumstances, they may decree a suspension or removal. 
25. Clerical supervision. Especially is it our pleasure, that clergy- 
men in villages and towns shall visit the schools of their place, generally 
twice a week, sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the after- 
noon, and shall not only take the information of the sacristans or school- 
master, but themselves examine the children in the Catechism and 
question them after other schoolbooks. They shall hold a monthly 
conference with the schoolteachers i matre, and designate to them the 
portion of the Catechism, the hymn, the psalm and Bible-verses which 
the children shall learn during the next month. Then he instructs them 
how to observe the principal divisions of the sermon and how to ex- 
amine the children; he also points out the defects of their instruction in 
school, their method, discipline, and gives them other information, that 
the schoolteachers may fulfil their duties. If a clergyman, against our 
expectation, should be careless in his visits to the schools, or in the per- 
formance of other duties enjoined upon him in these regulations, and 
not labor earnestly to effect an exact observance of this law on the part 
of custos and teachers, he shall if convicted of the non-fulfilment of 
these instructions, be suspended cum effectu, for a time, or, as the case

  may be, removed from office: because the care for the instruction of the 
young and the supervision thereof, belong to the most important 
duties of the ministry, as we always desire them to be considered. 
26. Annual inspection. The Superintendents and Inspectors of 
every district are hereby commanded, in the most expressive manner, 
annually to inspect every country-school in their jurisdiction, and with 
due attention to inquire into the condition of the schools, and examine 
whether parents and school authorities have held their children to 
regular attendance at school or have been negligent; whether the cler- 
gymen have done their duty in the observance of these regulations, by 
visiting the schools and superintending the teacher; especially whether 
the schoolmaster has the ability required or is not competent, and 
whatever else is in need of improvement. About all this the said Super- . 
intendents and Inspectors shall remit a dutiful report, every year, to . 
our High Consistory in this city, for further examination and disposi- 
iON. .e. 
Conclusion. In general we here confirm and renew all wholesome 
laws, published in former times, especially, that no clergyman shall 
admit to confirmation and the sacrament, any children not of his com- 
mune, nor those unable to read, or who are ignorant of the fundamental 
principles of evangelical religion. 
275. The Silesian School Code of 1765 
(Translation in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. xx, pp. 869-77)    
In 1748, as a result of an eight-year war known as the War of 
the Austrian Succession, Frederick the Great of Prussia succeeded 
in wresting by force from Maria Theresa of Austria the Province 
of Silesia. It was an arbitrary act of spoliation, similar to the 
“divisions” of Poland which soon followed. Silesia was a Catho- 
lic province, and in 1765 the King issued a long General Regula- 
tions (Code) for the Schools of Silesia, much like the previous 
(1763) Code for Prussia. In three particulars — (a) training of 
teachers, (b) regulation of conditions under which teachers lived 
and worked, and (e) the supervision of instruction by clergymen 
and inspectors — the Code embodied new directions, and these 
are reproduced below. The nature of the instruction required 
(c) and the regulations dealing with compulsory attendance (d) 
are also reproduced for comparison with similar regulations of the 
earlier Prussian Code. (R. 274, §§ 19, 20; 10, 11.) While still 
working through the Church authorities, the strong arm of the 
State is becoming increasingly evident.

REGULATIONS FOR CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN SILESIA 
November 3, 1765 
We, Frederick, by the grace of God, King of Prussia, &c., 
Make known hereby that, as in our paternal care for the welfare of 
our faithful subjects, we were led to issue the order of August 12, 1763, 
for the better organization, of the ill-managed country-schools, we have 
thought proper to proclaim a similar order in regard to our Roman 
Catholic subjects of Silesia and the county of Glatz, for the organiza- 
tion of the common elementary schools in towns and villages. That 
we may make our Roman Catholic subjects more useful citizens, we 
hereby ordain: 
(a) The training of teachers for the Catholic schools 
1. To strike at the source of all poor instruction, no schoolmaster, 
or by whatever name teachers in cities and villages may be designated, 
shall be anywhere engaged if he cannot prove, in the manner described 
below, that, with skill in singing and playing the organ sufficient to 
perform the services in the Church, he has acquired the art of instruct- 
ing the young in the German language, after the manner approved by 
Catholic school authorities. 
2. And that every one who desires to be employed in schools may 
have the opportunity for learning all that is needed by a good teacher, 
we have thought it best to establish here and there certain schools, in 
which not only the young will have the best instruction, but where 
adults, also, may be taught how to teach and manage youth. For this 
purpose we have selected the following schools: for Lower Silesia, the 
school of the Breslau Cathedral ad Saint Joannem, the school of the 
second Cistercians at the convents of Leubus, Grussau, and the Au- 
gustines of Sagan; for upper Silesia, the school in the city of Ratibor 
and of the Cistercians at the convent of Rauden; and for the county 
of Glatz, the school of the city of Habelschwerdt. 
3. We command that the above-named schools, which are to serve as 
seminaries for future teachers, shall not only be constantly provided 
with skillful teachers, but each shall also have a well-informed director, 
who shall devote himself to maintaining and improving the condition 
of his school, and especially to training and instructing those who are 
preparing to teach. The director must observe the following: 
4. He should aim at having everything in his school taught and 
learned thoroughly, and in reference to the needs of common life, 
which will be further described below. He should show the teachers 
howto give their pupils the reasons for everything, that they may ob- 
tain an understanding thereof, and become themselves able, on being 
questioned, to give these reasons. His object should not be to load the 
memory of the pupil, but to enlighten and train his mind.
-P-A-G-E-494
  468 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
5. And, since the method in which the first teachers of the above- 
named schools were instructed is such that, by retaining it, all those 
advantages may be reached, it is our will that it should be introduced 
everywhere, especially the essential part of the method of letters, 
tables, questions, and answers, as well as the books written for this 
purpose. 
6. The directors should not omit to employ such other advantages 
as they or others may discover in connection with this popular mode of 
teaching; and to this end they should correspond among themselves, 
and read the best works on schools and education. That such writings 
may become known to them, we commend the publisher of the priv- 
ileged Breslau literary periodical to notice and criticise such books and 
treaties as are new or reprinted. 
(b) Regulation of conditions under which teachers live and work 
13. It is well known how much children are hindered in their studies 
and become distracted when, in the room in which the school is kept, 
  
\ : \ \

SP Tie oo AY A WN ANY 
Fic. 68. THE ae or A Hanp-WoRKER 
the wife and children and frequently even the relatives of the school- 
master, work at their trade or domestic duties. In order to remove this 
evil, the school-room must be separated from the living room, in all new
-P-A-G-E-495
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 469 
schoolhouses erected in cities and villages, and shall be convenient, 
well lighted, and large enough to accommodate all the children. In 
cities where schools have several teachers, a separate room must be 
constructed for every teacher, which shall not be used for any other 
than school purposes. These schools are to be erected at the expense 
of the commune, if it is mainly Catholic, with concurrence of the pro- 
prietors, without distinction of religion; because it is important to 
masters of every denomination that subordinates be made useful 
through the training of the school; and all necessary furniture, black- 
boards, inkstands, and books for children of destitute parents they 
shall furnish also. 
14. In places where the salary of a teacher is so small that he cannot 
subsist on it, our Council of War and Domains shall see that the pro- 
prietors and Catholic subjects raise a sufficient support for him and pay 
it promptly. In places where the number of Catholic inhabitants is 
very small, and consequently a living salary for the teacher cannot be 
made up without oppressing the people, we will permit the teacher to 
practice a trade for his better subsistence, like that of a tailor or stock- 
ing weaver; but he shall not be permitted to work in the school room or 
during school hours. Any traffic in beer or liquor, or attendance at 
fairs with music, shall not be included in the lawful trades of a teacher. 
Experience shows that the first distracts a teacher and entices him 
from his duties; and by music and taverns the best schoolmasters are 
ruined, and reduced to drinking and idleness. 
15. Therefore all teachers are forbidden to keep a tavern, or to wait 
on weddings and other occasions; and we permit them to labor in any 
trade that will be no hindrance to the work of teaching. 
16. With the same intent of guarding schools against interruptions, 
we release teachers from the customary duty of carrying messages 
from the archbishop to the neighboring clergy, and we command that 
such should be done in future by other messengers from the commune, 
since these messages generally concern our war orders. 
(c) Nature of the instruction 
1g. As schools in large cities have frequently two or three teachers, 
we ordain that one of them —he who writes the best hand — shall 
teach the smaller children in the first elements; the others the more 
advanced pupils. 
20. Instruction to beginners includes: rst, the letters, spelling, and 
simple reading. The letters must be learned in a month; and since, in 
cities, new children are coming in every month, the course is to be re- 
peated. Every month the children should spell the six different classes 
of syllables in the spelling book; in the third month the children, who 
began with the letters the first month, should commence to read, but the 
difficult words must still be spelled and the rules be inquired into, 
 
-P-A-G-E-496
  470 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Every month they must go over the tables belonging to the subject, as 
they are found in the school books for children. 2d, in writing, the 
teacher should first acquaint the pupils with the rules of penmanship 
after the printed instructions, and they should then practice them until 
they have a correct German current handwriting, and can also write 
Latin letters according to the rules contained in the above instructions. 
He should go over the tables of calligraphy every month, taking the 
general principles during the first two weeks and the current letters; in 
the third week, Latin and current handwriting; and in the fourth week 
whatever is necessary to write words and sentences. In correcting, he 
should not omit to point at the tables, and proceed after the instruc- 
tions printed on the same. 3d, in arithmetic he must likewise proceed 
after the tables on the five simple operations prepared for the Silesian 
schools; also in the rule of three with simple numbers, and he must 
enlenyor to bring the children to do quick cyphering. During the first 
month he is to finish the table of enumeration, and the ‘children should 
know how to pronounce and write any given number of not above eight 
or nine figures. Addition and multiplication should be completed in 
two months, and the remaining three months of the semi-annual term 
given to subtraction and division and recapitulating the other opera- 
tions. 
21. The children thus prepared are to be further instructed by the 
second teacher. When they are able to read the larger tables with flu- 
ency, they should be taught how to pronounce correctly the French 
words which occur frequently in German papers. In writing, the 
teacher should show them the law style and fractura, and the current 
letters which they learned from the first teacher need not conform to 
his own handwriting, and he need not make copies for them, but should 
cause them to copy select portions from books or other useful matters, 
he seeing that all they write is in agreement with the rules given in the 
tables of calligraphy. He should instruct them in orthography, not 
only by copying, but by dictating to them from time to time, in order 
that the pupils acquire a fluency in writing, and also to see how far they 
apply the rules of orthography. He should teach the older scholars 
to write compositions of various kinds, especially letters and forms 
which occur most frequently in common life. He should observe the 
mistakes in the use of language in the modifications or combinations of 
words, for which purpose he should use Gottsched’s grammar. In 
arithmetic the pupils should learn the four operations in simple num- 
bers and with fractions, the rule of three in all its applications, and the 
Italian practice, if any desire it. Oftentimes, especially to those who 
are about to leave the school and gain a living by the pen, the teacher 
should give them various bills and accounts, and show them how to 
draw these up correctly, and what must be done in revising accounts. 
22. If, as in almost all large cities, the school has a third teacher, he
-P-A-G-E-497
      NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 471 
should instruct in the first elements of the French and Latin languages, 
in general and special history, in understanding and using a map, in 
studying geography from tables printed for this purpose, arid in finding 
places on the map by means of the Lexicorum. We shall also, in order 
to give the young an idea of those things which render a State prosper- 
ous and the subjects contented, cause to be published a short text- 
book, containing the most useful knowledge of physics and some pre- 
liminary knowledge of the objects which are of importance in arts, 
trades, and manufactures. The duty of making the contents of such 
a book known to youth belongs, also, in larger cities, to the third 
teacher. 
(d) Compulsion to attend 
25. All these regulations, intended for the welfare of our faithful sub- 
jects, will create but little effect if, as has been the case heretofore, the 
schools are empty, where it is left to the will of the parents to send their 
children to school or not. We ordain, therefore, by this present, that 
all children in cities and villages, without distinction, whether the par- 
ents are able to pay for tuition or not, shall be sent to school as soon as 
they complete their sixth year, and shall attend the same until they 
are thirteen years old. 
26. Parents and guardians who retain their children at home against 
this order shall, unless notoriously known as unable, pay double the 
tuition fee to the school teacher; the guardians from their own means, 
without any right of charging it to their-wards’ account; this to be 
levied by the justice of the court of the district; and the poor, who can- 
not pay this forfeiture, shall be compelled to two days’ work for the 
commune, without pay, for every week they neglect to send their chil- 
dren to school. Children of less than eight years must attend school 
in summer and winter; in summer only in the forenoon. 
27. As regards older children, whom the parents need for guarding 
the cattle and for other farm work, we permit that such, because the 
young now learn faster and more thoroughly by the new method 
introduced, be free from school from Saint George’s day to Saint 
Martin’s. 
28. They shall be required, however, during this time, to attend the 
instruction in Christianity every Sunday afternoon, and after that to 
participate for two hours in the lessons in reading and writing given in 
school; which lessons the teachers shall give under direction of the pas- 
tor, that they may become useful to the young. Those, also, who have 
left school, and are not yet twenty years of age, must attend these les- 
sons, though they may be in service on a domain or with a farmer, for 
their employers are bound to send them to school at such time, that 
they may recapitulate what they learned before, and prevent the utter 
lack of necessary knowledge. . . .

  472 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
(e) The supervision of instruction by clergymen and the State 
43. It is the duty of the clergyman to see that the young of his 
parish are well taught in school. We therefore command earnestly all 
clergymen in cities and villages to take care that these regulations are 
faithfully observed. 
44. Clergymen who, on account of age or professional engagements, 
ave been provided with one or more chaplains, may transfer the care 
f the schools over to one of them, but they shall be responsible for 
their delegate. 
45. At least once every two weeks the clergyman or his chaplain 
shall visit every school during school hours, of which the teacher shall 
make a note in his register, by placing a V, for visitation, on that day. 
46. The clergyman, during his visitation, shall observe: a, whether 
the prescribed school-hours are kept; 6, whether the improved method 
is practiced; c, whether the catalogue and list is in order; d, whether 
punishments are too severe; e, whether the school utensils and books 
are well kept; f, whether the school room is clean, and used for no other 
than school purposes, those cases excepted where no other room is pro- 
vided for the teacher. 
47. In regard to the children, the clergyman should see — a, whether 
all persons, who, according to law, should attend the day school, or’ 
Sunday and repetition school, are regular in their attendance; 6, 
whether the scholars are divided into classes on the basis of their abili- 
ties as well as age; c, whether they are benefited by the instructions 
and have made progress; d, whether the teacher advances them too 
rapidly before they have well learned the preceding lessons; e, whether 
the teacher employs children at his private work during school hours, 
and excuses them on this account from learning their lessons. 
48. The clergyman shall also see whether the schoolhouse and furni- 
ture are in good condition, and whether a copy of the school regulations 
and everything necessary has been provided; and if not, he should 
notify the magistrate, the nobleman, or the justice; also expostulate 
with parents who neglect to send their children, and endeavor to re- 
move all defects and impediments as much as is in his power; and 
where he cannot remedy them himself, he should notify the bishop and 
the school inspector. He should preserve the monthly statements of 
the teacher, and prepare an abstract of them, which he should be able 
to present to the bishop or school visitor. 
49. He should remonstrate with the teacher for his faults, but not 
in presence of the children, only when alone, and endeavor to instruct 
him in those matters wherein he is deficient. He must never employ 
him for other purposes during school hours, especially not in his own 
interest. When ministerial duties, like the visitation of the sick, call 
him away, he must not take the schoolmaster along; but may take one 
of the larger boys. He should also exhort his people on the advantages 
of instruction, before taking up the collections for school purposes. Ce ay

51. In order to render as permanent as possible this reform of 
schools, which lies near our heart, we cannot be satisfied with com- 
mitting the care of schools to the clergy only. We find it necessary 
that our bureau of War and Domain, the bureau of the Episcopal 
Vicariate, and the dioceses in our Silesian and Glatz districts, as well 
as all special school inspectors, give all due attention to this subject, 
so important to the State. 
71. The office of a Vicariate General, and the vicars and deacons of 
outside dioceses, must make a semi-annual report on the condition of 
schools, from the reports of school inspectors, to our royal Council of 
War and Domain, namely: at the end of May and at the end of Novem- 
ber, and inform in regard to — 
72. 1st, all neglect of these general school regulations, by magis- 
trates, landholders, or subjects, which cannot be reached by the head 
priests and inspectors; 2d, impediments of any kind; 3d, when school- 
houses are out of repair, or the teachers are not paid; 4th, important 
observations and discoveries which may serve to a. better arrangement 
of the school system; 5th, clergymen and teachers who distinguish 
themselves by their zeal and diligence in promoting education, that we 
may remove them to better benefices within our patronage; 6th, incor- 
rigible schoolmasters in our domain or villages, that they may be re- 
moved from office. 
73. We command our Council of War and Domain to-see that all 
cts brought to their notice are remedied; all obstacles removed; all 
incorrigible teachers expelled and good ones put in their places; that 
all zealous school inspectors, directors of seminaries, clergymen and 
chaplains, who deserve reward for their exertions in the cause of educa- 
tion, are provided with better benefices whenever vacancies occur, and 
thus others may be encouraged to like zeal. To the Episcopal Vicari- 
ate General, the vicars and deacons of outside dioceses, to the magis- 
trates, landholders, and to all our subjects, clergy or laity, whom these 
regulations concern, especially to all Roman Catholic school inspectors; 
head priests, directors of seminaries, clergymen, chaplains and school- 
masters, do we command, in the most serious manner, under pain of our 
disfavor and of due punishment, to superintend with all attention the 
fulfilment of these regulations to their full extent, and the duties made 
thereby obligatory on each and all.

FREDERICK 
276. The Austrian School Code of 1774 
(Translation in Barnard’s American Journal of Education, vol. Xx, pp. 879-84) 
In 1770 the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, a ruler deeply 
in sympathy with the progressive movements then stirring in
-P-A-G-E-500
474. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Europe, took up in real earnest the education of her subjects. Her 
first act was to create a School Commission for lower Austria 
(1770), and the year following the first Austrian normal school was 
established in Vienna. In 1774 she promulgated a General School 
Code for all the provinces of Austria, of which the more important 
points are reproduced below. 
GENERAL LAW FOR THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA 
December 6, 1774 
Marta THERESA, etc. 
Having nothing more at heart than the true welfare of the countries 
which God has confided to us, and having always attentively consid- 
ered whatever might contribute to this end, we have observed that the 
education of both sexes, the basis of the real happiness of nations, re- 
quires our especial care. This very important object has the more 
attracted our attention, inasmuch as the future destiny of man, the 
genius and thought of entire nations, depend mainly on the good in- 
struction and right training of children from their tenderest years. 
Such an object, however, can never be attained if the darkness of igno- 
rance is not dispelled by well-regulated instruction and education, so 
that every individual can acquire knowledge according to his ability 
and condition. These necessary ends, the utility of which is m fol 
acknowledged, we desire to reach by the following regulation for all 
schools in our kingdoms and hereditary states: 
1. Creation of a school commission in every State. In each State of 
the monarchy shall be formed a school-commission, composed of two 
or three counselors of the government, one under-delegate, and a sec- 
retary, associated with the inspector-general of normal schools. 
This commission is charged with the supervision of all school inter- 
ests, school-officers as well as school material, and they shall assure 
themselves that the method prescribed by ordinance is employed. . . . 
Frequent reports on the condition of schools must be rendered. 
2. Grades of schools, and where. Schools are of three classes: Normal 
schools, Principal schools (superior primary schools), and Trivial 
schools (primary). 
There shall be one normal (pattern or model) school in each proy- 
ince. All other establishments must conform to this school. The 
corps of teachers shall consist of a director and four or five teachers, 
one of whom shall be a catechist. 
Every capital of a canton must possess a Principal school. 
Finally, shall be established Trivial schools in all the small cities or 
boroughs in the country, and in all villages where exists a parish or a 
filial church, distant from the centre. 
3. Rules for the establishment of schools. It is not intended to estab- 
 
-P-A-G-E-501
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 475 
lish new schools everywhere, but to improve existing schools. In 
future no teacher shall be admitted, unless he knows the prescribed 
method of teaching, and has been found capable, on examination before 
the teachers of the Normal school. 
The right of keeping school or teaching the young’ shall continue to 
all laymen and ecclesiastics, who at present are engaged in the pro- 
fession of teachers; but they must, as soon as possible, make themselves 
familiar with the new method, and conform to the principles of this 
ordinance. 
New schools shall be created only where none exist, and only as 
many as are necessary; also in those places where the young are too 
numerous for the existing schools to accommodate all, or for the teach- 
ers to bestow the necessary care upon them. When the insufficiency 
is proved to exist, new schools must be erected, or the old ones repaired, 
as appears necessary, at the expense of the communes, who draw direct 
profit therefrom, unless the nobility, who have the advantage of draw- 
ing from these schools employees of good character, take upon them- 
selves the expense, or other means are devised. 
The school-commission is charged with stating the real wants, and 
to determine what portion of the expenses each party shall con- 
tribute. 
4. [Rules for the construction of *schoolhouses. General details as to 
construction, lighting, and equipment.] 
5. Branches of instruction. In each of the three classes of schools the 
instruction shall be: 
I. Normat Scuoot. A. Religion. Instruction in religion is to 
be given: 
ist. From the Catechism specially introduced by the bishop of the 
diocese, or from the Vienna Catechism for normal schools, approved 
by the bishops. 
2d. In a systematic manner, for which purpose the Reader is ar- 
ranged. 
3d.’ As history, that the pupils may learn under what circumstances 
and in what periods the divine revelations took place; what lessons 
man should draw from them, relative to his own conduct, etc. 
4th. By means of interpretation of passages in the Reader, which 
treat of the principles of morality and the condition of man. 
B. Reading. Reading, writing, and orthography; arithmetic and 
its application; and, in general, all that can contribute to inspire a 
well-regulated conduct, and be conducive to good manners. 
C. Language and science. Subjects which serve to prepare pupils 
for the study of Latin, or those who intend to pursue the career of polit- 
ical economy, and especially those who will devote themselves to agri- 
culture and the arts and trades, should be introduced. The mother 
language should be taught by exercises in composition; and the pupils
-P-A-G-E-502
  476 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
should obtain a sufficient knowledge of Latin to be able to begin the 
humanitas, to learn surgery and pharmacy, or to take up the profession 
of a writer. The best principles of economy, and especially of domestic 
economy, should be taught; also the history of arts and trades, as well 
as natural history, within the limits of utility and necessity. Also the 
elements of history and geography, especially of their own country; 
also the principles of surveying and mechanics; drawing by means of 
compass, ruler, and instruments. 
D. Methods of instruction. Those who aspire to the profession of 
teaching, shall be specially made to know, and have explained, what are 
the duties and qualifications of a good teacher; the methods and practi- 
cal means by which order and discipline are maintained in classes; 
how the school registers must be kept, and in what manner they should 
question the pupils in an examination; finally, what is required of 
public, and of private teachers. 
II. Principat Scnoors. The programme of the Principal schools 
comprises the subjects indicated under A and B, and as much as possi- 
ble, those under C, as the number and ability of the teachers and the 
time prescribed permit. 
Ill. Trrviat Scuoots. The subjects of instruction in the schools 
of small cities, boroughs, and villages, are: : 
(a) Religion and its history; morals drawn from the Bible and read- 
ing. 
(b) Reading printed and written type; current handwriting; the 
four rules of arithmetic, with the rule of simple proportions. 
(c) In the country a little book is to be used, which has been written 
to form “an honest citizen,” and to teach him thrift and manage- 
ment. 
6. Who shall teach the different branches of instruction. Ecclesiastics 
alone may teach the Christian doctrine. The Normal and Principal 
schools have a professor specially charged with giving every day, at 
least one hour, lessons on the catechism, on sacred history and moral- 
ity, and explaining the epistles and gospels. It shall be the duty of the 
vicar to catechise twice, or at least once a week, in the Trivial schools. 
If the vicars are not sufficient to teach religion in the schools of small 
towns, burghs, and the country, friars may be appointed, with the 
approval of the bishops, by the superiors of the neighboring convents. 
The schoolmasters shall be present during the lessons in the catechism, 
and pay good attention, that they may be able to repeat to the children 
the explanations which have been made. If the vicar or clergyman 
is prevented, the teachers themselves shall be obliged to question the 
children on what they have learned by heart, for instances, on verses 
from the Holy Scriptures, etc., or on what they have studied in the 
Reader relative to religion. Other subjects can be taught by laymen 
or ecclesiastics, provided they have passed their examination, The

NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 477 
teachers of the Principal schools consist of the director and four or 
five assistant teachers. 
7. [On school books. Charts and school books to be uniform.] 
8. On the manner of teaching. Instruction must be given simultane- 
ously to all pupils of the same class. The teacher should take special 
care that all pupils read together. He will punctually conform to the 
directions given in the books on method, and aim less at crowding the 
memory of children than at developing their mind by clear and pre- 
cise explanations. He should accustom the children to express them- 
selves with facility and exactitude on things which have been explained 
to them. 
g-11. [Division of classes; school hours; duration of studies.] 
12. Duty of school-attendance. In cities, all children of both sexes, 
for whom parents or guardians cannot or will not take a special teacher, 
must, without exception, attend the public schools from the age of six 
years until they are sufficiently instructed to choose a trade or profes- 
sion. As they hardly attain this degree of instruction before the age of 
twelve years, we shall see with satisfaction, if parents send them to 
school during six or seven years, and permit them to attend even longer. 
Children who desire to enter a Latin school before their twelfth 
year, must submit to a public examination, and obtain a certificate 
from the school-inspector that they possess the required knowledge. 
Where distinct schools exist, girls shall be taught separately, and 
they shall be instructed also in sewing, and all work suitable for their 
sex. If no distinct schools are organized, the girls shall attend the 
mixed school, but seated on separate benches. 
13. Duty of parents and guardians to send children to school. As the 
education and instruction of youth has a very great influence on the 
general well-being, we will not let the good success of our maternal 
care, in this regard, be endangered by the carelessness of parents and 
guardians. Consequently we ordain, that they send their children to 
school at the proper age, or have them instructed at home. We recom- 
mend to magistrates and superiors to watch over the execution of this 
ordinance, to reprimand, and if necessary, to enforce obedience on the 
part of parents or guardians who neglect this duty. 
After the necessary measures have been taken to train capable teach- 
ers in the Normal schools, no person shall be permitted to follow the 
work of teaching, if he possesses no certificate of ability, signed by the 
authorities of a Normal or Principal school, and for want of such cer- 
tificate he shall be excluded from the profession. 
14. Orphans to be instructed. That the service of orphans may not 
be an obstacle to their instruction, it shall not be lawful for magistrates 
to put them out to service before their thirteenth year; or at least those 
who have not reached that age must be permitted to attend school in 
Winter. Other persons, who take into their service orphans below 
   
-P-A-G-E-504
    478 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
thirteen years of age, will be obliged to send them to school morning 
and afternoon, and if they are not insolvent, they shall pay half tuition 
fees for them. 
15. Continuation schools. In the country, as well as in cities, the 
young people who have ceased to belong to primary schools, and par- 
ticularly those who are apprentices, must, especially in Summer, on 
Sundays after divine service, if possible, congregate at the common 
school, where, for two hours, the teacher will recapitulate with them, 
under the inspection of the curate or vicar. They shall attend these 
exercises till they are twenty years old. First, they will read the epistle 
or gospel of the day; then have an exercise in reading, writing, arith- 
metic, that they may revise the knowledge acquired at school. For 
these repetitions, passages will be selected from standard works, treat- 
. ing on religion, morality, and all subjects that tend to cultivate honest 
principles and domestic and simple tastes. The young should be fre- 
quently questioned on various important themes. , 
The obligation of apprentices to take part in these repetitions shall 
be such, that their apprenticeship cannot be declared ended, until they 
have obtained from the school-inspector a certificate, stating that they 
have fruitfully attended the repetition-school, after making good prog- 
ress in religion, reading, writing, and arithmetic, in the ordinary course. 
16. [School register, and pupil records.] 
17. Ordinary inspectors charged with examining the condition of 
schools. In order that the present regulation shall be observed, the 
authorities shall appoint in every village some special inspectors, whose 
reports, addressed to the Commission of Studies, shall contain their 
names. In the Normal and principal schools the director has the super- 
intendence; moreover, a citizen of the place, a friend of education, 
shall be nominated by the magistrate, to watch the progress of the 
schools, and to assure himself that the regulations are faithfully carried 
out. This inspector will keep account of the children that are diligent, 
and of those who are not regular in their attendance. He shall state 
whether the teacher proves zealous or negligent, or conforms to the 
ordinance. The inspectors should not make their visits at stated peri- 
ods, but whenever they think proper, without notifying the teachers. 
In cities, burghs, or the country, the curate of the parish shall be 
appointed inspector, one of the magistracy and a prudent man from the 
inhabitants of the commune. They shall conform to what has been 
ordained in regard to the inspectors in larger cities. Every inspector 
addresses a report to the Inspector-General of Normal schools, on the 
condition of the schools in his jurisdiction. 
18. Nomination of Inspector-Generals. The School-Commissions 
shall elect as Inspector-Generals only persons perfectly capable. A 
certain district will be assigned to each Inspector-General, in which to 
make his visits and institute schools. These Inspectors shall make

themselves acquainted with the deficiencies of schools; examine the 
children in presence of the teacher, and receive the reports of the local 
inspectors, rendered at Easter and Saint Michel’s. ‘These reports the 
Inspector-Generals forward to the government, which refers them to 
the School-Commission. They add an abstract of their observations, 
as well as their remarks on the following objects: 
1. In what place and point do magistrates, gentry, and inhabitants, 
act against the ordinance. 
2. What are the obstacles to the success of schools. 
3. In what places are school-buildings not in order, or need repair; 
how are the school servants salaried. 
4. What measures should be taken to improve instruction. 
5. What curates, vicars, catechisers, and schoolmasters have dis- 
tinguished themselves by diligence and zeal in teaching, and de- 
serve to be rewarded. 
6. What teachers. neglect their duty and should be punished; or 
are incorrigible, and should consequently be discharged. 
19-20. [Introducing reforms, and ecclesiastics to learn school methods.| 
21. Prohibition to teachers to keep a tavern. Though we are well dis- 
posed to permit teachers in the country to exercise an honest trade, 
provided it does not form an obstacle to their special duties, yet we or- 
der and ordain hereby, that no teacher who receives a sufficient salary 
and enjoys an honest subsistence, shall keep a tavern, under pain of 
removal. ‘ 
Neither can we permit school teachers to make music or play at a 
fair, wedding, or other occasion, in taverns or similar houses. This 
in future they are strictly forbidden to do, likewise, under pain of re- 
moval. We also forbid curates to be accompanied by the teacher in 
their visits to the sick; they should address themselves to other persons.

(Fichte, J. G., Reden an die deutsche Nation. Berlin, 1808; trans. in Barnard’s

To the thoughtful intellectual leadership of Johann Gottlieb 
‘ichte (1762-1814), for a time professor of philosophy at the Uni- 
ersity of Jena, and afterwards Rector of the new University of 
erlin, perhaps more than to any other one man, were the Prus- 
ian people indebted for their regeneration during the first two 
ecades of the nineteenth century. During the winter of 1807-08 
e delivered a series of lectures in Berlin to the German people

  had not been stirred since the days of the Reformation. The 
following selection from one of these lectures gives a good idea as 
to the importance he attached to education in connection with 
national welfare. 
Would that the State would look its present peculiar condition stead- 
ily in the face, and acknowledge to itself what that condition really is; 
would that it could clearly perceive that there remains for it no other 
sphere in which it can act and resolve as an independent State, except 
the education of the rising generation; that, unless it is absolutely de- 
termined to do nothing, this is now all it can do; but that the merit of 
doing this would be conceded to it undiminished and unenvied. That 
we are no longer able to offer an active resistance, was before presup- 
posed as obvious, and as acknowledged by every one. How then can 
we defend our continued existence, obtained by submission, against the 
reproach of cowardice and an unworthy love of life? In no other way 
than by resolving not to live for ourselves, and by acting up to this reso- 
lution; by raising up a worthy posterity, and by preserving our own 
existence solely in order that we may accomplish this object. If we 
had not this first object of life, what else were there for us todo? Our 
constitutions will be made for us, the alliances which we are to form, 
and the direction in which our military resources shall be applied, will 
be indicated to us, a statute-book will be lent to us, even the adminis- 
tration of justice will sometimes be taken out of our hands; we shall be 
relieved of all these cares for the next years tocome. Education alone 
has not been thought of; if we are seeking for an occupation, let us 
seize this. We may expect that in this occupation we shall be left 
undisturbed. I hope (perhaps I deceive myself, but as I have only 
this hope still to live for, I shall not cease to hope), that I convince some 
Germans, and that’ shall bring them to see that it is education alone 
which can save us from all the evils by which we are oppressed. I count 
especially on this, as a favorable circumstance, that our need will have 
rendered us more disposed to attentive observation and serious reflec- 
tion than we were in the day of our prosperity. Foreign lands have 
other consolations and other remedies; it is not to be expected that 
they would pay any attention, or give any credit to this idea, should it 
ever reach them; i will much rather hope that it will be a rich source of 
amusement to the readers of their journals, if they ever learn that any 
one promises himself so great things from education.

(Mann, Horace, Seventh Annual Report, Massachusetts State Board of Education.

on a short trip to Europe, and visited schools in England, Ireland, 
Scotland, Prussia, Saxony, the south German States, Holland and 
Belgium. Of the schools he saw he ranked those of Prussia first, 
those of Saxony second, those in the western and southern Ger- 
man States third, and those of Holland fourth. 
He was much impressed by what he saw of the Prussian semi- 
naries for the training of teachers, the careful selection of pupils 
for training, the course of instruction given, and the transforma- 
tion which had taken place in the elementary-school teaching by 
reason of the training given. The teachers and their training he 
describes in the following selection from his Report. 
I speak of the teachers whom I saw, and with whom I had more or 
less of personal intercourse; and, after some opportunity for the obser- 
vation of public assemblies or bodies of men, I do not hesitate to say, 
that if those teachers were brought together, in one body, I believe 
they would form as dignified, intelligent, benevolent-looking a company 
of men as could be collected from the same amount of population in 
any country. They were alike free from arrogant pretension and from 
the affectation of humility... . 
Whence came this beneficent order of men, scattered over the whole 
country, molding the character of its people, and carrying them for- 
ward in a career of civilization more rapidly than any other people in 
the world are now advancing? This is a question which can be 
answered only by giving an account of the Seminaries for Teachers. 
From the year 1820 to 1830 or 1835, it was customary, in all accounts 
of Prussian education, to mention the number of these Seminaries for 
Teachers. This item of information has now become unimportant, as 
there are seminaries sufficient to supply the wants of the whole country. 
The stated term of residence at these seminaries is three years. Lately, 
and in a few places, a class of preliminary institutions has sprung up — 
institutions where pupils are received in order to determine whether 
they are fit to become candidates to be candidates. As a pupil of the 
seminary is liable to be set aside for incompetency, even after a three 
ears’ course of study; so the pupils of these preliminary institutions, 
fter having gone through with a shorter course, are liable to be set 
side for incompetency to become competent. 
Let us look for a moment at the guards and securities which, in that 
ountry, environ this sacred calling. In the first place, the teacher’s 
rofession holds such a high rank in public estimation, that none who 
ave failed in other employments or departments of business, are en- 
ouraged to look upon school-keeping as an ultimate resource. Those, 
00, who, from any cause, despair of success in other departments of 
usiness or walks of life, have very slender prospects in looking forward
-P-A-G-E-508
  482 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
to this. These considerations exclude at once all that inferior order of 
men who, in some countries, constitute the main body of the teachers. 
Then come, — though only in some parts of Prussia, — these prelimi- 
nary schools, where those who wish eventually to become teachers, go, in 
order to have their natural qualities and adaptation for school-keeping 
tested; for it must be borne in mind that a man may have the most 
unexceptionable character, may be capable of mastering all the 
branches of study, may even be able to make most brilliant recitations 
from day to day; and yet, from some coldness or repulsiveness of man- 
ner, from harshness of voice, from some natural defect in his person or 
in one of his senses, he may be adjudged an unsuitable model or arche- 
type for children to be conformed to, or to grow by; and hence he may 
be dismissed at the end of his probationary term of six months. At 
one of these preparatory schools, which I visited, the list of subjects at 
the examination, — a part of which I saw, — was divided into two 
classes, as follows: 1. Readiness in thinking, German language, includ- 
ing orthography and composition, history, description of the earth, 
knowledge of nature, thorough bass, calligraphy, drawing. 2. Religion, 
knowledge of the Bible, knowledge of nature, mental arithmetic, sing- 
ing, violin-playing, and readiness or facility in speaking. The exam- 
ination in all the branches of the first class was conducted in writing. 
To test a pupil’s readiness in thinking, for instance, several topics for 
composition are given out, and, after a lapse of a certain number of 
minutes, whatever has been written must be handed in to the examin- 
ers. So questions in arithmetic are given, and the time occupied by 
the pupils in solving them, is a test of their quickness of thought, or 
power of commanding their own resources. This facility, or faculty, is 
considered of great importance in a teacher. In the second class of 
subjects the pupils were examined orally. Two entire days were occu- 
pied in examining a class of thirty pupils, and only twenty-one wer 
admitted to the seminary school; — that is only about two-thirds wer 
considered to be eligible to become eligible, as teachers, after three year: 
further study. Thus, in this first process, the chaff is winnowed out 
and not a few of the lighter grains of the wheat. 
It is to be understood that those who enter the seminary directly, 
and without this preliminary trial, have already studied, under abl 
masters in the Common Schools, at least all the branches I have abov 
described. The first two of the three years, they spend mainly i 
reviewing and expanding their elementary knowledge. The Germa: 
language is studied in its relation to rhetoric and logic, and as estheti 
literature; arithmetic is carried out into algebra and mixed mathema 
ics; geography into commerce and manufactures, and into a knowled; 
of the various botanical and zodlogical productions of the differe: 
quarters of the globe; linear drawing into perspective and machi 
drawing, and the drawing from models of all kinds, and from objects j
-P-A-G-E-509
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 483 
nature, &c. The theory and practice, not only of vocal, but of instru- 
mental music, occupy much time. Every pupil must play on the 
violin; most of them play on the organ, and some on other instruments. 
I recollect seeing a Normal class engaged in learning the principles of 
Harmony. The teacher first explained the principles on which they 
were to proceed. He then wrote a bar of music upon the blackboard, 
and called upon a pupil to write such notes for another part, or accom- 
paniment, as would make harmony with the first. So he would write 
a bar with certain intervals, and then require a pupil to write another, 
with such intervals as, according to the principles of musical science, 
would correspond w: ith the first. A thorough course of reading on the 
subject of education is undertaken, as well as a more general course. 
Bible history is almost committed to memory. Connected with all the 
seminaries for teachers are large Model or Experimental Schools. 
During the last part of the course much of the students’ time is spent in 
these schools. At first they go in and look on in silence, while an 
accomplished teacher is instructing a class. Then they themselves 
commence teaching under*the eye of such a teacher. At last they 
teach a class alone, being responsible for its proficiency, and for its 
condition as to order, &c., at the end of a week or other period. Dur- 
ing the whole course, there are lectures, discussions, compositions, &c., 
on the theory and practice of teaching. The essential qualifications of 
a candidate for the office, his attainments, and the spirit of devotion 
and religious fidelity in which he should enter upon his work; the modes 
lof teaching the different branches; the motive-powers to be applied to 
ithe minds of children; dissertations upon the different natural disposi- 
ions of children, and consequently, the different ways of addressing 
hem, of securing their confidence and affection, and of winning them 
0 a love of learning and a sense of duty; and especially the sacredness 
f the teacher’s profession, — the idea that he stands for the time be- 
Ing, in the place of a parent, and therefore that a parent’s responsibili- 
ies rest upon him, that the most precious hopes of society are com- 
itted to his charge, and that on him depends, to a great extent, the 
mporal and perhaps the future well-being of hundreds of his fellow- 
eatures, — these are the conversations, the ideas, the feelings, amid 
hich the candidate for teaching spends his probationary years. This 
the daily atmosphere he breathes. These are the sacred, elevating, 
vigorating influences constantly pouring in upon his soul. Hence, 
the expiration of his course, he leaves the seminary to enter upon his 
ofession, glowing with enthusiasm for the noble cause he has es- 
used, and strong in his resolves to perform its manifold and momen- 
lus duties. 
Here, then, is the cause of the worth and standing of the teachers, 
om I had the pleasure and the honor to see. As a body of men, their 
acter is more enviable than that of either of the three, so-called,

   279. Some Prussian Schools and Teachers as Dinter found them 
(Dinter, G. F., Dinter’s Leben von ihm selbst beschrieben; trans. in Barnard’s 
American Journal of Education, vol. xxi, pp. 833-34) 
Gustavus Friedrich Dinter. was a distinguished clergyman, 
normal school director in Saxony, and State School Inspector for 
East Prussia. In his Autobiography he has left some interesting 
pictures as to the conditions he found in the elementary schools 
there when he took up his duties as inspector (1819) for the prov- 
ince. The following are illustrative. 
Tn an examination of a school in East Prussia, which was taught by 
a subaltern officer dismissed from the army, the teacher gave Dinter 
a specimen of his skill in the illustration of a Scripture narrative. The 
passage was Luke vu, the miracle of raising the widow’s son at Nain. 
“See, children (says the teacher), Nain 
was a great city, a beautiful city; but 
even in such a great, beautiful city, 
there lived people who must die. They} 
brought the dead youth out. See, chil- 
dren, it was the same then as it is no’ 
— dead people couldn’t go alone 
they had to be carried. He that was dea 
began to speak. This was a sure sig: 
that he was alive again, for if he ha 
continued dead he couldn’t hav 
spoken a word.” 
[ In a letter to the King, a dismisse 
Epo schoolmaster complained that the di Gustavus Fr. DINTER 5 ‘ f 
(1760-1831) trict was indebted to him 200705 do! 
lars. Dinter supposed the man mu: 
be insane, and wrote to the physician of the place to inquire. T! 
physician replied that the poor man was not insane, but only ign 
rant of the numeration table, writing 200 70 5 instead of 275. Dint 
subjoins, “By the help of God, the King, and good men, very much hi 
now been done to make things better.” 
In examining candidates for the school-teacher’s office, Dinter ask: 
one where the Kingdom of Prussia was situated. He replied, that

    believed it was somewhere in the southern part of India. He asked 
another the cause of the ignis-fatuus, commonly called Jack-with-the- 
lantern. He said they were specters made by the devil. Another 
being asked why he wished to become a school-teacher, replied, that he 
must get a living somehow. 
A military man of great influence once urged Dinter to recommend 
a disabled soldier, in whom he was interested, as a school-teacher. 
“T will do so,” says Dinter, “if he sustains the requisite examination.” 
“Oh,” says the Colonel, “he doesn’t know much about school-teach- 
ing, but he is a good, moral, steady man, and I hope you will recom- 
mend him to oblige me.”” D.— Oh yes, Colonel, to oblige you, if you 
in your turn will do mea favor. Col. — What is that? D.— Get me 
appointed a drum-major in your regiment. True, I can neither beat 
a drum, nor play a fife; but I am a good, moral, steady man as ever 
lived. 
A rich landholder once said to him, “Why do you wish the peasant 
children to be educated? It will only make them unruly and diso- 
bedient.” Dinter replied, “If the masters are wise, and the laws 
good, the more intelligent the people, the better they will obey.” 
Dinter complained that the military system of Prussia was a great 
hinderance to the schools. A nobleman replied that the young men 
enjoyed the protection of the government, and were thereby bound to 
defend it by arms. Dinter asked if every stick of timber in a house 
ought first to be used in a fire-engine, because the house was protected 
by the engine? or whether it would be good policy to cut down all the

  280. Cousin’s Report on Education in Prussia 
(Cousin, Victor, Rapport sur Pétat de Vinstruction publique en Prusse. Paris, 
1831; trans. by Sarah Austin; London, 1834, pp. 105-08) 
      
  When the restored monarchy of France (1815-30) was over- 
hrown by the revolution of July, 1830, and a more progressive 
overnment, supported by the leading thinkers of France came 
nto power, one of their first acts was to begin the establishment of 
state system of primary schools for France. To this end one of 
he first things done was to send (1831) M. Victor Cousin, director 
f the Superior Normal School at Paris, to Prussia to study what 
as then regarded as the best school system of Europe. His 
eport on the State of Public Instruction in Prussia, made that same 
ear, carried conviction throughout France, and resulted in the 
aw of 1833, creating primary and superior primary schools for 
e nation.

  In a summary of his Report he gives an interesting picture o! 
the system of organization and administration, and shows how 
this was the result of a long local evolution. 
The six Points,’ Sir, which I have now gone over in succession, em- 
brace the entire organization of primary instruction in Prussia. There 
is not a single article which is not translated from the text of the law of 
1819. This law, without going into detail with relation to any par- 
ticular branch, omits no topic of interest, and is the most extensive and 
complete law on primary instruction of which I have any knowledge. 
It is impossible not to be struck with its profound wisdom. No in- 
applicable general principles, no spirit of system, no partial or exclusive 
views govern the legislator. He avails himself of all the means that 
can conduce to his end, however widely these means may differ. It is 
a king, and an absolute king, who issued this law; it is an irresponsible 
minister who advised or who digested it; and yet we find no injudicious 
spirit of centralization or of official despotism (bureaucratie ministéri- 
elle); almost everything is left to the parochial, departmental, or pro- 
vinicial authorities; little more than the general supervision and direc- 
tion are reserved te the minister. The clergy have a great share in the 
management of popular instruction, and householders are also con- 
sulted in the towns and villages. In a word, all persons or classes who 
have an interest in the subject, find their appropriate place in this 
organization, and concur, each in his own manner and degree, to the 
common end, which is, the civilization of the people. 
On these grounds the Prussian law of 1819 appears to me excellent; 
nor is it to be imagined that such a law could be conceived and ma- 
tured by the wisdom of an individual. Baron von Altenstein rathe’ 
digested than created it. Indeed, we may almost say that it alread: 
existed in a vast number of partial and detached ordinances, and in th 
manners and customs of the country. There is, perhaps, not a singl 
article of this long law to which numerous anterior regulations did no 
serve as a groundwork; and, in a paper on the history of primary in, 
struction in Prussia inserted in the first number of the second volum 
of the Journal of Primary Instruction, by Councillor von Beckedo 
I find rules as old as the years 1728 and 1736 which comprise a numb: 
of the provisions of the law of 1819. The obligation of parents to sen 
their children to school is of great antiquity in Prussia. The powerf 
and active superintendence exercised by the Church over the educatio 
         
   
            
      
    
1 The six points, or titles of chapters in his Report, to which he refers, were: 
I. Duty of parents to send their children to the primary schools. 
II. Duty of each parish to support a primary school. 
III. General objects and different gradations of primary instruction. 
IV. Training, appointment, promotion, and discipline of primary teachers. 
V. The superintendence of primary ‘nstruction. 
VI. Of private schools.

NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 487 
of the people, dates from the origin of Protestantism, of which it is an 
inherent characteristic. It is evident that the authors of a revolution 
effected in the name of liberty of conscience must necessarily labour at 
the emancipation of the popular mind, and the diffusion of knowledge, 
as the only secure means of defending their cause and rooting it in the 
minds of the people. Unquestionably the law of 1819 raises education 
to a sufficiently high pitch in the elementary‘schools and those for the 
middle classes; but if the course of instruction seems somewhat too full 
for some places or districts, it must be remembered that it was already 
acted up to, and even surpassed, in many others. The boldest measure 
was the establishment of a grand primary normal school for each de- 
partment; but there were already similar establishments in most of the 
old provinces of the monarchy. In short, this law does little more than 
methodize what already existed, not only in Prussia, but throughout 
Germany. 
It is not, then, a metaphysical, arbitrary and artificial abstraction, 
like the greater part of our laws on primary instruction; it is founded 
on reality and experience, and has, for that reason, been carried into 
execution, and produced the happiest results with extraordinary rapid- 
ity. Having taken care to ascertain that it was everywhere practi- 
cable, the Prussian minister peremptorily required that it should every- 
where be practiced; leaving the details to the authorities appointed to 
execute them, and reserving to himself only the general guidance and 
supervision. This guidance has been so firm, this supervision has been 
so vigilant, and the parochial, departmental and provincial authorities 
... entrusted with the management of schools have displayed so 
steady and well-directed a zeal, that in almost every part of the king- 
dom the reality actually goes beyond the law; and, on all points at least 
where zeal alone is required, even more is done than is commanded.    
   
                                              
    
     
       
     
   
      
   281. The Military Aspect of Prussian Education 
(Mann, Horace, Seventh Annual Report, Massachusetts State Board of Education. 
z Boston, 1843) 
This is another selection from the same Report as Reading 278, 
nd deals with the military and obedience aspect of the schools as 
ann saw them. At the time of his visit (1843) the forces of 
eaction following the victory over Napoleon were fast reaching a 
limax, though Pestalozzian normal schools and methods were 
till permitted. That he saw the weaknesses of the Prussian 
chools, as well as their points of strength, may be seen from the 
lowing. 
Among the nations of Europe, Prussia has long enjoyed the most dis- 
guished reputation for the excellence of its schools. In reviews, in  
-P-A-G-E-514
  488 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
speeches, in tracts, and even in graver works devoted to the cause of 
education, its schools have been exhibited as models for the imitation 
of the rest of Christendom. For many years, scarce a suspicion was 
breathed that the general plan of education in that kingdom was not 
sound in theory and most beneficial in practice. Recently, however, 
grave charges have been preferred against it by high authority. The 
popular traveler, Laing, has devoted several chapters of his large work 
on Prussia to the disparagement of its school system. An octavo vol- 
ume, entitled “‘The Age of Great Cities,” has recently appeared in 
England, in which that system is strongly condemned; and during the 
pendency of the famous “Factories Bill” before the British House of 
Commons, in 1843, numerous tracts were issued from the English 
press, not merely calling in question, but strongly denouncing, the 
whole plan of education in Prussia, as being not only designed to pro- 
duce, but as actually producing, a spirit of blind acquiescence to arbi- 
trary power, in things spiritual as well as temporal — as being, in fine, 
a system of education adapted to enslave, and not to enfranchise, the 
human mind. And even in some parts of the United States — the very 
nature and essence of whose institutions consist in the idea that the 
people are wise enough to distinguish between what is right and what is 
wrong — even here, some have been illiberal enough to condemn, in 
advance, everything that savors of the Prussian system, because that 
system is sustained by arbitrary power. 
       
                                      
    
    
     
   
    
      
     
    
   
   But allowing all these charges against the Prussian system to be true, 
there were still two reasons why I was not deterred from examining it. 
In the first place, the evils imputed to it were easily and naturally 
separable from the good which it was not denied to possess. If the 
Prussian schoolmaster has better methods of teaching reading, writing, 
grammar, geography, arithmetic, &c.,'so that, in half the time, he pro- 
duces greater and better results, surely we may copy his modes of 
teaching these elements without adopting his notions of passive obedi- 
ence to government, or of blind adherence to the articles of a church. 
By the ordinance Of nature, the human faculties are substantially the 
same all over the world, and hence the best means for their dévelop- 
ment and growth in one place, must be substantially the best for their 
development and growth everywhere. The spirit-which shall contro! 
the action of these faculties when matured, which shall train them t 
self-reliance or to abject submission, which shall lead them to refer al 
questions to the standard of reason or to that of authority, — thi 
spirit is wholly distinct and distinguishable from the manner in whic 
the faculties themselves ought to be trained; and we may avail ourselve: 
of all improved methods in the earlier processes, without being con, 
taminated by the abuses which may be made to follow them. Th 
best style of teaching arithmetic and spelling has no necessary or na‘
-P-A-G-E-515
         
   
                   
       
   
                      NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN PRUSSIA 489 
ural connection with the doctrine of hereditary right; and an accom- 
plished lesson in geography or grammar commits the human intellect 
to no particular dogma in religion. 
In the second place, if Prussia can pervert the benign influences of 
education to the support of arbitrary power, we surely can employ 
them for the support and perpetuation of republican institutions. A 
national spirit of liberty can be cultivated more easily than a national 
spirit of bondage; and if it may be made one of the great prerogatives 
of education to perform the unnatural and unholy work of making 
slaves, then surely it must be one of the noblest instrumentalities for 
rearing a nation of freemen. If a moral power over the understandings 
and affections of the people may be turned to evil, may it not also be 
employed for the highest good? 
Besides, a generous and impartial mind does not ask whence a thing \ 
comes, but what it is. Those who, at the present day, would reject an 
improvement because of the place of its origin, belong to the same 
school of bigotry with those who inquired if any good could come out 
of Nazareth; and what infinite blessings would the world have lost had 
that party been punished by success! Throughout my whole tour, no 
one principle has been more frequently exemplified than this, — that 
wherever I have found the best institutions, — educational, reforma- 
tory, charitable, penal, or otherwise, — there I have always found the 
greatest desire to know how similar institutions were administered 
among ourselves; and where I have found the worst, there I have found 
most of the spirit of self-complacency, and even an offensive disin- 
clination to hear of better methods.

    CHAPTER XXIII 
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE 
Tue Readings in this chapter have been selected to illustrate the 
founding of the centralized state school system of France, and 
cover the period from the reign of Napoleon to the beginnings of 
modern educational organization under the Third Republic. 
The first selection (282) gives the story of the founding of the 
National School of Arts and Trades by Napoleon, and is illustra- 
tive both of his interests and his methods of work. The second 
(283) reproduces the Statutes for the refounding of the Superior 
Normal School at Paris, and indicates the type of school intended 
to be created. The next (284) is a selection from the Report of 
M. Victor Cousin on the Prussian school system, a report that not 
only led to the Law of 1833 in France, but was influential in Eng- 
land and the United States as well. The organizing Law of 1833 
for France was presented to the Chamber of Deputies by the 
Minister of Public Instruction, M. Guizot, and selection 285 con- 
tains three extracts from his address on that occasion. In 286 
M. Guizot gives an interesting picture of the framing of the Law, 
by a group of progressive conservatives, and 287 is an important 
extract from his detailed letter to the teachers of France on the 
inauguration of the Law. Selection 288 is an appreciation of 
the work of M. Guizot from the pen of an English School In- 
spector. 
After the reversion to the Second Empire, education went back 
in part to clerical control. At the same time an agitation was con- 
tinued for lay and secular schools. The extract from M. Edgar} 
Quinet (289) presents an excellent argument on the question, 
After the establishment of the Third Republic the desires of earlie’ 
theorists and workers found realization, and the extract from th 
address of M. Jules Ferry (290) to the teachers of France, on moral 
and civic education, forms an interesting contrast with the lette 
of M. Guizot and pictures well the changes which had taken plac 
in French thinking and French educational practices.

282. Founding of the National School of Arts and Trades 
(Report of Inspector M. Le Brun; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, vol. Xx1, pp. 451-52) 
The story of the founding of the French School of Arts and 
Trades, by Napoleon, in 1803, is characteristic of the interest in 
practical education taken by him. In 1800 he had used the en- 
dowments of the old Collége Louis le Grande (founded in 1567 as 
a humanistic school) to create three military colleges. Most of 
the pupils were sent to these at public expense, and were taught 
French, the classical languages, ancient history, geography, draw- 
ing, mathematics, and military drill. One day Napoleon, while 
still First Consul, visited the military college at Compiégne, and 
questioned the older pupils as to what they intended to do on 
leaving it. He was so dissatisfied with the answers that he said: 
The Government pays considerable sums to educate these young 
men, and when their studies are ended, none of them, except those who 
enter the army, are of any use to the country. Nearly all of them 
remain at home, a burden to their families, which they ought to aid. 
This shall continue no longer. I have just visited the great manufac- 
turing establishments in the north and the larger workshops of Paris. 
I everywhere found foremen clever in the manual labor of their trades, 
but scarcely one among them able to draw the outlines or make the 
most simple calculations of a machine to convey his ideas by a sketch 
or a written description. This is a great defect, and I will here provide 
the means for remedying it. There must be no more Latin here; that 
will be learned in the lyceums about to be organized; but the study of 
trades, with so much theory as is necessary for their progress; by this 
ourse we shall obtain well-taught foremen for our manufactories. 
       
         
   
  A few days later (February 25, 1803), the following decision 
as printed in the official Moniteur:    From and after the month of Germinal, year XI (March, 1803), the 
eaching in the College of Compiégne shall have for its object the train- 
Ing of workmen and managers of shops.    
   The work of the school was now rearranged on the following 
lan:    
The pupils under twelve years of age were divided into three classes, 
which they received an elementary education: 1. Reading, writing, 
ind the rudiments of French grammar. 2. Continuation of the same 
udies, with the four rules of arithmetic. 3. The same studies, with 
e elements of geometry and first principles of drawing. From this col- 
ge the pupils passed to the School of Arts and Trades, where, accord-     
     
        
-P-A-G-E-518
      492 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ing to the occupations which they were to pursue, and qualifications, 
they were distributed among the different workshops, as — 1. Smiths, 
filers, fitters, turners in metal. 2. Founders. 3. Carpenters, joiners 
for buildings, furniture, and machines. 4. Turners in wood. 5. Wheel- 
wrights. In these shops they worked eight hours a day. There were 
six classes, according to the proficiency and aptitude of the pupils. 
Only two hours per day were devoted to study and to theory, including 
geometry, descriptive geometry applied to the arts, drawing and tinting 
of plans and machines. It was also arranged that those who should 
make great progress and display extraordinary talents should receive 
a more advanced education. They were to continue the same studies 
and were also to be instructed in the application of the principles of 
mechanics to the practice of the industrial arts. 
283. Refounding of the Superior Normal School 
Report of M. Charles Jourdain; trans. in Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, vol. xx, p. 324) 
In 1794 the National Convention had created a higher normal 
school (école normale supérieure) for the training of professors for 
the higher institutions of learning in France. The school opened 
in 1795, with great expectations, but closed in a few months from 
apparent failure. When Napoleon created the Imperial Univer- 
sity of France, in 1808, he re-created the normal school, and it 
began work in 1810. The following selections from the Uni- 
versity of France decree relate to the normal school, and reveal 
the nature of the institution created. 
      
    
   Art. 110. There shall be established, at Paris, a Normal Boarding- 
School, prepared to receive at least three hundred young men, who shall 
be educated in the art of teaching letters and science. 
111. The inspectors of the academy shall select, each year, from the 
lyceums, after due examination and competition, a certain number of 
pupils, of seventeen years of age or over, whose good conduct and prog- 
ress have been most marked, and who shall have shown aptitude for 
governing and instructing. 
112. Those who present themselves for examination shall be author- 
ized by their father or guardian to pursue the university course. They, 
shall be received into the normal school only on engaging to continue} 
in the profession of teaching for at leaSt ten years. 
113. These candidates shall pursue their studies at the College o: 
France, or the Polytechnic School, or the Museum of Natural History 
according as they intend to teach letters, or the different sciences. 
114. Besides their regular lessons, there shall be tutors, chosen fro’ 
the older and more talented pupils, under whose direction they shal

review the subjects taught in the special schools before mentioned, and 
have laboratory practice in natural philosophy or chemistry. 
115. The pupils shall not remain at the normal boarding-school more 
than two years. They shall then be supported at the expense of the 
university, and be bound out to their profession. 
116. The normal school shall be under the supervision of one of the 
counselors for life, who shall reside at the institution, and have under 
him a director of studies. 
117. The number of candidates for the normal school shall be regu- 
lated by the condition and needs of the colleges and lyceums. 
118. The candidates, during their course of two years, or at the close 
of it, must take their degrees at Paris, in the department of letters, or 
in that of science. They will then be called upon, in regular order, to 
fill vacant places in the academies, as they may occur.

284. Cousin’s Recommendations for Education in France 
(Cousin, Victor, Rapport sur Vétat Vinstruction publique en Prusse. Paris, 1831; 
trans. by Sarah Austin. London, 1834, pp. 111-33) 
This selection is a continuation of Reading 280. The Report 
was addressed to Count de Montalivet, Minister of Public In- 
struction and Ecclesiastical Affairs for 
France. After describing primary (Volks- 
schule) education in Prussia in some detail 
(see footnote, page 486, for chapter titles), 
he makes a summary of recommendations 
to the Minister for the drawing up of a Law 
for primary education in France. The fol- 
lowing selections represent the more impor- 
tant portions of the Report. 
(a) Previous neglect of primary education. 
Without question, Sir, in the present state of 
things, a law concerning primary instruction is 
indispensable in France; the question is, how 
to produce a good one, in a country where 
there is a total absence of all precedent and all experience in so grave 
a matter. The education of the people has hitherto been so neglected 
— so few trials have been made, or those trials have succeeded so ill, 
that we are entirely without those universally received notions, those 
predilections rooted in the habits and the mind of a nation, which are 
the conditions and the bases of all good legislation. I wish, then, for 
law; and at the same time I dread it; for I tremble lest we should 
lunge into visionary and impracticable projects again, without 
ttending to what actually exists... .

(6) Compulsion to attend. The idea of compelling parents to send 
their children to school is perhaps not sufficiently diffused through the 
nation to justify the experiment of making it law; but everybody agrees 
in regarding the establishment of a school in every commune as neces- 
sary. It is also willingly conceded that the maintenance of this school 
must rest with the commune; always provided that, in case of inability 
through poverty, the commune shall apply to the department, and the 
department to the state. This point may be assumed as universally 
admitted, and may therefore become law. . . . 
(c) Normal schools. You are likewise aware, Sir, that many of the 
councils of departments have felt the necessity of securing a supply 
of schoolmasters, and a more complete education for them, and have, 
with this view, established primary normal schools in their depart- 
ments. Indeed, they have often shown rather prodigality than par- 
simony on this head. This, too, is a most valuable and encouraging 
indication; and a law ordaining the establishment of a primary normal 
school in each department, as well as of a primary school in each com- 
mune, would do little more than confirm and generalize what is now 
actually doing in almost all parts of the country. Of course this pri- 
mary normal school must be more or less considerable according to 
the resources of each department. 
(d) The colléges (Lycées). Here we have already two most important 
points on which the country is almost unanimously agreed. You have 
also, without doubt, been struck with the petitions of a number of 
towns, great and small, for the establishment of schools of a class rather 
higher than the common primary schools; such as, though still inferior 
in classical and scientific studies to our royal and communal colléges, 
might be more particularly adapted to give that kind of generally 
useful knowledge indispensable to the large portion of the population 
which is not intended for the learned professions, but which yet needs 
more extended and varied acquirements than the class of day-labourers 
and artisans. Such petitions are almost universal. Several municipal 
councils have voted considerable funds for the purpose, and have ap- 
plied to us for the necessary authority, for advice and assistance. It 
is impossible not to regard this as the symptom of a real want, — 
the indication of a serious deficiency in our system of public in- 
struction. 
You, Sir, are sufficiently acquainted with my zeal for classical and 
scientific studies; not only do I think that we must keep up to the plan 
of study prescribed in our colléges, and particularly the philological 
part of that plan, but I think we ought to raise and extend it, and thus, 
while we maintain our incontestable superiority in the physical and 
mathematical sciences, endeavour to rival Germany in the solidity of 
our classical learning. . . . Classical studies keep alive the sacred tra- 
dition of the moral and intellectual life of the human race. To curtail

    NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE 495 
or enfeeble such studies would, in my eyes, be an act of barbarism, a 
crime against all true and high civilization, and in some sort an act of 
high treason against humanity. 
(e) Middle-class schools. Let our royal colléges then, and even a 
great proportion of our communal colléges, continue to lead the youth 
of France into this sanctuary; they will merit the thanks of their coun- 
try. But can the whole population enter learned schools? or, indeed, 
is it to be wished that it should? Primary instruction with us, however, 
is but meagre; between that and the colléges there is nothing; so that a 
tradesman, even in the lower ranks of the middle classes, who has the 
honourable wish of giving his sons a good education, has no resource 
but to send them to the collége. . . . Our colléges ought, without doubt, 
to remain open to all who can pay the expense of them; but we ought 
by no means to force the lower classes into them; yet this is the inevit- 
able effect of having no intermediate establishments between the pri- 
mary schools and the colléges. Germany, and Prussia more especially, 
are rich in establishments of this kind. I have described several in 
detail, at Frankfort, Weimar, and Leipsig. The Prussian law of 1819 
sanctions them. You perceive, Sir, that I allude to the schools called 
tradesmen’s or burghers’ schools, or schools for the middle classes 
(Biirgerschulen), écoles bourgeoises, — a name which it is perhaps im- 
possible to transplant into France, but which is accurate and expres- 
sive, as contradistinguishing them from the learned schools (Gelehrte- 
schulen), called in Germany Gymmasia, and in France colléges (in 
England “grammar-schools””) — a name, too, honourable to the class 
for whose especial use and benefit they are provided, — honourable to 
those of a lower class, who by frequenting them can rise to a level with 
that above them. The burgher schools form the higher step of primary 
instruction, of which the elementary schools are the lower step... . 
The Prussian law, which fixes a minimum of instruction for the ele- 
mentary schools, likewise fixes a minimum of instruction for the 
burgher schools; and there are two kinds of examination, extremely dis- 
tinct, for obtaining the brevet of primary teacher for these two grada- 
tions. . . . In Prussia this class of schools has, accordingly, very differ- 
ent gradations, from the minimum fixed by the law, with which I have 
already made you acquainted, to that point where it becomes closely 
allied with the Gymnasium, properly so called. At this point it some- 
times has the name of Progymnasium. 
..- In general, the German burgher schools, which are a little infe- 
rior to our communal colléges in classical and scientific studies, are 
incomparably superior to them in religious instruction, geography, 
history, modern languages, music, drawing, and national literature. 
In my opinion, it is of the highest importance to create in France,

number of our communal colléges into schools of that description. I 
regard this, Sir, as an affair of state... . 
(f) Local control for the schools. I regard as another incor testable 
point, the necessary intervention of the municipal and depai' mental 
councils in the management of public instruction. As there cught to 
be a school in every commune, so there ought to be for every com- 
munal school a special committee of superintendence, which ought 
to be formed out of the municipal council, and presided over by the 
maire.... 
After the administrative authorities, it is unquestionably the clergy 
who ought to occupy the most important place in the business of popu- 
lar education. How is it possible they could neglect, nay, even repugn, 
such a mission? But that they have done so is a fact, which, however 
deplorable, we are bound to acknowledge. The clergy in France are 
generally indifferent, or even hostile, to the education of the people. 
Let them blame themselves if the law does not give them great influence 
over primary instruction; for it was their duty to anticipate the law, 
and to take up a position which they must necessarily have continued 
to occupy. The law, offspring of facts, will therefore place small reli- 
ance on the clergy; but if it rejected them altogether, it would commit 
an egregious fault; for it would set the clergy in decided opposition to 
primary instruction, and would engage in a conflict, open, scandalous, 
and perilous. The rational middle course is to put the curé or the 
pastor, and if need be both, on every communal committee; and the 
highest dignitary of the church in each department, on the depart- 
mental committee. . . . 
(g) Private teachers and schools. As to private teachers, and what 
people are pleased to call liberty of primary tuition, I can only repeat 
what I have said elsewhere, — we must neither oppose it, nor reckon 
upon it. There are branches of the public service which must be se- 
cured against all casualties by the state, and in the first rank of these 
is primary instruction. It is the bounden duty of government to guar- 
antee it against all caprices of public opinion, and against the variable 
and uncertain calculations of those who would engage in it as a means of 
subsistence. On this principle are founded our primary normal schools 
in each department, bound to furnish annually the average number of 
schoolmasters required by the department. We must rely exclusively 
on these normal schools for the regular supply of communal teachers. 
But if, in the face of our primary communal schools, there are per- 
sons who, without having passed through the normal schools, choose 
to establish schools at their own risk and peril, it is obvious that they 
ought not only to be tolerated, but encouraged; — just as we rejoice 
that private institutions and boarding-schools should spring up beside 
our royal and communal colléges. This competition cannot be other- 
wise than useful, in every point of view. If the private schools prosper, 
     
-P-A-G-E-523
  
  i. TIONAL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE 497 
so muck the better; they are at full liberty to try all sorts of methods, 
and to make experiments in teaching, which, on such a scale, cannot be 
very perilous. At all events, there are our normal schools. Thus all 
interests are reconciled, — the duties of the state, and the rights of 
individuals; the claims of experience, and those of innovation. Who- 
ever wishes to set up a private school must be subject to only two con- 
itions, from which no school, public or private, can on any pretext be 
exempt, — the brevet of capacity, given by the commission of exami- 
nation, and the supervision of the committee of the commune and of 
the inspector of the department. I would very readily give up the cer- 
tificate of moral character, as illusory, and as implicitly contained in 
that of fitness. . . . 
(h) The law to represent experience. All these measures, on which 
I will not enlarge, are more or less founded on existing facts; they have 
the sanction of experience; it would be simply advantageous to add 
that of law. On all the points concerning which the law is silent, 
experiments might be made. Among these experiments some would 
probably be successful; when sufficiently long practice had confirmed 
them, they might be inserted in a new law; or ordonnances and in- 
structions, maturely weighed by the royal council, would convert 
them into general and official measures. Nothing must pass into a 
law which has not the warranty of success. Laws are not to be peril- 
ous experiments on society; they ought simply to sum up and to gener- 
alize the lessons of experience.   285. Guizot on the Law of 1833 
(M. Guizot, An Address made on introducing the Law in the French Chamber of 
Deputies, 1832; trans. in Barnard’s Am. Jour. of Education, vol. xx, pp. 236-37) 
On the experience of Prussia as a basis (Rs. 280, 284), M. 
Guizot, Minister of Public Instruction from 1832 to 1837, pre- 
pared and had enacted the famous Law of 1833, organizing pri- 
mary and higher primary instruction for France. In introducing 
the bill he made a lengthy Address, from which the following 
extracts, which give the general nature of the bill, are taken. 
(a) History of primary education up to 1832. In framing this bill, 
it is experience, and experience alone, that we have taken for our guide. 
The principles and practices recommended have been supplied to us by 
facts. There is not one part of the mechanism which has not been 
worked successfully. We conceive that, on the subject of the educa- 
tion of the people, our business is rather to methodize and improve 
what exists, than to destroy for the purpose of inventing and renewing 
upon the faith of dangerous theories. It is by laboring incessantly on 
these maxims, that the Administration has been enabled to communi-
-P-A-G-E-524
  
498 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
cate a firm and steady movement to this important branch of the pub- 
lic service; so much so, that we take leave to say, that more has been 
done for primary education during the last two years (1831, 1832), and 
by the Government of July, than during the forty years preceding, by 
all the former Governments. The first Revolution was lavish of prom- 
: ises, without troubling itself about the perform- 
ance. The Imperial Government exhausted 
itself in efforts to regenerate the higher instruc- 
tion, called secondary; but did nothing for that 
of the people. The restored Dynasty, up to 
1828, expended no more than 50,000 francs 
annually upon primary instruction. The Min- 
istry of 1828 obtained from the Chamber a 
grant of 300,000 francs. Since the revolution of 
July, 1830, a million has been voted annually 
— that is, more in two years than the Restora- 
tion in fifteen. Those are the means, and here 
are the results. All of you are aware that pri- 
mary instruction depends altogether on the cor- 
responding Normal Schools. The prosperity of 
these establishments is the measure of its progress. The Imperial 
Government, which first pronounced with effect the words, Normal 
Schools, left us a legacy of one. The Restoration added five or six. 
Those, of which some were in their infancy, we have greatly improved 
within the last two years, and have, at the same time, established 
thirty new ones; twenty of which are in full operation, forming in each 
department a vast focus of light, scattering its rays in all directions 
among the people. 
(b) The two grades of primary instruction. The first degree of in- 
struction should be common to the country and the towns; it should 
be met with in the humblest borough, as well as in the largest city, 
wherever a human being is to be found within our land of France. By 
the teaching of reading, writing, and accounts, it provides for the most 
essential wants of life; by that of the legal system of weights and meas- 
ures, and of the French language, it implants, enlarges, and spreads 
everywhere the spirit and unity of the French nationality; finally, by 
moral and religious instruction, it provides for another class of wants 
quite as real as the others, and which Providence has placed in the 
hearts of the poorest, as well as of the richest, in this world, for uphold- 
ing the dignity of human life and the protection of social order. The 
first degree of instruction is extensive enough to make a man of him who 
will receive it, and is, at the same time, sufficiently limited to be every- 
where realized. It is the strict debt of the country toward all its 
children. 
But the law is so framed that by higher elementary schools, primary

instruction can be so developed, so varied, as to satisfy the wants of 
those professions which, though not scientific, yet require to be ac- 
quainted with “the elements of science, as they apply it every day in 
the office, the workshop, and field.” 
(c) The training of the teacher. All the provisions hitherto described 
would be of no effect, if we took no pains to procure for the public 
school thus constituted an able master, and worthy of the high vocation 
of instructing the people. It can not be too often repeated, that it is 
the master that makes the school. .. . A bad schoolmaster, like a bad 
parish -priest, is a scourge to a commune; and though we are often 
obliged to be contented with indifferent ones, we must do our best to 
improve the average quality. We have, therefore, availed ourselves of 
a bright thought struck out in the heat of the Revolution, by a decree 
of.the National Convention in 1794, and afterward applied by Napo- 
leon, in his decree, in 1808, for the organization of the University, to the 
establishment of his central Normal School at Paris. We carry its 
application still lower than he did in the social scale, when we propose 
that no schoolmaster shall be appointed who has not himself been a 
pupil of the school which instructs in the art of teaching, and who is not 
certified, after a strict examination, to have profited by the opportuni- 
ties he has enjoyed. 
286. Principles underlying the Law of 1833 
(M. Guizot, Mémoires pour servir & histoire de mon temps. 8 vols., Paris, 1858-61; 
trans. of chapter in Barnard’s Amer. Jour. of Education, vol. xx, pp. 266-67) 
M. Francois Pierre Guillaume Guizot (1787-1874), in the Mé- 
moires which he wrote to illustrate the history of his life, devoted 
a chapter to his work as Minister of Public Instruction for France, 
a position he held during the constructive period from 1832 to 
1837. In this he describes the formation of the important Law of 
1833, and the principles which guided his action and that of his 
colleagues. The following extract is interesting as illustrating 
the tender feeling still existing toward religious education, and 
also toward the rights of parents to educate their own children in 
their own way, or not at all, as they saw fit, on the part of the con- 
servative statesmen of the time. 
The first point, and the one which, not only in my estimation, but in 
that of many sound thinkers, still remains undecided, whether the 
elementary instruction of all children should be an absolute obligation 
imposed by the law on their parents, and supported by specific penal- 
ties in case of neglect, as adopted in Prussia and in the greater portion 
of the German States. I have nothing to say in respect to the coun- 
tries where this rule has been long established, and acknowledged by 
      
-P-A-G-E-526
      
     500 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
national sentiment. There it has certainly produced beneficial re- 
sults. But I must observe that it is almost exclusively confined to 
nations hitherto exacting little on the question of liberty, and that it 
has originated with those with whom, through the Reformation of the 
sixteenth century, the civil power is also in matters of religion, or 
touching upon religious interests, the sovereign authority. The proud 
susceptibility of free peoples, and the strong mutual independence of 
temporal and spiritual power, would accommodate themselves badly to 
this coercive action of the state on the domestic economy of families: 
where not sanctioned by tradition, the laws would fail to introduce it, 
for either they would be confined to an empty command, or to compel 
obedience they would have recourse to proscriptions and inquisitorial 
searches, hateful to attempt, and almost impossible to execute, espe- 
cially in a great country. The National Convention tried, or rather 
decreed this, in 1793, and amongst all its acts of tyranny, this, at least, 
remained without effect. 
Popular instruction is at present, in England, whether on the part of 
national and municipal authorities, or of simple citizens, the object of 
persevering zeal and exertion. No one proposes to enforce the obliga- 
tion on parents by law. The system prospers in the United States of 
America, where local governments and private societies make great 
sacrifices to increase and improve the schools; but no efforts are at- 
tempted to intrude into the bosoms of families to recruit the scholars by 
compulsion. It forms a characteristic and redounds to the honor of a 
free people, that they are at the same time confiding and patient; that 
they rely on the empire of enlightened reason and well-understood in- 
terests, and know how to wait their results. I care little for regulations 
that bear the impress of the convent or the barrack room. I therefore 
decidedly expunged constraint from my bill on elementary education, 
and none of my fellow-laborers insisted on its being retained, not even 
those who regretted the omission. 
Next to the question of compulsory elementary education, came that 
of free primary instruction. Here, indeed, there could be no doubt. 
The charter had promised liberty on this point, and it was not in regard 
to the first principles of instruction that this promise could give rise to 
opposite interpretations or lengthened disputes. No one thought of 
demanding that elementary education should be entirely committed to 
private industry, evidently incapable of furnishing the necessary sup- 
ply, and little tempted to undertake it. The labor is immense, and 
without brilliant perspectives. The interference of the State here be- 
comes indispensable. A free competition between the government and 
private individuals, private and public schools opened side by side, and 
under the same regulations, comprised all that the most exacting lib- 
erals required, and produced no opposition from the stanchest sup- 
porters of power.
-P-A-G-E-527
      NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE 501 
A third question gave rise to more discussion. In the public schools, 
should elementary instruction be absolutely gratuitous, and supplied 
by the State to all children of the soil? This was the dream of generous 
spirits. Under the constitution of 1791, the Constituent Assembly had 
decreed that ‘‘a system of public instruction should be created and or- 
ganized, common to every citizen, and gratuitous with regard to those 
branches of education indispensable to all men.” The National Con- 
vention, while maintaining this principle, fixed the salaries of the tutors 
at a minimum of 1200 francs. Experience has proved the vanity of 
these promises, as irrational as they were impracticable. The State is 
bound to offer elementary instruction to all families, and to give it to 
those who have not the means of paying for it; and thus it does more 
for the moral life of the people than it can effect for their material con- 
dition. This I consider the true principle of the question, and this I 
adopted in my bill. 
These general and in some degree preliminary points being disposed 
of, there remained others of a more special character, the solution of 
which formed the text and scope of the bill. What were to be the ob- 
jects and limits of elementary instruction? How were the public in- 
stitutions to be formed and recruited? What authorities were to be 
charged with the superintendence of the elementary schools? What 
should be the means and securities for the effective execution of the 
act? 
France, in company with all progressive modern nations, has 
since abandoned these positions. Popular education in France 
was made wholly free in 1881, and compulsory in 1882, while the 
supplanting of religious by lay teachers was begun in 1891, and in 
1904 all religious schools were closed. 
  287. Guizot’s Letter to the Primary Teachers of France 
(Official Circular, Minister of Public Instruction for France; trans. in Barnard’s 
American Journal of Education, vol. xx, pp. 278-80) 
The following extracts from an Official Circular, sent out by 
M. Guizot to the 39,300 primary teachers of France, of all kinds, 
accompanying a copy of the new Law of June 28, 1833, establishing 
primary instruction in France under the aid and control of the 
State, reveal the spirit with which M. Guizot worked. The be- 
ginning and closing of the Circular are reproduced; the central 
part was a statement as to the duties of the teachers as regarded 
the children, morals, religious instruction, etc. 
Str: I send you herewith the law of the 28th of June last, on elemen- 
tary education; together with a statement of the reasons that led to its 
         
  
-P-A-G-E-528
       502 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  enactment when, in obedience to the orders of the King, I had the honor 
of presenting it, on the 2d of January, to the Chamber of Deputies. 
The law is, in reality, the charter of elementary education; and for 
that reason I am anxious that it should directly reach the knowledge, 
and remain in the possession of every tutor. If you study it carefully, 
and reflect with attention on its provisions, as well as on the motives 
which develop its true spirit, you may be assured of thoroughly com- 
prehending your duties and privileges, together with the new position 
assigned to you by our institutions. 
Do not deceive yourself. Although the career of an elementary 
teacher may be unostentatious; although his life and labors may, for 
the most part, be consumed within the boundary of a single township, 
—those labors interest society at large, and his profession partici- 
pates in the importance of public duties. It is not for a particular dis- 
trict, of tor any interest exclusively local, that the law desires every 
Frenchman to acquire, if possible, the knowledge indispensable to 
social existence, without which intelligence languishes, and sometimes 
becomes brutified. The law is for the state at large, and for public ad- 
vantage; and because liberty can neither be assured nor regular, except 
with a people sufficiently enlightened to listen, under all circumstances, 
to the voice of reason. Universal elementary education will become 
henceforward a guarantee for order and social stability. As all the 
principles of our government are sound and rational, to develop intel- 
lect and propagate light is to confirm the empire and durability of our 
constitutional monarchy. 
In conclusion, I have no occasion to dwell on your relations with the 
special authorities which watch over the schools, and with the Univer- 
sity itself. You will obtain from them general advice, all necessary di- 
rections, and frequently a support against local difficulties and inci- 
dental enmity. The administration has no other interests than those 
of elementary education, which are, in fact, your own. It only re- 
quires of you to understand thoroughly and progressively the spirit of 
your mission. While, on its part, it will carefully protect your rights, 
your interests, and your future, do you, in turn, maintain by unremit- 
ting vigilance the dignity of your position. Do not disorder it by 
unseasonable speculations, or by employments incompatible with in- 
struction. Keep your eyes fixed on every possible method of improy- 
ing the instruction you disperse around you. Assistance will not be 
wanting. In the greater number of large towns, advanced classes are 
opened; in the normal schools, places are reserved for such tutors as . 
may feel desirous of going there to improve their teaching. Every day 
it becomes easier for you to obtain, at a trifling cost, a library sufficient 
for your requirements. Finally, in some districts and cantons, confer- 
ences have already been established between the teachers. By these

means, they can unite their common experience and encourage each 
other by mutual aid. 
At the moment when, under the auspices of a new legislation, you 
are about to enter on a new career, when elementary education is des- 
tined to become the object of the most extensive practical experience 
that has ever yet been attempted in our country, I have felt it my duty 
to detail to you the principles which govern the administration of pub- 
lic instruction, and the hopes founded on your exertions. I rely on 
your utmost endeavors to insure the success of our undertaking. 
288. Guizot’s Work as Minister of Public Instruction 
(Arnold, Matthew, Popular Education in France. London, 1861) 
Mr. Arnold was an Inspector of Schools for the English govern- 
ment. He made careful studies on education on the continent of 
Europe, and wrote Reports on his work for his home government. 
In one of these he gives the following very interesting picture of 
the work of M. Guizot, Minister of Public Instruction for France 
from 1832 to 1837. At the time he wrote the earlier zeal for popu- 
lar education had largely died out. 
Such was the Law of 1833, not more remarkable for the judgment 
with which it was framed than for the energy with which it was exe- 
cuted. Asif he had foreseen the weak point of his law, the inadequacy 
of the local authorities to discharge the trust committed to their hands, 
M. Guizot multiplied his efforts to stimulate and to enlighten them. 
In successive circulars to prefects, to rectors, to directors of normal 
schools, to inspectors, he endeavored to procure the active codperation 
of all his agents in the designs of the Government, and to inspire in all 
of them the zeal with which he himself was animated. On behalf of the 
elementary schools, he strove to awaken that spirit of local interest and 
independent activity which he and his friends have never ceased to in- 
voke for their country, and the want of which has, since the Revolution, 
been the great want of France. He succeeded imperfectly in inspiring 
his countrymen with a faith in habits of local exertion; but he suc- 
ceeded at last in founding the elementary schools of France, and in 
inspiring faith in his own zeal for them. In the chamber of the Frére 
Philippe or of the Pére Etienne, as among the Protestant populations of 
Nismes and of Strasbourg; in the palaces of bishops and in the manses 
of pastors; in the villages of Brittany and in the villages of the Ce- 
vennes — everywhere I found M. Guizot’s name held in honor for the 
justice and wisdom of his direction of popular education when it was in 
fashion, for his fidelity to it now that it is no longer talked of. Singular 
confidence inspired in quarters the most various upon the most delicate 
lof questions, which insincere ability can never conciliate, which even
-P-A-G-E-530

sincere ability can not always conciliate; only ability united with that 
heartfelt devotion to a great cause, which friends of the cause instinc- 
tively recognize, and warm towards it because they share it.    
    
   
                             
    
    
            
    
   289. A Lay School for a Lay Society

rington French Ideals of Today. World Book Company, Yonkers, New York, 
1919. Reproduced by permission) 
Edgar Quinet (1803-75) was a professor at the Collégede France, 
and was forced into exile after the establishment of the Second 
Empire because of his republican protests. 
The nineteen years of his exile (1851-70) he 
devoted to the awakening of the French 
conscience in matters of lay education, and 
by his writings did much to prepare France 
for the complete national system of educa- 
tion adopted after 1870. His book on the 
“Instruction of a People”’ states clearly the 
principles of republican and national educa- 
tion, as the following extract shows. 
No particular church being the soul of 
ie France, the teaching which diffuses this soul 
BC 2: ee ENED should be independent of every particular (1803-75) church. 
The teacher is not merely the priest’s assistant; he teaches what no 
priest can teach, the alliance of churches in the same society. 
The teacher has a more universal doctrine than the priest, for he 
speaks to Catholic, Protestant, and Jew alike, and he brings them all 
into the same civil communion. 
The teacher is obliged to say: ‘“‘ You are all children of the same God 
and of the same country; take hold of each others’ hands until death.” 
The priest is obliged to say: “ You are the children of different churches, 
but among these mothers there is but one who is legitimate. All those 
who do not belong to her are accursed; they shall remain orphans. Be, 
then, separated in time, since you must be separated in eternity.” 
Do you think it would be a misfortune for your child thus to be born 
to civil life with any feeling of concord, peace, and union toward his 
brethren? Is the first smile that heaven has given him, given him to 
curse? Must his first lisping be an anathema? 
The intention of the sacerdotal castes has always been that they are 
the only power capable of giving a foundation to civil and political 
institutions. Look at them wherever they have held sway, among the 
Hindus or in the states of Rome. While they reigned, each detail of 
 
-P-A-G-E-531
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE 505 
the civil state, its administration, even the police, were things sacred; 
in the theocracy of Moses the smallest hygienic or agricultural regu- 
lation came from the wisdom on high. Every prescription of the priest 
is of divine institution; the thought of heaven permeates the whole 
body of laws. 
As soon as lay society frees itself from the rule of the priests, it is con- 
sidered to have broken off all relation with the eternal order. The 
same laws which formerly were filled with the spirit of God are now but 
the caprices of chance. From the moment that this State, which was 
said to be of divine institution, dispenses with the priest, it is pro- 
claimed atheistic. Yesterday it was eternal wisdom, manifested and 
written in the laws. To-day it is a blind person who pushes away his 
guide. It knows nothing, it sees nothing. Separated from the priest, 
what remains for it to teach? Not even the wisdom which the ant 
teaches the ant. 
If society without the priest does not believe in justice, why does it 
seek from century to century to come nearer to justice in the develop- 
ment of law? If it does not believe in truth, why does it pursue truth 
in science? If it does not believe in order, why does it pursue order in 
the succession of its institutions and revolutions? 
Justice, truth, absolute order, what are they but the eternal source 
of divine ideas; in other words, that essence of the God on which the 
customs of the State are ordered? This God of order and of justice, 
this eternal geometer who descends by degrees into the very ground- 
work of the laws of all civilized peoples, is not the one who pleases the 
sacerdotal castes. Is this a reason for conceding that a society con- 
tains no principle outside its Church, no moral teaching outside its 
clergy, or that all light dies out if it is not lighted at the altar? 
People repeat incessantly that lay society has no fundamental prin- 
ciple and consequently nothing to teach. At least you must admit that 
better than any one else it can teach itself, and that is precisely the 
point in lay teaching. 
For my part I have always claimed that society possesses a principle 
which it alone is in a position to profess, and that on this principle is 
founded its absolute right to teach in civil matters. That which forms 
the foundation of this society, makes its existence possible, and pre- 
vents it from falling to pieces, is precisely a point which cannot be 
taught with equal authority by any of the official cults. This society 
lives on the principle of the love of citizens for one another, independ- 
ently of their beliefs. 
Do you wish to free lay teaching? Dare affirm what three centuries 
have affirmed before you, that it is sufficient unto itself, that it exists 
of itself, that it itself is belief and science. 
How has modern science been constituted? By breaking away from 
the science of the Church. The civil law? By breaking away from

canon law. The political constitution? By breaking away from the 
teligion of the State. All the elements of modern society have devel- 
oped by emancipating themselves from the Church. The most im- 
portant of all — education — remains to be emancipated. By a con- 
clusion deduced from all that precedes, is it not clear that we can 
regulate it only on condition that it be completely separated from 
ecclesiastical education?

pany, Yonkers, New York, 1919. Reproduced by permission) 
Jules Ferry (1832-93) was mayor of Paris during the trying 
period of 1870-71; later a member of the French legislature; and 
from 1879 to 1885 was several times Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion. From his letter to the teachers of France, in 1883, the fol- 
lowing extract relative to moral and civic education, which now 
replaced the religious, is taken. This expresses well the spirit of 
the new government, and of the state system of education it 
created. 
The academic year just opened will be the second since the Law of 
March 28, 1882, went into effect. At this time I cannot refrain from 
sending you personally a few brief words which you will probably not 
find inopportune, in view of the experience 
you have just had with the new régime. Of 
the diverse obligations it imposes upon you, 
assuredly the one nearest your heart, the one 
which brings you the heaviest increase of 
work and anxiety, is your mission to instruct 
your pupils in ethics and citizenship. You 
will be grateful to me, I am sure, for answer- 
ing the questions which preoccupy you at 
present, by trying to determine the character 
and the purpose of this teaching. In order 
to succeed more surely I shall, with your 
permission, put myself in your place for an 
instant to show you by examples borrowed 
from your everyday experience how you can 
Fic. 73. Jures Ferry do your duty, and your whole duty, in this 
(1832-93) respect. 
The Law of March 28 is characterized by 
two provisions which supplement each other and harmonize com- 
pletely: on the one hand it excludes the teaching of any particular 
 
-P-A-G-E-533
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN FRANCE 507 
dogma; on the other it gives first place among required subjects to 
moral and civic teaching. Religious instruction is the province of the 
family; moral instruction belongs to the school. 
Our legislators did not mean to pass an act that was purely negative. 
Doubtless their first object was to separate the school from the Church, 
to assure freedom of conscience to both teachers and pupils, in short, 
to distinguish between two domains too long confused; the domain of 
beliefs, which are personal, free, and variable; and that of knowledge, 
which, by universal consent, is common and indispensable to all. But 
there is something else in the law of March 28. It states the determina- 
tion of the people to found here at home a national education, and to 
found it on the idea of duty and of right, which the legislator does not 
hesitate to inscribe among the fundamental truths of which no one 
can be ignorant. 
It is on you, Sir, that the public has counted to realize this all- 
important part of education. While you are relieved from religious 
teaching, there never was a question of relieving you from moral teach- 
ing. That would have deprived you of the chief dignity of your pro- 
fession. On the contrary, it seemed quite natural that the master, 
while teaching the children to read and write, should also impart to 
them those simple rules of moral conduct which are not less universally 
accepted than the rules of language or of arithmetic.

  CHAPTER XXIV 
THE STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN 
ENGLAND 
     
        
   
                         
   
             
   
       Tue Readings in this chapter have been selected to illustrate the 
long struggle to create a national system of education in England. 
They cover the early beginnings, the period of the charitable- 
voluntary conception of education, the period of philanthropic 
effort to provide schools, and the long struggle to secure national 
support and national organization. 
The first selection (291) reproduces the testimony of a witness, 
called before one of the many parliamentary commissions of in- 
quiry, as to educational conditions among the poor of London, 
and the maintenance of a charity-school. It is typical of volumes 
of evidence collected in the course of a half-century by such means. 
The next (292) is a bookkeeping statement as to the early cost for 
a charity-school, and what was provided each pupil. vin 1780 
Sunday Schools were begun, as a means of helping solve the prob- 
lem of educating and bettering the condition of the children of 
the poor, and in selection 293 Robert Raikes tells of the begin- 
nings of the movement. Another form of charitable and philan- 
thropic effort was the Ragged School, and 294 gives the Constitu- 
tion and Rules for one of these, showing how they were organized 
and supported, for whom they were intended, and what they 
taught. 
At about the same time that the French Revolutionary theorists 
were stating their theories as to education being an affair of the 
State, Adam Smith’s celebrated book appeared, and selection 295 
gives his reasoning as to why general education becomes especially 
necessary as society becomes more highly organized. A little 
later Rev. T. R. Malthus added to the argument for national 
education (296) by pointing out the wastefulness of poor relief, 
and the advantages of teaching people to help themselves. 
The introduction of monitorial or mutual instruction, which wa: 
evolved near the beginning of the nineteenth century, gave a grea 
impetus to the development of schools by making education fo 
all for the first time seem possible. Selections 297 and 298 giv
-P-A-G-E-535
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 509 
good descriptions of the organization and instruction given in the 
monitorial schools organized and directed by Lancaster. 
In 1833 the first parliamentary grant for elementary education 
was made, and the conditions under which this was voted are 
described in 299. Now ensued a battle to extend the aid, and to 
enact a law organizing elementary education. This continued 
unsuccessfully until 1870. Selection 300 gives an extract from a 
speech of Lord Macaulay, declaring it the duty of the State to act 
in the matter. This speech is typical of many such made in both 
houses of Parliament. The evils of the existing conditions were 
pointed out in many official reports, of which 301, on the appren- 
ticing of the children of paupers, is given as an example. 
All these efforts met with much opposition, and selection 302 is 
introduced to show a typical conservative attitude. In 1858 a 
new Parliamentary Commission was appointed to review progress 
and to analyze needs, and a summary of the principles and recom- 
mendations of this body are given in 303. Finally the Education 
Act of 1870 was attained, the fundamental features of this being 
given in 304. It provided that children in the state schools need 
not attend religious instruction, and the same year another law 
(305) exempted students and candidates for degrees at the old 
English universities from similar requirements. Selection 306 is 
an excellent brief statement of the outstanding events in a century 
of English educational progress, and gives a good review of the 
efforts made to create a national system.

(Report from Select Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to inquire into the 
Education of the Lower Orders in the eer obs: Minutes of Evidence, u. Lon- 
don, 1816) 
This Commission was appointed, on motion of Henry Brougham 
later Lord Brougham), to take evidence as to educational condi- 
ions in London, Westminster, and Southwark, and to report to 
he House of Commons “what may be fit to be done with respect 
0 the children of Paupers.” The Commission found one hundred 
nd thirty thousand children without school accommodations, and 
commended that Parliament should take ‘“‘proper measures for 
pplying the deficiency of the means of Instruction’ which exist 
present, and for calendiay this blessing to the Poor of all de- 
riptions.”

The following evidence, given by the first witness examined, is 
both typical of the evidence and descriptive of the work and 
means of support of a charity-school. 
Monday, June 3rd, 1816. 
Henry Broucuam, Esq. in the Chair. 
Mr. Grorce GrirFitus called in, and examined. 
Where do you live? — Saint Katherine’s, near the Tower. 
Are you a schoolmaster in the neighbourhood? — Yes. 
Of what school? — Saint Katherine’s charity-school. 
Upon what foundation is that school? — It is supported by volun- 
tary contributions. 
Have you any other funds? — There is a fund established by the 
contributions, which is placed in the bank. 
To what does it amount? — The last purchase that was made has 
made it up to £1550. 
What is the amount of annual subscriptions? — It has varied very 
much within the last seven or eight years; it formerly used not to 
amount to more than sixty or seventy pounds, it has in the last six or 
seven years amounted to upwards of £100 by subscriptions and dona- 
tions. 
What is the whole amount of the yearly income? — I am not pre- 
pared to state that exactly. 
Is it £200? — Yes, it must be that, because our expenses amount to 
that. 
How many children are educated there? — Fifty. 
Boys and girls? — Yes. 
What are they taught? — Reading, writing, and arithmetic, and 
clothed. 
What is the master’s salary? — The master and mistress, £60 a year} 
between them. 
Are there any other salaries than the master’s and mistress’s? 
Nothing more than a trifling salary, for teaching psalmody, of fou 
guineas a year. 
Have the master and the mistress any perquisite? — None. 
A house? — A house to live in, and coal, but no candle. 
Are there ever fewer children than fifty? — No. 
How long have you been master? — About eight years. 
How many were there when you came? — Fifty. 
Have there never been fewer, at any one time of the year, since th| 
time you have been there? — There may have been so for a month 
six weeks; the committee meet the first Tuesday in every month, and 
there is a vacancy they admit whatever child is next in rotation to co: 
in.    
   
    
         
      
     
      
-P-A-G-E-537
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 511 
How long has the school been established? — Since the year 1707. 
Had it never any more property, besides the money in the funds? — 
The chapter of Saint Katherine’s has made it a present, at several 
times, of the leases of three houses towards its support. 
Have they that leasehold property at present? — They have. 
At what are the houses underlet? — Sixty pounds a year, the three. 
Then the school has this £60 a year in addition to the interest of 
£1550 in the funds, and £100 a year subscriptions? — The increase of 
stock has doubled since I have been schoolmaster, owing to a lady who 
died and left us £500. 
In what stock is it? — Navy 5 per cents. 
Then instead of nearly £200, it appears the income of the school is 
above £250 a year? —I was not aware of any question of the kind 
being asked, or I would have been prepared to answer it. 
Is there any other property whatever belonging to the establish- 
ment? — None. 
How are the children clothed? — ‘They are completely clothed at 
Midsummer, and extra shoes, stockings, and linen, at Christmas. 
Any other salary paid, besides the master and mistress’s ? — None. 
Do the premises belong to the institution? — During the lease; the 
schoolhouse is a gift of the chapter of Saint Katherine’s, during their 
pleasure, for which no rent is paid; there is a ground-rent paid for the 
other property. 
Are there any occasional contributions and donations, besides the 
annual subscriptions? — I include those in the annual subscriptions. 
Any charity sermons? — Yes, we have about one a year. 
Is that included in the former account of £100? — No, that is not, 
so that the produce of this is to be added to the former sum. 
What are the hours of teaching? — From nine to twelve, and from 
two to five; six hours a day. 
Have you any other occupation than schoolmaster? — I am parish 
clerk. 
Any other occupation? — As parish clerk, I do a little business in 
the undertaking line, which I employ other people to do. 
Any other? — I do make a trifle as a musician; I am chorus singer to 
his Majesty’s ancient concert of music in Hanover-square. 
Have you any other employment? — No. 
Do you teach any other scholars besides those in the school? — I am 
allowed to take a few, as they offer, such as sixpenny scholars per week; 
and very often I give several children their education, without charg- 
ing them any thing. 
Do the fifty children upon the foundation pay any thing? — Nothing. 
Are they in general children of very poor people? — In general very 
oor. 
Are there many poor children in the neighbourhood in which you    
     
          
   
    
     
    
      
    
    
     
-P-A-G-E-538
  512 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
reside, destitute of instruction? — The generality of the children are 
poor people’s children; the neighbourhood is a very poor neighbour- 
hood. 
Have those children the means of instruction? — Not till they 
are placed in our establishment, or other establishments in the neigh- 
bourhood.     
   
    
      
      
      
    Is there any indisposition among the lower orders to send their chil- 
dren to those schools? — None; the parents are very anxious to get 
their children on the establishment. 
In all those schools do they clothe? — In all the schools I have men- 
tioned. 
They do not board them? — No. 
292. Cost of and Support of Charity-Schools 
(Allen, W. O. B., and McClure, Edm., History of the Society for Promoting 
Christian Knowledge, pp. 140-42. London, 1898) 
In their history of two hundred years’ work of the S.P.C.K., 
the two secretaries of the Society give the following statement as 
to the cost for clothing and education, in 1710, and the means 
whereby the schools were provided. They say: 
In 1704 the ordinary charge in London of a “School for 50 Boys 
Cloathed comes to about £75 p. Ann., for which a School-Room, 
Books, and Firing are provided, a Master paid, and to each Boy is 
given yearly, 3 Bands, 1 Cap, 1 Coat, 1 pair of Stockings and 1 pair of 
Shooes.” A girls’ school of the same size then cost £60 per annum, 
which paid for the room, books, firing, and mistress, and provided for 
each girl, “2 Coyfs, 2 Bands, 1 Gown and Petticoat, 1 Pair of knit 
Gloves, 1 pair of Stockings, and 2 pair of Shooes.” 
Jn 1706 the cost of “cloathing a Poor Boy ” was stated to be gs. 
9 1/2d. and of a girl ros. 7d. This had increased in 1710, and the 
following detailed statement may be of interest:

This zeal for the education of the children of the poor was widely 
spread, and some of the earliest parochial and ward schools arose under 
the auspices of our Society. A yearly account of all the charity-schools 
was printed and published, as an appendix to the sermon preached on 
the anniversary service attended by the charity children. Even in 
small villages where it was impossible to collect sufficient money to 
start a charity-school, a plan was proposed and adopted for opening day 
schools. Some discreet and sober person was to be pitched upon in 
each parish, and to be paid by results. So soon as the child could name 
and distinguish all the letters in the alphabet, the teacher was to receive 
2s. 6d. “A like payment was to be made when the child could spell 
well; and 5s. more when such child could read well and distinctly, and 
say the Church Catechism. By which means Poor Children may be 
taught to read for Ten shillings; and the additional Charge for Books 
will be very inconsiderable.” 
The clergy were specially noted for their zeal in this good work. In 
some places they taught the children gratis. In others persons were 
made parish clerks, on condition they would teach a certain number of 
children gratis. At Warwick a charity box, set up in the church, with 
this inscription, ‘For the use and increase of the Charity-School,” had so 
good an effect that several children were taught and clothed by what 
was put in it. In some places effigies or statues of charity children 
were placed at the church or school doors, with a poor’s box near them, 
and suitable texts of Scripture, to excite the alms of veople resorting 
thither. 
In another place (Ewhurst in Surrey), where the minister of the 
parish was at the whole expense of educating the children, he “had 
provided two palls, the one of which is let out for 2s. 6d. and the other 
for 1s. a time, for the more decent funerals of the dead; and the money 
so arising bears a good part of the charge of teaching the poor children 
there.” In a few cases the parents contributed something. In the 
account for 1717, “At Winleton in the County of Durham, the work- 
men of an iron-work, who are about 400 or 500, allow one farthing and 
a half per shilling, per week, which together with their master’s con- 
tribution, maintains their poor, and affords about £17 per annum for 
teaching their children to read, etc.”

(Gentleman’s Magazine, June, 1784; Gloucester Journal, May 24, 1784) 
The following letter, written by Robert Raikes to Colonel 
Townley, of Sheffield, describes the origin and work of the Glou- 
cester Sunday Schools, under the direction of Raikes. 
     
    
                                   
    
    
       
    
    
   
   Gloucester, November 25th, 1783. 
Str, — My friend, the Mayor (Mr. Colborne) has just communicated 
to me the letter which you have honoured him with, enquiring into 
the nature of Sunday Schools. The beginning of this scheme was en- 
tirely owing to accident. Some business leading me one morning into 
the suburbs of the city, where the lowest of the people (who are prin- 
cipally employed in the pin manufactory) chiefly reside, I was struck 
with concern at seeing a group of children, wretchedly ragged, at play 
in the streets. J asked an inhabitant whether those children belonged 
to that part of town, and lamented their misery and idleness. ‘‘Ah! 
sir,” said the woman to whom I was speaking, “‘could you take a view 
of this part of the town on a Sunday, you would be shocked indeed; for 
then the street is filled with multitudes of these wretches, who, released 
on that day from employment, spend their time in noise and riot, play- 
ing at ‘chuck,’ and cursing and swearing in a manner so horrid as to 
convey to any serious mind an idea of hell rather than any other place. 
We have a worthy clergyman (said she), curate of our parish, who has 
put some of them to school; but on the Sabbath day they are all given 
up to follow their own inclinations without restraint, as their parents, 
totally abandoned themselves, have no idea of instilling into the minds 
of their children principles to which they themselves are entire stran- 
gers.” 
This conversation suggested to me that it would be at least a harm- 
less attempt, if it were productive of no good, should some little plan 
be formed to check the deplorable profanation of the Sabbath. I then 
enquired of the woman, if there were any decent well-disposed women 
in the neighbourhood who kept schools for teaching to read. I presently 
was directed to four: to these I applied, and made an agreement with 
them to receive as many children as I should send upon the Sunday, 
whom they were to instruct in reading and in the Church Catechism. 
For this I engaged to pay them each a shilling for their day’s employ- 
ment. The women seemed pleased with the proposal. I then waited 
on the clergyman before mentioned, and imparted to him my plan; he| 
was so much satisfied with the idea, that he engaged to lend his assist- 
ance, by going round to the schools on a Sunday afternoon, to examin 
the progress that was made, and to enforce order and decorum amon, 
such a set of little heathens. 
This, sir, was the commencement of the plan. It is now abou

  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 515    
     
                                                      
   
   
     
     
    
      
     three years since we began, and I could wish you were here to make 
enquiry into the effect. A woman who lives in a lane where I had 
fixed a school told me, some time ago, that the place was quite a heaven 
on Sundays, compared to what it used to be. The numbers who have 
learned to read and say their Catechism are so great that I am aston- 
ished at it. Upon the Sunday afternoon the mistresses take their 
scholars to church, a place into which neither they nor their ancestors 
had ever before entered, with a view to the glory of God. But what is 
yet more extraordinary, within this month these little ragamuffins have 
in great numbers taken it into their heads to frequent the early morn- 
ing prayers, which are held every morning at the Cathedral at seven 
o’clock. I believe there were nearly fifty this morning. They assemble 
at the house of one of the mistresses, and walk before her to church, 
two and two, in as much order as a company of soldiers. I am gener- 
ally at church, and after service they all come around me to make their 
bow; and, if any animosities have arisen, to make their complaints. 
The great principle I inculcate is, to be kind and good natured to each 
other; not to provoke one another; to be dutiful to their parents; not to 
offend God by cursing and swearing; and such little plain precepts as 
all may comprehend. As my profession is that of a printer, I have 
printed a little book, which I gave amongst them; and some friends of 
mine, subscribers to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 
sometimes make me a present of a parcel of Bibles, Testaments, &c., 
which I distribute as rewards to the deserving. The success that has 
attended this scheme has induced one or two of my friends to adopt the 
plan, and set up Sunday Schools in other parts of the city, and now a 
whole parish has taken up the object; so that I flatter myself in time 
the good effects will appear so conspicuous as to become generally 
adopted. The number of children at present thus engaged on the Sab- 
bath are between two and three hundred, and they are increasing 
every week, as the benefit is universally seen. I have endeavoured to 
engage the clergy of my acquaintance that reside in their parishes; 
one has entered into the scheme with great fervour, and it was in order 
to excite others to follow the example that I inserted in my paper the 
paragraph which I suppose you saw copied into the London papers. 
. .. With regard to the rules adopted, I only require that they may 
come to the school on Sunday as clean as possible. Many were at first 
eterred because they wanted decent clothing, but I could not under- 
ake to supply this defect. I argue, therefore, if you can loiter about 
without shoes, and in a ragged coat, you may as well come to school 
nd learn what may tend to your good in that garb. I reject none on 
hat footing. All that I require are clean hands, clean face, and 
heir hair combed; if you have no clean shirt, come in what you have 
n. 
The want of decent apparel at first kept great numbers at a distance,

but they now begin to grow wiser, and all pressing to learn. Ihave had 
the good luck to procure places for some that were deserving, which has 
been of great use. You will understand that these children are from 
six years old to twelve or fourteen. Boys and girls above this age, who 
have been totally undisciplined, are generally too refractory for this 
government. A reformation in society seems to me to be only practi- 
cable by establishing notions of duty, and practical habits of order and 
decorum, at an early age... . 
I have the honour to be, Sir, yours, &c.,     
     
   
    
                   
     
          
   
      
    R. Rarxes. 
In his Gloucester Journal for May 24, 1784, Raikes printed the 
following item regarding the good effects of the schools in Glouces- 
ter, and of their establishment elsewhere. 
The good effects of Sunday Schools established in this city are in- 
stanced in the account given by the principal persons in the pin and 
sack manufactories, wherein great reformation has taken place among 
the multitudes whom they employ. From being idle, ungovernable, 
profligate, and filthy in the extreme, they say the boys and girls are 
become not only cleanly and decent in their appearance, but are greatly 
humanized in their manners — more orderly, tractable, and attentive 
to business, and, of course, more serviceable than they ever expected to 
find them. The cursing and swearing and other vile expressions, which 
used to form the sum of their conversation, are now rarely heard among 
them. 
Such, we are well assured, is the fact. The London Chronicle of 
Tuesday last mentions that the plan of Sunday Schools is taken up with 
such general concurrence in Leeds and Yorkshire that the spirited in- 
habitants of that place have them in all quarters of their populous 
town, and have already admitted near 2000 poor children!

   295. Adam Smith on the Instruction of the Common People 
(Smith, Adam, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, book 
v, chap. 1, part 11, art 1. [1776.] Reprint of second edition; Edited by Rogers, 
Oxford, 1880) 
In 1776 there was published one of those epoch-making books 
which from time to time appear to mould human thinking anew. 
The author, Adam Smith, was a Scotchman by birth who had 
studied at Glasgow and Oxford. It was a 
long and rather exhaustive treatment as 
to what constitutes the real wealth of na- 
tions, and, among other things, he included 
two chapters on the ‘‘ Expense of the Insti- 
tutions for Education.”’ From one of these 
chapters the following selection, relating to 
state support of elementary education, has 
been taken. 
Ought the public, therefore, to give no atten- 
tion, it may be asked, to the education of the 
people? Or if it ought to give any, what are 
the different parts of education which it ought 
to attend to in the different orders of the 
people? and in what manner ought it to attend to them? 
In some cases the state of the society necessarily places the greater 
part of individuals in such situations as naturally form in them, with- 
out any attention of government, almost all the abilities and virtues 
which that state requires, or perhaps can admit of. In other cases 
the state of the society does not place the greater part of individuals in 
such situations, and some attention of government is necessary in or- 
der to prevent the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great 
body of the people. 
In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far 
greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of 
the people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations; fre- 
quently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of 
men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man 
whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of

   which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the 
same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his in- 
vention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never 
occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and 
generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human 
creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only in- 
capable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but 
of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and conse- 
quently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the 
ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and extensive interests of 
his country, he is altogether incapable of judging. .. . 
The education of the common people requires perhaps, in a civilized 
and commercial society, the attention of the public more than that of 
people of some rank and fortune. People of some rank and fortune are 
generally eighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that 
particular business, profession, or trade, by which they propose to dis- 
tinguish themselves in the world. ‘They have before that full time to 
acquire, or at least to fit themselves for afterwards acquiring, every ac- 
complishment which can recommend them to the public esteem, or 
render them worthy of it. Their parents or guardians are generally 
sufficiently anxious that they should be so accomplished, and are, in 
most cases, willing enough to lay out the expense which is necessary for 
that purpose. If they are not always properly educated, it is seldom 
from want of expense laid out upon their education; but froni the im- 
proper application of that expense. . . . 
It is otherwise with the common people. They have little time to 
spare for education. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them 
even in infancy. As soon as they are able to work, they must apply to 
some trade by which they can earn their subsistence. That trade, too, 
is generally so simple and uniform as to give little exercise to the under- 
standing; while, at the same time, their labour is both so constant and 
so severe, that it leaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply 
to, or even think of anything else. 
But though the common people cannot, in any civilised society, be 
so well instructed as people of some rank and fortune, the most essen- 
tial parts of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be 
acquired at so early a period of life, that the greater part even of those 
who are to be bred to the lowest occupations have time to acquire them 
before they can be employed in those occupations. For a very small 
xpense the public can facilitate, can encourage, and can even impose 
pon almost all the whole body of the people, the necessity of acquiring 
hose most essential parts of education. 
The public can facilitate this acquisition by establishing in every 
arish or district a little school, where children may be taught for a 
eward so moderate, that even a common labourer may afford it; the

       master being partly, but not wholly paid by the public; because if he 
was wholly, or even principally paid by it, he would soon learn to neg- 
lect his business. In Scotland the establishment of such parish schools 
has taught almost the whole common people to read, and a very great 
proportion of them to write and account. In England the establish- 
ment of charity-schools has had an effect of the same kind, though not 
so universally, because the establishment is not so universal. If in 
those little schools the books, by which the children are taught to read, 
were a little more instructive than they generally are, and if, instead of 
a little smattering of Latin, which the children of the common people 
are sometimes taught there, and which can scarce ever be of any use to 
them, they were instructed in the elementary parts of geometry and 
mechanics, the literary education of this rank of people would perhaps 
be as complete as it can be. There is scarce a common trade which 
does not afford some opportunities of applying to it the principles of 
geometry and mechanics, and which would not therefore gradually ex- 
ercise and improve the common people in those principles, the neces- 
sary introduction to the most sublime as well as the most useful 
sciences. 
The public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential 
parts of education by giving small premiums, and little badges of 
distinction, to the children of the common people who excel in 
them. — 
The public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the 
necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education, by oblig- 
ing every man to undergo an examination or probation in them before 
he can obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to be set 
up in any trade either in a village or town corporate. 
... Though the state was to derive no advantage from the instruc- 
tion of the inferior ranks of people, it would still deserve its attention 
that they should not be altogether uninstructed. The state, however, 
derives no inconsiderable advantage from their instruction. The more 
they are instructed, the less liable they are to the delusions of enthusi- 
asm and superstition, which, among ignorant nations, frequently occa- 
sion the most dreadful disorders. An instructed and intelligent people 
besides are always more decent and orderly than an ignorant and stupid 
one. They feel themselves, each individually, more respectable, and 
more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful superiors, and they are 
therefore more disposed to respect those superiors. They are more} 
disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing through, the interested] 
complaints of faction and sedition, and they are, upon that account, 
less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to th 
measures of government. In free countries, where the safety of govern. 
ment depends very much upon the favourable judgment which th

concerning it. 
296. Malthus on National Education 
Malthus, Rev. T. R., An Essay on the Principles of Population, book tv, chap. rx. 
[r798.] Reprint of the sixth edition, London, 1890) 
The Essay by Malthus, a work of over six hundred octavo 
pages, which appeared in 1798, was another of the great books of 
all time. The ideas it contained underlay some of the work of 
Darwin more than a half-century later. On the question of poor 
relief and education he wrote: 
We have lavished immense sums on the poor, which we have every 
reason to think have constantly tended to aggravate their misery. But 
in their education and in the circulation of 
those important political truths that most (b> 
nearly concern them, which are perhaps the Fe i‘ 
only means in our power of really raising Ti 
their condition, and of making them happier 
men and more peaceable subjects, we have 
been miserably deficient. It is surely a great 
national disgrace, that the education of the 
lower classes of people in England should be 
left merely to a few Sunday Schools, sup- 
ported by a subscription from individuals, 
who can give to the course of instruction in ‘ ) 
them any kind of bias which they please. HN ‘ my 
And even the improvement of Sunday Schools a meee 
(for, objectionable as they are in some points a [0 nae Rae oN 
of view, and imperfect in all, I cannot but con- (1766-1834) 
sider as an improvement) is of very late date. 
The arguments which have been urged against instructing the people 
appear to me to be not only illiberal, but to the last degree feeble; and 
they ought, on the contrary, to be extremely forcible, and to be sup- 
ported by the most obvious and striking necessity, to warrant us in 
withholding the means of raising the condition of the lower classes of 
people, when they are in our power. Those who will not listen to any 
lanswer to these arguments drawn from theory, cannot, I think, refuse 
the testimony of experience; and I would ask, whether the advantage 
f superior instruction which the lower classes of people in Scotland 
te known to possess, has appeared to have any tendency toward creat- 
ng a spirit of tumult and discontent amongst them. . . . The quiet and 
eaceable habits of the instructed Scotch peasant, compared with the

       turbulent disposition of the ignorant Irishman, ought not to be without 
effect upon every impartial reasoner. 
The principal argument which I have heard advanced against a 
system of national education in England is, that the common people 
would be put in a capacity to read such works as those of Paine, and 
that the consequences would probably be fatal to government. But on 
this subject I agree most cordially with Adam Smith in thinking, that 
an instructed and well-informed people would be much less likely to be 
led away by inflammatory writings, and much better able to detect the 
false declamation of interested and ambitious demagogues, than an 
ignorant people. One or two readers in a parish are sufficient to circu- 
late any quantity of sedition; and if these be gained to the democratic 
side, they will probably have the power of doing much more mischief, 
by selecting the passages best suited to their hearers, and choosing the 
moments when their oratory is likely to have the most effect, than if 
each individual in the parish had been in a capacity to read and judge 
of the whole work himself; and at the same time to read and judge 
of the opposing arguments, which we may suppose would also reach him. 
But in addition to this, a double weight would undoubtedly be 
added to the observation of Adam Smith, if these schools were made 
the means of instructing the people in the real nature of their situation; 
if they were taught, what is really true, that without an increase of 
their own industry and prudence no change of government could essen- 
tially better their condition; that, though they might get rid of some 
particular grievance, yet in the great point of supporting their families 
they would be but little, or perhaps not at all benefited; that a revolu- 
tion would not alter in their favour the proportion of the supply of 
labour to the demand, or the quantity of food to the number of the con- 
sumers; and that if the supply ot labour were greater than the demand, 
and the demand for food greater than the supply, they might suffer the 
utmost severity of want, under the freest, the most perfect, and best 
executed government, that the human imagination could conceive. 
A knowledge of these truths so obviously tends to promote peace and 
quietness, to weaken the effect of inflammatory writings and to prevent 
all unreasonable and ill-directed opposition to the constituted author- 
ities, that those who would still object to the instruction of the peopl 
may be fairly suspected of a wish to encourage their ignorance, as 
pretext for tyranny, and an opportunity of increasing the power an 
the influence of the executive government.

the kind of work done in the monitorial schools. The monitorial 
system was both improved in organization and extended in scope 
after its introduction into the United States. 
The first or lower class of children are taught to write the printed 
alphabet, and to name the letters when they see them. The same with 
the figures used in arithmetic. One day the boy traces the form of a 
letter, or figure; the next he tells the name, when he sees the letter. 
These two methods assist each other. When he is required to write 
H, for example, the shape of the letter which he saw yesterday assists 
his manual execution — when he is required to say how that letter is 
named, the shape of the letter reminds him of his manual execution; 
and the manual execution has associated itself with the name. In the 
same manner he learns syllables and words; writing them one day — 
reading them the next. The same process for writing the common 
epistolary character, and for reading it. 
(A) This progress made, the class go up to the master to read — 
a class consisting perhaps of 30. While one boy is reading, the word, 
e.g. Ab-so-lu-ti-on, is given out with a loud voice by the monitor, and 
written down by all the other 29 boys, who are provided with slates 
for the purpose; which writing is looked over by monitors, and then 
another word called, and so on; whoever writes a word, spells it of 
course at the same time, and spells it with much more attention than 
in the common way. So that there is always one boy reading, and 
twenty-nine writing and spelling at the same time; whereas, in the 
ancient method, the other twenty-nine did nothing. 
(B) The first and second classes write in sand; the middle classes on 
slates; only a few of the upper boys on paper with ink. This is a great

aving point of expense, — in books the saving is still greater. Twenty 
r thirty boys stand around a card suspended on.a nail, making a semi- 
ircle. On this card are printed the letters in very large characters; —
-P-A-G-E-550
    524 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
these letters the boys are to name, at the request of the monitor. 
When one spelling class have said their lessons in this manner, they 
are despatched off to some other occupation, and another spelling class 
succeeds. In this way one book or card may serve for two hundred 
boys, who would, according to the common method, have had a book 
each. In the same manner, syllables and reading lessons are printed 
on cards and used with the same beneficial economy. 
(C) In arithmetic, the monitor dictates a sum, ex. gr. in addition, 
which all the boys write down on their slates, for example,

   He then tells them, aloud, how to add the sum. First column — 6 and 
8 are 14, and 4 are 18; set down 8 and carry 1 to the next column; and 
soon. In this manner, the class acquire facility of writing figures, and 
placing them; and, by practicing what the monitor dictates, insensibly 
acquire facility in adding. Again they are placed around arithmetical 
cards, in the same manner as in paragraph (B), and required to add up 
the columns. This method evinces what progress they have made 
from the preceding method of dictating; and the two methods are 
always used alternately. 
It is obvious that a school like this of Mr. Lancaster’s, consisting of 
from 700 to 800 boys, would soon fall into decay, without very close 
attention to order and method. | In this part of his system, Mr. Lan- 
caster has been as eminently successful as in any other; contriving to 
make the method and arrangement, so necessary to his institution, a 
source of amusement to the children. In coming into school, in going 
out, and in moving in their classes from one part of the school to an- 
other, the children move in a kind of a measured pace, and in known 
places, according to their number, of which every boy has one. Upon 
the first institution of the school, there was great loss and confusion of| 
hats. After every boy has taken his place there, they all stand up 
expecting the word of command, “Sling your hats!” upon which they, 
immediately suspend their hats round their necks by a string provided 
for that purpose. When the young children write in sand, they all 
look attentively to their monitor, waiting for the word, and instantly| 
fall to work, with military precision, upon receiving it. All these littl 
inventions keep children in a constant state of activity, prevent th 
listlessness so observable in all other institutions for education, an 
evince (trifling as they appear to be) a very original and observin; 
mind in him who invented them. 
The boys assembled round their reading or arithmetical cards tak 
places as in common schools. The boy who is at the head of the clas} 
wears a ticket, with some suitable inscription, and has a prize of a littl
-P-A-G-E-551
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 525 
picture. The ticket-bearer yields his badge of honour to whoever can 
excel him; and the desire of obtaining and the fear of losing the mark of 
distinction, create, as may easily be conceived, no common degree of 
enterprize and exertion. Boys have a prize when they are moved from 
one class to another, as the monitor has also from whose class they are 
removed. Mr. Lancaster has established a sort of paper currency of 
tickets. These tickets are given for merit — two tickets are worth a 
paper kite; three worth a ball; four worth a wooden horse, etc. 
It is no unusual thing for me to deliver one or two hundred prizes 
at the same time. And at such times the countenances of the whole 
school exhibit a most pleasing scene of delight; as the boys who obtain 
prizes commonly walk around the school in procession, holding the 
prizes in their hands, with a herald proclaiming before them, “These 
good boys have obtained prizes for going into another class.” The 
honour of this has an effect as powerful, if not more so, than the prizes 
themselves. 
A large collection of toys, bats, balls, pictures, kites, is suspended 
above the master’s head beaming glory and pleasure upon the school 
beneath. Mr. Lancaster has also, as another incentive, an order of 
merit. No boys are admitted to this order but those who distinguish 
themselves by attention to their studies, and by their endeavours to 
check vice. The distinguishing badge is a silver medal and plated 
chain hanging from the neck. The superior class has a fixed place in 
the school; any class that can excel it may eject them from this place 
and occupy it themselves. Every member, both of the attacking and 
defending classes, feels of course the most lively interest in the issue of 
the contest. 
Mr. Lancaster punishes by shame rather than pain; varying the 
means of exciting shame, because as he justly observes, any mode of 
punishment long continued loses its effect. 
The boys in the school appointed to teach others are called monitors; 
they are in the proportion of about one monitor to ten boys. So that, 
for the whole school of one thousand boys, there is only one master; 
the rest of the teaching is all done by the boys themselves. Besides 
the teaching monitors, there are general monitors, such as, inspectors of 
slates, inspectors of absentees, etc.

The following description is taken from an article in an issue of

     One of the peculiar features of this plan is the extraordinary 
manner in which the talents of boys are drawn forth, and many in- 
stances may be given, where young lads, acting upon this system, have 
evinced energies which are rarely to be met with in mature age. In the 
Royal Free School, at the Borough Road, a little boy of twelve or thir- 
teen years of age often commands the whole school, and that with the 
same ease to himself, and with equal obedience from the many hundred 
children of which the school is composed, as a military officer would 
experience with a body of well-disciplined troops; the firmness, prompt- 
ness and decision attendant on military order are interwoven into the 
school discipline, but without the least severity; a constant activity is 
maintained, by which the minds of the children are amused; they ac- 
quire the more important habit of fixing their attention; their duties 
are made a pleasure, and their progress in learning is proportionally 
rapid. 
In Shropshire and Staffordshire in the space of only eight months a 
boy scarcely seventeen has lately organized schools and instructed 
schoolmasters for above one thousand children; the affectionate and 
mild but firm conduct of this amiable lad rendered each school a scene 
of pleasure and delight, in which his steady application of the system 
of order proved its utility and excellence. When he took leave of one 
school, in order to open another at a different place, it was a most de- 
lightful sight to behold the whole school of children lamenting his de- 
parture, as they would the loss of their nearest friend. He introduced 
the system so completely into one school that the children required 
very little attention to execute the plan, and thereby teach themselves; 
to a person not an eye-witness it would scarcely seem credible, but it is 
a fact, that the master, who was a shoe-maker, would sit at the head of 
the school with his last and leather, and alternately work and overlook 
the tuition of the school; he had no occasion to exert himself to pre- 
vent confusion, for the order of the system was so far introduced into 
the habits of the children, that they would themselves be the first to 
correct the smallest disorderly movement; the success of this boy’s 
labour was so great in one instance as to induce a countryman to go to 
the clergyman of the parish, who was the patron of the school, to com- 
plain that his children learned so much and so fast that, as he did not 
get on at such a rate when he was a child at school, he thought witch- 
craft alone could produce such an effect upon his children. The 
vorthy clergyman, though scarcely able to refrain from laughter, was 
liged to put on a grave countenance, and assure his parishioner that} 
neither magic, incantation, nor witchcraft had anything to do in the] 
business. 
There are other young men who, before they were eighteen year: 
of age, have organized schools for more than two thousand chil

    From 1807 to 1833 was a period of investigation and discussion 
as to the need for state aid for elementary education, and the year 
1833, when the first grant of parliamentary funds to help build 
schoolhouses was made, is a dividing point between the old condi- 
tion of affairs and the new. This grant of aid, small as it was, 
formed a precedent from which the House of Commons has never 
turned back. The following description of the passage of the Act 
making the grant reveals something of the attitude of many Eng- 
lishmen toward the question of public education. 
On Saturday, August 17th, 1833, in a very empty House of Com- 
mons, a vote of £20,000 for the purposes of education was passed after 
a hot debate by 50 votes to 26 votes. Mr. T. B. Macaulay voted with 
the majority in favour of the grant. Lord Althorp explained that the 
object of the grant was to build schools where there already existed the 
means of carrying on such schools. In the debate Lord John Russell 
pointed out, in answer to a complaint that no ground for the experi- 
ment had been shown, that in the Report of the Education Com- 
mittee in 1818 there were cases referred to of parishes which, if they 
could have been assisted in the first outlay, would afterwards have sup- 
ported their own schools. This was still the case in 1833, and justified 
a vote for building grants. Mr. William Cobbett, the Member for 
Oldham, opposed the grant on the ground that education was not im- 
proving the condition of the country. In the country districts, he said, 
the father was a better man and a better labourer than his son. Re- 
ports on the table of the House proved, he declared, that men became 
more and more immoral every year. Then what had become of the 
benefits of education? Education had been more and more spread; 
but to what did it all tend?  ‘‘Nothing but to increase the number of 
schoolmasters and schoolmistresses — that new race of idlers. Crime, 
too, went on increasing. If so, what reason was there to tax the people 
for the increase of education? It was nothing but an attempt to force 
education — it was a French — it was a Doctrinaire — plan, and he 
should always be opposed to it.” It is difficult to realize that Mr. Cob- 
bett — a praiser of times past, a hater of State intervention, a despiser 
of French philosophy — was the advanced reformer of his day. One 
does not usually couple such opinions with the conceptions of reform. 
Mr. Joseph Hume opposed the grant on the somewhat reasonable 
ground that it was too small to constitute a national system, and with- 
ut such a system there was no justification for the grant. In the divi- 
ion on the grant he acted as one of the tellers for the Noes. The form

of vote was as follows: “That a Sum, not exceeding Twenty thousand 
pounds, be granted to His Majesty, to be issued in aid of Private Sub- 
scriptions for the Erection of School Houses, for the Education of the 
Children of the Poorer Classes in Great Britain, to the 31st day of March 
1834; and that the said sum be issued and paid without any fee or other 
deduction whatsoever.” The vote of £20,000 appears in the Revenue 
Act, 1833, as a grant for the erection of school houses in Great Britain.     
     
   
                                                    
    
    
    300. Lord Macaulay on the Duty of the State to provide Education 
(Extract from an Address in the House of Commons, in 1847. Reported in 
Barnard’s National Education in Europe, p. 747. Hartford, 1854) 
Among the early champions of a general state system of educa- 
tion for the masses was Thomas Babington Macaulay. In de- 
fending the minutes of the Committee of Council on Education 
relative to nationalizing education, he said, in part: 
Thold that it is the right and duty of the State to provide for the edu- 
cation of the common people. I conceive the arguments by which this 
position may be proved are perfectly simple, perfectly obvious, and the 
most cogent possible. . . . All are agreed that it is the sacred duty of 
| every government to take effectual measures 
for securing the persons and property of the 
community; and that the government which 
neglects that duty is unfit for its situation. 
This being once admitted, I ask, can it be 
denied that the education of the common 
people is the most effectual means of protect- 
ing persons and property? On that subject 
I can not refer to higher authority, or use 
more strong terms, than have been employed 
by Adam Smith; and I take his authority the 
more readily, because he is not very friendly 
to State interference; and almost on the same 
page as that I refer to, he declares that 
the State ought not to meddle with the edu- 
Fic. 78. cation of the higher orders; but he distinctly 
Lorp T. B. Macautay says that there is a difference, particularly 
(1800-59) in a highly civilized and commercial com- 
munity, between the education of the higher 
classes and the education of the poor. The education of the poor he 
pronounces to be a matter in which government is most deeply con- 
cerned; and he compares ignorance, spread through the lower classes, 
neglected by the State, to a leprosy, or some other fearful disease, and] 
says that where this duty is neglected, the State is in danger of fallin; 
into the terrible disorder. He had scarcely written this than the axio! 
 
-P-A-G-E-555

was fearfully illustrated in the riots of 1780. I do not know if from all 
history I could select a stronger instance of my position, when I say 
that ignorance makes the persons and property of the community un- 
safe, and that the government is bound to take measures to prevent 
that ignorance. On that occasion, what was the state of things? With- 
‘out any shadow of a grievance, at the summons of a madman, 100,000 
men rising in insurrection —a week of anarchy — Parliament be- 
sieged — your predecessor, sir, trembling in the Chair — the Lords 
pulled out of their coaches — the Bishops flying over the tiles — not a 
sight, I trust, that would be pleasurable to those who are now so un- 
favorable to the Church of England — thirty-six fires blazing at once 
in London — the house of the Chief Justice sacked — the children of 
the Prime Minister taken out of their beds in their night clothes, and 
laid on the table of the horse guards — and all this the effect of nothing 
but the gross, brutish ignorance of the population, who had been left 
brutes in the midst of Christianity, savages in the midst of civiliza- 
tion... . Could it have been supposed that all this could have taken 
place in a community were even the common laborer to have his mind 
opened by education, and be taught to find his pleasure in the exercise 
of his intellect, taught to revere his maker, taught to regard his fellow- 
creatures with kindness, and taught likewise to feel respect for legiti- 
mate authority, taught how to pursue redress of real wrongs by con- 
stitutional methods? 
... Take away education, and what are your means? Military 
force, prisons, solitary cells, penal colonies, gibbets — all the other 
apparatus of penal laws. If, then, there be an end to which govern- 
ment is bound to attain — if there are two ways only of attaining it — 
if one of those ways is by elevating the moral and intellectual charac- 
ter of the people, and if the other way is by inflicting pain, who can 
doubt which way every government ought to take? It seems to me 
that no proposition can be more strange than this — that the State 
ought to have power to punish and is bound to punish its subjects for 
not knowing their duty, but at the same time is to take no step to let 
them know what their duty is. 
301. Evils of apprenticing the Children of Paupers 
(Report of the Reverend H. Mosely, Inspector, to the Committee of Council on 
Education for England. In a Report on Kneeler Hall Training School, 1851) 
Kneeler Hall Training School, twelve miles from London, was 
established. in 1846 to train teachers for service in workhouse and 
penal schools, and was under the direct control of the Committee 
of Council on Education. The Report of the Poor-Law Board for 
1850 showed that there were, on January 1, 1851, 43,138 children 
in the workhouses of England and Wales, and 838 teachers em-
-P-A-G-E-556
re er Te nC ty ee nn en ere

ployed in their instruction. This was about one child in eight for 
whom poor-relief was being extended, and for whom the State 
stood more or less in loco parentis. For these children, the Report 
held, ‘‘every dictate of humanity and wise economy demands that 
the State should make immediate and thorough provision in . 
schools and teachers of the right kind.” 
Of the system of apprenticing the children of paupers, Mr. 
Mosely wrote : 
The system of education under the old poor law was that of parish 
apprenticeship. Pauper children were bound apprentices to such per- 
sons as were supposed capable of instructing them in some useful call- 
ing. In some cases this was by compulsion, the apprentices being 
assigned to different rate-payers, who render themselves liable to fines 
if they refuse to receive them, which fines sometimes went to the rates, 
and in other cases were paid as premiums to persons who afterward 
took these apprentices. Another method of apprenticeship was by 
premiums paid from the rates to masters who, in consideration of such 
premiums, were contented to take pauper children as apprentices. 
The evils of this system were manifold: — 
ist. As it regarded the independent laborer, whom, by its competi- 
tion, it prevented ‘“‘from getting his children out, except by making 
them parish paupers, he having no means of offering the advantages 
given by the parish,” and in whom it discouraged that which in a parent 
is the strongest motive to self-denial, forethought, and industry — a 
desire to provide for his children. 
2dly. As it regards those to whom the children were apprenticed; 
who, when they took them on compulsion, took them at an incon- 
venience and a disadvantage — to whom these parish apprentices 
“were much worse servants and less under control than others,’”’— 
who often found them “hostile both in conduct and disposition, ready 
listeners, retailers of falsehood and scandal of the family affairs, 
ready agents of mischief of the parents and other persons ill disposed 
to their employers,” — who “not infrequently excited the children to 
disobedience, in order to get their indentures cancelled,’ — they were 
the unwilling servants of unwilling masters; they could not be trusted, 
and yet could not be dismissed. The demoralization of the appren- 
tices made them undesirable inmates. They disseminate in the parish 
the morals’ of the workhouse. 
3dly. As it regards the children themselves: — 
1. They were often apprenticed to “needy persons, to whom the 
premium offered was an irresistible temptation to apply for them,” and 
“after a certain interval had been allowed to elapse, means were not 
unfrequently taken to disgust them with their occupation, and to ren- 
der their situations so irksome as to make them abscond.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-557
        
     
       
     
        
   
          
    
      NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 531 
2. They were looked upon by such persons as “defenseless, and 
deserted by their natural protectors,’ and were often cruelly treated. 
So that to be treated “worse than a parish apprentice” has passed into 
a proverb. 
3. Not only was their moral culture neglected, but their moral well- 
being was often totally disregarded. The facts under this head are 
fearful. There was a mutual contamination. The system appears, 
says Mr. Austin, to have led directly to cruelty, immorality, and suffer- 
ing, although, in: some cases, apprenticeship was not unproductive of 
certain beneficial results to both master and apprentice. 
4. Their instruction in any useful calling was for the most part 
neglected, because their masters were often unfit to teach them, and 
because they were obstinately unwilling to learn. The position which 
the parish apprentice occupied in the house was therefore commonly 
that of the household drudge. 
It is scarcely to be wondered at, that among a race thus born in pau- 
perism, and educated to it, pauperism became hereditary. 
When the Poor Law Board abolished the system of education by 
apprenticeship, they took upon themselves the responsibility of provid- 
ing some better form of education. Every workhouse was accordingly 
required to provide a schoolmaster who should educate the children. 
For which purpose they were to be completely separated from the 
adults, and instructed for at least three hours every day. 
Lest the guardians should be tempted to employ inefficient school- 
masters, that they might not have to pay them high salaries, it was 
afterward provided that the salaries of workhouse schoolmasters 
should be paid out of a grant voted specially for that purpose by Parlia- 
ment; and, later still, these salaries were ordered to be determined by 
your Lordships, upon examination by Her Majesty’s Inspectors.             
            
      
  302. Typical Reasoning in Opposition to Free Schools 
(Kay-Shuttleworth, Sir James, Public Education as affected by the Minutes of the 
Committee of Privy Council, 1846-52. London, 1853)      
  The following brief extract from the above volume is typical of 
much of the reasoning of the time in favor of supporting schools by 
public grants, coupled with tuition fees, in preference to the crea- 
tion of a system of national education based on taxation. 
            
  A weekly payment from the parents of scholars is that form of taxa- 
tion, the justice of which is most apparent, to the humbler classes. 
Eyery one who has even an elementary knowledge of finance is aware 
that no tax can be largely productive from which the great mass of the 
people are exempt.

is, that it appeals to the sense of paternal duty. It enforces a lesson 
of domestic piety. It establishes the parental authority, and vindicates 
personal freedom. The child is neither wholly educated by religious 
charity, nor by the State.. He owes to his parents that honor and 
obedience, which are the source of domestic tranquillity, and to which 
the promise of long life is attached. Let no one rudely interfere with 
the bonds of filial reverence and affection. Especially is it the interest 
of the State to make these the primal elements of social order. Nor 
can the paternal charities of a wise commonwealth be substituted for 
the personal ties of parental love and esteem}, without undermining 
society at its base. 
The parent should not be led to regard the school as the privilege of 
the citizen, so much as another scene of household duty. Those com- 
munities are neither most prosperous, nor mdst happy, in which the

the operations of the department. 
6. Of the pupils in the inspected schools not more than one-fourth of 
the children were receiving a good education, the instruction given be- 
ing too much adapted to the elder scholars to the neglect of the younger 
ones. 
b. Chief Recommendations. 
1. That all assistance given to the annual maintenance of schools 
should be simplified and reduced to grants of two kinds. The first of 
these grants should be paid out of the general taxation of the country, 
in consideration of the fulfilment of certain conditions by the managers 
of the schools. Compliance with these conditions was to be ascer- 
tained by the inspectors. The second was to be paid out of the county 
rates, in consideration of the attainment of a certain degree of 
knowledge by the children in the school during the year preceding 
the payment. The existence of this degree of knowledge would be 
ascertained by examiners appointed by county and borough boards of 
education hereinafter described. 
2. That no school should be entitled to these grants which did not 
fulfil the following general conditions: — The school would have to be 
registered at the office of the Privy Council, on the report of the in- 
spector, as an elementary school for the education of the poor. The 
school would have to be certified by the inspector to be healthy and 
properly drained and ventilated, and supplied with offices; and the prin- 
cipal school-room must contain at least eight square feet of superficial 
area for each child in average daily attendance. 
With a view to making the teaching in schools more effective and 
more evenly distributed among the scholars, the Commission recorm- 
mended what has since been known as “payment by results.” “There 
is only one way,” the Commission reported, “of securing this result, 
which is to institute a searching examination by competent authority 
of every child in every school to which grants are to be paid, with a 
view to ascertaining whether these indispensable elements of knowl- 
edge are thoroughly acquired, and to make the prospects and position 
of the teacher dependent, to a considerable extent, on the results of this 
examination.” 
Of these recommendations, that one which proposed that education 
should be supported partly by means of a local rate bore no immediate 
fruit. The other main suggestions, viz., that the Parliamentary grant 
should be paid directly to the managers, who should arrange all ques- 
tions of stipend with their teachers, and that this grant should be made 
to depend largely on the record of individual examination of the schol- 
ars, formed the backbone of Mr. Lowe’s Revised Code. 
The bedrock principle of this famous code, the principle of “pay- 
ment by results,” was bitterly challenged by educationists; but it held

departed from, with, as I think, the most salutary effects mn the 
permanent value and fruitfulness of the teaching given. 
304. The Elementary Education| Act of 1870 
(Elementary Education Act; 33 and 34 Victoria, chap. 75) 
In 1870 the culmination of over sixty years of struggle to secure 
the beginnings of national organization for education was reached, 
and the Act providing for the organization of elementary educa- 
tion to supply deficiencies, and further providing that the Board 
Schools should be free from religious compulsion, was secured. 
The essential features of the Act of 1870 were: 
There shall be provided for every school district a sufficient amount’ 
of accommodation in public elementary schools (as hereinafter defined) 
available for all the children resident in such district for whose elemen- 
tary education efficient and suitable provision is not otherwise made; 
and where there is an insufficient amount of such accommodation, in 
this act referred to as “public school accommodation,” the deficiency 
shall be supplied in the manner provided by this act. 
Where the education department, in the manner provided by this 
act, are satisfied and have given public notice that there is an insuffi- 
cient amount of public school accommodation for any school district, 
and the deficiency is not supplied as hereinafter required, a school 
board shall be formed for such district and shall supply such deficiency, 
and in case of default by the school board the education department 
shall cause the duty of such board to be performed in the manner pro- 
vided by this act. 
Every elementary school which is conducted in accordance with the 
following regulations shall be a public elementary school within the 
meaning of this act; and every public elementary school shall be con- 
ducted in accordance with the following regulations (a copy of which 
regulations shall be conspicuously put up in every such school) ; namely, 
(rz) it shall not be required, as a condition of any child being admitted 
in or continuing in the school, that he shall attend or abstain from at- 
tending any Sunday School or any place of religious worship, or that he 
shall attend any religious observance or any instruction in religious 
subjects in the school or elsewhere, from which observance or instruc- 
tion he may be withdrawn by his parent, or that he shall, if withdrawn 
by his parent, attend the school on any day exclusively set apart for 
religious observance by the religious body to which his parent belongs: 
(2) the time or times during which any religious observance is practiced 
or instruction in religious subjects is given at any meeting of the school 
shall be either at the beginning, or at the end, or at the beginning and 
the end of such meeting. 4 i

  3° ©The Abolition of Religious Tests for Degrees at the 
English Universities 
( Lhe Universities Tests Act of 1871; 34 and 35 Victoria, chap. 26) 
Queen Elizabeth did much to foster and advance learning in the 
English universities, but she felt the necessity of keeping these 
institutions free from popery. Accordingly, in 1558, she imposed 
on all graduates the oath of supremacy, in all temporal and spirit- 
ual matters, to prevent non-conformists from receiving university 
degrees. Under the requirements every student, fellow, and lec- 
turer was compelled to take certain oaths, and to conform in reli- 
gious matters in a way that none but members of the Church of 
England could possibly do. In time this came to be a heavy bur- 
den on the English nation, in that it prevented many bright minds 
from attendance on the universities. Finally, as part of the edu- 
cational and political awakening of the nation which took place 
after 1850, Parliament, in 1871, repealed this burdensome statute 
of 1558, and opened the universities to dissenters as well as church- 
men. The chief points in this law, abolishing religious tests for 
degrees, are contained in the following extract. 
Whereas, it is.expedient that the benefits of the universities of Ox- 
ford, Cambridge, and Durham, and of the colleges and halls now sub- 
sisting therein, as places of religion and learning, should be rendered 
freely accessible to the nation: 
And whereas, by means of divers restrictions, tests, and disabilities, 
many of Her Majesty’s subjects are debarred from the full enjoyment 
of the same: 
And whereas, it is expedient that such restrictions, tests, and dis- 
abilities should be removed, under proper safeguards for the mainte- 
nance of religious instruction and worship in the said universities and 
the colleges and halls now subsisting within the same. . . . 
No person shall be required, upon taking or to enable him to take 
any degree (other than a degree in divinity) within the universities of 
Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham, or any of them, or upon exercising 
or to enable him to exercise any of the rights and privileges which may 
heretofore have been or may hereafter be exercised by graduates in the 
said universities or any of them, or in any college subsisting at the time 
of the passing of this act in any of the said universities, or upon taking 
or holding, or to enable him to take or hold any office in any of the said 
universities or any such college as aforesaid, or upon teaching or to 
enable him to teach within any of the said universities or any such col- 
leges as aforesaid, or upon opening or to enable him to open a private 
hall or hostel in any of the said universities for the reception of students,

306. The Educational Traditions of England 
(London Times, Educational Supplement, September, 1917) 
The following is reproduced as an excellent summary of a cen- 
tury of English educational history. 
Mr. Fisher’s Education Bill, which was read for the first time on 
Friday last, is the legitimate successor of a series of educational im- 
pulses dating from the very end of the eighteenth century, when Joseph 
Lancaster and Andrew Bell realized, almost simultaneously, the straits 
to which the introduction of machinery into labor had reduced the 
children of the land. 
At that moment the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were 
stirring in their eighteenth-century sleep, but in all other directions 
a profound coma lay upon national education. The Charity-Schools 
had definitely failed; the endowment schools were for the most part 
out of action; the children of a Christian land had no facilities for the 
simplest form of education despite the efforts of the leaders of the new 
Sunday-school movement that had reached London in 1780. The 
monitorial movement initiated by Bell and Lancaster revived similar 
expedients necessitated by the lack of teachers in the thirteenth and 
the sixteenth centuries. It was at once crowned with an embarrassing 
success, and it was clear in the dawn of the nineteenth century that the 
tradition of education was but asleep, that the people of the land were 
as hungry for education as in any past age... . 
SS From 1802 to 1832 many stalwart efforts were made to secure a uni- 
versal system of education. Mr. Whitbread in 1807 introduced a bill 
for the establishment of schools throughout the land to supply machin- 
ery by which all children were to be entitled to two years’ schooling 
between the ages of seven and fourteen years. Public opinion has 
been or was being stimulated by the keenest minds: Blackstone, Adam 
Smith, Bentham demanded in no uncertain tones education for all. In 
1816 a Select Committee of the Commons was directed to report on the 
subject of the education of the lower orders. In 1818 it proclaimed 
“the anxiety of the poor for education,” and dwelt on their meager 
opportunities. The committee recommended a universal conscience 
clause, the establishment of rate-supported free parochial schools in
-P-A-G-E-563
    v

very poor districts — the goal which was achieved in 1870 — and Par- 
liamentary building grants in richer districts — the principle adopted 
in 1833. A full century ago, the true principles of advance were advo- 
cated by Parliament, but nothing was done. 
In 1820 Brougham took up that subject of national education which 
he was destined ceaselessly to pursue until his last speech of July, 1864. 
The persistence of his efforts gave a certain continuity to the whole 
struggle for progress. He was often wrong in his dogmatism, but never 
in his optimism and in his determination to secure educational justice 
for the people of England. Mr. Fisher’s measure of 1917 is a direct 
descendant of Brougham’s measure of 1820, when he recommended 
the universal establishment of undenominational parochial schools 
with efficient teachers supported out of local rates supplemented by the 
old endowments. In 1828 Brougham passionately declared in the 
house that “the schoolmaster was abroad, and he trusted more to the 
schoolmaster armed with his primer than he did to the soldier in full 
military array for upholding and extending the liberties of his coun- 
try.” In 1825 he published his pamphlet, “Observations on the Edu- 
cation of the People,” which within a year ran through twenty editions. 
The desire for a national system had spread through England, and in 
1833 there were already over a million children in the schools of the 
education societies. On Saturday, August 17, 1833, in a house as 
empty as that addressed by Mr. Fisher on Friday, August 10, 1917, the 
House of Commons voted the sum of £20,000 “‘in aid of private sub- 
scriptions for the erection of schoolhouses for the education of the chil- 
dren of the poorer classes.” State intervention in English education 
had begun at last, and this little grant was the first rivulet of the great 
river of to-day on which so many national argosies are floating. 
Lord Althorp’s government placed the administration of the grant 
in the hands of the Treasury. The response to the grant showed that 
the country was hungering for education, and applications for grants 
poured in with ample voluntary funds. A great scheme was then pos- 
sible, but the Treasury refused to recommend any increase in the 
grant. The first “fine careless rapture” of the reformers died away, 
and though Parliament made a grant of £10,000 for training colleges 
in 1834, it remained unused until 1839. Parliament in 1837 refused 
leave to introduce a bill to establish a national system, and Brougham 
had to abandon his educational charities bills in the same year, while 
a proposal to form a board to distribute the grant was flatly defeated 
in the house in 1838. But three successive Select Committees pro- 
duced the gloomiest reports as to national educational conditions, and 
as to the dreadful state of child labor. The committee of 1837-38 was 
forced by Gladstone and others to reject a proposal for a Board of 
Education. In 1839 Queen Victoria personally intervened with a pro- 
test at a lack of education “not in accordance with the character of a

civilized and Christian nation.” This brought a new figure into the 
field, Lord John Russell, and suddenly the formation of a Committee 
of Council on Education gathered to a head slumbering political ex- 
citement. Gladstone, Disraeli and Peel all attacked the new depar- 
ture, which by a bare majority in a crowded house was confirmed, and 
became the basis of all subsequent developments. 
From 1839 to 1870 the Education Committee (which by statute in 
1856 was combined with the Department of Science and Art into the 
Education Department) carried on the heavy work of administering 
a rapidly growing grant under the Regulations, first issued in 1839, 
that later became the well-known Code. The work of inspection was 
carried out with great thoroughness, and the reports of the inspectors 
are some of the most valuable documents extant for the social history 
of the mid-nineteenth century. Macaulay, Brougham and Russell 
fought with herculean energy to destroy the “empire of ignorance.” 
On April 19, 1847, grants were extended from school buildings to edu- 
cation itself, and then the long struggle for compulsory education be- 
gan. Russell proposed in 1842 that rates should be made available for 
education. The proposal was part of a great scheme dealing with all 
grades of education. Bill after bill followed; bill after bill disappeared, 
while the conditions of childhood grew rapidly worse. It seemed as if 
the state itself could never enfranchise the slave-children of the people. 
Gladstone was bitterly opposed even to the increase of the grant, 
which in 1856 was nearly half a million. Two years later a Royal Com- 
mission was appointed. Robert Lowe came upon the scene, and in 
1859 introduced education estimates approaching one million. The 
report of the commission in 1861 proposed the introduction of rate 
grants as well as state grants, and hoped to secure local administration 
by county and borough boards. But nothing came of the report, and 
Mr. Lowe introduced his famous Revised Code to meet a position 
which was rapidly getting worse. The average of attendance was 
lower than ten years earlier. His remedy was a single grant dependent 
on examinations, coupled with attendance, efficient buildings and effi- 
cient teaching. It was only to apply to children up to the age of 
twelve. A tremendous Parliamentary struggle followed, the Code was 
accepted, and it seemed successful, since the numbers inspected in- 
creased with lower estimates. But the system left half the children 
of the country without education, and the end of efforts that now seem 
to us puerile was at hand. Bills were introduced in 1867 and 1868 
intended to strengthen the voluntary system, but they were clearly 
inadequate. It is true that in 1869 a million children were at school, 
and a million and a half on the registers, but of these 400,000 were 
under six and only 640,000 were examined; while there were a mil- 
lion children between six and ten and half a million between ten and 
twelve not on the registers at all. Compulsory attendance and com-
-P-A-G-E-565
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 539 
pulsory rating were beyond all doubt essential, and with the Act of 
1870 the new system was inaugurated. 
When we gaze into the perspective of the history before 1870 we are 
able to see more signs of hope than the generation actually engaged in 
the struggle could detect. In seventy years the school-going habit of 
English childhood had been reéstablished. Parents throughout the 
country had come to recognize that school was the place for children, 
and though compulsion involved loss of wages it was gladly accepted 
by the industrial classes. We do not realize to-day what a wonderful 
achievement this was. ... That was one gain. Another was the reli- 
gious training of the schools, which was excellent throughout the 
period and kept alive one of the most important of the English educa- 
tional traditions. A third gain was the deep basis of voluntary effort 
that had been laid. It was prophesied that when compulsion came 
voluntary effort would cease. Instead it multiplied, and it flourishes 
to-day in every grade of education. But the pre-compulsion period 
did more than all this. It laid the basis for reform in all other grades 
of education. Organized state effort in respect to science and art 
began in 1836; a long struggle for the re-creation of our secondary sys- 
tem of endowed schools reached its goal in 1868 and 1869 and restored 
to English education the full current of medieval and Elizabethan 
humanism, and this was supplemented by the brilliant awakening of 
the old universities, the birth of many new places of higher education, 
and the creation of a living relation’from 1856 onwards (when Oxford 
started the local examinations) between the universities and the peo- 
ple. By 1870 the threefold tradition of English education — religion, 
humanism, and science — was again in full operation. 
The period from 1870 to 1917 was occupied with one long struggle, 
the effort to give this tradition full operative value in the life of the 
people as a whole. In order to do this it was essential to correlate 
once again our educational and our local government systems. The 
weakness of the school-board system was that it did not adequately fit 
into a system of local government. . . . Until the two were related real 
progress was scarcely possible, though the great school boards in the 
teeth of the law did much to press forward the claims of democracy'to 
full educational facilities. The evils of child labor, of exemptions from 
school, of lack of facilities for higher education, of lack of health 
through evil social conditions, could not be grasped while local govern- 
ment itself was invertebrate. That ceased to be the case in 1888, 
when the county councils and borough councils were formed. From 
that moment educational reform became possible once more. The 
demand for reform began at once. Compulsory fees for schooling 
ceased in 1891, though in fact the system of fees with alternative free 
schools is only now to be abolished. The abolition of fees was followed 
by growing demands for efficiency, and from 1897 necessitous schools

received special grants. But it had become clear enough that na- 
tional education required drastic reorganization; that the efforts for 
higher education must not be blighted by a technical definition of 
elementary education; that secondary and elementary and technical 
education must be codrdinated, and that while a new centralization 
at Whitehall was necessary a new decentralization was equally essen- 
tial, and that the position of the teacher must be placed on a higher 
stage. So in 1899 the Education Department and the Science and 
Art Department were amalgamated in the Board of Education, to 
which new body was transferred the powers of the Charity Commis- 
sioners in relation to educational trusts.... But the creation of a 
real Board of Education ... only achieved one aspect of reform. 
It was left to Mr. Balfour, in his great Act of 1902, to graft the educa- 
tional system into the new (or rather revived) local government sys- 
tem, and create committees of the local authorities to take over not 
only the work of the School Boards, but also many duties, with more 
or less adequate rating powers, in relation to higher education. This 
Act was extended to London in 1903. In the r5 years since education 
once more passed into the hands of local authorities responsible for all 
the other social work of the district a new aspect has come over the 
whole subject. The great School Medical Service was introduced in 
1907. A numerous class of skilled educational administrators with 
immense technical knowledge has grown up; a deep sense of educa- 
tional responsibility in the local authorities has developed; the inter- 
relation of education and public health has become obvious; the de- 
pendence of industry on education has become almost as obvious, and 
with this recognition the claims of higher education have advanced 
and have been recognized and especially in the regions of technical 
studies. In 1887 national education seemed at a standstill; real prog- 
ress seemed impossible. Thirty years later we see, in the midst of 
the greatest war that Europe has known, progress with gigantic strides 
not only possible but indubitable. 
During the progress of the Bill of 1902 the attention of the public 
was chiefly fixed on the clauses relating to religious teaching, and Mr. 
Balfour had to devise ways and means to meet the conflicting claims of 
the voluntary and the provided schools. Not only was attention riv- 
eted on this side of the case, but for ten years after, the Act suggesting 
legislation to amend these clauses occupied the attention of Parliament 
and roused the bitterest feeling among the leaders of various denomi- 
nations. But all this while wider views were growing; the clauses in 
question in the vast majority of schools were seen in fact not to work 
unjustly, and the local authorities and educationists devoted them- 
selves to the great difficulties of actual education standing in the way 
of a national system that should give to every child the means of freely 
developing his or her own peculiar gifts. The questions of child labor,
-P-A-G-E-567
  NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IN ENGLAND 541 
of child health, of adequate teaching, smaller classes, better school- 
houses, able and contented teachers, the codrdination of grades of 
education, continuously occupied the attention of the Board of Edu- 
cation, of the local authorities, and of educationists at large. When the 
war came in 1914 it looked for a moment as if the labors of a decade 
were to be cast aside. But a trumpet call for an educational revolu- 
tion came, and after more than two years of continuous effort a really 
great Minister of Education has been able to bring forward a measure 
of reform that crowns the efforts of men like Whitbread, Brougham, 
Macaulay, Russell, Forster, and certainly not least Mr. Balfour, who 
may claim to have created machinery that codrdinated the ancient 
traditions of English education and made possible the revolution of 
to-day.

  CHAPTER XXV 
AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN 
THE UNITED STATES 
Tue Readings of this chapter have been selected to illustrate 
educational conditions and movements during the first half- 
century of American national existence, during the period of 
transition from colonial conditions, and before any clear educa- 
tional consciousness on the part of the people had been awakened. 
The first group of selections describes early schools. The first 
of these (307) is a characterization of the schools of Boston during 
the period of about 1790 to 1815, by the celebrated teacher and 
textbook writer, Caleb Bingham. His description of the origin of 
the double elementary-school system of Boston is important, as is 
also that of the instruction and the textbooks used. In Rhode 
Island, the first and for long the only city to maintain schools was 
Providence, and selection 308 reproduces the first course of study 
(1800) ; selection 309 is a reprint of the early rules and regulations 
for the schools; and 310 is a memorial to the City Council from a 
very important society of the city praying for better schools, and 
giving facts as to attendance and costs. 
Among the many charitable and philanthropic undertakings 
begun to found schools, the Sthool Societies for day and infant 
schools, and the Lancastrian monitorial organizations, were the 
most important. Selection 311 is an appeal to the people of New 
York City by the newly founded Public School Society, and repre- 
sents the beginnings of public education there. Selection 312 is 
from a Report made to the School Committee of Boston, stating 
the advantages of the monitorial plan of instruction over the older 
individual plan, and supplements the descriptions of the plan 
previously reproduced (297, 298). Selection 313 is the Report of 
the Boston School Committee which resulted in the creation of 
primary schools in that city. The selection which follows (314) 
describes the Boston elementary-school system of 1823, as reor- 
ganized early in the century and with the new infant schools 
added. This description is continued for the secondary schools 
in 327.

After about 1825 the newly formed workingmen’s associations 
began to take a prominent part in the agitation for schools, 
and from New York to Maryland they were particularly active. 
Many resolutions were adopted and reports made, of which 315, 
a Report of the Workingmen’s Committee of Philadelphia, is re- 
produced as typical. 
307. The Schools of Boston about 1790-1815 
(Fowle, Wm. B., Memoir of Caleb Bingham. Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, vol. v, pp. 325-34) 
Caleb Bingham (1757-1817) enjoyed an enviable reputation as 
a teacher in Boston during the last decade of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, and later became a notable textbook writer and publisher of 
schoolbooks. In this Memoir the writer gives an excellent picture 
of the schools of Boston, as reorganized by the School Committee 
in 1789, and as they continued for more than a quarter of a cen- 
tury. 
(a) Schools for girls. The main object of Mr. Bingham in coming 
to Boston was to establish a school for girls; and the project was of the 
most promising description, for the town of Boston had even then be- 
come eminent for its wealth and intelligence, and, strange to say, was 
deficient in public and private schools for females. It certainly is a 
remarkable fact, that, while the girls of every town in the state were 
allowed and expected to attend the village schools, no public provision 
seems to have been made for their instruction in the metropolis, and 
men of talents do not seem to have met with any encouragement to 
open private schools for this all important class of children. The only 
schools in the city to which girls were admitted, were kept by the 
teachers of public schools, between the forenoon and afternoon ses- 
sions, and how insufficient this chance for an education was, may be 
pathered from the fact, that all the public teachers who opened private 
schools, were uneducated men, selected for their skill in penmanship 
and the elements of arithmetic. The schools were called writing 
schools; and, although reading and spelling were also taught in them, 
this instruction was only incidental, being carried on, we cannot say 
“attended to,” while the teachers were making or mending pens, pre- 
paratory to the regular writing lesson. 
This had probably been the state of things for more than a century, 
and at the advent of Mr. Bingham, there were only two such schools, 
while there were two others devoted exclusively to the study of Latin 
and Greek, although the pupils of these latter schools hardly num- 
bered one tenth of the others. Of course, the proposal of Mr. Bing- 
ham to open a school, in which girls should be taught, not only writing 
 
-P-A-G-E-570
  544 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
and arithmetic, but, reading, spelling and English grammar, met with 
a hearty reception, and his room, which was in State street, from which 
schools and dwelling houses had been banished nearly half a century, 
was soon filled with children of the most respectable families. There 
does not seem to have been any competition, and Mr. Bingham ha 
the field to himself for at least four years before any movement was 
made to improve the old public system, or to extend the means of pri- 
vate instruction. 
(b) The public writing schools. At that time, and for more than a 
century and a half, the public schools of Boston, and indeed, those o! 
the state had been under the control and supervision of the selectmen, 
three to nine citizens, elected annually to manage the financial an 
other concerns of the several towns, without much, if any, regard to 
their literary qualifications. The selectmen of Boston were generally 
merchants, several of whom, at the time under consideration, had 
daughters or relatives in the school of Mr. Bingham. It was natura 
that the additional expense thus incurred, for they were taxed to sup- 
port the public schools, from which their daughters were excluded, 
should lead them to inquire why such a preference was given to parents 
with boys; and the idea seemed, for the first time, to be started, tha 
the prevailing system was not only imperfect, but evidently unfair. 
The simplest and most natural process would have been to open the 
schools to both sexes, as the spirit of the laws required, but this woul 
have left the instruction in the hands of the incompetent writing mas- 
ters, when a higher otder of teachers was required; or it would have 
involved the dismission of all the writing masters, a bold step, which 
the committee dared not to hazard, because many citizens were op- 
posed to any innovation, and the friends of the masters were so influ- 
ential, that no change was practicable which did not provide for their 
support. After much consultation, therefore, there being some com- 
plaint of the insufficient number of the schools, the school committee 
proposed the only plan which seemed to secure the triple object — 
room for the girls, employment for the old masters, and the introduc- 
tion of others better qualified. 
(c) Origin of the reading schools. The new plan was to institute three 
new schools, to be called READING SCHOOLS, in which reading, 
spelling, grammar and perhaps geography, should be taught by mas- 
ters to be appointed; the two old writing schools to be continued, a 
new one established; and one of the Latin schools to be abolished. As 
no rooms were prepared, temporary ones were hired, so that the same 
pupils attended a writing school in. one building half-the-day, and a 
reading school in a different building, at a considerable distance, and 
under a different and independent teacher, the other half. Each 
reading school had its corresponding writing school, and while the boys 
were in one school, the girls were in the other, alternating forenoon  
-P-A-G-E-571
    NEW INFLUENCES IN AMERICA 545 
and afternoon, and changing the half day once a month, because, 
Thursday and Saturday afternoons being vacation, this arrangement 
was necessary to equalize the lessons taught in the separate schools. 
This system afterwards acquired the name of the double-headed sys- 
tem, and it was continued, essentially, for more than half a century;in 
spite of all the defects and abuses to which it was exposed. Even 
when the town built new schoolhouses, the upper room was devoted 
to the reading school, and the lower to the writing, the masters never 
changing rooms, and the boys and girls alternating as before. The 
points gained, however, were very important, the girls were provided 
for, better teachers were appointed, and the sexes were separated into 
different rooms... . 
(d) The Latin schools. Another evil in the new system also held its 
ground for many years. Boys had been admitted into the Latin school 
at the early age of seven years, on the mistaken idea, that the very 
young are best qualified to learn a dead language, as they undoubtedly 
are to learn a spoken one. The age was increased to ten years by the 
new system, but, as before, no provision was made in the Latin school 
for their instruction in English, in penmanship, or in any of the’com- 
mon branches. To remedy this serious defect, the Latin scholars were 
allowed to attend the writing schools two hours, forenoon or afternoon, 
and about thirty availed themselves of the privilege, although they 
were obliged to neglect one school to attend the other, and unpunctu- 
| ality and disorder, in all the schools, were the natural consequence. . . . 
(e) Books used; Methods of instruction. The books used in the read- 
ing schools were, the Holy Bible, Webster’s Spelling Book, Webster’s 
Third Part, and the Young Lady’s Accidence. The Children’s Friend 
and Morse’s Geography were allowed, not required; and “ Newspapers 
were to be introduced, occasionally, at the discretion of the mas- 
heroes 
Furthermore, it was ordered that, in the writing schools, the children 
“should begin to learn arithmetic at eleven years of age; that, at 
twelve, they should be taught to make pens.” Until eleven years old, 
all the pupils did, in a whole forenoon or afternoon, was to write one 
page of a copy book, not exceeding ten lines. When they began to 
cipher, it rarely happened that they performed more than two sums in 
the simplest rules. These were set in the pupil’s manuscript, and the 
operation was there recorded by him. No printed book was used. 
Such writing and ciphering, however, were too much for one day, and 
the boys who ciphered, only did so every other day. If it be asked, 
how were the three hours of school time occupied? The answer is, in 
one of three ways, — in mischief; in play; or in idleness. . . . 
In the reading schools, the course was for every child to read one 
verse of the Bible, or a short paragraph of the Third Part. The mas- 
ter heard the first and second, that is, the two highest classes, and the

usher heard the two lowest. While one class was reading, the other 
studied the spelling lesson. The lesson was spelled by the scholars in 
turn, so that, the classes being large, each boy seldom spelled more 
than one or two words. In grammar, the custom was to recite six or 
more lines once a fortnight, and to go through the book three times 
before any application of it was made to what was called parsing. No 
geography was prepared for the schools until Mr. Bingham left them. 
Morse’s abridgment began to be a reading book about the year 1800, 
and soon after, Mr. Bingham prepared his little Catechism, which 
was probably based upon it. When Mr. B.’s American Preceptor was 
published, it displaced Webster’s Third Part. His Child’s Compan- 
ion superseded Webster’s Spelling Book in the lower classes, and the 
Columbian Orator was the reading book of the upper class, to the 
displacement of the Bible, which, instead of being read by the children, 
was read by the reading masters as a religious exercise, at the opening 
of school in the morning, and at its close in the afternoon. The writ- 
ing masters were not required to read or pray for fifteen or twenty 
years after the great reform. 
308. Petition for Free Schools in Rhode Island 
(Petition of Mechanics and Manufacturers Association, of Providence, 1799. Re- 
produced in Carroll, Charles, Public Education in Rhode Island, pp. 77-78. Provi- 
dence, 1918) 
One of the very influential associations which did effective prop- 
aganda work for free schools, in the early days of American na- 
tional life, was the Providence Association of Mechanics and 
Manufacturers, in the educational work of which a barber of 
Providence, John Howland by name, was the leading spirit. He 
is commonly designated as. the founder of the free schools of 
Rrovidence: i 
’ In 1799 this Association addressed the following petition to the 
General Assembly of Rhode Island: 
A Petition for Free Schools. To the Honorable General Assembly 
of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, to be holden 
at Greenwich, on the last Monday of February, A.D. 1799: 
The Memorial and Petition of the Providence Association of Me- 
chanics and Manufacturers respectfully presents — 
That the means of education which are enjoyed in this state are very 
inadequate to a purpose so highly important. 
That numbers of the rising generation whom nature has liberally 
endowed, are suffered to grow up in ignorance, when a common edu- 
cation would qualify them to act their parts in life with advantage to 
the public and reputation to themselves. 
     
    
       
    
       
-P-A-G-E-573
    NEW INFLUENCES IN AMERICA 547 
That in consequence of there being no legal provision for the estab- 
lishment of schools, and for want of public attention and encourage- 
ment, this so essential part of our social duty is left to the partial pa- 
tronage of individuals, whose cares do not extend beyond the limits of 
their own families, while numbers in every part of the state are de- 
prived of a privilege which is the common right of every child to enjoy. 
That when to that respect which as individuals we feel ourselves 
bound to render to the representatives of the people we add our public 
declaration of gratitude for the privilege we enjoy as a corporate body, 
we at the same time solicit this Honorable Assembly to make legal pro- 
vision for the establishment of free schools sufficient to educate all the 
children in the several towns throughout the state; with great confi- 
dence we bring this, our earnest solicitation before this Honorable 
Assembly, from the interest we feel in the public welfare and from the 
consideration that our society is composed of members not originally 
of any particular town, but assembled mostly in our early years from 
almost every town in the state. , 
That we feel as individuals the want of that education which we now 
ask to be bestowed on those who are to succeed us in life, and which 
is so essential in directing its common concerns. That we feel a still 
greater degree of confidence from the consideration that while we pray 
this Honorable Assembly to establish free schools, we are at the same 
time advocating the cause of the great majority of children through- 
out the state, and in particular of those who are poor and destitute — 
the son of the widow and the child of distress. 
Trusting that our occupations as mechanics and manufacturers 
ought not to prevent us from adding to these reasons an argument 
which cannot fail to operate on those to whom is committed the guar- 
dianship of the public welfare, and that is, liberty and security under 
a republican form of government depend on a general. diffusion of 
knowledge among the people. 
In confiding this petition and the reasons which have dictated it to 
the wisdom of the Legislature, we assure ourselves that their decision 
will be such as will reflect on this Honorable General Assembly the 
praise and the gratitude, not only of the youth of the present genera- 
tion, but of thousands the date of whose existence has not commenced.

The petition was referred to a committee, which reported 
avorably, and the General Free School Act of 1800 was the re- 
ult. Providence at once organized free schools under the Act, as 
id two or three other towns, but in 1803 the Act was repealed, 
nd no further general legislation took place until 1828.

(Report of the Committee for revising the School Regulations, June 20, 1820; 
in Centennial Report School Committee, 1899-1900, pp. 42-43) 
Until 1825 the schools of Providence remained almost the 
only schools in Rhode Island. The following documents describe 
the first schools established, and the regulations for their govern- 
ment. In 1800 a set of rules and regulations was drawn up, and 
in 1820 these were revised by re-wording but without materially 
changing their character. The 1820 regulations are reproduced 
below as describing the schools at a little later date, though they 
are substantially the same as those for 1800. 
Regulations for the instruction and government of the publick schools 
in the Town of Providence 
The Publick Schools are established for the general benefit of the 
community; And all children, of both sexes, having attained the age of 
six years, shall be received therein and faithfully instructed, without 
preference or partiality. 
The Instruction shall be uniform in the several schools, and shall con- 
sist of spelling, Reading, the use of Capital letters and Punctuation, 
Writing, English Grammar & Arithmetick. 
The Pronunciation shall be uniform in the several schools & the 
standard shall be the Critical Pronouncing Dictionary of John Walker. 
The following Books, and none others, shall be used in the several

provement it is indispensible that the scholars should implicitly obey 
the Regulations of the Schools. 
The good morals of the Youth being essential to their own comfort 
& to their progress in useful knowledge, they are strictly enjoined to 
avoid idleness and profaneness, falsehood and deceitfulness, and every 
other wicked & disgraceful practice; and to conduct themselves in a 
sober, orderly & decent manner both in & out of school. If any scholar 
should prove disobedient & refractory, after all reasonable means used 
by the Preceptor to bring him or her to a just sense of duty, such offen~ 
der shall be suspended from attendance & instruction in any School, 
until the next visitation of the committee. Each Scholar shall be 
punctual in attendance at the appointed hour and be as constant as 
possible in daily attendance and all excuses for absence shall be by note, 
from the Parent or Guardian of the scholar. 
It shall be the duty of the Preceptors to report at each quarterly vis- 
itation the names of those scholars who have been grossly negligent 
in attending School or inattentive to their Studies. 
It is recommended to the Preceptors, as far as practicable, to exclude 
corporal punishment from the schools, and particularly that they 
never permit it to be inflicted by their ushers in their presence, or at 
any time by a scholar. 
That they inculcate upon the scholars the necessity of good behay- 
iour during their absence from school. That they endeavor to convince 
the children by their treatment that they feel a parental affection for 
them, and never make dismission from school at an early hour a re- 
ward for good conduct or diligence, but endeavor to teach the scholars 
to consider being at school as a privilege & dismission from it as a pun- 
ishment. 
That they endeavor to impress on the minds of the scholars a sense 
of the Being & Providence of God & their obligations to love & rever- 
ence Him, — their duty to their parents & preceptors, the beauty & 
excellency of truth, justice & mutual love, tenderness to brute crea- 
tures, the happy tendency of self government and obedience to the dic- 
tates of reason & religion; the observance of the Sabbath as a sacred 
institution, the duty which they owe to their country & the necessity 
f a strict obedience toits Laws, and that they caution them against 
he prevailing vices.

       To THE Ciry CoUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PROVIDENCE: 
The undersigned, in behalf of the Providence Association of Me- 
chanics and Manufacturers, respectfully represent: That 
At a meeting of the Association, held on Monday evening, January 
30, 1837, the accompanying resolutions were unanimously adopted: 
RESOLVED, That no subject can be of more importance to the in- 
habitants of this city, than the education of the rising generation. 
RESOLVED, That as the members of this association were the pioneers 
in the establishment of the public schools, they manifested a most 
laudable zeal on that subject. 
RESOLVED, That the public schools of this city come far short of the 
wants of the community, and are much inferior in their character to the 
public schools in neighboring cities. 
RESOLVED, That the public schools can and ought to be made equal 
to the private schools, so far as relates to the common branches now 
taught. 
RESOLVED, That two of the greatest evils now existing, as respects 
public school instruction are the great number of scholars in each school, 
and the small salaries paid to the teachers. 
RESOLVED, That an increased number of public schools ought to be 
established in this city as soon as practicable. 
ReEsoLveD, That a committee be appointed to draft a memorial to 
the City Council, on the subject of public schools, in conformity with 
the recommendation of the Select Committee, to report at an adjourned 
meeting, to be held on Saturday evening next. 
Accompanying the above resolutions was a Memorial, from 
which the following statistical statement is taken:

There are about 50 per cent more attending private-school instruc- 
tion than public, in this city; while in Boston, three fifths of the whole 
number, 12,848, are attending the public schools. 
Boston, containing a population of about 80,000, pays $88,000; and 
Providence, whose population is about 20,000, pays $7,461. Should 
Providence pay $22,000, instead of the sum above stated, her public 
schools might then be equal in standing, and perhaps nearly adequate 
to the actual wants of the community. 
311. The Beginnings of Public Education in New York City 
(‘“Address” published in New York City papers of May, 1805. Reproduced in 
Bourne, Wm. O., History of the Public School Society of the City of New York. 
New York, 1870) 
In 1800 New York City had a population of 60,489, but no 
school facilities other than those provided by private and church 
schools. In February, 1805, a body of public-spirited citizens 
formed an Association, and applied to the legislature for a charter 
to establish a School Society. The legislature approved the re- 
quest and chartered the Society, under the name given in the fol- 
lowing “Address” to the Public. To secure funds to erect the 
first building the Society issued this appeal, asking for subscrip- 
tions.. The “Address” states well the conditions existing at the 
time, and reveals the philanthropic origin of the society and of the 
ublic schools. ~ 
TO THE PUBLIC 
ddress of the Trustees of the “ Society for Establishing a Free School in 
the City of New York, for the Education of such Poor Children as do 
not Belong to, or are not Provided for by, any Religious Society.” 
While the various religious and benevolent societies in this city, with 
spirit of charity and zeal which the precepts and example of the Di- 
ine Author of our religion could alone inspire, amply provide for the 
ducation of such poor children as belong to their respective associa- 
ions, there still remains a large number living in total neglect of 
eligious and moral instruction, and unacquainted with the common 
tudiments of learning, essentially requisite for the due management of 
lhe ordinary business of life. This. neglect may be imputed either to 
e extreme indigence of the parents of such children, their intemper- 
nce and vice, or to a blind indifference to the best interests of their 
fispring. The consequences must be obvious to the most careless ob- 
rver. Children thus brought up in ignorance, and amidst the con- 
gion of bad example, are in imminent danger of ruin; and too many of 
em, it is to be feared, instead of being useful members of the commun-

ity, will become the burden and pests of society. Early instruction and 
fixed habits of industry, decency, and order, are the surest safeguards 
of virtuous conduct; and when parents are either unable or unwilling 
to bestow the necessary attention on the education of their children, it 
becomes the duty of the public, and of individuals, who have the power,

Socrety In NEw York Crry 
Built in 1809, in Tryon Row. Cost, without site, $13,000 
to assist them in the discharge of this important obligation. It is in 
vain that laws are made for the punishment of crimes, or that good men 
attempt to stem the torrent of irreligion and vice, if the evil is not 
checked at its source; and the means of prevention, by the salutary dis- 
-cipline of early education, seasonably applied. It is certainly in the 
power of the opulent and charitable, by a timely and judicious inter- 
position of their influence and aid, if not wholly to prevent, at least to 
diminish, the pernicious effects resulting from the neglected education| 
of the children of the poor. 
Influenced by these considerations, and from a sense of the neces. 
sity of providing some remedy for an increasing and alarming evil 
several individuals, actuated by similar motives, agree to form an as 
sociation for the purpose of extending the means of education to suc 
poor children as do not belong to, or are not provided for, by any reli. 
gious society. After meetings, numerously attended, a plan of associa. 
tion was framed, and a Memorial prepared and addressed to the legis: 
lature, soliciting an Act of Incorporation, the better to enable them t 
carry into effect their benevolent design. Such a law the Legislatur 
at their last session, was pleased to pass; and at a meeting of th 
Society, under the Act of Incorporation, on the sixth instant, thirtee 
Trustees were elected for the ensuing year.

The particular plan of the school, and the rules for its discipline and 
management, will be made known previous toitscommencement. Care 
will be exercised in the selection of teachers, and, besides the elements 
of learning usually taught in schools, strict attention will be bestowed 
onthe morals of the children, and all suitable means be used to counter- 
act the disadvantages resulting from the situation of their parents. It 
is proposed, also, to establish, on the first day of the week, a school, 
called a Sunday School, more particularly for such children as, from 
peculiar circumstances, are unable to attend on the other days of the 
week. In this, as in the Common School, it will be a primary object, 
without observing the peculiar forms of any religious Society, to incul- 
cate the sublime truths of religion and morality contained in the Holy 
Scriptures. 
This Society, as will appear from its name, interferes with no existing 
institution, since children already provided with the means of educa- 
tion, or attached to any other Society, will not come under its care. 
Humble gleaners in the wide field of benevolence, the members of this 
Association seek such objects only as are left by those who have gone 
before, or are fellow-laborers with them in the great work of charity. 
They, therefore, look with confidence for the encouragement and sup- 
port of the affluent and charitable of every denomination of Christians; 
and when they consider that in no community is to be found a greater 
spirit of liberal and active benevolence than among the citizens of New 
York, they feel assured that adequate means for the prosecution of 
their plan will be easily obtained. In addition to the respectable list 
of original subscriptions, considerable funds will be requisite for the 
purchase or hire of a piece of ground, and the erection/of a suitable 
building for the school, to pay the teachers, and to defray other charges 
incident to the establishment. To accomplish this design, and to place 
the Institution on a solid and respectable foundation, the Society de- 
pend on the voluntary bounty of those who may be charitably disposed 
to contribute their aid in the promotion of an object of great and uni- 
versal concern.       De Wirt Ciinton, President.

In 1828 the Boston School Committee (Board of Education) in-

mittee reported as below. The selection contrasts well the moni- 
torial and the individual plans. 
The advantages of the monitorial system, in comparison with the old 
system, may briefly be thus stated. To the student it makes learning 
less irksome, by simplifying and facilitating his progress, it gives to 
instruction more interest, by alternation and variety of exercise, in 
which physical and intellectual action are combined; it keeps attention 
awake and interested, by permitting no moment of idleness or listless- 
ness; its effects on the habits, character and intelligence of youth are 
highly beneficial; disposing their minds to industry, to readiness of at- 
tention, and to subordination thereby creating in early life a love of 
order, preparation for business, and acquaintance with the relative obli- 
gations and duties both of pupils and instructor. To the master also, 
it renders teaching less irksome and more interesting, giving an air of 
sprightliness and vivacity to his duties, exciting the principles of emu- 
lation among his scholars, aiding him by the number of assistants he 
can thus employ, and, by relieving him from the constant necessity of 
direct supervision of every individual, capacitates him to concentrate 
his mind and efforts on doings and objects of the most importance, dif- 
ficulty, and responsibility. To all which it may be added, though a 
consideration less important yet not to be overlooked, that it is an im- 
mense saving both of time and money, in consequence of the far greater 
numbers which can be taught as well by this mode, as a smaller num- 
ber can by the former. It will be sufficient under this head to state 
that in New York, masters, in three distinct schools, teach fifteen 
hundred and forty-seven boys, being an average of upwards of five 
‘hundred each. In our schools the same number of boys require seven 
schools and fifteen instructors. In New Yorka female teaches a school, 
on this principle, of four hundred. In our schools the average number 
to an instructress is fifty-six. The success and progressive advance- 
ment in those schools, is asserted by men deemed competent judges, to 
be not less than ours. 
313. The Establishment of Primary Schools in Boston 
(Wightman, Jos. M., Annals of the Boston Primary School Committee, pp. 33-34. 
Boston, 1860) 
In Boston, as in a number of other cities, children were suppose 
to learn to read in private dame schools before being admitte 
to the public schools. This produced friction and agitation, and 
in 1817, a petition was presented to the Selectmen of Bosto 
asking for the establishment of public primary schools. The mat: 
ter’ was considered in town meeting, and referred to the Schoo 
Committee, which in time reported adversely on the question. 
a

   NEW INFLUENCES IN AMERICA 555 
This produced more agitation, many articles on the matter 
appeared in the newspapers, a new and larger petition was drawn 
up and presented, and, in 1818, the School Committee reversed 
itself and established the first primary schools in the city. 
The report of the Committee, to whom the second petition was 
referred, and who recommended action, is interesting for the light 
it throws on primary education in Boston and in the State at that 
time. It reads: 
The Committee appointed at the Town meeting on the 25th of May, 
to consider the subject of the petition of a number of the inhabitants, 
for the establishment by the town of schools for children under seven 
years of age, having attentively considered the same, ask leave respect- 
fully to report. 
That, in their opinion, the opening for such schools for children 
under the age of seven years, is highly expedient and necessary; that 
several hundred children of that age do not attend any school, because 
the Charity-Schools are, in most instances, provided only for female 
children, being under the inspection of ladies, their founders; and the 
private schools are so expensive that many parents find it difficult to 
defray that expense; that the examination of the circumstances of the 
several parts of the town in this respect, made last July, presented a 
return by which it was found that two hundred and eighty-three, be- 
tween the ages of four and seven years, did not attend any school; but 
from inquiry of some of the gentlemen who made the returns, the Com- 
mittee are satisfied that many children of that age were omitted, their 
parents or guardians being unwilling to acknowledge that they were 
sent to no school. That the Committee, with greater confidence, rec- 
mmend the adoption of such a course, because most of the towns in 
his Commonwealth provide schools for children four years old equally 
with others, and particularly is this adhered to in the large towns of 
alem, Newburyport, and Portland; that the best mode of providing 
uch schools, seems to them to be by the guidance and direction of 
hree gentlemen from each ward, of sufficient activity, firmness, dis- 
retion and energy, to be nominated by the School Committee. 
314. The Boston School System in 1823 
(Selected from The System of Education pursued at the Free Schools in Boston, 
56 pp. Boston, 1823) 
The following description of the primary schools of Boston, in 
823, gives a good picture of the type of elementary education 
rovided in one of the leading American cities of the time. 
(a) The Primary Schools. The basis of free education in Boston is 
id in the Primary Schools, kept by women the year round, for in-
-P-A-G-E-582
re " 
556 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
structing, at the public expense, all children, of either sex, between 
four and ‘seven years of age, who may be duly sent to them. ... 
The object of these schools is to teach children to spell and read well, 
and thereby to prepare them so thoroughly for admission to the free 
reading and writing schools, which they are permitted to enter at 
seven, that the character and rank of these schools may be gradually 
raised, and thus the whole system of public instruction in the city im- 
proved from its foundations. Their number is so considerable, both 
because it is found that more than fifty or sixty children of this age 
cannot be well managed by one person, and because it is expedient to 
have such schools as near as possible to the homes of their pupils, who, 
at so tender an age, could not conveniently go far, under the most 
favorable circumstances, and would necessarily be prevented from 
attendance in bad weather. It is, in short, their object to bring the 
first rudiments of knowledge so near to the doors of those who need it, 
and make instruction in them so thorough, that all who are not deter- 
mined to keep their children in. ignorance, shall have no excuse for 
neglecting to begin the work of their education so soon and so well, as 
to have it afterwards successfully accomplished in the higher free 
schools of the city... . 
(b) The old Writing Schools. It has already been stated that the 
object of the primary schools is to qualify children for entering the 
English Grammar Schools, to which they are admissible at seven years 
of age. By the laws of the Commonwealth it is required, that “no 
- youth shall be sent to such Grammar Schools, unless they shall have 
i learned in some other school, or in some other way, to read the Eng- 
lish language, by spelling the same.”’ ‘The laws likewise provide for the 
establishment of preparatory schools where grammar is not taught, but 
for many years, previous to the establishment of the primary schools, 
there were no public schools of this description in Boston, and children, 
without much regard to age or qualifications, were received into what 
should have been grammar schools. Writing, reading, and arithme- 
tic were taught in one room, by the same master, who, being selected 
for his skill in writing, was usually incompetent to teach any thin! 
else. Grammar was not attempted, and the only reading book was th 
Bible. No provision was made for the education of females at th 
public expense; although in the other towns no such distinction wa 
made. At the close of the last century, an unusual interest was ex 
cited on the subject of education, and several important changes wer 
effected in the schools; which, as no material alterations in the syste 
have since taken place, will be understood by a description of the pres 
ent state of the schools. 
(c) The reformed school plan. These schools are separated into tw 
rooms, the"upper being occupied for the reading, and the lower for th 
writing department, the two branches being kept entirely distinc

   NEW INFLUENCES IN AMERICA 557 
Each room is provided with a master and assistant, and is calculated 
to accommodate about 300 children. From the middle of April till the 
middle of October, the girls are permitted to attend these schools; half 
the day being spent in the reading, and half. in the writing room, the 
boys changing in like manner to accommodate them. It being sup- 
posed that females would not attend during the inclement season, they 
are excluded from October to April, when the boys are divided be- 
tween the two rooms, the highest and lowest classes being separated 
from the two intermediate ones. As writing and arithmetic only are 
taught at the writing schools, the masters are selected with special ref- 
erence to their qualifications in these branches; but the law requires 
that the master of the grammar or reading school, shall have been “‘ed- 
ucated at some college or university, and be a citizen of the United 
States by birth or naturalization.” 
(d) The Reading Schools. The reading schools are subdivided into 
four classes, of which the first is the highest. The two upper classes 
are under the care of the master, and the two 
lower under his assistant; but they are over- ie AcHooNs 
looked and frequently examined by the mas- 3g 
ter. These are generally the most numerous, 15 
and attend to nothing but reading and spell- 14 
ing. The second class commit the grammar 13 
to memory, and the first apply it to practice; 2 
in some schools the second class are suff- 1

    ciently advanced to do this. Geography is 10 8 g 
taught only to the highest class, but as the 3-8 
schools are not furnished with any apparatus, a? 
less is effected in this study than might be 
with more facilities. The most promising 
children are from time to time advanced, 
and finally reach the first class; from which 
there is annually made a selection of the best 
boys, who are transferred to the English Clas- 
sical, or to the Latin Grammar School to perfect what they have 
already begun, and to pursue more advanced studies. 
(e) The Writing Schools. In the writing school the exercises are few 
land simple. The master and his assistant usually set the copies and 
ake the pens at home, or at school out of school hours. Ina few min- 
tes after the school commences, the classes in arithmetic, which con- 
ist of about one third of the school, begin to write. The scholars 
ring out their writing books, and present their exercise for examina- 
ion, and themselves for instruction two or three times before their 
xercise is completed. If the exercise be not satisfactory when finished, 
nother is required, and so on till one is accepted. After the arithme- 
icians have done writing, which is generally about an hour from the   Fic. 80. THE Boston 
ScHOOL SYSTEM IN 1823 
 
-P-A-G-E-584
  558 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
opening of the school, their books are closed, and the residue of their 
time is devoted to arithmetic. While the two first classes are thus em- 
ployed in writing, the teachers are engaged in examining their exer- 
cises, mending their pens, or hearing the boys, who do not cipher, repeat 
the tables and rules in arithmetic. For as soon as the upper classes 
begin to write, the lower classes are taken out to commit to memory 
such tables and rules in arithmetic as are proper to prepare them for 
that study. These take their turn at writing when the upper classes 
have done. Thus all have employment for the whole of school hours. 
Some use of the system of mutual instruction is also made in the writ- 
ing schools. On the first Tuesday of each month it is customary for 
the scholars to take places according to merit. The first scholar has 
the privilege of choosing a seat for the month, and likewise of selecting 
two or more young scholars to sit near, whose studies he overlooks, and 
for whose improvement and good conduct in school he is responsible. 
The next scholar does the same, and so on, as far as they are qualified 
to teach others. When we consider how many children are under the 
care of each master, we are naturally led to fear that but little attention 
can be shown to each individually, and consequently little progress 
made; but the greater number of distinguished citizens, who have 
received no other education than our public schools afforded, is the 
best proof of their utility. 
The number of children varies in the different schools, but by the 
returns made to the Committee, in July, 1823, the average number of 
boys in each school exceeded two hundred, and the girls one hundred 
and seventy. ‘The salary of the master is twelve hundred dollars, and 
that of the assistant six hundred; making the expense of tuition alone, 
about nine dollars a year for each child.

This committee, appointed by the working-men to consider the 
Pennsylvania situation, after nearly five months’ investigation 
and deliberation, made a long report on the matter. After three 
evenings spent in considering the Report, it was adopted, Feb- 
ruary 11, 1830. This Report is typical of many similar docu-

With the exception of this city and county, the city and incor- 
porated borough of Lancaster, and the city of Pittsburg, erected into 
“school districts” since 1818, it appears that the entire state is desti- 
tute of any provisions for public instruction, except those furnished by 
the enactment of 1809. This law requires the assessors of the several 
counties to ascertain and return the number of children whose parents 
are unable, through poverty, to educate them; and such children are 
permitted to be instructed at the most convenient schools at the ex- 
pense of their respective counties. 
The provisions of this act, however, are incomplete and frequently 
inoperative. They are, in some instances, but partially executed; in 
others, perverted and abused — and in many cases entirely and cul- 
pably neglected. The funds appropriated by the act, have, in some 
instances, been embezzled by fraudulent agents; and in others, partial 
returns of the children have been made, and some have been illegally 
and intentionally excluded from participating in the provisions of the

tutions, established by individuals, from mere motives of private 
speculation or gain, who are sometimes destitute of character, and fre- 
quently, of the requisite attainments and abilities. From the circum- 
stance of the schools being the absolute property of individuals, no 
supervision or effectual control can be exercised over them; hence, 
ignorance, inattention, and even immorality, prevail to a lamentable 
extent among their teachers. 
But the principles on which these “school districts” are founded, 
lare yet, in the opinion of the committees, extremely defective and in- 
fficient. Their leading feature is pauperism! They are confined, 
xclusively, to the children of the poor, while there are, perhaps, 
housands of children whose parents are unable to afford for them, a 
‘ood private education, yet whose standing, professions or connexions 
n society effectually exclude them from taking the benefit of a poor 
aw. There are great numbers, even of the poorest parents, who hold 
dependence on the public bounty to be incompatible with the rights 
nd liberties of an American citizen, and whose deep and cherished 
consciousness of independence determines them rather to starve the 
tellect of their offspring, than submit to become the objects of public 
harity. 
Another radica] and glaring defect in the existing public school sys- 
is the very limited amount of instruction it affords, even to the 
mparatively small number of youth, who enjoy its benefits. It ex- law. From a parsimonious desire of saving the county funds, the’

THE AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS     
   
     
   
         
       
      
   
   
    
  THE Readings of this chapter deal with the struggle that took 
place in the American States east of the Mississippi River and 
north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers, between about 1820 and 
1850, and which resulted there in the creation of state school sys- 
tems. The strategical points in this American struggle were the 
battles for tax support, for the elimination of the pauper-school 
idea and of the rate-bill, the prohibition of support for sectarian 
schools, the establishment of the American high school, and the 
addition of the state university to crown the educational ladder 
created. 
The first Reading (316), from one of Horace Mann’s famous 
Annual Reports, states well the necessary financial basis for school 
support. After schools had been established they frequently ex- 
perienced many difficulties, and Readings 317 and 318 illustrate 
such: The two relate to the repeal of the Connecticut School Law 
and the abolition of the State Board of Education and its Secre- 
tary, after these had been provided for by the State. The next 
selection (319) also illustrates the kind of controversies frequently 
aroused by the free-school proposal, and shows how important it 
often was to allow the opposition to talk itself out, before prog- 
ress could be made in establishing schools. 
ing 320 is typical of many ‘‘Addresses” made to the 
of the States urging legislative action, this one being an 
eloquent and convincing appeal for the abolition of the pauper- 
school idea in New Jersey. The following Reading (321) is a re- 
roduction of a typical “rate-bill,” with a warrant for its collec- 
ion. 
The next three Readings are illustrative of the controversy over 
he elimination of sectarian instruction from the schools. The 
rst (322) isa clear statement, by Horace Mann, of the fundamen- 
al principles involved in the question, he being one of the earliest 
choolmen to have to meet the religious issue publicly. The two 
ollowing (323, 324) are illustrative of the petitions and counter- 
etitions to legislatures for and against a division of the school

AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 563 
The Pilgrim Fathers, amid all their privations and dangers, con- 
ceived the magnificent idea, not only of a universal, but of a free 
education for the whole people. To find the time and the means to 
reduce this grand conception to practice, they stinted themselves, amid 
all their poverty, to a still scantier pittance; amid all their toils, they 
imposed upon themselves still more burdensome labors; and, amid all 
their perils, they braved still greater dangers. T'wo divine ideas filled 
their great hearts — their duty to God and to posterity. For-the one 
they built the church, for the other they opened the school. Religion 
and knowledge — two attributes of the same glorious and eternal 
truth, and that truth the only one on which immortal or mortal happi- 
ness can be securely founded! 
It is impossible for us adequately to conceive the boldness of the 
measure which aimed at universal education through the establishment 
of free schools. As a fact, it had no precedent in the world’s history; 
and, as a theory, it could have been refuted and silenced by a more 
formidable array of argument and experience than was ever marshalled 
against any other institution of human origin. But time has ratified 
its soundness. Two centuries of successful operation now proclaim it to 
be as wise as it was courageous, and as beneficent as it was disinterested. 
Every community in the civilized world awards it the meed of praise; 
and states at home and nations abroad, in the order of their intelligence, 
are copying the bright example. What we call the enlightened nations 
of Christendom are approaching, by slow degrees, to the moral eleva- 
tion which our ancestors reached at a single bound... . 
     
      
                                             
    
     
      
     
     
     
   
      
   
   
          
      
   In later times, and since the achievement of American independence, 
the universal and ever-repeated argument in favor of free schools has 
been that the general intelligence which they are capable of diffusing, 
and which can be imparted by no other human instrumentality, is in- 
dispensable to the continuance of a republican government. This 
argument, it is obvious, assumes, as a postulatum, the superiority of a 
republican over all other forms of government; and, as a people, we 
religiously believe in the soundness both of the assumption and of the 
argument founded upon it. But, if this be all, then a sincere mon- 
archist, or a defender of arbitrary power, or a believer in the divine 
right of kings, would oppose free schools for the Sea reasons we 
offer in their behalf. . 
Again, the eapedienty of free schools is sometimes advocated on 
grounds of political economy. An educated people is always a more in- 
dustrious and productive people. Intelligence is a primary ingredient 
in the wealth of nations. . . . The moralist, too, takes up the argument 
lof the economist.. He demonstrates that vice and crime are not only 
rodigals and spendthrifts of their own, but defrauders and plunderers 
f the means of others, that they would seize upon all the gains of hon-

est industry and exhaust the bounties of Heaven itself without satia- 
ting their rapacity; and that often in the history of the world whole 
generations might have been trained to industry and virtue by the 
wealth which one enemy to his race has destroyed. 
And yet, notwithstanding these views have been presented a thou- 
sand times with irrefutable logic, and with a divine eloquence of truth 
which it would seem that nothing but combined stolidity and depravity 
could resist, there is not at the present time [1846], with the exception of 
the States of New England and a few small communities elsewhere, a 
country or a state in Christendom which maintains a system of free 
schools for the education of its children. . . . 
I believe that this amazing dereliction from duty, especially in our 
own country, originates more in the false notions which men entertain 
respecting the nature of their right to property than in anything else. In 
the district school meeting, in the town meeting, in legislative halls, 
everywhere, the advocates for a more generous education could carry 
their respective audiences with them in behalf of increased privileges 
for our children, were it not instinctively foreseen that increased privi- 
leges must be followed by increased taxation. Against this obstacle, 
argument falls dead. The rich man who has no children declares that 
the exaction of a contribution from him to educate the children of his 
neighbor is an invasion of his rights of property. The man who has 
reared and educated a family of children denounces it as a double tax 
when he is called upon to assist in educating the children of others also; 
or, if he has reared his own children without educating them, he thinks 
it peculiarly oppressive to be obliged to do for others what he refrained 
from doing even for himself. Another, having children, but disdaining 
to educate them with the common mass, withdraws them from the 
public school, puts them under what he calls “‘selecter influences,” and 
then thinks it a grievance to be obliged to support a school which he 
contemns. Or, if these different parties so far yield to the force of 
traditionary sentiment and usage, and to the public opinion around 
them, as to consent to do something for the cause, they soon reach the 
limit of expense at which their admitted obligation or their alleged 
charity terminates. 
It seems not irrelevant, therefore, in this connection, and for the pur- 
pose of strengthening the foundation on which our free-school system 
reposes, to inquire into the nature of a man’s right to the property he 
possesses, and to satisfy ourselves respecting the question whether any 
man has such an indefeasible title to his estates or such an absolute 
ownership of them as renders it unjust in the government to assess upon 
him his share of the expenses of educating the children of the commu- 
nity up to such a point as the nature of the institutions under which he 
lives, and the well-being of society, require.  
-P-A-G-E-591
    AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 565 
I bring my argument on this point, then, to a close; and I present a 
test of its validity, which, as it seems to me, defies denial or evasion. 
In obedience to the laws of God and to the laws of all civilized com- 
munities, society is bound to protect the natural life of children; and 
this natural life cannot be protected without the appropriation and use 
of a portion of the property which society possesses. We prohibit in- 
fanticide under penalty of death. We practice a refinement in this 
particular. The life of an infant is inviolable, even before he is born; 
and he who feloniously takes it, even before birth, is as subject to the 
extreme penalty of the law as though he had struck down manhood in 
its vigor, or taken away a mother by violence from the sanctuary of 
home where she blesses her offspring. But why preserve the natural 
life of a child, why preserve unborn embryos of life, if we do not intend 
to watch over and to protect them, and to expand their subsequent 
existence into usefulness and happiness? As individuals, or as an or- 
ganized community, we have no natural right, we can derive no au- 
thority or countenance from reason, we can cite no attribute or purpose 
of the divine nature, for giving birth to any human being, and then in- 
flicting upon that being the curse of ignorance, of poverty, and of vice, 
with all their attendant calamities. We are brought, then, to this 
startling but inevitable alternative, — the natural life of an infant 
should be extinguished as soon as it is born, or the means should be 
provided to save that life from being a curse to its possessor; and, there- 
fore, every State is morally bound to enact a code of laws legalizing and 
enforcing infanticide or a code of laws establishing free schools. 
The three following propositions, then, describe the broad and ever- 
during foundation on which the common-school system of Massachu- 
setts reposes 
The successive generations of men, taken collectively, constitute one 
great commonwealth. 
The property of this commonwealth is pledged for the education of 
allits youth, up to such a point as will save them from poverty and vice, 
and prepare them for the adequate performance of their social and 
civil duties. . 
The successive holders of this property are trustees, bound to the 
faithful execution of their trust by the most sacred obligations; and 
embezzlement and pillage from children and descendants have not less 
of criminality, and have more of meanness, than the same offences when 
perpetrated against contemporaries.

      lature of Connecticut, under the inspiration of Henry Barnard, 
one of its members, created a similar board. Henry Barnard was 
appointed its first Secretary, and from 1838 to 1842 gave his best 
efforts to the creation of an educational sentiment and to the es- 
tablishment and improvement of schools in Connecticut, for the 
munificent salary of $3.00 a day. What promised to be the be- 
ginning of a new era in education in that State was soon cut short 
by a succeeding Legislature, acting under the inspiration of a 
Governor opposed to the new ideas. In his message to the 
Connecticut Legislature, in May, 1842, Governor Cleveland 
said: 
An opinion was advanced some years since, calling in question, to 
some extent, the beneficial influence of the School Fund, as it has been 
applied; and the Legislature, by way of experiment, established a 
Board of Commissioners of Common Schools; and, under the belief that 
some essential improvements might be made, an officer has been em- 
ployed, at considerable expense, to visit the various schools in the State 
with reference to their improvement. As a part of the same plan, pro- 
vision was subsequently made by law for paying the visitors of the dis- 
trict schools one dollar a day for their services. The reason for the 
imposition of this tax, which, when the number of districts and com- 
mittee-men is considered, will appear to be a considerable sum, has 
never been apparent. From time immemorial, it has been deemed 
a part of the obligations which competent men owed to society, to at- 
tend to these duties; and no inconvenience had ever been experienced. 
Until the spirit of benevolence and good-will to men shall cease to burn 
in the hearts of our people, I anticipate no difficulty in following, in 
this respect, in the path of our fathers. Without questioning the mo- 
tives of those by whom these experiments were suggested and adopted, 
I think it obvious, that the public expectations, in regard to their con- 
sequences, have not been realized; and that to continue them, will be 
only to entail upon the State a useless expense. In conformity with 
this opinion, and in obedience to what I believe to be the public senti- 
ment, I recommend the repeal of these laws. 
   In addition the Governor successfully used his personal influ- 
ence with the members of the Legislature, and secured the repeal 
of the law creating the Board, the abolition of the Union-Schools 
law, and other progressive legislation. The Union-Schools law 
was regarded as a ‘dangerous innovation,” because it “created by 
law schools of a higher order.’

318. Horace Mann on the Repeal of the Connecticut Law 
(Massachusetts Common School Journal, 1846. Reproduced in Barnard’s 
American Journal of Education, vol. 1, p. 719) 
After commenting on the progress of education in Rhode Is- 
land, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts, 
Mann has the following to say of Connecticut. 
One only of the New: England States proves recreant to duty in this 
glorious cause — the State of Connecticut. Favored for half a cen- 
tury, in the munificence of her endowments, beyond any of her New 
England sisters, she is the only one which, for the last few years, has 
not merely been stationary, but has absolutely retrograded; and now, 
if she promises to be useful at all, it is as a warning and not as an ex- 
ample. A common ancestry, an identity of general interests and pur- 
suits, a similar position in regard to the other States of the Union, anda 
similar duty to furnish them with high example and encouragement, 
has led us all to expect that we should have, not only the sympathy, but 
the active codperation, of Connecticut, in this common cause. We not 
only expected it, we believed it. Events seemed auspicious. The year 
after the Massachusetts Board of Education was established, an organ- 
ization almost identical in its form, and entirely so in its object, was 
created in Connecticut. For carrying out its measures of reform and 
improvement, an agent was selected — Henry Barnard, Esquire — of 
whom it is not extravagant to say that, if a better man be required, we 
must wait, at least, until the next generation, for a better one is not to 
be found in the present. This agent entered upon his duties with un- 
bounded zeal. He devoted to their discharge his time, talents, and 
means. The cold torpidity of the State soon felt the sensations of re- 
turning vitality. Its half-suspended animation began to quicken with 
a warmer life. Much and most valuable information was diffused. 
Many parents began to appreciate more adequately what it is to be a 
parent. Teachers were awakened. Associations for mutual improve- 
ment were formed. System began to supersede confusion. Some 
salutary laws were enacted. All things gave favorable augury of a 
prosperous career. And it may be further affirmed, that the cause was 
so administered as to give occasion of offence to no one. The whole 
movement was kept aloof from political strife. All religious men had 
reason to rejoice that a higher tone of religious and moral feeling was 
making its way into the schools, without giving occasion of jealousy to 
the one-sided views of any denomination. But all these auguries of 
good were delusive. In an evil hour the whole fabric was overthrown. 
The Educational Board was abolished. Of course, the office of its 
devoted and faithful Secretary fell with it. As if this were not enough, 
the remedial laws which had been enacted during the brief existence of 
 
-P-A-G-E-594
         568 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the Board, and which might have continued and diffused their benefits 
‘without the Board, were spitefully repealed. 
The whole educational movement in Connecticut, or rather, the body 
in which the vital movement had begun, was paralyzed by this stroke. 
Once or twice, since, it has attempted to rise, but has fallen back pros- 
trate as before. 
  319. The Struggle for Free Schools in Norwich, Connecticut 
(Address by the Reverend J. P. Gulliver, at the inauguration of the Norwich Free 
Academy. In Annual Report of the Superintendent of Common Schools of Connec- 
ticut, 1856) 
The following selection is illustrative of the slow and patient 
struggle that had to be carried on by those favoring the estab- 
lishment and improvement of schools, often allowing the opposi- 
tion to talk itself out before any substantial progress in developing 
or improving schools could be made. What was true for Norwich 
was true for many other places, in the middle of the nineteenth 
century. 
Movements were commenced about twenty years since, for a re- 
organization of the public schools of the Second School Society of Nor- 
wich. The usual opposition, originated by a few narrow-minded tax- 
payers, and fanned into life by ambitious demagogues, was arrayed 
against the measure, and it was finally defeated. The whole commu- 
nity had, however, been agitated with the subject, and much good seed 
had been sown, which has since borne beautiful fruit. For ten years 
the citizens of Norwich made the best they could of a set of disjointed 
schools, thrown together with scarcely any attempt at gradation, 
governed by six independent districts, and some forty school officers, 
and supported entirely without taxation. Good men labored hard; but 
almost in vain, to secure for the people, under the existing system, good 
schools. 
An effort was then made, with still greater earnestness, to improve 
the schools, without any attempt at re-organization. They were regu- 
larly visited. A monthly meeting of the visitors was held, at which the 
condition of each school was minutely reported. Every possible effort 
was made to elevate the schools. The success was, however, but par- 
tial. After a trial of two years, the gentlemen, whose valuable time had 
been given to the effort, came unanimously to the conclusion that with- 
out a consolidation of at least the more central school districts, and the 
thorough grading of the schools, and the taxation of property for the 
support of schools, this labor would be thrown away, The board, ac- 
cordingly laid before the school society a proposition for inaugurating 
such a change. This was the signal for a storm! A few (but only a
-P-A-G-E-595
  AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 569 
few) of the heavy tax-payers were the first to smell treason. They 
passed the word to a set of men, who flourish in their own esteem, by 
exhibiting their powers in thwarting what others attempt to do. The 
usual cry was raised, “a school for the rich!” The prejudices of poor 
men were appealed to. This class, who were to be most benefited 
by the change, were excited to oppose it. Men who had been paying - 
rate bills for years, clamored against the proposition to support schools 
by taxing property. Parents, who had bitterly complained that their 
children could not be as well educated as those of the wealthy, refused 
to accept a plan which was to bring the highest order of schools within 
their reach, at a mere nominal expense. The intelligent portion of the 
community were, however, thoroughly aroused. Meeting after meet- 
ing was held. Crowds attended and listened to the discussions. 
Light was rapidly diffused. The opposition became desperate. All 
manner of offensive personalities were made use of to intimidate those 
who were inclined to be champions of the good cause. Still, it was ap- 
parent, by incidental votes, that a large and an incredsing majority 
were in favor of the proposed change. This majority, however, for- 
bore to press the question to a decisive vote. They publicly avowed 
their intention to postpone final action, until the whole community 
should have fully examined the question, and arrived at an intelligent 
decision upon it. 
This concession was taken advantage of. At an adjourned meeting 
where it was generally understood no decisive action was to take place, 
the opposition collected a large force, very many of whom were not 
legal voters, and, in the absence of the great body of the friends of the 
measure, voted the indefinite postponement of the whole subject. No 
sooner had this been accomplished than a general regret was expressed 
at the result, even among those who had boisterously aided in the move- 
ment. Many declared, that had they expected to succeed, they would 
not have opposed the measure. Their leaders, instead of receiving the 
coveted meed of applause from their followers, for the victory, were 
overwhelmed with reproaches. In these circumstances, the friends of 
reform judged it wise to cease all further agitation of the subject, and to 
leave the responsibility of the consequences upon those who had chosen 
to assume it. The administration of the schools was accordingly left 
in their hands. They appointed such officers as they chose, and no 
attempt was made in any form, for two years, to interfere with their 
wishes. During this time, the schools sunk to a lower level than ever. 
Even the most ignorant and prejudiced could not fail to see and feel the 
evil. The attendance constantly diminished, until it was ascertained 
that only about one-third of the children, between the ages of four and 
sixteen, attended school at all. The feeling of the community on the 
subject was becoming intense. The attention of the people having 
been so thoroughly aroused by previous discussion, every defect was 
 
-P-A-G-E-596
          570 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  seen as in a focal light. Those who had been distinguished as the 
leaders in the effort to defeat the proposed reforms, found themselves 
in a most uncomfortable position. They were daily reproached as the 
authors of all the mischief. 
The first fruit of this ripened public sentiment, was a movement for 
the endowment of a free high school. Every attempt to improve the 
lower schools had been met by the cry, “ You want a high school! You 
want a school for the rich, and mean to tax the poor to pay for it!” 
Some thirty-five individuals accordingly determined that they would 
unite and establish a high school and endow it, which should be open, 
free of all charge, to all classes. This effort was successful, some eighty- 
five thousand dollars having been subscribed for that purpose. It was 
generally understood that as soon as this subscription was complete, a 
new appeal was to be made to the school society to acknowledge this 
magnificent donation, by re-organizing their lower schools on thé plan 
previously rejected. Before this plan could be carried out, it was 
ascertained that the leaders in the former opposition were moving in the 
same direction, and were about to propose the same thing! Most 
gladly the friends of reform left the business in their hands. The result 
was, that a consolidation of the two central districts of the city was 
effected, a vote was passed, unanimously, to purchase one of the most 
valuable lots in the city, and to erect a noble structure three stories in 
height. . Soon after, the provisions of the new school law were accepted, 
a Board of Education was appointed, the ablest teachers were engaged 
at liberal salaries, a perfect gradation of schools established, and every 
provision made for the institution of the very best system of public 
education. é 
320. ‘‘The State and Education” 
(An “Address to the People of New Jersey,”’ adopted by the Convention as- 
sembled in Trenton, January 27 and 28, 1838) 
Written by the Right Reverend George W. Doane, of the Pro- 
testant Episcopal Church, chairman of a committee of nine ap- 
pointed to draft the ‘‘ Address,” by ‘the most notable convention 
of the friends of the common schools ever held in the State.” 
This ‘“‘ Address”’ so aroused the people that a new law establishing 
a partial school system was secured, and six years later a new 
state constitution made provision for the creation of a non-pauper 
state school system. Two important features of the Address 
attract attention, — the emphasis upon education for state ends, 
and the utter repudiation of the pauper-school idea which had 
characterized New Jersey education since 1830. 
We were appointed by the convention of your own delegates to ad- 
dress you on the subject of common schools. We approach you with

                                 solicitude, as deeply sensible of the great importance of the interest 
intrusted to us, yet, as freemen speaking to freemen, with prevailing 
confidence. 
The points which we propose for your attention, and, if we might, 
would press into every heart, are few, simple, and practical; the neces- 
sary consequences, it seems to us, from principles which all admit. We 
say that knowledge is the universal right of man, and we need bring no 
clearer demonstration than that intellectual nature, capable of it, thirst- 
ing for it, expanding and aspiring with it, which is God’s own argument 
in every living soul; we say that the assertion for himself of this in- 
herent right, to the full measure of his abilities and opportunities, is 
the universal duty of man, and that whoever fails of it thwarts the de- 
sign of his Creator, and, in proportion as he neglects the gift of God, 
dwarfs and enslaves and brutifies the high capacity for truth and liberty 
which he inherits. And all experience and every page of history con- 
proved of ignorance and vice with wretchedness and slavery. And we 
say, further, that the security of this inherent right to every individual, 
and its extension, in the fullest measure, to the greatest number, is the 
universal interest of man; so that they who deny or abridge it to their 
fellows, or who encourage, or, from want of proper influence, permit 
them to neglect it, are undermining the foundations of government, 
weakening the hold of society, and preparing the way for that unset- 
tling and dissolving of all human institutions which must result in an- 
archy and ruin, and in which they who have the greatest stake must be 
the greatest sufferers. .. . 
If the truth of these positions be established their application is self- 
evident, and there never was a nation since the world was made in 
which their obligation was so clear or its application so important. In 
the theory of our Constitution the people are the governors. In prac- 
tice they ought to be. And is ignorance the qualification for good 
government? Would you select a man to make your laws who can not 
read, or one who can not write to execute them? Yet the authority 
which they exercise and the abuses of which they are capable are noth- 
ing in comparison with theirs from whom all power proceeds, and 
without whose permission no wrong can be done.. Fellow-citizens, we 
are republicans. Our country is our Commonwealth. We all have an 
equal share in her. Her laws are alike for the protection of all. Her 
institutions are alike for the advantage of all. Her blessings are our 
common privilege. Her glory is our common pride. But common 
privileges impose a common responsibility, and equal rights can never 
be disjoined from equal duties. The Constitution, which under God 
secures our liberties, is in the keeping of us all. It is a sacred trust 
which no man can delegate. He holds it for himself not only, but for 
his children, for posterity, and for the world, and he who can not read firm the assertion, in the close kindred which has everywhere been.

it, who does not understand its provisions, who could not on a just 
occasion assert its principles, no more sustains the character of an 
American citizen than the man who would not seal it with his blood. 
It is in vain to say that education is a private matter, and that it is 
the duty of every parent to provide for the instruction of his own 
children. Intheoryitisso. But there are some who can not and there 
are more who will not make provision. And the question, then, is, 
Shall the State suffer from individual inability or from individual neg- 
lect? When the child who has not been trained up in the way in which 
he ought to go commits a crime against the State, the law, with iron 
hand, comes in between the parent and his offspring and takes charge 
of the offender. And shall there be provision to punish only and 
none to prevent? Shall the only offices in which this State is known 
be those of jailer or executioner? Shall she content herself with the 
stern attributes of justice and discard the gentler ministries of mercy? 
It was said of Draco’s laws that they were writ with blood. Is it less 
true of any State which makes provision for the whipping post, the 
penitentiary, the scaffold, and leaves the education of her children to 
individual effort or precarious charity? .. . 
If the positions be maintained that the education of the people is 
indispensable to the preservation of free institutions, and that it is 
therefore the duty of every free State to provide for the education of 
her children, we are prepared, fellow-citizens, for the inquiry, How 
far has provision been made for the discharge of this duty in the State 
with which we are most intimately connected, — the State of New 
Jersey? That the duty of making some provision for this end has long 
been recognized, the twenty-one years which have elapsed since the 
passage of the first act “to create a fund for the support of free schools” 
sufficiently attest. That what has been done is insufficient, you have 
yourselves borne witness. . . . 
Omitting all considerations . . . of what has been or of what may be 
legislative enactments on the subject, we address you as the sovereign 
people, and we say that it is your duty and your highest interest to 
provide and to maintain, within the reach of every child, the means of 
such an education as will qualify him to discharge the duties of a citizen 
of the Republic, and will enable him, by subsequent exertion, in the 
free exercise of the unconquerable will, to attain the highest eminence 
in knowledge and in power which God may place within his reach. We 
utterly repudiate as unworthy, not of freemen only, but of men, the 
narrow notion that there is to be an education for the poor as such. 
Has God provided for the poor a coarser earth, a thinner air, a paler 
sky? Does not the glorious sun pour down his golden flood as cheerily 
upon the poor man’s hovel as upon the rich man’s palace? Have not 
the cotter’s children as keen a sense of all the freshness, verdure, fra- 
grance, melody, and beauty of luxuriant nature as the pale sons of
-P-A-G-E-599
  AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 573 
kings? Or is it on the mind that God has stamped the imprint of a 
baser birth, so that the poor man’s child knows with an inborn cer- 
tainty that his lot is to crawl, not climb? It is not so. God has not 
done it. Men can not do it. Mind is immortal. Mind is imperial. 
It bears no mark of high or low, of rich or poor. It needs no bound of 
time or place, or rank or circumstance. It asks but freedom. It re- 
quires but light. It is heaven born, and it aspires to heaven. Weak- 
ness does not enfeeble it. Poverty can not repress it. Difficulties do 
but stimulate its vigor. And the poor tallow chandler’s son that sits 
up all the night to read the book which an apprentice lends him, lest 
the master’s eye should miss it in the morning, shall stand and treat 
with kings, shall add new provinces to the domain of science, shall bind 
the lightning with a hempen cord and bring it harmless from the skies. 
The common school is common, not as inferior, not as the school for 
poor men’s children, but as the light and air are common. It ought to 
be the best school because it is the first school. . . . 
Fellow-citizens, it is for you to say what shall be the present charac- 
ter, what shall be the future destiny of New Jersey. We have indeed 
a goodly heritage, but it has been long and shamefully neglected. We 
have undervalued our privileges. We have overlooked our duties. 
We have been content to be a pendent merely, when we ought to be an 
independent State. There is now, thank God, the sound as of a trum- 
pet in the land that stirs the old heroic blood. We feel the remnant 
sparks of the forgotten fire which warmed our fathers’ hearts. The 
spirit of the elder day is breathing on us with its quickening and invigor- 
ating power. Let us accept the omen. Let us obey the noble impulse. 
Let us arise to duty and to glory. Men of New Jersey, it is you that are 
to rise. You are the State. You create and you control the legisla- 
ture. You enact and you sustain the laws. Yours are the means. 
Yours is the influence. Yoursis the work. You make, you are the 
State. Goonas you have now begun. The system of common schools 
which shall be adopted by the present legislature, take it into your own 
hands. If it isnot what it should be, see that the next legislature make 
itsuch. Act together. Act withsystem. Actlikemen. The organi- 
zation for the purpose is complete. The general committee, the com- 
mittees of correspondence for the counties, the committees of the 
townships — there is not an inch of ground that is not reached; there is 
not a citizen of New Jersey whose heart may not be roused by this 
electric chain.

322. Horace Mann on Religious Instruction in the Schools 
(Mann, Horace, Sequel to the so-called Correspondence between ihe Rev. M. H. 
Smith and Horace Mann. Boston, 1847) 
In 1846 a Reverend Mr. Smith attacked the Massachusetts 
State Board of Education and its Secretary, Mr. Mann, in a ser- 
mon entitled “The Ark of God on a New Cart.” In this sermon 
he claimed that the increase in crime and immorality was due to 
the ‘‘Godless schools,” sponsored by Mr. Mann and the State 
Board. Mr. Mann and the Reverend Mr. Smith exchanged two 
letters each on the question, and then Smith published the sermon 
and the correspondence in a book entitled The Bible, the Rod, and 
Religion in Common Schools. To this Mann published a Sequel, 
etc., of fifty-six pages, in which he judiciously examined the ques- 
tion at issue. He said he stood firmly for the reading of the Bible in 
the schools, but without comment; examined the matter in its dif- 
ferent aspects; and in the concluding portion of the pamphlet said: 
It is easy to see that the exper’ ment would not stop with having half 
a dozen conflicting creeds taught by authority of law in the different 
schools of the same town or vicinity. Majorities will change in the 
same place. One sect may have the ascendency to-day; another to- 
morrow. This year there will be three Persons in the Godhead; next 
year but one; and the third year the Trinity will be restored to hold its 
precarious sovereignty until it shall be again dethroned by the worms of 
the dust it has made. This year, the everlasting fires of hell will burn 
to terrify the impenitent; next year, and without any repentance, its 
eternal flames will be extinguished, to be rekindled forever, or to be 
quenched forever as it may be decided at annual town meetings. This 
year, under Congregational rule, the Rev. Mr. So and So and the Rey. 
Dr. So and So will be on the committee; but next year these reverends 
and reverend doctors will be plain misters, never having had apostolic 
consecration from the bishop. This year the ordinance of baptism is 
inefficacious without immersion; next year one drop of water will be as 
good as forty fathoms. Children attending the district school will be 
taught one way; going from the district school to the high schoo! they 
will be taught another way. In controversies involving such momen- 
tous interests, the fiercest party spirit will rage, and all the contem- 
plations of heaven be poisoned by the passions of earth. Will not 
town lines and school district lines be altered, to restore an unsuccessful 
or to defeat a successful party? Will not fiery zealots move from 
place to place, to turn the theological scale, as it is said is sometimes 
now done to turn a political one? And will not the godless make a 
merchandise of religion by being bribed to do the same thing? Can 
       
            
-P-A-G-E-602
    576 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  aught be conceived more deplorable, more fatal to the interests of the 
young than this? Such strifes and persecutions on the question of 
total depravity as to make all men depraved at any rate; and such 
contests about the nature and the number of persons in the Godhead 
in heaven, as to make little children atheists on earth. 
If the question, “ What theology shall be taught in school?” is to be 
decided by districts or towns, then all the prudential and the superin- 
tending school committees must be chosen with express reference to 
their faith; the creed of every candidate for teaching must be investi- 
gated; and when litigations arise — and such a system will breed them 
in swarms — an ecclesiastical tribunal, some star chamber, or high 
commission court must be created to decide them. If the governor is 
to have power to appoint the judges of this spiritual tribunal, he also 
must be chosen with reference to the appointments he will make, and 
so, too, must the legislators who are to define their power, and to give 
them the purse and sword of the State, to execute their authority. 
Call such officers by the name of judge and governor, or cardinal and 
pope, the thing will be the same. The establishment of the true faith 
will not stop with the schoolroom. Its grasping jurisdiction will ex- 
tend over all schools, over all private faith and public worship, until at 
last, after all our centuries of struggle and of suffering, it will come 
back to the inquisition, the faggot, and the rack. 
Let me ask here, too, where is the consistency of those who advocate 
the right of a town or a district to determine, by a majority, what the- 
ology shall be taught in the schools, but deny the same right to the 
State? Does not this inconsistency blaze out into the faces of such 
advocates so as to make them feel, if they are too blind to see? This 
would be true, even if the State had written out the theology it would 
enforce. But ours has not. It has only said that no one sect shall 
obtain any advantage over other sects by means of the school system, 
which, for purposes of self-preservation, it has established.    
     
     
     323. Petition for a Division of the School Funds 
(Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for Michigan, 1853, pp. 190-91) 
The following petition to the Legislature of Michigan, in 1853, 
by the Catholics of Detroit, is typical of petitions of the time to 
Legislatures in other States. This petition contains an interesting 
sectarian definition of free schools and liberty in instruction. It 
was met with a counter-petition from the Protestant Episcopal 
Bishop for the Diocese of Michigan (R. 324), and the matter was 
threshed out before the Legislature. Committees of both the 
Senate and the House made reports opposing division, and the 
Legislature took no further action on the request.

  AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 577 
Memorial to the Legislature relative to a division of the School Fund 
We, the undersigned, citizens of Michigan, respectfully represent to 
your Honorable Body, that we have labored, and are still laboring 
under grievances to which neither Justice nor Patriotism require longer 
submission on our part, without an effort for their removal. 
We, your petitioners, wish to represent to your Honorable Body, 
that notwithstanding the Constitution guarantees liberty of conscience 
to every citizen of the State, yet our Public School laws compel us to 
violate our conscience, or deprive us unjustly of our share of the Public 
School Funds, and also impose on us taxes for the support of schools, 
which, as a matter of conscience? we cannot allow our children to at- 
tend. 
To convince your Honorable Body of the magnitude of these griev- 
ances, we have but to refer you to the fact, that in the cities of Monroe 
and Detroit alone, there are educated at the expense of their parents, 
and charitable contributions, some 2500 of our children. Your peti- 
tioners might bear longer their present grievances, hoping that our 
fellow-citizens would soon discover the injustice done to us by the pres- 
ent School laws, and that the love of public justice for which they are 
distinguished, would prompt them to protest against laws which are 
self-evidently a violation of liberty of conscience, a liberty which is 
equally dear to every American citizen; but, as the new Constitution 
requires that free schools be established in every district of our State, 
and as the present Legislature will be called upon to act upon the sub- 
ject, your petitioners consider that their duty to themselves, their duty 
to their children, and their duty to their country, the liberties of which 
they are morally and religiously bound to defend, as well as their duty 
to their God, require that they apprise your Honorable Body of the 
oppressive nature of our present School laws, the injustice of which is 
equalled only by the laws of England, which compel the people of all 
denominations to support a church, the doctrines of which they do not 
believe. 
Your petitioners would not wish to be understood as being opposed to 
education; on the contrary they are prepared to bear every reasonable 
burden your Honorable Body are willing to impose on them, to promote 
the cause of education, providing that our schools be free indeed. But 
they do not consider schools free when the law imposes on parents the 
necessity of giving their children such an education as their conscience 
cannot approve of. But that your Honorable Body may not be igno- 
rant of what they understand by free schools, your petitioners wish to 
say that in their opinions, schools can be free only, when the business of 
school teaching be placed on the same legal footing as the other learned 
professions, when all may teach who will, their success depending, as in 
other cases, on their fitness for their profession, and the satisfaction
-P-A-G-E-604
  578 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
that they may render to the public; that in all cases the parent be left 
free to choose the teacher to whom he will entrust the education of his 
child, as he is left to choose his physician, his lawyer, etc.; that each 
person teaching any public school in the State should be entitled to 
draw from the public school fund, such sums as the law might provide 
for every child so taught by the month, quarter, or otherwise, on pro- 
ducing such evidence as the law might require in such cases. Schools | 
established on such principles are what your petitioners understand by 
free schools. 
Your petitioners, therefore, respectfully urge that the public school 
system for our State, be based on these broad democratic principles of 
equal liberty to all, allowing freedom of conscience to the child, who also 
has a conscience, as well as to the instructor and parent. And your 
petitioners will ever pray. 
324. Counter-Petition against Division 
(Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for Michigan, 1853, p. 205) 
To’'the preceding petition for a division of the school funds, 
Samuel A. McCoskry, Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church 
in the Diocese of Michigan, entered the following counter-peti- 
tion: 
The undersigned is the Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 
the Diocese of Michigan: He has learned from the public newspapers, 
and from petitions about to be presented to your honorable bodies, 
that an application is to be made for a division of the school fund of 
this State, so that “in all cases the parent be left free to choose the 
teacher to whom he will entrust the education of his child.” Such ap- 
plication (if granted) he considers as giving the right not only to par- 
ents, but to every religious body, to select teachers who will teach the 
peculiarities of the religious views of opinions they may hold. It will 
place the school fund of this State in the hands of religious bodies or 
sects, and entrust to them the education of the children of the-State; 
for the right, if given to one, will be claimed by each and all. What- 
ever opinion the writer may entertain in reference to the system and 
effects of the common-school education, he begs leave to say, that he 
has no wish or desire to interfere with, or in any way alter, or abridge 
the system which has been the pride of the State, and which has fur- 
nished to so many thousands of her children the means of obtaining a 
high secular education; nor does he wish that the fund so generously 
granted to the people of the State, and so carefully guarded by her 
Legislature, and so highly prized by her citizens, should be used for| 
the promotion of sectarian strife and bitterness. 
It is one of the distinguishing features of our free institutions, an
-P-A-G-E-605
  AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 579 
which lies at the foundation of happiness and freedom of the people, 
that neither religious tests nor religious preferences form any part of 
our legislation. All religious bodies are placed on precisely the same 
footing, and whatever may be the exclusive claims of each and all, they 
can be settled only by an appeal to a higher and different authority 
than State legislatures. But if your honorable bodies see fit to over- 
turn and destroy that system which has been heretofore so carefully 
guarded, and which has introduced into every occupation and profes- 
sion, some of the most distinguished men of the State, and which has 
brought to the door of the poor man the means of educating his chil- 
dren; and if the Priests and Clergymen of every religious body are to 
take the place of the common-school teacher, and the State is to as- 
sume the duty, through them, of extending and building up religious 
differences, and of fomenting strife and contention, then, the under- 
signed (most reluctantly) would claim to have a share in this work. 
If then such a change is to be made in our common-school law, so as to 
allow parents to choose teachers for their children, the undersigned 
would respectfully ask for his proportion of the common-school fund, so 
that the people entrusted to his spiritual oversight may employ such 
teachers as will fully carry out their religious preferences. He would 
freely and frankly state to your honorable bodies that the amount thus 
granted, shall be carefully used in teaching the principles and doctrines 
of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and that the services of as many 
clergymen and laymen of the Church will be secured and used, so that 
no other principles and doctrines shall find any place in the different 
schools.

lemies in towns and cities. A body of citizens was constituted the 
‘‘ corporation,”’ with power to establish and conduct the school. 
ome of these school corporations still exist, though most of them 
ave been turned over to the towns or cities and merged with or 
come the public high schools.

requisite and convenient for the purposes of a school; to sue and to be 
sued; defend and be defended, in all courts and places whatsoever; may 
have a common seal, and change and alter the same at their discretion; 
appoint proper officers and agents; elect residents of said town of Nor- 
wich, to fill the vacancies occurring in their number by death, resigna- 
tion, or removal from said town, so that hereafter the number of said 
corporators shall be maintained at twenty-five, when from any of these 
causes it shall be reduced below that number; and make such regula- 
tions, rules and by-laws, as they shall deem expedient, to carry out the 
objects of the corporation, not inconsistent with the laws of this State 
or of the United States. 
Provided always, that this resolve may be altered, amended, or re- 
pealed by the General Assembly.   326. The Establishment of the First American High School 
(Report of the School Committee to the Town Meeting of Boston, January, 1821) 
In 1818 Boston had extended its school system downward to 
include Primary Schools, and in 1820 steps were taken to extend 
it upward for those not destined for the Latin Grammar School 
and College. In October, 1820, the School 
Committee voted “that it is expedient to 
establish an English Classical School in the 
Town of Boston.” The matter was sub- 
mitted to a town meeting in January, 1821, 
in the form of the Report which follows, 
and by an almost unanimous vote the 
School Committee was instructed to estab- 
lish the school. The school opened in May, 
1821, as the English Classical School, and 
in 1824 the name was changed to that of 
the English High School. The report, as| 
adopted, reads: 
  Fic. 81. THE First Hich

STATES Though the present system of public edu 
Established in Boston —_ cation, and the munificence with which i 
nea is supported, are highly beneficial and hon. 
orable to the town; yet, in the opinion of the Committee, it is sus: 
ceptible of a greater degree of perfection and usefulness, withou 
materially augmenting the weight of the public burdens. Till r
-P-A-G-E-607

   cently, our system occupied a middle station: it neither commenced 
with the rudiments of Education, nor extended to the higher branches 
of knowledge. This system was supported by the Town at a very 
great expense, and to be admitted to its advantages, certain prelimi- 
nary qualifications were required at individual cost, which have the ' 
effect of excluding many children of the poor and unfortunate classes 
of the community from the benefits of a public education. The 
Town saw and felt this inconsistency in the plan, and have removed 
the defect by providing Schools (Primary) in which the children of 
the poor can be fitted for admission into the public seminaries. 
The present system, in the opinion of the Committee, requires still 
further amendment. ‘The studies that are pursued at the English 
grammar schools are merely elementary, and more time than is neces- 
sary is devoted to their acquisition. Avscholar is admitted at seven, 
and is dismissed at fourteen years of age; thus, seven years are ex- 
pended in the acquisition of a degree of knowledge, which with ordinary 
diligence and a common capacity, may be easily and perfectly acquired 
in five. If then, a boy remain the usual term, a large portion of the 
time will have been idly or uselessly expended, as he may have learned 
all that he may have been taught long before its expiration. This loss 
of time occurs at that interesting and critical period of life, when the 
habits and inclinations are forming by which the future character will 
be fixed and determined. This evil, therefore, should be removed, by 
enlarging the present system, not merely that the time now lost may 
be saved, but that those early habits of industry and application may 
be acquired, which are so essential in leading to a future life of virtue 
and usefulness. 
Nor are these the only existing evils. The mode of education now 
adopted, and the branches of knowledge that are taught at our English 
grammar schools, are not sufficiently extensive nor otherwise calculated 
to bring the powers of the mind into operation nor to qualify a youth to 
fill usefully and respectably many of those stations, both public and 
private, in which he may be placed. A parent who wishes to give a 
child an education that shall fit him for active life, and shall serve as 
a foundation for eminence in his profession, whether Mercantile or 
Mechanical, is under the necessity of giving him a different education 
from any which our public schools can now furnish. Hence, many 
children are separated from their parents and sent to private academies 
in this vicinity, to acquire that instruction which cannot be obtained at 
the public seminaries. Thus, many parents, who contribute largely to - 
the support of these institutions, are subjected to heavy expense for 
ithe same object, in other towns. 
The Committee, for these and many other weighty considerations 
that might be offered, and in order to render the present system of 
ublic education more nearly perfect, are of the opinion that an addi-
-P-A-G-E-608
  582 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
tional School is required. They therefore recommend the founding of 
a seminary which shall be called the English Classical School, and sub- 
mit the following as a general outline of a plan for its organization and 
of the course of studies to be pursued. 
1st. That the term of time for pursuing the course of studies pro- 
posed, be three years. 
2ndly, That the School be divided into three classes, and one year 
be assigned to the studies of each class. 
3rdly. That the age of admission be not ‘ess than twelve years. 
4thly. That the School be for Boys exclusively. 
5thly. That candidates for admission be proposed on a given day 
annually; but scholars with suitable qualifications may be admitted at 
any intermediate time to an advanced standing. 
6thly. That candidates for admission shall be subject to a strict 
examination, in such manner as the School Committee may direct, to 
ascertain their qualifications according to these rules. 
7thly. That it be required of every candidate, to qualify him for ad- 
mission, that he be well acquainted with reading, writing, English 
grammar in all its branches, and arithmetic as far as simple propor- 
tion. 
Sthly. That it be required of the Masters and Ushers, as a necessary 
qualification, that they shall have been regularly educated at some 
University. 
First Class: Composition; reading from the most approved authors; 
exercises in criticism, comprising critical analyses of the language, 
grammar, and style of the best English authors, their errors and beau- 
ties; Declamation; Geography; Arithmetic continued. 
Second Class: Composition, Reading, Exercises in Criticism, Decla- 
mation; Algebra; Ancient and Modern History and Chronology; 
Logic; Geometry; Plane Trigonometry, and its application to mensut- 
ation of heights and distances; Navigation; Surveying; Mensuration 
of Surfaces and Solids; Forensic Discussions. 
Third Class: Composition; Exercises in Criticism; Declamation; 
Mathematics; Logic; History, particularly that of the United States; 
Natural Philosophy, including Astronomy; Moral and Political Philos- 
ophy. 
The Report was followed by a financial statement, showing that 
the school was to employ a master, a sub-master, and two ushers 
(assistant teachers), and would cost $4000 for maintenance the 
ensuing year.

327. The Boston Secondary-School System in 1823 
(Selected from The System of Education pursued at the Free Schools in Boston, 
56 pp. Boston, 1823) 
This is a continuation of the Report given in Reading 314, and 
describes the new High School, and the old Latin Grammar 
School. 
The English Classical School 
(In 1824 renamed as the English High School) 
Public opinion and the wants of a large class of citizens of this town 
have long been calling for a school in which those, who have either not 
the desire or the means ot obtaining a classical education, might receive 
instruction in many branches of great practical importance which have 
usually been taught only at the Colleges. This led to the establish- 
ment of the English Classical School. 
This school was established by a vote of the town in 1820, expressly 
for the purpose of affording to lads, intending to become merchants or 
mechanics, better means of instruction than were provided at any of 
the public schools. A large building was erected, in a central part of 
the town, and an appropriation made of $2500, to furnish a philosophi- 
cal apparatus. It was provided that there should be four instruc- 
tors, viz. one Principal, one Sub-master, and two Ushers. A plan was 
reported for the studies of the course, including’ three years. This, 
however, was only an outline, and intended for the general guidance, 
rather than the particular direction of the instructors, as to the order 
in which the studies should be introduced, and the time which should 
be devoted to each. The instructors, accordingly, while they have 
adhered to the general intention, have, with the concurrence of the 
school committee, deviated from the plan in the disposition of the 
studies, and have introduced some studies not originally included. 
The school went into operation in May, 1821; since which time, one 
hundred and seventy-six boys have been admitted, of which number 
nearly one hundred are now in the school. The annual examination 
for admission is in August. 
For admission, boys are examined in those branches which are taught 
at the Grammar schools, viz. Reading, Writing, English Grammar, and 
Arithmetic; and, as they are allowed to remain in the Grammar schools 
until fourteen, none are admitted to this school under twelve. Four- 
teen was fixed as the other limit, but it was found that this would 
operate unjustly on those boys who were just fourteen, and this had 
consequently not been strictly insisted on. 
As there are many lads who cannot continue at school during a com- 
plete course, nor even remain long after they have becomé able to do 
something for their own support, it is desirable to arrange the studies 
     
   
   
                     
      
-P-A-G-E-610
    584. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
in such a manner that those branches should fall in the first year, 
which are of the most essential importance. The course for the first 
year includes Intellectual and Written Arithmetic, Geography and the 
use of the Globes, exercises in Grammar, General History, and History 
of the United States, Book-keeping by single entry, Elements of some 
Arts and Sciences, Composition and Declamation. That for the sec- 
ond and third year embraces Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and 
its applications, Book-keeping by double entry, various branches of 
Natural Philosophy, Natural History, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy 
and Natural Theology, Rhetoric, Evidences of Christianity, Intellec- 
tual Philosophy, Political Economy, and Logic. 
The establishment of this school forms an era in the history of Free 
Education in Boston. Its present high reputation and growing im- 
portance, while they render it an object of increasing interest, promise 
extensive and lasting utility; and furnish a gratifying proof of the wis- 
dom of that policy which brings forward to places of high responsi- 
bility young men of talents and learning, who have a reputation and 
fortune to gain. 
The Latin Grammar School 
This ancient and venerable institution, so intimately connected with 
the early history of Boston, and of its learned men in generations that 
are past, seems to démand a moment’s pause: Res ipsa hortari videtur, 
quoniam de morabus civitatis tempus admonuit, supra repetere, ac, paucis, 
instituta majorum disserere. . It is grateful to look back on the picture 
of primitive, but enlightened simplicity exhibited in the early history 
of New England, and to arrest, as far as possible, the progress of decay 
by which its already indistinct lines are rapidly fading from our view. 
The whole school house in School Street, is now appropriated to this 
school. The last catalogue contains two hundred and twenty-five 
scholars. These are distributed into six separate apartments, under 
the care of the same number of instructors; viz..a Principal, or head 
master, a sub-master, and four assistants. For admission, boys must 
be at least nine years old; able to read correctly and with fluency, and 
to write running hand; they must know all the stops, marks, and ab- 
breviations, and have sufficient knowledge of English Grammar to 
parse common sentences in prose. The time of admission is the Friday 
and Saturday next preceding the Commencement at Cambridge, which 
two days are devoted to the examination of candidates. The regular 
course of instruction lasts five years; and the school is divided into five 
classes, according to the time of entrance. 
When a class has entered, the boys commence the Latin Grammar all 
together, under the eye of the principal; where they continue until he 
     
         
    
-P-A-G-E-611
    AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 585 
     
   
                      
     
   
       has become in some degree acquainted with their individual characters 
and capacities. As they change their places at each recitation, those 
boys will naturally rise to the upper part of the class, who are most in- 
dustrious, or who learn with the greatest facility. After a time a di- 
vision of from twelve to fifteen boys is taken off from the upper end of 
the class; after a few days more, another division is in like manner 
taken off; and so on, till the whole class is separated into divisions of 
equal number; it having been found that from twelve to fifteen is the 
most convenient number ¢o drill together. 
In this way boys of like capacities are put together, and the evil of 
having some unable to learn the lesson which others get in half the time 
allowed, is in some measure obviated. The class, thus arranged for 
the year, is distributed among the assistant teachers, a division to each 
. ..as writing is not taught in the school, the younger classes for the 
first two or three years are dismissed at eleven o’clock, an hour before 
school is done, that they may attend a writing school... . 
Thus we have endeavoured to give a view of the means, provided at 
the public expense, for the gratuitous instruction of the children of all 
classes of the citizens of Boston. They are offered equally to all. The 
.poorest inhabitant may have his children instructed from the age of 
four to seventeen, at schools, some of which are already equal, if not 
superior to any private schools in our country; and all of them may be 
made so. 
Indeed if a child be kept at a Primary School from four to seven, and 
then at one of the Grammar Schools until nine, and from that time till 
seventeen at the Latin, and the English Classical School, there is no 
question but he will go through a more thorough and complete course of 
instruction, and in reality enjoy greater advantages than are provided at 
many of the respectable colleges in the Union. 
              
  328. The Massachusetts High-School Law of 1827 
(Laws of Massachusetts, January Session, 1827, chapter CXLI1) 
This is the first American law requiring the establishment of 
high schools, and is important as a landmark in the history of the 
evolution of the high school. It is also significant in that its pro- 
visions are mandatory, whereas legislation in most of the States, 
for decades thereafter, was merely permissive.        
          
     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General 
Court assembled and by the authority of thesame. That each town or 
district within this Commonwealth, containing fifty families, or house- 
holders, shall be provided with a teacher or teachers, of good morals, to 
instruct children in orthography, reading, writing, English grammar,            
   
-P-A-G-E-612
    586 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  geography, arithmetic, and good behavior, for such term of time as 
shall be equivalent to six months for one school in each year; and every 
town or district containing one hundred families or householders, 
shall be provided with such teacher or teachers, for such term of time 
as shall be equivalent to eighteen months, for one school in each year. 
And every city, town, or district, containing five hundred families, or 
householders, shall be provided with such teacher or teachers for such 
term of time as shall be equivalent to twenty-four months, for one 
school in each year, and shall also be provided with a master of good 
morals, competent to instruct, in addition to the branches of learning 
aforesaid, the history of the United States, bookkeeping by single en- 
try, geometry, surveying, algebra; and shall employ such master to in- 
struct a school, in such city, town, or district, for the benefit of all the 
inhabitants thereof, at least ten months in each year, exclusive of va- 
cations, in such convenient place, or alternately at such places in such 
city, town, or district, as the said inhabitants, at their meeting in March, 
or April, annually, shall determine; and in every city, or town, contain- 
ing four thousand inhabitants, such master shall be competent in addi- 
tion to all the foregoing branches, to instruct the Latin and Greek 
languages, history, rhetoric, and logic. 
329. An Example of the Opposition to High Schools 
(Gulliver, John P., Norwich (Connecticut) Weekly Courier, November 25, 1856) 
The following extract from an Address is illustrative of the 
difficulties experienced in establishing high schools, likewise of 
the arguments advanced against taxation for them, not only in 
Connecticut, but in other States as well. 
. .. The lower schools up to the grade of the grammar school were 
well sustained. Men were to be found in all our communities who had 
been themselves educated up to that point, and understood, practically, 
the importance of such schools, in sufficient numbers to control popu- 
lar sentiment, and secure for them ample appropriations and steady 
support. But the studies of the high school, Algebra, Geometry, 
Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Ancient History, Latin, Greek, French 
and German, were a perfect “terra incognita” to the great mass of the 
people. While the High School was a new thing and while a few en- 
lightened citizens had the control of it, in numerous instances it was 
carried to a high state of perfection. But after a time the burden of 
taxation would begin to'be felt. Men would discuss the high salaries 
paid to the accomplished teachers which such schools demand, and 
would ask, “To what purpose is this waste?” Demagogues, keen- 
scented as wolves, would snuff the prey. ‘‘What do we want of a High 
School to teach rich men’s children?” they would shout. “It is a 
       
               
       
-P-A-G-E-613
    AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 587 
shame to tax the poor man to pay a man $1,800, to teach the children 
to make x’s and pot-hooks and gabble parley-vous.”” The work 
would go bravely on; and on election day, amid great excitement, a 
new school committee would be chosen, in favor of retrenchment and 
popular rights. Ina single day the fruits of years of labor would be 
destroyed. 
330. The Kalamazoo Decision 
(Charles E. Stuart ef al. vs. School District No. 1 of the Village of Kalamazoo, 
30 Michigan, p. 69) 
This is a famous decision, as settling the rights of a community 
to maintain a high school by taxation. The decision was of im- 
portance as a precedent in many other States. The School 
Board of Kalamazoo, Michigan, decided to open a high school and 
employ a superintendent of schools. A citizen, Charles E. Stu- 
art, brought suit to prevent the collection of the tax levied there- 
for. The case was taken to the Supreme Court of the State of 
Michigan, and the decision was written by Chief Justice Thomas 
M. Cooley. The decision was emphatic that the State had the 
right to establish a complete system of schools, including a non- 
teaching Superintendent, and was not limited to the so-called 
“common schools.” : 
     The bill in this case is filed to restrain the collection of such portion 
of the school taxes assessed against complainants for the year 1872, as 
have been voted for the support of the high school in that village, and 
for the payment of the salary of the superintendent. While, nominally, 
this is the end sought to be attained by the bill, the real purpose of the 
bill is wider and vastly more comprehensive than this brief statement 
would indicate, inasmuch as it seeks a judicial determination of the 
right of school authorities, in what are called union school districts of 
the state, to levy taxes upon the general public for the support of what 
in this state are known as high schools, and to make free by such taxa- 
tion the instruction of children in other languages than the English. 
        
   
        The more general question which the record presents we shall en- 
deavor to state.in our own language, but so as to make it stand out 
distinctly as a naked question of law, disconnected from all considera- 
tions of policy or expediency, in which light alone we are at liberty to 
consider it. It is, as we understand it, that there is no authority in 
this state to make the high schools free by taxation levied on the people 
lat large. The argument is that while there may be no constitutional 
rovision expressly prohibiting such taxation, the general course of 
legislation in the state and the general understanding of the people     
    
    
      
-P-A-G-E-614
    588 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  have been such as to require us to regard the instruction in the classics 
and in the living modern languages in these schools as in the nature 
not of practical and therefore necessary instruction for the benefit of 
the people at large, but rather as accomplishments for the few, to be 
sought after in the main by those best able to pay for them, and to be 
paid for by those who seek them, and not by general tax. And not 
only has this been the general state policy, but this higher learning of 
itself, when supplied by the state, is so far a matter of private concern 
to those who receive it that the courts ought to declare it incompe- 
tent to supply it wholly at the public expense. This is in substance, 
as we understand it, the position of the complainants in this suit. 
When this doctrine was broached to us, we must confess to no little 
surprise that the legislation and policy of our state were appealed to 
against the right of the state to furnish a liberal education to the youth 
of the state in schools brought within the reach of all classes. We sup- 
posed it had always been understood in this state that education, not 
merely in the rudiments, but in an enlarged sense, was regarded as an 
important practical advantage to be supplied at their option to rich 
and poor alike, and not as something pertaining merely to culture and 
accomplishment to be brought as such within the reach of those whose 
accumulated wealth enabled them to pay for it. As this, however, is 
now so seriously disputed, it may be necessary, perhaps, to take a 
brief survey of the legislation and general course, not only of the state, 
but of the antecedent territory, on the subject. 
Here follows a review of the educational history of the State, 
from the Ordinance of 1787 to the new state constitution of 1850, 
to show the intention to establish ‘“‘a complete system of educa- 
tion.” Of the constitution of 1850 the court says: 
The instrument submitted by the convention to the people and 
adopted by them provided for the establishment of free schools in every 
school district for at least three months in each year, and for the uni- 
versity. By the aid of these we have every reason to believe the peo- 
ple expected a complete collegiate education might be obtained... . 
The inference seems irresistible that the people expected the tendency 
towards the establishment of high schools in the primary-school dis- 
tricts would continue until every locality capable of supporting one was 
supplied. And this inference is strengthened by the fact that a con- 
siderable number of our union schools date their establishment from 
the year 1850 and the two or three years following.     
      
      The final opinion of the court as to the legality of the high 
school is stated as follows: 
If these facts do not demonstrate clearly and conclusively a general 
state policy, beginning in 1817 and continuing until after the adoption|     
      
-P-A-G-E-615
AMERICAN BATTLE FOR FREE SCHOOLS 589 
of the present constitution, in the direction of free schools in which 
education, and at their option the elements of classical education, 
might be brought within the reach of all the children of the state, then, 
as it seems to us, nothing can demonstrate it. We might follow the 
subject further and show that the subsequent legislation has all con- 
curred with this policy, but it would be a waste of time and labor. We 
content ourselves with the statement that neither in our state policy, in 
our constitution, or in our laws, do we find the primary-school districts 
restricted in the branches of knowledge which their officers may cause 
to be taught, or the grade of instruction that may be giv en, if their 
voters consent in regular form to bear the expense and raise the taxes 
for the purpose. 
331. Program of Studies in the University of Michigan, 1843-44 
(Joint Documents of the Legislature of Michigan, 1852, p. 388) 
The following program of studies of the University of Michigan, 
for the academic year 1843-44, reveals the meager scope, from a 
modern point of view, of the leading western state university of 
that time. The institution at that date had a faculty of three 
professors, one tutor, one assistant in science, and one visiting 
lecturer, and there were fifty-three students in attendance. The 
following program of studies shows that this faculty then offered 
all told, in the entire four-year course, fifty term courses (of one- 
third of a year each), twenty-six of which were in Greek, Latin, 
and mathematics; nine in natural science; five in intellectual sci- 
ence; three in morals and religion; three in political science; and 
four in English. The program of studies for 1850, when the uni- 
versity had come to have 72 students, shows but slight change 
from that for 1843. 
Each class was required to attend three recitations daily, with 
Bible Study on Monday mornings and Elocution on Saturday 
mornings as extras, making a 17-hour week. These extras are 
also found in the 1850 program. The instruction throughout was 
the same for all. 
The program of studies offered is eicia both as showing 
the long continuance of the early conception of an English 
eaching college, and by way of illustrating the very remarkable 
ransformation in American higher education which took place 
in the half-century between 1850 and 1900.

332. The Michigan System of Public Instruction 
(Tappan, Henry P., “Report to the Regents of the University of Michigan, 1856”; 
in Report of Superintendent of Public Instruction, Michigan, 1855-56-57, pp. 155-84) 
The report of President Tappan to his Board of Regents, from 
which the following extract is taken, describes the system of 
public instruction in Michigan, as it had then been developed and 
conceived, and shows the unity of the state school system from 
the primary school to the university. 
An entire system of public education comprises three grades and can 
comprise but three grades: the primary, the intermediate, and the 
university. .. . The primary school comes first. . . . All human learn- 
ing begins with the alphabet. 
Thesecond grade occupies the period of youth — of adolescence or 
growth. This is the period when the foundations of knowledge and 
character can be most amply and securely laid... . 
But let it be remembered that the intermediate grade embraces only 
the apprenticeship of the scholar. . . . Hence the necessity of universi- 
ties, as the highest form of educational institutions. .. . 
The highest institutions are necessary to supply the proper standard 
of education; to raise up instructors of the proper qualifications; to 
define the principles and methods of education... . 
Nothing is more evident than that the three grades of education — 
the primary, the intermediate, the university — are all alike necessary. 
The one cannot exist, in perfection, without the others; they imply one 
another. ...

  592 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
It is to the honor of Michigan that she has conceived of a complete 
system of public education running through the three grades we have 
discussed above. Nor do these grades exist merely in name. She has 
established the primary grade of schools and made them well-nigh free. 
She has laid the foundation of an institution which admits of being 
expanded to a true university. In former days she had her “branches” 
belonging to the intermediate grade; and now we see rising up those in- 
valuable institutions, the “union schools,” belonging to the same grade. 
We say not that legislation has adequately reached the entire system, 
or made provision for its development; but the idea of the entire sys- 
tem is abroad among the people; it has not been absent from our legis- 
lation; it has appeared in the reports of superintendents and visitors, 
and in other documents; and the people, at this moment, unaided by 
any special appropriation, are organizing above the district school, the 
best schools of the intermediate grade, less than a college, which have 
yet existed among us; and are erecting large, tasteful, and convenient 
edifices for their accommodation. These ideas, spontaneously working 
in the minds of the people, these spontaneous efforts to create schools 
of a higher grade, must determine future legislation and indicate the 
grand point to which our educational development is tending.

  CHAPTER XXVII 
EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 
Tue Readings in this chapter relate to the spread of the state- 
control-of-education idea among the nations of the earth; the 
scientific advances of the nineteenth century; the Industrial 
Revolution; and the use made by nations of education for na- 
tional ends. 
The first Reading (333) reproduces those parts of the Swiss 
Federal Constitution which relate to the maintenance of educa- 
tion, and the relations of churches and religious orders thereto — 
education in Switzerland, as in the United States, being left to 
the twenty-two different cantons to control. This is a type of 
what modern constitutions have ordered that governments pro- 
vide, though the best examples of such constitutional provisions 
are found in new lands, and not among the older nations of 
Europe. The second Reading (334) reproduces the basic docu- 
ments for Japanese education, from which both the character and 
the state purpose of the school system may easily be inferred. 
The third (335) deals with the remarkable transformation which 
has taken place since the beginning of the twentieth century in 
China. The fourth (336) is an extract from one of the celebrated 
Annual Reports of Horace Mann, still readable and pertinent, as 
to the relation between the promotion of education and the 
advancement of the national welfare. 
The three Readings which follow the above relate to the won- 
derful advancement of science, invention, and intercommunica- 
tion which have characterized the nineteenth century. The first 
(337) is an extract from Huxley’s celebrated Essay; the second 
(338) gives a good statement as to why the human inventive 
faculty lay dormant for so long, and then flowered so wonderfully; 
and the third (339) describes a lack of world intercourse a cen- 
tury ago that seems almost unbelievable to-day. 
The three Readings which follow deal with the use of education 
to promote nationality. The first (340) is an excellent statement 
of the influence of the struggle for nationality on educational prac- 
tice; the second (341) reveals how intelligently the French have  
-P-A-G-E-620
  594 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
used education as a constructive national tool; while the third 
(342) is a good description of the narrowly-national ends which 
the Germans have made it serve. 
The final Reading of the chapter (343) relates to the work of 
the American teacher in the Philippines, and the transformation 
which has been effected there during the past quarter of a cen- 
tury. 
333- The Swiss Constitution on Education and Religious 
Freedom 
(Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, 1874) 
In Readings 260 and 261 the eatly constitutional mandates 
relating to education in two American States were given, and in 
the following a similar extract from the Swiss Constitution is 
reproduced. 
In the Name of Almighty God 
The Swiss Confederation, desiring to confirm the allegiance of the Con- 
federates, to maintain and to promote the unity, strength, and honor of 
the Swiss nation, has adopted the Federal Constitution following: 
Carter J. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Art. 27. The Confederation has the right to establish, besides the 
existing Polytechnic School, a Federal University and other institu- 
tions of higher instruction, or to subsidize institutions of such nature. 
The Cantons provide for primary instruction, which shall be suffi- 
cient, and shall be placed exclusively under the direction of the secular 
authority. It is compulsory and, in the public schools, free. 
The public schools shall be such that they may be frequented by the 
adherents of all religious sects, without any offense to their freedom of 
conscience or of belief. 
The Confederation shall take the necessary measures against such 
Cantons as shall not fulfill these duties. 
Art. 50. The free exercise of religious worship is guaranteed within 
the limits compatible with public order and good morals. 
The Cantons and the Confederation may take suitable measures for 
the preservation of public order and of peace between the members of 
different religious bodies, and also against encroachments of ecclesias- 
tical authorities upon the rights of citizens and of the State. 
Contests in public and private law, which arise out of the formation 
or the division of religious bodies, may be brought by appeal before the 
competent federal authorities. 
No bishopric shall be created upon Swiss territory without the con- 
sent of the Confederation.  
-P-A-G-E-621
  EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 595 
Art. 51. The order of the Jesuits, and the societies affiliated with 
them, shall not be received into any part of Switzerland; and all action 
in church and school is forbidden to its members. 
This prohibition may be extended also, by federal ordinance, to other 
religious orders, the action of which is dangerous to the state or dis- 
turbs the peace between sects. 
Art. 52. The foundation of new convents or religious orders, and 
the reéstablishment of those which have been suppressed, are forbidden. 
334. The Basic Documents for Japanese Education 
(Baron D. Kikuchi, Article on “Education in Japan’’; in Monroe’s Cyclopedia 
of Education, vol. 11) . 
The following selections set forth well the spirit of Japanese 
popular education. The first (a) is the Preamble to the first 
Education Code of the Empire (1872). This provides for a two- 
class type of educational system, though based on the very demo- 
cratic principle of the equality of all in the lower school. The 
second (0) is a Rescript issued by the Mikado, in 1890, and forms 
the basis for the moral education of the people. A copy of this is 
to be found in every schoolroom in Japan, those in the public 
schools being actually signed by the Mikado himself. Based on 
this Rescript, textbooks on moral education have been prepared 
by a special commission, and the following instructions (c) to 
schools have been issued by the Ministry for Education. Two 
hours a week are given to moral instruction in all primary schools 
in Japan. 
(a) Preamble to the Education Code of 1872 
It is intended that henceforth universally without any distinction of 
class or sex, in a village there shall be no house without learning (edu- 
cation), and in a house no individual without learning. Fathers and 
elder brothers must take note of this intention, and, bringing up their 
children or younger brothers (or sisters) with warm feeling of love, 
must not fail to let them acquire learning. As for higher learning, that 
depends upon the capacity of individuals, but it shall be regarded as a 
neglect of duty on the part of fathers or elder brothers, should they fail 
to send young children to primary schools at least without distinction 
of sex. 
(b) Imperial Rescript on Moral Education 
Know ye, Our Subjects: 
Our Imperial Ancestors have founded our Empire on a basis broad 
and everlasting, and have deeply and firmly implanted virtue; Our

subjects ever united in loyalty and filial piety have from generation to 
generation illustrated the beauty thereof: This is the glory of the 
fundamental character of Our Empire, and herein also lies the source of 
our Education. Ye, Our Subjects, be filial to your parents, affection- 
ate to your brothers and sisters; as husbands and wives be harmonious, 
as friends true; bear yourselves in modesty and moderation; extend 
your benevolence to all; pursue learning and cultivate arts, and 
thereby develop intellectual faculties and perfect moral powers; fur- 
thermore, advance public good and promote common interests; always 
respect the Constitution and observe the laws; should emergency arise, 
offer yourself courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain 
the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne, coeval with heaven and earth. 
So shall ye not only be Our good and faithful subjects, but render 
illustrious the best traditions of your forefathers. 
The Way here set forth is indeed the teaching bequeathed by Our 
Imperial Ancestors, to be observed alike by Their Descendants and 
the subjects, infallible for all ages and true in all places. It is Our wish 
to lay it to heart in all reverence, in common with you, (Our subjects, 
that we may all attain to the same virtue. 
The 3oth day of the roth month of the 23rd year of Meiji (October 
3oth, 1890). 
Imperial Sign Manual, Imperial Seal. 
(c) Instructions to Schools as to Lessons on Morals 
The teaching of morals must be based on the Imperial Rescript on 
education, and its aim should be to cultivate the moral nature of chil- 
dren and to guide them in practices of virtue. 
In the ordinary primary course, easy precepts appropriate for prac- 
tice concerning such virtues as filial piety and obedience to elders, 
affection and friendship, frugality and industry, modesty, courage, etc., 
should be given, and then some of the duties toward the State and 
society, with a view to elevate their moral character, strengthen their 
will, increase their spirit of enterprise, make them value public virtues, 
and foster the spirit of loyalty and patriotism. 
In the higher primary course, the above must be further extended 
and training given made still more solid. 
In the teaching of girls, special stress must be laid on the virtues of 
chastity and modesty. 
Encouragement and admonition should be given by means of wise 
sayings and proverbs and by tales of good deeds, so that children may 
lay them to heart.

         335. The Transformation of China by Education 
(Ping Wen Kuo, The Chinese System of Public Education, pp. 163-64. 
. New York, 1915) 
The following brief statement as to the relation between educa- 
tion and national progress, as seen by a distinguished Chinese, is 
interesting also for the comparison made between ancient Chinese 
and European Renaissance learning. 
The history of Chinese education forms an excellent example of the 
important relation of school training to national progress. For many 
centuries Chinese education was purely literary, philosophical in char- 
acter. There was little that could be called concrete or practical in 
the modern sense of the word, neither was there anything requiring 
the knowledge of the experimental method or of inductive reasoning. 
Education strongly resembled the form of training which prevailed in 
Europe for two centuries after the revival of Greek learning. This 
peculiar quality of Chinese education produced a prodigious effect on 
the career of the nation. It accounts for the present comparatively 
backward condition of China, explaining why the country made little 
progress in the arts of modern life and in the modern sciences until the 
last decade. 
Since her contact with the western nations, her educational system 
has undergone a radical change through the introduction of modern 
subjects of study and the education of many of her students in foreign 
lands. The effect of this change upon her national life has been mar- 
velous. It set the country on the high road of progress and reform. 
A great revolution, at once political, industrial, and social, is taking 
place under our very eyes. Educational reform in China now forms 
the very pivot around which all other reforms turn, for it is to educa- 
tion that China is looking for the men to steer the ship of state into the 
haven of safety. This close relationship between education and na- 
tional progress should be an argument for the introduction of a more 
practical training in the public schools of China.        
        
    
      
    
      
  336. Education and National Prosperity 
(Mann, Horace, Twelfth Annual Report, as Secretary of the Massachusetts State 
Board of Education. Boston, 1848)        
  Each year, Mr. Mann, in his Annual Report as Secretary, dis- 
cussed some topic of general interest. In his Report for 1848 he 
chose the relation of education to national prosperity, and some 
of the paragraphs of this Report make good reading, even to-day. 
The following have been selected to show Mr. Mann’s conception 
of the importance of education for national welfare.        
    
      
-P-A-G-E-624
      598 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
A cardinal object which the government of Massachusetts, and all the 
influential men in the State, should propose to themselves, is the physi- 
cal well-being of all the people, — the sufficiency, comfort, competence, 
of every individual in regard to food, raiment, and shelter. And these 
necessaries and conveniences of life should be obtained by each indi- 
vidual for himself, or by each family for themselves, rather than ac- 
cepted from the’ hand of charity or extorted by poor-laws. It is not 
averred that this most desirable result can, in all instances, be ob- 
tained; but it is, nevertheless, the end to be aimed at. True states- 
manship and true political economy, not less than true philanthropy, 
present this perfect theory as the goal, to be more and more closely 
approximated by our imperfect practice. The desire to achieve such 
a result cannot be regarded as an unreasonable ambition; for, though 
all mankind were well fed, well clothed, and well housed, they might 
still be but half civilized. 
According to the European theory, men are divided into classes, — 
some to toil and earn, bthers to seize and enjoy. According to the 
Massachusetts theory, all are to have an equal chance for earning, and 
equal security in the enjoyment of what they earn. The latter tends 
to equality of condition; the former, to the grossest inequalities. 
Tried by any Christian standard of morals, or even by any of the better 
sort of heathen standards, can any one hesitate, for a moment, in de- 
claring which of the two will produce the greater amount of human 
welfare, and which, therefore, is the more conformable to the divine 
will? The European theory is blind to what constitutes the highest 
glory as well as the highest duty of a State. 
Our ambition as a State should trace itself to a different origin, and 
propose to itself a different object. Its flame should be lighted at the 
skies. Its radiance and its warmth should reach the darkest and the 
coldest abodes of men. It should seek the solution of such problems 
as these: To what extent can competence displace pauperism? How 
nearly can we free ourselves from the low-minded and the vicious, not 
by their expatriation, but by their elevation? To what extent can the 
resources and powers of Nature be converted into human welfare, the 
peaceful arts of life be advanced, and the vast treasures of human talent 
and genius be developed? How much of suffering, in all its forms, can 
be relieved? or, what is better than relief, how much can be prevented? 
Cannot the classes of crimes be lessened, and the number of criminals 
in each class be diminished?     
   
    
    Now two or three things will doubtless be admitted to be true, 
beyond all controversy, in regard to Massachusetts. By its industrial 
condition, and its business operations, it is exposed, far beyond any 
other State in the Union, to the fatal extremes of overgrown wealth    
    
-P-A-G-E-625
  EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 599 
and desperate poverty. Its population is far more dense than that of 
any other State. It is four or five times more dense than the average 
of all the other States taken together; and density of population has 
always been one of the proximate causes of social inequality. Accord- 
ing to population and territorial extent there is far more capital in 
Massachusetts — capital which is movable, and instantaneously avail- 
able — than in any other State in the Union; and probably both these 
qualifications respecting population and territory could be omitted 
without endangering the truth of the assertion. 
Now surely nothing but universal education can counterwork this 
tendency to the domination of capital and the servility of labor. If one 
class possesses all the wealth and the education, while the residue of 
society is ignorant and poor, it matters not by what name the relation 
between them may be called: the latter, in fact and in truth, will be 
the servile dependants and subjects of the former. But, if educa- 
tion be equably diffused, it will draw property after it by the strongest 
of all attractions; for such a thing never did happen, and never can hap- 
pen, as that an intelligent and practical body of men should be per- 
manently poor. Property and labor in different classes are essentially 
antagonistic; but property and labor in the same class are essentially 
fraternal. The people of Massachusetts have, in some degree, appre- 
ciated the truth that the unexampled prosperity of the State — its 
comfort, its competence, its general intelligence and virtue — is attrib- 
utable to the education, more or less perfect, which all its people have     received; but are they sensible of a fact e 
that it is to this same education that two 
debted for not being to-day the vassals o: ually important, — namely, 
-thirds of the people are in- 
as severe a tyranny, in the 
form of capital, as the lower classes of Europe are bound to in the form 
of brute force? 
Education, then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the 
great equalizer of the conditions of men, — the balance-wheel of the 
social machinery. I do not here mean that it so elevates the moral 
nature as to make men disdain and abhor the oppression of their fellow- 
men. This idea pertains to another of its attributes. But I mean that 
it gives each man the independence and the means by which he can 
resist the selfishness of other men. It does better than to disarm the 
poor of their hostility towards the rich: it prevents being poor. Agrari- 
anism is the revenge of poverty against wealth. The wanton destruc- 
tion of the property of others — the burning of hay-ricks and corn- 
ricks, the demolition of machinery because it supersedes hand-labor, 
the sprinkling of vitriol on rich dresses — is only agrarianism run mad. 
Education prevents both the revenge and the madness. On the other 
hand, a fellow-feeling for one’s class or caste is the common instinct of 
hearts not wholly sunk in selfish regards for person or for family. The   
 
-P-A-G-E-626
  600 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
spread of education, by enlarging the cultivated class or caste, will 
open a wider area over which the social feelings will expand; and, if this 
education should be universal and complete, it would do more than 
all things else to obliterate factitious distinctions in society. 
For the creation of wealth, then, — for the existence of a wealthy 
people and a wealthy nation, —intelligence is the grand condition. The 
number of improvers will increase as the intellectual constituency, 
if I may so call it, increases. In former times, and in most parts of the 
world even at the present day, not one man in a million has ever had 
such a development of mind as made it, possible for him to become a 
contributor to art or science. Let this development precede, and con- 
tributions, numberless, and of inestimable value, will be sure to follow. 
That political economy, therefore, which busies itself about capital 
and labor, supply and demand, interest and rents, favorable and un- 
favorable balances of trade, but leaves out of account the element of 
a wide-spread mental development, is naught but stupendous folly. 
The greatest of all the arts in political economy is to change a consumer 
into a producer; and the next greatest is to increase the producer’s 
producing power, — an end to be directly attained by increasing his 
intelligence. For mere delving, an ignorant man is but little better 
than a swine, whom he so much resembles in his appetites, and sur- 
passes in his powers of mischief. . . . 
337. The Recent Progress of Science 
(Huxley, T. H., Methods and Results, Essay 11. London, 1893) 
In an Essay, dated 1887, on “The Progress of Science,” the 
English scientist Thomas Huxley begins with the following strik- 
ing statement as to nineteenth-century scientific advances. 
The most obvious and the most distinctive feature of the History of 
Civilisation, during the last fifty years, is the wonderful increase of 
industrial production by the application of machinery, the improve- 
ment of old technical processes and the invention of new ones, accom- 
panied by an even more remarkable development of old and new 
means of locomotion and intercommunication. By this rapid and vast 
multiplication of the commodities and conveniences of existence, the 
general standard of comfort has been raised; the ravages of pestilence 
and famine have been checked; and the natural obstacles, which time 
and space offer to mutual intercourse, have been reduced in a manner, 
and to an extent, unknown to former ages. The diminution or re- 
moval of local ignorance and prejudice, the creation of common inter- 
ests among the most widely separated peoples, and the strengthening 
of the forces of the organisation of the commonwealth against those of 
 
-P-A-G-E-627
  EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 601 
political or social anarchy, thus effected, have exerted an influence 
on the present and future fortunes of mankind the full significance 
of which may be divined, but cannot, as yet, 
be estimated at its full value. 
This revolution — for it is nothing less — 
in the political and social aspects of modern 
civilisation has been preceded, accompanied, 
and in a great measure caused, by a less ob- 
vious, but no less marvellous, increase of 
natural knowledge, and especially of that part 
of it which is known as Physical Science, in 
consequence of the application of scientific 
method to the investigation of the phenomena 
of the material world. Not that the growth 
of physical science is an exclusive prerogative 
of the Victorian age. Its present strength 
and volume merely indicate the highest level — Pyoyas H. Huxtey 
of a stream which took its rise alongside of (1825-95) 
the primal founts of Philosophy, Literature, 
and Art, in ancient Greece; and, after being dammed up for a thou- 
sand years, once more began to flow three centuries ago. 
  In the early decades of the seventeenth century, the men of the 
Renaissance could show that they had already put out to good interest 
the treasure bequeathed to them by the Greeks. They had produced 
the astronomical system of Copernicus, with Kepler’s great additions; 
the astronomical discoveries and the physical investigations of Galileo; 
the mechanics of Stevinus and the De Magnete of Gilbert; the anatomy 
of the great French and Italian schools and the physiology of Harvey. 
Tn Italy, which had succeeded Greece in the hegemony of the scien- 
tific world, the Accademia dei Lyncei and sundry other such associations 
for the investigation of nature, the models of all subsequent acade- 
mies and scientific societies, had been founded: while the literary skill 
and biting wit of Galileo had made the great scientific questions of the 
day not only intelligible, but attractive, to the general public. In our 
own country, Francis Bacon had essayed to sum up the past of phy- 
sical science, and to indicate the path which it must follow if its great 
destinies were to be fulfilled... . 
The progress of science, during the first century after Bacon’s 
death, by no means verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits which 
it would yield. For, though the revived and renewed study of nature 
had spread and grown to an extent which surpassed reasonable expec- 
tation, the practical results — the “good to men’s estate” — were, at 
first, by no means apparent. Sixty years after Bacon’s death, Newton 
had crowned the long labours of the astronomers and the physicists,
-P-A-G-E-628
  602 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
by coérdinating the phenomena of molar motion throughout the visi- 
ble universe into one vast system; but the Principia helped no man 
to either wealth or comfort. Descartes, Newton, and Leibnitz had 
opened up new worlds to the mathematician, but the acquisitions of their 
genius enriched only man’s ideal estate. Descartes had laid the foun- 
dations of rational cosmogony and of physiological psychology; Boyle 
had produced models of experimentation in various branches of phys- 
ics and chemistry; Pascal and Torricelli had weighed the air; Malpighi 
and Grew, Ray and Willoughby had done work of no less importance 
in the biological sciences; but weaving and spinning were carried on 
with the old appliances; nobody could travel faster by sea or by land 
than,at any previous time in the world’s history, and King George 
could send a message from London to York no faster than King John 
might have done. Metals were worked from their ores by immemorial 
tule of thumb, and the center of the iron trade of these islands was still 
among the oak forests of Sussex. The utmost skill of our mechanicians 
did not get beyond the production of a coarse watch. 
But, a little later, that growth of knowledge beyond imaginable 
utilitarian ends, which is the condition precedent of its practical utility, 
began to produce some effect upon practical life; and the operation of 
that part of nature we call human upon the rest began to create, not 
“new natures,” in Bacon’s sense, but a new Nature, the existence of 
which is dependent upon men’s efforts, which is subservient to their 
wants, and which would disappear if man’s shaping and guiding hand 
were withdrawn. Every mechanical artifice, every chemically pure 
substance employed in manufacture, every abnormally fertile race of 
plants, or rapidly growing and fattening breed of animals, is a part of 
the new Nature created by science. Without it, the most densely pop- 
ulated regions of modern Europe and America must retain their primi- 
tive, sparsely inhabited, agricultural or pastoral condition; it is the 
foundation of our wealth and the condition of our safety from sub- 
mergence by another flood of barbarous hordes; it is the bond which 
unites into a solid political whole, regions larger than any empire of 
antiquity; it secures us from the recurrence of the pestilences and 
famines of former times; it is the source of endless comforts and con- 
veniences, which are not mere luxuries, but conduce to physical and 
moral well-being. During the last fifty years, this new birth of time, 
this new Nature begotten by science upon fact, has pressed itself daily 
and hourly upon our attention, and has worked miracles which have 
modified the whole fashion of our lives.

338. Scientific Knowledge must precede Invention 
(Editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle, October, 1919) 
The following selection, which appeared as an editorial in a 
Sunday edition of the above-mentioned newspaper, offers so good 
an explanation as to why the human inventive faculty waited so 
long, and then within a century has borne such abundant fruit, 
that it is reproduced here in its entirety as furnishing good collat- 
eral reading for the subject-matter of the corresponding chapter 
in the text. 
When one casts a backward look over the multitude of inventions 
that have been given to the world in the last hundred years, and then 
a farther look back over the long barren centuries that went before, 
there rises a natural feeling of amazement that the world should have 
lived so long without the simple devices that now are part of our 
lives and that invention, so long delayed, should have come in such a 
flood. 
Though the time when man first learned to use fire was so far back 
that we have no account of it except in myth, it was not until our 
grandmothers’ days that man had safety matches; though the arrow 
goes so far back that we cannot find on the face of the earth a savage 
so isolated that he has it not, we had no airplanes until the present 
decade; though history does not take us back far enough to find a time 
when geometry and arithmetic were not fairly well understood, it was 
not until comparatively modern times that the discovery of the zero 
made arithmetic a supple servant and made possible the great modern 
development of mathematics; though the cart is found on the earliest 
monuments, it was only within the last twenty years that we produced 
the first practical automobile. 
We are quite apt to conclude that the human race has been without 
mechanical ideas for the greater part of its life, and acquired them only 
a hundred or so years ago. Such a conclusion, though natural enough, 
must be dismissed as erroneous. A more correct conclusion is that the 
mechanical faculties of the race lay dormant for long centuries. They 
must have existed from the very beginning of intelligence, for the fun- 
damental inventions and discoveries from which civilization has arisen 
were made so far back that we cannot give them date. Fire, the cook- 
ing pot, the bow, the wheel, the lever, the knife, all came before the 
dawn of civilization. These are simple inventions, you say; but they 
are no more simple than the lamp chimney, the cotton gin, or even the 
phonograph. 
There are other reasons for the thousands of years barren of inven- 
tion, followed by a sudden flowering. Undoubtedly the fact that in the 
ancient civilizations labor was almost exclusively slave labor stifled the
-P-A-G-E-630
  604. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
inventive faculty. The slave had no incentive to better the devices 
he worked with, or to work out new ones. Then, too, mankind did 
not have the constantly widening circle of needs that began to expand 
only with the development of ocean commerce and the discovery of the 
new world. There was another thing; there were no patent laws, and 
no organization of industry to ensure a reward for the man who worked 
overtime to devise a better clock or some new convenience. 
But the chief reason is that the vast majority of modern inventions 
had to wait for the invention of the steam power-plant and the develop- 
ment of modern science. The steam engine brought in its train a host 
of inventions that would have been either impossible or useless before. 
The locomotive, the steam-hammer, are examples of those impossible; 
the screw propeller is an example of one that would have been useless. 
The discoveries of modern science have been responsible for a huge 
number of inventions. Without a knowledge of electricity, the tele- 
graph and telephone, simple as they are, were impossible. The old 
alchemy gave us gunpowder, but only modern chemistry could give us 
the aniline dye, dynamite, high-speed steel, aluminum, the Bessemer 
process, gasoline, usable rubber, and oleomargarine. 
The bicycle had to wait for the discovery of rubber gum, and then 
for the invention of the vulcanizing process. The automobile had to 
wait not only for that, but for the development of the gasoline engine. 
The airplane was impracticable before the internal combustion engine 
had reached a high stage of perfection. 
Once started by the invention of the steam engine and the devel- 
opment of science, modern invention has proceeded in geometrical 
progression, each new invention or discovery making possible a dozen, 
or a hundred, more. Though example and the increase of possibili- 
ties has spurred the inventive faculty, it is perhaps no greater now 
than it ever was. 
339. Lack of Intercommunication illustrated by Ticknor 
(Life, Letters, and Journals of George Ticknor, vol. 1, pp. 11-12. Boston, 1825) 
George Ticknor (1791-1871) was the fourth American who went 
to a German university for the purpose of study, and the first who 
left an account of his journey and residence there. He studied 
at the University of Géttingen, 1815-17. Two other American 
students preceded him by a few years; one having gone there 
from Philadelphia to study medicine as early as 1789. Germany, 
though, before the days of railways, telegraphs, and fast steam- 
ships, was almost as unknown to Americans as was China. In 1813 
Madame de Staél’s book on Germany (De l’ Allemagne) was pub- 
lished in England. This opened up a new world to Ticknor, a

Boston boy who had been graduated from Dartmouth and had 
opened a law office in Boston, as it did to many other English and 
American readers. Of his efforts to learn something about the 
German universities, then the most celebrated in Europe (R. 359), 
and to study the German language, he wrote: 
The first intimation I ever had on the subject was from Mme. de 
Staél’s work on Germany, then just published. My next came from a 
pamphlet, published by Villers, to defend the University of Géttingen 
from the ill intentions of Jerome Bonaparte, the King of Westphalia, in 
which he gave a sketch of the university and its courses of study. My 
astonishment at these revelations was increased by an account of its 
library, given by an Englishman who had been at Gottingen, to my 
friend, the Rev. Samuel C. Thacher. I was sure that I should like to 
study at such a university, but it was in vain that I endeavored to get 
further knowledge upon the subject. I would gladly have prepared for 
it by learning the language I should have to use there, but there was 
no one in Boston who could teach me. 
At Jamaica Plain there was a Dr. Brosius, a native of Strasburg, who 
gave me instruction in mathematics. He was willing to do what he 
could for me in German, but he warned me that his pronunciation was 
very bad, as was that of all Alsace, which had become a part of France. 
Nor was it possible to get books. I borrowed Meidinger’s Grammar, 
French and German, from my friend Mr. Everett, and sent to New 
Hampshire, where I knew there was a German dictionary, and pro- 
cured it. I also obtained a copy of Goethe’s Werther in German 
(through Mr. William S. Shaw’s connivance) from among Mr. J. Q. 
Adams’s books, deposited by him on going to Europe in the Atheneum, 
under Mr. Shaw’s care, but without giving him permission to lend 
them. I got so far as to write a translation of Werther, but no further.

(Monroe, Paul, Introduction to ‘Teachers College Syllabi, No. 9,” on Democracy 
and Nationalism in Education. New York, 1919. Reproduced by permission)     
In an Introduction to a brief syllabus of lectures by Professor 
Reisner, as given above, Professor Monroe has given such an 
excellent statement of the struggle for nationality which has char- 
acterized modern history, and the use by nations of education as 
a tool to that end, that permission has been secured to reproduce 
the Introduction in full, which is done in the following Reading. 
     
      The growth of nations has been the conspicuous political feature of 
odern times, and the problems of the relation of education to this 
evelopment have become obvious during the nineteenth century.

    606 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The earliest stage of political development occurred with the fixing 
of tribal groups in a definite habitat. The earliest form of this was 
the city state with its environing dependencies. These early states 
looked upon all other groups as hostile and unworthy of existence, ex- 
cept as they became subordinated. This incorporation was usually 
accomplished by force, which process tended to destroy the distinctive 
cultural features of the minor groups. In other words, the groups 
expanding by military power led by dynastic ability and ambition 
looked upon political organization as all-inclusive. With the Roman 
Empire this tendency became substantially a reality. With the Chris- 
tianization of the Roman Empire the ecclesiastical ideal and pretension 
paralleled the political one and both became coterminous with civiliza- 
tion. This belief in the universal scope of political organization con- 
stituted in form the world’s political theory long after the actual con- 
ditions were changed. The Holy Roman Empire which expressed this 
theory in the early modern period was only destroyed by Napoleon in 
1804. The chief force in rendering this organization a mere form was 
that of growing nationalism. 
From very early days certain groups, especially the English, had 
grown up in isolation. Over these the Holy Roman Empire had pos- 
sessed only the most nebulous authority. From the twelfth to the six- 
teenth century both the English and the French groups, and to a less 
extent the German and Italian, through internal conflict, developed a 
local consciousness which more and more gave a distinctive character 
to each group. The original tribal groups which had entered into the 
composition of these dawning national groups were marked by distinct 
racial characteristics. Through internal conflicts, through migration, 
through conquest and the merging of conqueror and conquered, in time 
these developing national groups came to represent the accomplished 
amalgamation of many tribal or racial strains. In fact, the strongest of 
these early nationalities, the English and French, represented the fusion 
of most diverse elements. 
Thus’early became distinct the three great factors determining mod- 
ern nationalities, namely, blood relationship or race, habitat or geo- 
graphical environment, and culture. Culture in this sense means com- 
mon ideals, common traditions, habits and aspirations. A number of 
other specific characteristics are often urged as essential to nationality, 
such as common language, common religion, common laws, but there 
is no one characteristic except that of a common culture which may be 
posited but what exceptions may be found. The one most commonly 
given, that of race, cannot be accepted, for every European nation 
represents a great mixture, and the United States has become the 
greatest mixture of all. Nor, on the other hand, can such great admix- 
ture of racial groups be made an essential, for there are illustrations of 
the opposite as in the case of Japan. A compact habitat is a usual    
   
    
                        
-P-A-G-E-633
    EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 607 
characteristic, but there are exceptions as in the case of Greece, now 
struggling for national realization, or that of the British Empire. It 
cannot be maintained that common language is an essential, for there 
is the case of Switzerland with its three languages. Common religion, 
for a period believed to be essential, was responsible for the many wars 
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; but strong national states 
have developed in spite of internal differences of religious belief. 
Common laws cannot be held as essential, for federal states are based on 
the recognition of a diversity of laws. 
Modern history since the fifteenth century has been essentially the 
story of the struggle for national realization. This long struggle has 
brought a growing recognition that a common culture, that composite 
of common habits, ideals and purposes, is the one essential characteris- 
tic of nationality. Most modern wars, especially of Europe, have been 
caused by the violation of this principle. This was particularly true 
during the nineteenth century, because most international settlements, 
particularly those made by the Congress of Vienna in 1816 and by the 
Congress of Berlin in 1878, resulted in gross violations of that principle, 
in favor of other principles usually based on arbitrary force. Ina very 
true sense, then, the great war is but a readjustment of the evils pro- 
duced by the imperfect and unjust settlements made at the close of the 
Napoleonic struggle. 
From the late eighteenth century the element of common culture has 
become the dominating one in the conception of nationality. This has 
resulted in the recognition of two fundamental and correlated truths: 
First, common culture is a trait which transcends social, religious, and 
economic distinctions, and its recognition transfers the seat of national 
existence from dynasties or bureaucratic legal institutions supported by 
military force to the masses of the people. Second, the discovery was 
made that common culture was an artificial product and could be man- 
ufactured. The process of this manufacture is by education. From 
one point of view then the nineteenth century is the period of national 
development, working towards the democratic interpretation of the 
problem of nationality and using education as a means. 
The first people consciously to apply this method of education to the 
determination of nationality was the German. Beginning near the 
middle of the eighteenth century, or even earlier, with special groups, 
and after 1809 very definitely for the whole group, this people before 
the Napoleonic wars organized into more than one hundred independ- 
ent nations has gradually amalgamated into one. The limitation to 
this development of a German nation as we see it now is that the Ger- 
mans retained along with this democratic conception of nationality the 
old dynastic and predatory one. The latter has now been eliminated, 
in part at least, and it remains to be seen what the former may accom- 
plish.

   608 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Other European nations, more favorably situated in regard to other 
factors in nationality, or relying more upon the older interpretations of 
national strength, recognized more tardily the importance of education 
as a means of developing national unity and power. Even the United 
States has depended more on geographical environment, racial selec- 
tion, political institutions and common language than upon consciously 
developed cultural unity. While in the early national period the im- 
portance of education to the successful workings and perpetuation of 
free institutions was commonly recognized, yet a wholly individualistic 
interpretation of education was practised. 
Practically all modern nations are now awake to the fact that educa- 
tion is the most potent means in the development of the essentials of 
nationality. Education is the means by which peoples of retarded cul- 
tures may be brought rapidly to the common level. Education is the 
means by which small or weak nations may become so strong through 
their cultural strength and achievements that their place in the political 
world may be made secure. Education is the means by which nations, 
strong in the strength of the past, may go through the perilous transi- 
tion to the modern world, as has Japan and as will Russia. Education 
is the only means by which the world can be “made safe” for the na- 
tional type of organization. 
Thus the history of nationality during the nineteenth century is 
closely bound up with the problems of education. And, on the other 
hand, the education of the present may find an interpretation of all of 
its problems, whether of purpose, of subject-matter, of organization, or 
even of method in terms of nationality. 
341. The French Teacher and the National Spirit 
(Buisson, Ferdinand, “‘The Schoolmaster as a Pioneer of Democracy”; in Manuel 
général, September 28, 1909. Reproduced by permission from Buisson and 
Farrington’s French Educational Ideals of Today. World Book Company, 
Yonkers, 1919) 
The following address to the teachers of France, printed in the 
principal educational journal of France, in 1909, by its Editor — 
at that time a member of and chairman of the Committee on 
Education of the French Chamber of Deputies — is so expressive 
of the French use of education for national ends, and likewise so 
expressive of the French educational spirit, that a good portion - 
of the address is here reproduced. 
In the eyes of the world, France is attempting what some one has 
called an “‘unheard-of experiment.” She has pledged herself to estab- 
lish a new social order founded upon reason and justice. She has pro- 
claimed the rights of man, enunciated the principal of universal liberty, 
           
-P-A-G-E-635
  EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 609 
and suppressed all caste privileges. Since escaping as if by a miracle 
from all forms of reaction and starting again on her march with the 
Third Republic, she is building up step by step the new type of society 
that she conceived — a society in which each individual will not only 
encounter no obstacle but will be sure to re- 
ceive the support of society in the free and 
complete development of his personality. 
Wishing to realize this ideal, the Republic 
needed to interest the entire nation. In a de- 
mocracy nothing is done unless the people 
wish it, and then only to the extent that the 
people wish. 
The Republic found a man in each village 
who was very close -to the people, one pos- 
sessing the confidence of the citizens, and 
enjoying a situation at once modest and in- 
dependent, whose profession removed him 
from petty local quarrels, but left him cap- 
  able of exerting an incalculable influence, Fic. Be 
through the children upon the family, and  Ferpmnanp Buisson 
through the family upon the district. It was (b. 1841) 
natural, it was inevitable, that the Republic 
in its propaganda should have made of the schoolmaster its Sis na- 
tional agent, the sower of republican ideas. 
Thus the schoolmaster’s social réle evolved, not a product of faint 
ambition, nor of vain presumption, but of the very force of circum- 
stances. 
To the sons of working men and peasants whose education the Re- 
public confides to them, they are bound to give a course in civic in- 
struction which will enable these children to live in the twentieth cen- 
tury and not in the eighteenth, in a democratic republic and no longer 
under a king or an emperor. They are bound to teach their pupils that 
the Republic wishes all men to “be born and to remain free and in 
tights equal”; that it will be neither a blameworthy nor a chimerical 
hope on their part to desire to see this ideal realized; that this realiza- 
tion depends in great measure upon themselves; that the political, 
economic, and intellectual emancipation of the workers will be the act 
of the workers themselves; that it suffices for them to agree, to organize, 
to teach themselves to apply the perfectly legal means of political ac- 
tion which universal suffrage offers them, the syndicate and economic 
coédperation; that to this end there is need of having recourse neither 
to rioting, nor to dynamite, nor to sabotage, nor to any form of violence; 
and finally that the lesson of these last years, not only in France, but in 
Belgium, Germany, and England, proves that through association the 
proletariat can become a power, capable of treating with other powers    
-P-A-G-E-636
      610 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
as their peer. All this, they are bound to teach. Such being the case, 
they can show only a cordial sympathy and a fraternal spirit to all 
efforts toward organization on the part of the working class. 
On the other hand, they can no longer believe that war is an institu- 
tion forever necessary and inevitable. They belong to a people who 
have always passed for brave men and who have one of the richest heri- 
tages of military glory that history records, but who also treasure in 
their family inheritance the persistent idea of abolishing war and of 
substituting for bloody violence between peoples and between men the 
rational law of arbitration. They will not hide from these French 
youths that a Frenchman of the twentieth century dare no longer have 
the mental attitude of the soldiers of Louis XIV or of the “growlers”’ of 
Napoleon. They will not leave the youth ignorant of the fact that we 
send statesmen to The Hague to write line by line with labored pen, 
but none the less surely, the charter of a civilization to come, which 
some day perhaps will solve by simple and peaceful arbitration the con- 
flicts that are so tragically and sometimes so wrongly decided to-day by 
the massacre of millions of men. 
On these two points the teacher of 1909 is obliged by his profession to 
act in sympathy with his time and his country. 
What, then, is the difficulty? And why is the schoolmaster of our 
time wrestling with practical problems that his predecessors did not 
have and that are not known to the same extent by his colleagues in 
other countries? 
We have just seen the reason. It is because he is being asked what 
has never before been asked of a teaching body: to teach at the same 
time for both the present and the future. 
The French schoolmaster is the servant of a republic and of a democ- 
racy that does not insult him by believing him neutral, indifferent, or 
skeptical. This republic, this democracy, wishes him to speak for her, 
to act openly for her, to make her understood, to make her loved, to 
furnish her with generations of men inspired with principles of repub- 
lican and democratic faith. He must, therefore, give these new gen- 
erations a twofold education, the one they need immediately and the 
one that they will doubtless need later, for the democracy is constantly 
advancing, and the young must be able to advance with her. They are 
not destined to live indefinitely the life of the present, this transitional 
moment which is no longer the monarchy and which is not yet the 
perfect democracy. 
A twofold education, then, for our children when they become citi- 
zens will entail a twotold duty. Whether they consider national or 
foreign policy, social relations or international relations, they will have 
constantly to harmonize the vision of the future with the good of the 
present, the hope of to-morrow with the obligation of to-day. 
     
     
                  
-P-A-G-E-637
    EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 611 
From the social point of view our pupils can not only hope for, but 
they should support vigorously with their votes and with their united 
efforts a demand for, a state of affairs more and more in conformity to 
the principles of justice. The teacher should inspire in them the 
spirit of association and codperation. Thus he will arm them against 
the so-called revolutionary methods, which can only retard the real 
economic revolution, against the revolutionary general strike, against 
sabotage, “that affront to the conscience of work,” against illegal and 
violent action, which is but one more disorder added to others — in 
short, against all forms of anarchy, which would do more harm to the 
democratic and social republic than they would to any other society. 
Where the military question is concerned, we have the same twofold 
duty. 
That which makes the task of the teacher both unique and noble is 
that as he awakens in the souls of the young people the idea of one of 
the greatest advances humanity can make, he will tell them that the 
best means of hastening this great reform is to support with all their 
energy the country that has conceived this reform and may some 
day have the honor of carrying it through triumphantly. Far, then, 
from lessening the duty these young citizens owe the country, this out- 
look can only strengthen it, since it gives them additional reasons for 
shedding their blood for their country if such a sacrifice becomes nec- 
essary. ... True patriotism is like all other virtues; an honest man 
does not make a display of it. The teacher prefers acts to words. The 
conduct of his pupils will prove that they know how to serve their 
country like men, assuming if necessary all possible sacrifices. In sug- 
gesting this conduct he no longer appeals to hatred of the foreigner, or 
love of glory, or blind chauvinism, or the intoxication of battle. His 
pupils will find an equally strong incentive in the clear notion of duty 
and in the vivid feeling of the devotion they owe to France; for is not 
serving France the surest way of serving humanity?   
         
       
The moment through which modern civilization is passing imposes 
upon the teacher two functions, two tasks, which seem to contradict 
each other, but which nevertheless he is expected to perform simul- 
taneously. 
He is a pioneer in all the new ideas which are the very soul of de- 
mocracy. Nevertheless he should keep himself and his pupils from 
digressions, from excesses, and from impatience. In speaking to the 
young, he should appeal frankly to all the generosity that youth pos- 
sesses, to faith in progress, to enthusiasm for the good. At the same 
time he should dissuade from employing methods that appear the most 
expeditious, but which are brusque and brutal. He should inspire a 
etermination to urge society forward by reason and not by force. 
Commissioned to propagate the spirit of solidarity, the love of lib-      
              
        
-P-A-G-E-638
      612 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
erty, the thirst for justice, the will to progress, the schoolmaster should 
perform his function as magistrate of civic education while at the same 
time binding himself to neutrality in everything that does not concern 
the very principles of democracy itself. 
He is both a militant and a man of peace. At heart he is in sym- 
pathy with the people, yet he must not teach class hatred. He is the 
servant of the nation, and at the same time he is conscious of an inter- 
national duty. He says openly, “Have a horror of war!” But he 
prepares his pupils to be good soldiers, capable some day of being 
heroes. 
We readily acknowledge that such a task is less simple than that of 
the schoolmaster of a bygone day. But it is to the honor of the teach- 
ers, men and women, such as the Republic has made them, that one 
should consider putting into their hands the moral direction of a whole 
people, not determining exactly what is expected of them, but leaving 
them to act freely, with reason for a guide and conscience as judge. 
Are we not justified in saying that rarely in history has a bolder, a 
more delicate and difficult enterprise been confided, not to a carefully 
chosen élite, but to a corps of more than one hundred thousand persons 
taken from the lower strata of the nation? 
342. The German Emphasis on National Ends 
(Fr. de Hovre, German and English Education, pp. 23-29. London, 1916) 
The following selection is from a very interesting little book, 
comparing German: and English education, by a Maitre de Con- 
ferences on the Philosophy of Education at the Higher Institute 
of Philosophy, of Louvain University, which appeared in London, 
written by a Belgian exile, during the World War. In the chap- 
ter from which this is taken the author defines German Kultur, 
and declares it to be ‘The Soul of Modern Germany.” 
     
     
  What is meant by Kultur? The best way to grasp what it means is 
to go back to its origin. Kultur is something German; it is an his- 
torical product of their life, and therefore it is only by noting its de- 
velopment that we shall come to see its full and cumulative meaning. 
Being the real soul of the new Germany, Kultur is really the founda: 
tion-stone upon which the German Empire has been built. It is as ol 
as the very idea of the German nation, with which it is most closel 
bound up.    
         
     It was in those dark days (1806-13) that the national idea ripened i 
the German mind. The noise of battle had scarcely ceased before th 
man arose who was to give voice to the sentiments which had graduall     
-P-A-G-E-639
  
EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 613 
matured in the German heart. This apostle of German nationalism 
was Fichte. In 1808, two years after the defeat of Jena, he delivered 
in Berlin his famous “ Discourses to the German Nation” which are the 
gospel of German nationalism and contain the very pith and substance 
of their Kultur. 
       
                                                                  
   
   
     Fichte found the highest expression of the German nation in the 
German language. The German language, says Fichte, must be loved 
not only as the expression of the German mind, but also because it is the 
only purely original language in Europe. All others have been cor- 
rupted by Latin and Greek. German alone has remained pure. Con- 
tinuing, he maintains that a nation with such an original language must 
trace its descent from the birth of humanity. It must be a primitive 
nation. And in this way it comes about that the German nation is the 
oldest people in Europe. ‘Moreover such a language must have been 
fashioned by a people with an original mind; therefore the German 
mind must be the only one which is truly original. The German mind, 
on the other hand, must be original not only in the elaboration of its 
language, but also in the expression of its feelings and thoughts, in all 
the provinces of its activity, namely, in its religion, philosophy, poetry, 
science, art, industry, social organization, education, etc. Such a 
nation, in short, must have its own idiosyncracy in all departments of 
life. It must have its own Kultur. Thus Fichte laid the national 
foundation-stone of German Kultur. 
The nation warrants the originality of Kultur; the State assures its 
consolidation. Though the idea of the Kultur-State was already re- 
volving in the mind of Fichte, it was by Heg@l that the political founda- 
tion of Kultur was laid. 
According to Hegel, the State is previous to the individual, previous 
to all social institutions; it existed before the family, before society, 
before the nation and the Church. Just as the premises imply the 
conclusion, just as the Absolute dominates the contingent and the 
universal includes the particular and the class, in the same way the 
State implies the individual and the social institutions. The State is 
the source of all existence, the creator of all rights, the highest power 
on earth, the “realization of the moral idea,” the “divine will,” the 
“earthly divinity.” 
By his view that “the rational is real and the real is rational,” Hegel 
ery soon came to regard the German State as the truest embodiment 
f his State-idea. The organism of Germany, with him, is the German 
tate; the individuals are only its cells; the social institutions are 
erely its organs. The German State stands supreme over and rests 
nder no obligation to any other State. The German State is a closed 
system, bound by no power on earth, absolute, omnipotent. Its own 
ife, its own existence is its one concern.

The place to be assigned to Kultur is thus clearly indicated: it will 
be but another subservient element in the German State. Kultur is 
the spiritual capital of the nation, the German State is its owner; Kul- 
tur is the soul, the State is the body of Germany; Kultur is the heart, 
the State is the protecting thorax of the national organism: Kultur is 
the marrow, the State is the backbone of Germany. On this so inti- 
mate connection between the two is founded the idea of the German 
Kultur-State. 
Fichte and Hegel were the spiritual fathers of Germany, the two 
pioneers of the German Kultur idea. Later on their work was devel- 
oped by others. The political basis of Kultur, established by Hegel, was 
afterwards indebted for development, firstly, on the side of history to 
Treitschke; secondly, in the realm of practical politics to Bismarck; 
thirdly, in the realm of matters military to men like Scharnhorst, Herd- 
enberg, to writers like Clausewitz, Moltke, Bernhardi. The national 
basis of Kultur, conceived and laid by Fichte, was later developed in 
the various liberal sciences and other departments; so, for instance, in 
economic theory by the National-Economists, in practice by the Zoll- 
verein (Customs-Union). 
If we take both its national and its political basis into consideration, 
German Kultur may thus be defined: “the whole of the creations and 
achievements of the German nation; its language, science, art, litera- 
ture, industry, army, education, etc., organized and controlled by the 
German State for the German State.” 
      
   
   
            
   
       
          
   
    
    
    
    
   343. The Landing of the Pilgrims at Manila 
(Stuntz, Homer C., in Journal of Education, vol. 75, p. 66. January 18, 1912) 
The following brief article, by one of the earliest American 
teachers in the Philippines, gives well the spirit with which the 
United States went about helping the Filipino people to help 
themselves. 
Ten years ago to-day (viz. August 23, 1901), the famous shipload of 
American teachers landed in Manila. There is no parallel to that event 
in the history of nations, and certainly not in the history of coloniza- 
tion in Asia or Africa. A strong nation finds itself in control of eight 
million weak and belated people. This control comes after two years| 
of war, with rifle and gunboat and cannon, bringing public order out of 
chaos and insurrection. 
All the precedents set America by pioneers in Asiatic colonization] 
may be scrutinized in vain to find a suggestion of the course taken b: 
Governor Taft and his advisers. They passed “Act number 74,” — 
free public school act. Then they set scores of college presidents i 
the United States to work securing teachers, and on this date, ten year

EDUCATION BECOMES A NATIONAL TOOL 615 
ago, the army transport Thomas took five hundred and fifty graduates 
of our universities, colleges, and normal schools to the Philippines to 
begin that education of all the people which must precede the estab- 
lishment there of a government of the Philippines by the Filipinos. 
It wasa great day. I can never forget that I was not only a witness, 
but a participant in an event that had no precedent and can never be 
duplicated. No salute was fired; but tons of powder burned in “shame- 
less shocks of senseless sound”’ could not have made more significant 
the “landing of the Pilgrims” in Philippine pedagogy — the layers of 
sure foundation principles for hosts unborn to build upon. We were 
Americans. Over our heads floated free the stars and stripes. The 
yellow flag of Spain was gone. With it should go illiteracy, intoler- 
ance, monarchy, and that ruthless disregard of the individual’s welfare 
which goes with the unruly trinity named. 
England had ruled parts of the East for more than a century, and, 
in the main, ruled it well. Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, and 
France had each colonized parts of the vast continent of Asia and some 
of its islands, but no one of these nations had ever let an official drag- 
net down among the graduates of her institutions of higher education 
and seined up over five hundred young men and women, and then 
chartered a ship and sent them “to the uttermost parts of the earth” to 
lift their belated wards up to a plane upon which they could hope to 
stand as a self-respecting and a self-governing people. That America 
did, and every patriot’s pulse should beat a bit more rapidly when he 
recalls this notable anniversary from year to year — August 23. 
These teachers and their successors have wrought wonders in the 
decade which closes to-night. Over half a million Filipino children and 
youth are now in school. Five hundred thousand Filipino young men 
and women are now teaching English to their own people, and none of 
them knew English ten years ago. More Filipinos can now speak Eng- 
lish than could ever speak Spanish, and our less than ten years of actual 
school work seems a very brief period when compared with three hun- 
dred years during which Spain could have taught her tongue. 
Splendid new intermediate and high school buildings are being 
built, costing up to $50,000. each. The new building for the Manila 
Normal School is about completed, at a cost of $250,000. The Univer- 
sity of the Philippines is fast taking on the proportions of a great state 
university. Trade schools are receiving special attention. A group of 
twenty new and fully-equipped buildings is being planned for this one 
phase of the new educational era in the Philippines. 
The Report of the Superintendent of Education for the Philippine 
Islands, for 1918, contains information which supplements the 
above in an interesting manner. The following is a digest of 
certain portions of this Report.
-P-A-G-E-642
  616 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The steady progress of the people of the Philippine Islands toward 
preparedness for unassisted self-government is reflected in the change 
in the character of the teaching force, and the new interest in education 
shown by the Filipino people themselves. In 1913 the percentage of 
American teachers in the intermediate schools of the Islands was 20; 
in 1918 but 2.7 per cent; in the secondary schools the reduction was 
from 97.5 to 67 per cent; and among the supervisors of education the 
reduction was from 64 to 22 per cent. In 1918 the Filipino legislature 
appropriated $1,500,000 for an educational program extending over 
the following ten years, with a view to placing free elementary instruc- 
tion within the reach of every child of school age on the Islands. To 
do this twelve thousand additional teachers will need to be trained, 
and thousands of new school buildings will have to be erected. The 
six hundred thousand pupils in English-speaking schools in 1918 will be 
doubled by 1923, and by 1921 a majority of the Filipino legislature will 
be English-speaking. The Spanish language is steadily giving way to 
the English, and the general adoption of the latter as the official ae 
guage of the Islands is only a matter of a short time.

  CHAPTER XXVIII 
NEW CONCEPTIONS OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS 
Tue Readings of this chapter relate largely to the rise of teacher- 
training and the normal school, the grading of instruction, and 
the new theories as to the educational purpose and process which 
have come in during the latter part of the nineteenth century. 
The first nations to organize special institutions for the training 
of teachers were the German States and France, the former taking 
the lead. Still later came England and the United States. These 
four were the leading nations in the movement, up to beyond the 
middle of the nineteenth century, and from these four the teacher- 
training idea has spread over the world. Selections 344 and 345 
relate to the German teachers’ seminaries, as early travelers 
abroad found them, the first describing their work in general 
terms, and the second a specific institution. Selection 346 de- 
scribes a French normal school of the same period. Selections 
347 and 348 relate to beginnings in England, the first describing 
the origins of the training-college system, and the second the 
pupil-teacher system which was introduced later on. All these 
descriptions were influential in getting under way the early Amer- 
ican development. Selection 349 reproduces the recommenda- 
tion of Governor Clinton, of New York, for the inauguration of 
teacher-training in the academies, a recommendation which was 
at once adopted by the New York legislature. The next, 350 
a-c, describes the real beginnings of the state normal school idea 
in the United States — 350 a reproducing the first Massachusetts 
law, 350 b the first admission regulations and course of instruc- 
tion, and 350 ¢ Horace Mann’s conception of the importance of 
the normal school in a state system of public instruction, as ex- 
pressed at the dedication of the first building erected in the United 
States for the specific purpose of training teachers. 
The next group of selections relates to the transformation in the 
instruction of the school produced by the coming of professional 
training and the industrial and social revolutions of the nine- 
teenth century. Selection 351 reproduces a number of extracts 
from popular early American school textbooks, to illustrate the 
 
-P-A-G-E-644
      618 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
old type of subject-matter instruction. Selection 352 reproduces 
a typical teacher’s contract of the same period, which also is illus- 
trative of the early textbook and fact-instruction type of school. 
The next selection (353) is introduced to show the partly un- 
graded character and subjects of study of the schools of the city 
of Berlin, at about the same time. The next selection (354) de- 
scribes the process of grading American schools which took place 
during the first half of the nineteenth century — the evolution 
at Providence, Rhode Island, being taken as a type of early 
American development. 
The remaining selections of the chapter relate to nineteenth- 
century educational theory and practice. Selections 355 and 356 
give good statements as to the nature and importance of the work 
done by Herbart. Selection 357 is a good brief statement of 
scientific progress and of the changes in psychology during the 
century, while selection 364 compares the psychology of Pesta- 
lozzi and his followers with that of more recent educational work- 
ers. Selection 358 gives a good brief exposition of Froebel’s 
educational ideas, by his most important interpreter and propa- 
gandist. 
Selections 359 to 363 relate to the movement for the introduc- 
tion of science study. Selection 359 contrasts the English and 
German universities of the mid-nineteenth century in the matter 
of scientific research. Selections 360 and 361 describe the English 
elementary and secondary education at the same time, revealing 
the dearth of modern studies. Selections 362 and 363 give the 
argument and the conclusions of Herbert Spencer on the question 
he raised as to ‘What Knowledge is of Most Worth?” 
Selections 365 and 366 describe the recent transformation of 
school instruction from the older textbook type (351) to instruc- 
tion which tries to relate the work of the school to life outside. 
The first (365) shows the difficulties experienced in transforming 
a school system of the old type into the new, as illustrated by 
China; and the second (366), illustrates, from the teaching of his- 
tory, the modern attempt to socialize all school work. 
          
    
      344. The German Seminaries for Teachers 
(Bache, Alexander D., Report on Education in Europe, pp. 325-26. Philadelphia, 1839) 
In 1836 the trustees of the newly founded Girard College, at 
Philadelphia, an institution for the education of orphans, sent    
    
-P-A-G-E-645
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 619 
Professor A. D. Bache “‘to visit all establishments in Europe re- 
sembling Girard College.” On his return, in 1839, his Report on 
Education in Europe was printed. He devoted much space to an 
enthusiastic description of the Pestalozzian methods, as he had 
seen them in the schools of Holland and the German States, and 
had the following to say with reference to the German system for 
training teachers. 
When education is to be rapidly advanced, Seminaries for Teachers 
offer the means of securing this result. An eminent teacher is selected 
as Director of the Seminary; and by aid of competent assistants, and 
while benefiting the community by the instruction given in the schools 
attached to the Seminary, trains, yearly, from thirty to forty youths 
in the enlightened practice of his methods; these, in turn, become 
teachers of schools, which they are fit at once to conduct, without the 
failures and mistakes usual with novices; for though beginners in name, 
they have acquired, in the course of two or three years spent at the 
Seminary, an experience equivalent to many years of unguided efforts. 
This result has been fully realized in the success of the attempts to 
spread methods of Pestalozzi and others through Prussia. The plan 
has been adopted, and is yielding its appropriate fruits in Holland, 
Switzerland, France, and Saxony; while in Austria, where the method 
of preparing teachers by their attendance on the primary schools is 
still adhered to, the schools are stationary, and behind those of North- 
ern and Middle Germany. 
These Seminaries produce a strong esprit de corps among teachers, 
which tends powerfully to interest them in their profession, to attach 
them to it, to elevate it in their eyes, and to stimulate them to improve 
constantly upon the attainments with which they may have com- 
menced its exercise. By their aid a standard of examination in the 
theory and practice of instruction is furnished, which may be fairly 
exacted of candidates who have chosen a different way to obtain access 
to the profession. 
345. A German Teachers’ Seminary described 
(Bache, Alexander D., Report on Education in Europe, pp. 237-40. Philadelphia, 1839) 
The preceding selection deals with the German Teachers’ Sem- 
inaries in general, and the following describes the work of one of 
the best of the time (1838), located at Weissenfels, in Saxony. 
This seminary, for the education of teachers for the elementary 
schools, is one of four belonging to the province of Saxony, and was last 
organized in 1822. It combines within its premises, or in the neighbor- 
hood, so as to be subject to the control of the same director, the follow- 
 
-P-A-G-E-646
      620 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ing establishments: 1. The normal school, or seminary for teachers, a 
government institution. 2. A preparatory school, subsidiary to the 
former, and established by the enterprise of its teachers. 3. A sem- 
inary school, or burgher school, of four hundred pupils already de- 
scribed. 4. An elementary school for poor children, of two hundred 
pupils. 5. A school for the deaf and dumb, of twenty-five pupils, es- 
tablished in 1828, and supported by the government. The last three 
mentioned schools afford practice to the students of the seminary. 
The government of these establishments is confided to a director, 
who is responsible immediately to the provincial school-board in 
Magdeburg. He has the personal charge of the seminary in which he 
gives instruction, and of which he superintends the domestic economy, 
discipline, and policy. He is assisted in the seminary by three teach- 
ers, who meet him once a week in conference, to discuss the progress 
and conduct of the pupils, the plans of instruction, and other matters 
relating to the school. There are also seven assistant teachers, five for 
the seminary school, and two for the deaf and dumb institution, who 
also assist in the seminary itself. Once a month there is a general 
meeting of the teachers of all the schools just enumerated, for similar 
purposes. 
Applicants for admission are required to produce certificates of bap- 
tism, of moral conduct, and of health, besides an engagement on the 
part of their parents or guardians to pay an annual sum of fifty thalers 
(thirty-seven dollars) for maintenance. These papers must be for- 
warded to the director a fortnight before the day of examination. The 
candidates are examined at a certain time of the year (after Easter), in 
the presence of all the teachers of the school, and their attainments must 
prove satisfactory in Bible and church history, the Lutheran Cate- 
chism, reading, writing, German grammar, especially the orthography 
of the language, the ground-rules of arithmetic (mental and written), 
geography and history, and natural history and philosophy, of the 
grade of the highest class of a burgher school. They must also be able 
to play, at sight, easy pieces of music upon the violin. The usual age of 
admission is eighteen; and the lowest at which they are admissible, 
seventeen. On entrance they are entitled to free lodging and instruc- 
tion, and, if their conduct and progress are satisfactory, in! general, 
receive a yearly allowance of twenty-five dollars, which is equivalent, 
nearly, to the cost of their maintenance. Their clothing and school 
books are provided by the pupils. The modes of preparation judged 
most appropriate by the authorities of the seminary are, the attendance 
on a burgher school, with private lessons from a competent teacher, or 
entrance into the preparatory establishment at Weissenfels. A gym- 
nasium is considered by no means a proper place for the preparation of 
pupils, its courses, discipline, and mode of life having a different tend- 
ency from that required by the future teacher of a common school.

      NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 621 
The admission of new pupils takes place with some ceremony, in 
presence of the teachers and pupils. The director gives a charge, in 
which he makes them acquainted with the rules of the school, chiefly 
those relating to moral conduct, to obedience to the authorities, punc- 
tuality, regular attendance at study, school, church, and, in general, on 
the appointed exercises, due exertion, neatness in their habits, and ex- 
actness in the payment of dues to the tradesmen with whom they may 
deal. They bind themselves to serve for three years after leaving the 
school, in whatever situation may be assigned them by the regency of 
Merseburg, or to pay the cost of their education and maintenance. 
During their stay at the seminary, they are exempted from military 
service, except for six weeks... . 
The courses of instruction are, — morals and religion, German, 
arithmetic and geometry, cosmology, pedagogy, terraculture, hygiene, 
theory and practice of music, drawing and writing. Cosmology is a 
comprehensive term for geography, an outline of history and biogra- 
phy, the elements of natural history and natural philosophy, all that 
relates to the world (earth) and its inhabitants. Pedagogy includes 
both the science and art of teaching. The courses just enumerated are 
divided among the masters, according to the supposed ability of each 
in the particular branches, the whole instruction being ‘given by the 
four teachers. The director, as is customary in these schools, takes the 
religious instruction, and the science and art of teaching, as his especial 
province, and adds lectures on the theory of farming and gardening 
(terraculture), and of health. 
The duration of the course of studies has been reduced from three 
years to two, on account, it is alleged, of the necessity for a more abun- 
dant supply of teachers. There are, probably, other reasons, such as 
the expense, and the fear of over-educating the pupils for their station, 
which have been influential in bringing about this reduction. There 
are two classes corresponding to the two years of study. The first 
year is devoted entirely to receiving instruction; and in the second, 
practice in teaching is combined with it. In the preparatory school 
there is likewise a course of two years, and the pupils are divided into 
two classes. ...

(Bache, Alexander D., Report on Education in Europe, pp. 349-53. Philadelphia, 1839) 
The following description gives a good idea of a typical French 
normal school for the training of elementary teachers of the time 
(1837) of Guizot. 
              
  The Primary Normal School of Versailles is for the Department of 
Seine and Oise. It comprises within its ample premises several estab-

lishments for the instruction and practice of teachers. The school itself 
contains eighty pupils under regular instruction throughout the year, 
and furnishes a two months’ course to adult schoolmasters. The estab- 
lishments for practice begin with the infant school, and rise through 
the primary to the grade of primary superior. Of the elementary 
schools, one affords the young teacher an example of the method of 
mutual, and another of simultaneous instruction. The primary su- 
perior school had been recently established, at the date of my visit, in 
1837. There is, besides, an evening department for the elementary in- 
struction of adults, taught by the pupils of the Normal School, and also 
a school of design, which is established here rather for convenience than 
as properly belonging to the range of the institution. 
... The age of admission is, by rule, between sixteen and twenty- 
one, but the former limit is considered too early for profitable entrance. 
The qualifications for admission consist in a thorough knowledge of 
the subjects taught in the elementary schools. 
The period of instruction is two years. The first year is devoted to 
the revision of elementary studies, and the second to an extension of 
them, and to theoretical and practical instruction in the science and 
art of teaching. The subjects of revision or instruction are, read- 
ing, writing, linear drawing, geography, history, the drawing of maps, 
morals and religion, vocal music, arithmetic, elementary physics, terra- 
culture, and pedagogy. 
The religious instruction is given by an ecclesiastic, who is almoner 
to the school; it includes iessons-on the doctrines and history of the 
church, given twice per week. Protestants are not required to attend 
these lessons, but receive instruction out of the institution from a 
minister of their own confession. 
Besides the more usual school implements, this institution has a 
library, a small collection of physical and chemical apparatus, of tech- 
nological specimens, already of considerable interest, and of models of 
agricultural implements. There are also two gardens, one of which is 
laid out to serve the purposes of systematic instruction in horticulture, 
the other of which contains specimens of agricultural products, and a 
ground for gymnastic exercises. The pupils work by details of three 
at atime, under the direction of the gardener, in cultivating flowers, 
fruits, vegetables, etc. They have the use of a set of carpenters’ and 
joiners’ tools, with which they have fitted up their own library in a very 
creditable way. In the second year they receive lectures on the science 
and art of teaching, and in turn give instruction in the schools, under 
the direction of the teachers. Their perforrnances are subsequently 
criticised for their improvement. 
The order of the day in summer is as follows: 
The pupils rise at five, wash, make up their beds, and clean their

dormitories, in two divisions, which alternate; meet in the study hall 
at half past five for prayers, breakfast, engage in. studies or recitation 
until one; dine and have recreation until two; study or recite until four; 
have exercises or recreation, sup, study, and engage in religious reading 
and prayers; and retire at ten, except in special cases. Before meals 
there is a grace said, and during meals one of the pupils reads aloud. 
In distributing the time devoted to study and recitation, an hour of 
study is made to precede a lesson, when the latter requires specific 
preparation; when, on the contrary, the lesson requires after-reflection 
to fix its principles, or consists of a lecture, of which the notes are to 
be written out, the study hour follows the lesson. The branches of a 
mechanical nature are interspersed with the intellectual. The students 
of the second year are employed, in turn, in teaching, and are relieved 
from other duties during the hours devoted to the schools of practice. 
On Sunday, after the morning service, the pupils are free to leave 
the walls of the institution. The same is the case on Thursday after- 
noon. The director has found, however, bad results from these indis- 
criminate leaves of absence. 
347. The Beginnings of Teacher Training in England 
(Barnard, Henry, National Education in Europe, p. 751. Hartford, 1854) 
The following brief historical account is descriptive of the be- 
ginnings of teacher training in England and Scotland. 
The germ of all the institutions for training teachers for elementary 
schools in England, must be found in the model school and teachers’ 
class of the British and Foreign School Society in the Borough-road, 
London. So early as 1805, the “training of schoolmasters,” in the 
methods of this school, was made the ground of a subscription in its be- 
half, and in 1808, it was set forth as one of the cardinal objects of the 
society. From that time, persons have been admitted every year to 
the school to observe, learn, and practice the methods of classification 
and instruction pursued there. Its accommodations as a normal 
school were insufficient even on the plan of observation and practice 
pursued there, until 1842, when the present building was completed at 
an expense of £21,433, toward which the Committee of Council ex- 
tended a grant of £5000. In the mean time the National Society was 
pursuing a similar plan in its model school at Westminster; and the 
necessity of training well-qualified teachers by means of a special course 
of instruction and practice was ably discussed, and the mode and re- 
sults of such training as exhibited on the continent, and especially in 
Prussia, were ably advocated in parliament, pamphlets, reviews, and 
the daily press. The Quarterly Journal of Education, and the publica- 
tions of the Central Society of Education, and especially the Prize 
Essay of Mr. Lalor, set forth this necessity, and the experience of other
-P-A-G-E-650
  
624. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
countries in a very able manner. Lord Brougham, in his whole public 
life the early and eloquent advocate of popular education, in a speech 
in the House of Lords on the education of the people on the 23d May, 
1835, remarked: 
“These seminaries for training masters are an invaluable gift to 
mankind and lead to the indefinite improvement of education. It is 
this which above all things we ought to labor to introduce into our 
system. . . . Place all normal schools — seminaries for training teachers 
—jin a few such places as London, York, Liverpool, Durham, and 
Exeter, and you will yearly qualify five hundred persons fitted for dif- 
fusing a perfect system of instruction all over the country. These 
training seminaries will not only teach the masters the branches of 
learning and science in which they are now deficient, but will teach 
them what they know far less, the didactic art — the mode of impart- 
ing the knowledge they have, or may acquire — the best method of 
training and dealing with children, in all that regards temper, capacity, 
and habits, and the means of stirring them to exertion, and controlling 
their aberrations.” : 
The speaker, though he failed in this, as well as in former, and subse- 
quent efforts in parliament, to establish a systemof national education, 
according to his own views, has lived long enough to see thirty-six nor- 
mal schools, or training colleges in England and Wales, fourin Scotland, 
and one in Ireland, in successful operation; and both the quantity and 
quality of elementary instruction greatly improved. These results 
have been realized mainly through the action of the Board, or Commit- 
tee of Council on Education, first appointed in 1839. 
One of the first objects proposed for the consideration of the Board, 
was a normal, or model school, in organizing which they were advised 
that “it is her Majesty’s wish, that the youth of this kingdom should be 
religiously brought up, and that the right of conscience should be re- 
spected.” The committee experienced so much difficulty in devising 
the plan of a normal school, under their direction, and in reconciling 
conflicting views of religious communions, that the subject was post- 
poned, and the sum of £10,000 granted by parliament in 1835 toward 
the erection of such a school, was distributed in equal proportions to 
the National Society, and the British and Foreign School Society, to be 
applied by them for this purpose. 
With the aid of this grant, the British and Foreign School Society 
proceeded to provide suitable accommodations for a class of eighty 
normal pupils, in connection with the model schools in the Borough- 
road. The building was completed in 1842, at an expense of £21,433. 
The National Society commenced, in 1840, the erection of a training 
college for seventy-four masters of schools in connection with that 
Society, at Stanley Grove, in Chelsea, two miles from Hyde Park

The success of these experiments dissipated the vague apprehensions, 
which the first announcement of normal schools, asa foreign institution, 
had created, and inspired general confidence in their tendencies, and 
conviction of their necessities. The different religious communions, by 
whose exertions and jealousies the plan of the Committee of Council 
had been defeated in 1839, now came forward to found Training Col- 
leges for teachers of schools in their several connections. The Com- 
mittee of Council encouraged the erection of suitable buildings by 
“grants of money, and contributed toward their support and useful- 
ness by the establishment of the system of pupil teachers, and Queen’s 
scholarships, by which young men and young women of the right 
character are prepared for these institutions, and enabled to remain in 
them for a sufficient length of time to profit by the extended course of 
instruction, and practice prescribed. 
In 1852, there were thirty-four Normal Schools or Training Colleges 
in England and Wales, erected at an expense in building alone of over 
£350,000 of which sum the government contributed about one half. 
These institutions provide the means of residence for about 1000 males 
and seven hundred females, at an annual outlay of about £80,000, of 
which the government will contribute, in grants for Queen’s scholars, 
about one half. 
In Scotland, the first attempt to train teachers in the principles and 
practice of their art, was made by the Education Committee of the 
Church of Scotland, in 1826, by placing a few teachers appointed to 
their schools in the Highlands, for a short course of observation, in- 
struction and practice, in one of their best-conducted schools in Edin- 
burgh. This plan was enlarged and improved in 1838; and, in 1846, 
a building was erected for a Normal School in Castle Place, in Edin- 
burgh, at an expense of £10,000. In the mean time, Mr. Snow, in 
1836, commenced at Glasgow, a similar enterprise at his own risk to 
exemplify, and finally, to train teachers on a system of instruction 
somewhat peculiar. He was subsequently aided by a voluntary 
society, and finally the building was completed by the General As- 
sembly Committee in 1840. The disruption of the Church of Scot- 
land, and the organization of the free church, has led to the establish- 
ment of two other Normal Schools, one at Edinburgh, in 1849, and the 
other at Glasgow, in 1852, at an aggregate expense of over £20,000. 
The buildings for Normal Schools, in Scotland, have cost over £45,000 
($225,000.), and will accommodate about 300 resident pupils, besides 
the schools of practice. 
Of the forty Training Colleges in England and Scotland, twenty- 
seven are connected with the Church of England, two with the estab- . 
lished Church of Scotland, two with the Free Church of Scotland, one

with the Roman Catholic Church, one with the Wesleyan, one with the 
Congregational denomination; and in the six others, the Church of 
England has a virtual ascendency. 
348. The Pupil-Training System described 
(Barnard, Henry, National Education in Europe, p. 753. Hartford, 1854) 
In 1846 the English educational authorities, in an effort to se- 
cure more trained teachers for the schools, instituted an appren- 
ticeship form of teacher training. Under this system pupils were 
apprenticed, usually from thirteen to eighteen years of age, to 
learn the art of teaching, after which they might be eligible to 
enter a training college. The following is a brief description of the 
plan. 
To stimulate and aid the elementary schools, and to prepare pupils 
for the Training Schools, stipends from £10 to £18, increasing from 
year to year for five years, are allowed to a certain number of the most 
vigorous, intelligent, well-behaved and proficient scholars in any 
school, subject to the inspection of the government, who shall pass in a 
satisfactory manner, the examination prescribed by the Committee of 
Council, for an apprenticeship to the office of teaching. These pupil 
teachers, as they are called, receive daily one hour and a half of separate 
instruction from the master of the schools, to which they belong (who 
receives an annual addition to his salary according to the number of 
such pupils), besides spending about the same time in diligent prepara- 
tion; and during five hours each day, are familiarized with the manage- 
ment and instruction of an elementary school, by having charge of one 
of its classes. After spending five years in this way, and passing satis- 
factorily the annual written and oral examination on subjects pre- 
sented by the committee, these pupil teachers are then allowed to enter 
on a vigorous competition for admission in any of the Training Schools, 
as Queen’s scholars. In all of the Training Schools, aided and inspected 
by the Committee of Council, the government allows £25 for the first 
year, £20 for the second, and £30 for the third year, towards the cost of 
maintenance and education of a given number of pupil teachers who 
can pass in a satisfactory manner the examination prescribed by the 
committee. Each Training School receives a grant, varying from £20 
to £30 on each Queen scholar instructed during the year... . This 
system of an annual and strict examination, and of an annual grant to 
deserving pupils to aid them in obtaining the requisite knowledge of 
the principles and practice of teaching, before entering on the responsi- 
bilities of a school, and of rewarding afterwards those who prove faith- 
ful and successful, is changing the whole aspect of elementary educa- 
tion in England. The full results will not be seen, until after the 5000
-P-A-G-E-653

pupil teachers, who have served an apprenticeship of five years in the 
best elementary schools of the kingdom, have spent three years in the 
Training Colleges, and having gained the certificates of merit, are ac- 
tively engaged as teachers. 
349. Governor Clinton on Teacher-Training Schools 
(Randall, S. S., Common School System of the State of New York, p. 27. Troy, 1851) 
In 1827 Governor DeWitt Clinton, in his message to the legis- 
lature, thus recommends the establishment of academies in the 
different counties of the State, in large part to train teachers for 
schools. 
The great bulwark of republican government is the cultivation of 
education; for the right of suffrage cannot be exercised in a salutary 
manner without intelligence. It is gratifying to find that education con- 
tinues to flourish. We may safely estimate the number of our common 
schools at 8000; the number of children taught during the last year, on 
an average of eight months, at 430,000; and the sum expended in edu- 
cation at 200,000 dollars. It is, however, too palpable that our system 
is surrounded by imperfections which demand the wise consideration 
and improving interposition of the legislature. In the first place, there 
is no provision made for the education of competent instructors. Of the 
eight thousand now employed in this state, too many are destitute of 
the requisite qualifications, and perhaps no considerable number are 
able to teach beyond rudimental instruction. Ten years of a child’s 
life, from five to fifteen, may be spent in a common school; and ought 
this immense portion of time to be absorbed in learning what can be 
acquired in a short period? Perhaps one-fourth of our population is 
annually instructed in our common schools; and ought the minds and 
morals of the rising, and perhaps the destinies of all future generations, 
to be entrusted to the guardianship of incompetence? The scale of 
instruction must be elevated; the standard of education ought to be 
raised, and a central school on the monitorial plan ought to be estab- 
lished in each county for the education of teachers, and as exemplars 
for other momentous purposes connected with the improvement of the 
human mind. 
350. Organization of the First Massachusetts Normal Schools. 
(Tenth Annual Report Massachusetts State Board of Education. Boston, 1846) 
From 1825 on, James Carter and others had been trying to get 
a state normal school established in Massachusetts. In 1839 
a citizen of Boston, Mr. Edmund Dwight, authorized Horace 
Mann, then Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Edu-
-P-A-G-E-654
a a 
628 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
cation, to say to the legislature that he would personally give 
, $10,000 for the project, if the State of Massachusetts would ap- 
propriate a similarsum. This was done, by the following: 
(a) The Organizing Law 
RESOLVES 
Relative to qualifying teachers for common schools 
Whereas, by letter from the Honorable Horace Mann, Secretary 
of the Board of Education, addressed, on the r2th of March current, 
to the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Repre- 
sentatives, it appears, that private munificence has placed at his dis- 
posal the sum of ten thousand dollars, to promote the cause of popular 
education in Massachusetts, on condition that the Commonwealth will 
contribute from unappropriated funds, the same amount in aid of the 
same cause, the two sums to be drawn upon equally from time to time, 
as needed, and to be disbursed under the direction of the Board of 
Education in qualifying teachers for our Common Schools; therefore, 
Resolved, That his Excellency, the Governor, be, and he is hereby 
authorized and requested, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Council, to draw his warrant upon the Treasurer of the Common- 
wealth in favor of the Board of Education, for the sum of $10,000, in 
such installments and at such times, as said Board may request: pro- 
vided, said Board, in their request, shall certify, that the Secretary of 
said Board has placed at their disposal an amount equal to that for 
which such application may by them be made; both sums to be ex- 
pended, under the direction of said Board, in qualifying teachers for 
the Common Schools in Massachusetts. 
Resolved, That the Board of Education shall render an annual 
account of the manner in which said moneys have been by them 
expended. 
The State Board of Education, after mature deliberation, de- 
cided to establish three state normal schools, rather than give the 
money to the Academies, as New York had done. This was done, 
and the first three state normal schools in the United States 
opened at Lexington, July 3, 1839; Barre, September 4, 1839; 
and Bridgewater, September 9, 1840. For these schools the 
Board established admission requirements and a course of study, 
as follows: 
(b) Admission and Instruction 
As a prerequisite to admission, candidates must declare it to be their 
intention to qualify themselves to become school teachers. If they 
belong to the State, or have an intention and a reasonable expectation 
of keeping school in the State, tuition is gratis. Otherwise, a tuition- 
 
-P-A-G-E-655
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 629 
fee is charged, which is intended to be about the same as is usually 
charged at good academies in the same neighborhood. . . . 
If males, pupils must have attained the age of seventeen years com- 
plete, and of sixteen, if females; and they must be free from any disease 
or infirmity, which would unfit them for the office of school teachers. 
They must undergo an examination, and prove themselves to be 
well versed in orthography, reading, writing, English grammar, geog- 
raphy, and arithmetic. 
They must furnish satisfactory evidence of good intellectual capacity 
and of high moral character and principles. 
Examinations for admission take place at the commencement of each 
term, of which there are three in a year. 
Term of study. 
. .. The minimum of the term of study is one year, and this must be 
in consecutive terms of the schools. . . . 
Course of study. 
The studies first to be attended to in the State Normal Schools are 
those which the law requires to be taught in the district schools, 
namely, orthography, reading, writing, English grammar, geography, 
and arithmetic. When these are mastered, those of a higher order 
will be progressively taken. 
For those who wish to remain at the school more than one year, and 
for all belonging to the school, so far as their previous attainments will 
permit, the following course is arranged: 
1. Orthography, reading, grammar, composition, rhetoric, and logic. 
2. Writing and drawing. 
3. Arithmetic, mental and written, algebra, geometry, book- 
keeping, navigation, surveying. 
4. Geography, ancient and modern, with chronology, statistics and 
general history. 
5. Human Physiology, and hygiene or the Laws of Health. 
6. Mental Philosophy. 
7. Music. 
8. Constitution and History of Massachusetts and of the United 
States. 
g. Natural Philosophy and Astronomy. 
to. Natural History. 
11. The principles of piety and morality, common to all sects of 
Christians. 
12. The science and art of teaching, with reference to all the above- 
named studies. 
Religious exercises. 
A portion of the Scriptures shall be read daily, in every State Normal 
School.
-P-A-G-E-656
  630 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
To these new schools Mr. Mann gave most hearty support, and 
helped them to weather legislative storms for a decade before 
they became firmly established as parts of the school system of 
the State. Probably nowhere else in the Union could the normal 
school have been established at so early a date, or, if established, 
been allowed to remain. Speaking at the dedication of the first 
building for normal school purposes erected in the United States, 
at Bridgewater, in 1846, Mr. Mann showed the deep interest he 
felt in the establishment of normal schools, when he said: 
(c) Importance of the Normal School 
I believe the Normal schools to be a new instrumentality in the ad- 
vancement of the race. I believe that without them free schools 
themselves would be shorn of their strength and their healing power, 
and would at length become mere charity-schools, and thus die out in

fact andin form. Neither the art of printing, nor the trial by jury, nor 
a free press, nor free suffrage, can long exist to any beneficial and salu- 
tary purpose without schools for the training of teachers; forif the char- 
acter and qualifications of teachers be allowed to degenerate, the free 
schools will become pauper schools, and the pauper schools will produce 
pauper souls, and the free press will become a false and licentious press, 
and ignorant voters will become venal voters, and through the medium 
and guise of republican forms an oligarchy of profligate and flagitious 
men will govern the land; nay, the universal diffusion and ultimate 
triumph of all-glorious Christianity itself must await the time when 
knowledge shall be diffused among men through the instrumentality of 
good schools. Coiled up in this institution, as in a spring, there is a 
vigor whose uncoiling may wheel the spheres,

To illustrate the type of instruction that was common in our 
early educational history, a few typical pages from two popular 
early textbooks are here reproduced. With such subject-matter,

of questions and answers covering American history, arranged in 
catechism form, to which was added the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, the Federal Constitution, and a Table of Chronology of

(Bache, Alexander D., Report on Education in Europe, pp. 231-35. Philadelphia, 1839) 
At the time of Professor Bache’s visit (1838) the elementary 
schools of Berlin were divided into two classes, the first covering 
instruction from six to ten, and the second from ten to fourteen. 
He gives the subjects of study, for both boys and girls, for each 
class, to be as follows: 
Subjects of Instruction 
For the first class: 
1. For religion: the Bible, Catechism, the positive truths of Chris- 
tianity. 
2. For the German language: language considered as the expression 
of thought; the most general rules of grammar, clear and intelli- 
gible pronunciation, reading and orthography. 
. Writing. 
. Arithmetic, to fractions and the rule-of-three, inclusive. 
Singing, and particularly exercises in sacred choral music. ape

354. Grading the Schools of Providence 
(Regulations of the School Committee, 1800, 1827, 1828, and Ordinance of the City 
Council of Providence, Rhode Island, of April 9, 1838; in Centennial Report School 
Committee, 1899-1900, pp. 49, 51-52, 58, 72) 
In 1799 the ‘Providence Association of Mechanics and Manu- 
facturers” petitioned the Legislature to “establish free schools 
throughout the State.” In response a law was passed under 
which Providence began schools, in 1800. 
The original course of study for the schools, adopted at the 
time of their origin, is reproduced below. It is noteworthy for its 
brevity and simplicity, and reveals an ungraded, individual- 
instruction school. It reads: 
The principal part of the Instruction will consist in teaching Spelling, 
Accenting and Reading both Prose and Verse with propriety and ac- 
curacy, and a general knowledge of English Grammar and Composi- 
tion: Also writing a good hand according to the most approved Rules, 
and Arithmetic through all the previous Rules, and Vulgar and Deci- 
mal Fractions, including Tare and Tret, Fellowship, Exchange, Inter- 
est, &c. 
The books to be used in carrying on the above Instruction are Al- 
den’s Spelling Book, rst and 2d part, the Young Ladies’ Accidence, 
by Caleb Bingham, The American Preceptor, Morse’s Geography, 
abridged, the Holy Bible in select portions and such other Books as 
shall hereafter be adopted and appointed by the Committee. The 
Book for teaching Arithmetic shall be agreed on by the Masters. 
In 1827 Primary Schools were added below, to the ungraded 
schools organized in 1800, and the course of study was changed to 
tread as follows: — 
2d. The branches taught in the Primary Schools shall be reading and 
spelling; and the books used for instruction therein shall be the following 
and no other: viz. the New York Primer; Alden’s Spelling Book, first 
and second parts; Easy Lessons and the New Testament.
-P-A-G-E-663
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 637 
3d. Children of both sexes of the age of four years and upwards may 
attend the primary schools in their respective districts and no other 
until they are transferred to the writing schools as is herein after pre- 
scribed. 
4th. The branches taught in the writing schools shall be spelling, read- 
ing, the use of capital letters and punctuation, writing, arithmetic, the 
rudiments of book keeping, English grammar, geography and epistolary 
composition; and the books used shall be the following and no other, 
viz. Alden’s Spelling Book, second part, the new Testament, the Amer- 
ican Preceptor, the Brief Remarker, Murray’s Sequel to the English 
reader, Smith’s Arithmetic, Murray’s Abridgement of English gram- 
mar and Woodbridge’s small Geography. 
Some attempt at the grading of the Writing or Grammar 
Schools was introduced at about this same time, by a resolution 
of July 23, 1827, which read: 
RESOLVED that it be recommended to the Committee of the Council 
appointed to set off a portion of the 4th District School for a female 
School, and to make enquiry whether a sufficient attention be paid to 
the study of Arithmetic in said School. — 
ReEsoLvep that it be recommended by this Committee that no male 
pupil in the public schools shall commence the study of Geography un- 
til he shall have pursued the Study of Arithmetic as far as practice, nor 
shall any female pupil study Geography until she shall have pursued 
the Study of Arithmetic as far as Compound Division. 
In 1838 a higher school was voted, and organized in 1843, to 
complete the system upward, and a City Superintendent of Schools 
was ordered employed. At this time the City Council fixed the 
scope of the school system by an ordinance providing for one 
High School, six Grammar or Writing Schools, and ten Primary 
Schools, and made the following provisions concerning them: 
Sec. 2, That each Primary School shall be under the care of a princi- 
pal and one assistant teacher and the rudiments of an English educa- 
tion shall be'taught therein. That each Grammar and Writing School 
shall be under the care of a Master and at least two female assistant 
teachers, or one male assistant teacher, at the discretion of the school 
committee; and the ordinary branches of an English education shall be 
taught therein. That the High School shall be under the care of a 
Preceptor and one or more Assistant teachers, and thorough instruc- 
tion shall be given therein in all the branches of a good English educa- 
tion; and instruction shall also be given therein, to all the pupils whose 
parents or guardians may desire it, in all the preparatory branches of a 
classical education.
-P-A-G-E-664

Sec. 3. The High School shall not at any time contain more than two 
hundred pupils, of which number not more than one hundred shall be 
females, except when the number of male pupils shall be less than one 
hundred; in which case, an additional number of females may be admit- 
ted, until the School shall be filled, under such conditions as the School 
Committee may prescribe.

Fic. 88. Extertor AND INTERIOR OF A PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND 
SCHOOL 
This was the typical grammar-school building of about 1840. Each floor seated 
228 pupils, and was conducted as a separate school. Boys and girls were here 
seated on opposite sides of the central aisle, though the usual plan was to give 
one floor to each sex. In Boston the upper floor was used by the writing school and 
the lower floor by the reading school. Two small recitation rooms are shown 
leading off the main room, for the use of the assistant teachers

Sec. 5. That the School Committee be and they are hereby author- 
ized and requested to appoint annually a Superintendent of the Public 
Schools, who shall perform such duties in relation to the public schools 
as said Committee may from time to time prescribe, said Superintend- 
ent to be subject to removal at any time by the School Committee in 
case of inability or mismanagement. 
By 1844 the schools were re-divided into Primary, Intermedi- 
ate, Grammar, and High Schools, and then the yearly grading was 
further applied to perfect the system. 
355. Herbart’s Educational Ideas 
(Felkin, Henry M. and Emmie. Translator’s “Introduction” to Herbart’s 
Science of Education. London, 1891) 
The following extracts from a long Introduction to an English 
translation of Herbart’s ‘‘The Aisthetic Revelation of the World” 
and his ‘‘General Principles of the Science of Education,” give a 
fairly good idea as to the philosophy and principles worked out by 
Herbart, and the relation of his psychology to that of his prede- 
cessors. 
The significance of Herbart’s life and work for the teacher arises from 
the fact that education with him was the starting point and end of 
all his investigations. He was the only modern thinker who has not 
treated education casually in his works, or looked at it, as Fichte did, 
mainly from a political standpoint, but has allowed the whole weight 
of his philosophy and ethics to operate on it, and construct it into a 
scientific system. He not only sought, found, and explained its psy- 
chological basis, but he did this in the light of his larger philosophy. 
“T for my part,” he writes, “have for twenty years called to my aid 
metaphysics and mathematics, besides self-observation, experience, 
and experiments, in order only to find the foundation of true psycho- 
logic knowledge.” 
_ Philosophers before Herbart (Wolff, Kant, and his disciples) ad- 
hered to Aristotle’s principle, but slightly modified, that the soul is the 
dwelling-place of higher and lower capacities, entirely separate from 
each other. According to this theory, mental processes lying open to 
the observation of experience were classified into smaller and larger 
divisions, according to their similitude. . All phenomena of one kind 
were regarded as effects of a single capacity, originally inherent in the 
soul. Three chief capacities were assumed — knowledge, feeling, and 
will, each of which was again separated into its sub-capacities, the re- 
sult being a system which was nothing more than a classification of so- 
called capacities. Given these as the material for their work, the old    
   
-P-A-G-E-666
640 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
school of teachers set before itself a corresponding diversity of aims, 
each of which was to be reached by a separate road, and imagined an 
all-round perfection of the single capacity would follow from its con- 
centration on one object. Herbart proved not only the falsity of this 
theory, but also that, were it true, education in its noblest conception 
would be but an empty word. 
Educational problems first directed him to the study of psychology, 
and, convinced of its supreme importance not only for them but for 
natural philosophy, and the philosophy of history, ethics, and politics, 
he pursued it with never-failing energy for the rest of his life. Relegat- 
ing in its light the “capacities” to the region of myth, he may be said to 
have created, as the result of his long and deep research, a natural his- 
tory of the human mind. He proved how vain was the attempt to 
deduce from the capacities, the conformity of mental activity to law, 
or to reconcile with their multiplicity the simple nature of the soul and 
the unity of consciousness, how irrational to consider as original those 
endowments of the soul, which are the result of a long process of devel- 
opment... . 
The proposition, then, which forms the basis of his psychology is, — 
that presentations (Vorstellungen) are the elements of mental life, and 
their combinations, permutations, and interactions cause all the rest of 
the manifold forms of consciousness. They are to psychology what the 
elements are to chemistry, and cells to physiology. By a presentation, 
Herbart means not only the complex idea presented to the mind 
through sense, to which the term is usually applied (for instance the 
idea of a chain), but the numerous elementary ideas to the furthest 
extremity of thought of which it is composed. ... 
The masses of presentations which the teacher finds already existent 
in the child’s mind have two main sources, experience and intercourse. 
It is the teacher’s work to create from the former knowledge, from the 
latter sympathy, by means of an educating instruction. 
If, then, the mind be built up of presentations, and consequently is 
inherently neither good nor bad, but develops one way or the other, 
under external influences and guidance of the teacher, it follows nec- 
essarily that what it receives in the form of presentations and their 
mode of combination, that is to say the work of education, is of infinite 
importance. It is, in Herbart’s own words, “the formation of the cir- 
cle of thought’’ (Gedankenkreis), upon which depends the good, that 
is the enlightened will — the source of the one and only aim of educa- 
tion — morality. His insistence on the circle of thought as the seat of 
the good will, and its result, the formation of a moral character, as the 
whole and sole end of the teacher’s work, and the strictly logical method 
by which on the basis of his psychology he showed the absolute depend- 
ence of the aim to be attained, upon the enlightenment of the will, is
-P-A-G-E-667
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 641 
the greatest service which Herbart rendered to education. Morality 
depends on the good will, this again on the enlightenment of the whole 
man. Cultivate in the pupil this enlightenment, i.e. a “large and, in 
all its parts, interconnected circle of thought, which possesses the 
power of overcoming what is unfavorable in the environment, as well 
as of dissolving and absorbing from it what is good,” for ‘“‘he only 
wields the full force of education who does so.” The fundamental 
thought and aim of the Padagogik is thus to aid the pupil to form his 
moral character by his own power — by “‘a making’ he himself dis- 
covers when choosing the good and rejecting the bad.”’ To place the 
power already existent and in its nature trustworthy under such condi- 
tions that it must surely and infallibly accomplish this rise, is the 
work of the teacher, and the means to its accomplishment as elaborated 
in Herbart’s system of education are government, instruction, and 
discipline. 
The immeasurable service Herbart rendered to education by the new 
light he threw on the laws of mind, indicates his distinct advance in one 
direction on his predecessors. Comenius and Pestalozzi, insisting that 
education should follow the course of the child’s natural development. 
and be based on the psychological laws of human nature, had ad- 
vanced far in the same direction. But the knowledge of those laws in 
their day was too vague to allow of any but the most general expression 
of the vital truth they saw and proclaimed. Herbart himself made no 
pretension to possess a complete science of mind; no one was more pen- 
etrated than he by the conviction that this science was in its earliest 
beginning, leaving an immeasurable field for future investigators. But 
his wide knowledge, his power of analytic and abstract thought, and 
incorruptible love of truth enabled him to gain a more accurate insight 
into the origin and process of, mental activity, and with it the possibil- 
ity of marking out a systematic course of education, which in the em- 
ployment of definite means would attain sure results and compass its 
appointed end. Such a course of education, together with its means 
and their employment, is developed in the General Principles of the 
Science of Education. The system of education it contains is, as the 
title of the book sets forth, deduced from its aim — morality, which in 
the isthetic Revelation of the World Herbart presents as the highest aim 
of humanity, and consequently of education. ... 
356. Application of Herbart’s Ideas to Instruction 
(Felkin, Henry M. and Emmie. In Translator’s “Introduction” to Herbart’s 
Science of Education. London, 1891) 
The following is a continuation of the preceding selection, and 
applies Herbart’s educational ideas to the process of instruction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-668
Ee Te ee ee ee ee ee 
642 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
We have seen that Herbart founded his pedagogy on ethics and 
psychology, the former supplying the aim of education, and the latter 
the means thereto. On its ethical side, pedagogy is purely specula- 
tive; but on its psychological side it must take counsel with experience. 
Viewed, then, in relation to ethics, it is a science (that which is known); 
in its relation to psychology — to experience, it is an art (that which 
is done). Education as an art is classified as government, instruction, 
and discipline. 
1. Government. The highest and necessary aim of education is 
| morality. But the boy when grown to manhood will set other aims 
beside this before himself; therefore the teacher must consider not only 
the necessary, but these other possible aims of his pupil also — aims 
which will answer to his talents, dispositions, and inclinations. Since 
the teacher cannot know what these aims will be, he must qualify the 
pupil to attain them by preparing inward power, and this can only be 
done by giving a general stimulus to the mind. 
The starting point of education is individuality, — what the pupil 
is and has. The idiosyncrasies of the individual are to be re- 
spected, for in them lies the strength of individuality, which is to be 
maintained as unimpaired as possible, that the child may not become a 
mere type of the race. 
The sole object of government, the first division of education, is to 
create order and keep the child within bounds; it therefore deals with 
the present alone. Authority and love support its measures, which are 
occupation, supervision, threatening and punishment. These must 
gradually be made dispensable and then withdrawn. 
2. Instruction. Instruction, the second division of education, is the 
most important. Education must determine the will towards virtue. 
But both will and wisdom have their roots in the circle of thought, that 
is to say, in the combination and codperative activity of the presenta- 
tions acquired, and the true cultivation of that circle instruction alone 
can give. The more immediate aim of instruction on its way to its 
ultimate aim is a balanced, mamy-sided interest; that is, an intellectual 
activity prompted by instruction, and directed towards many objects, 
in which no single effort preponderates, but all are as far as possible of 
equal strength. Interest as such depends iramediately upon its object, 
and is thereby differentiated from desire, which strives toward some- 
thing in the future. When the mind becomes concentrated on the 
future more than the present, interest passes into desire. Observa- 
tion and expectation are conditions of interest, demand and action of 
desire... : 
Interest, whose object is to create a many-sided activity, is directed 
first to the natural already-existent presentations, i.e., those which 
have been given by experience and intercourse. Since experience leads 
to knowledge of nature, and intercourse to the disposition toward]
-P-A-G-E-669
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 643 
human beings (sympathy), instruction must be brought to bear on both 
in order that it may correct and complete them. 
... To place all in balanced action is to create the perfect many- 
sided culture of the mind. 
The course of instruction is determined accordingly. It will be 
analytical in so far as it separates and dissects, moreover corrects and 
completes; in it the chief work will fall on the pupil. Or it will be 
synthetical in so far as the elements are given and combined; in this 
the teacher will determine the order of connection. Both analytical 
and synthetical instruction are classified in conformity with the six 
classes of interest, and the two must naturally support each other. 
Instruction. must universally point out, connect, teach, philosophise; 
the first is productive of Clearness, the second of Association; the 
third leads to System, the last to Method. In matters appertaining 
to sympathy, instruction is observing, continuous, elevating, active in 
the sphere of reality. And these conditions are again in like manner 
productive in order of clearness, association, system, and method. 
3. Discipline. Discipline, the third division of education, consists in 
direct action on the child, with intent to form him. This cannot be 
accomplished, however, by merely exciting the feelings. Through the 
influence of discipline, the circle of thought itself must receive addi- 
tions, and the desires be transformed into action. Therefore its work 
is indirect, so far as it prepares the way for instruction to determine the 
circle of thought, and direct so far as it transforms the contents of that 
circle into action, and thus lays the foundation for character. The 
aim of discipline is moral strength of character, that is steadfastness in 
progress to virtue. Character consists in uniformity and firmness of 
will, as these are exhibited both in what the man will, and what he will 
not do.... 
The attitude which the teacher assumes toward the pupil is the most 
important aid to discipline — his expressed satisfaction or dissatisfac- 
tion, freedom granted or restraint imposed, etc., — throughout which, 
the pupil’s susceptibility is to be observed, made use of carefully, and 
not over-stimulated. 
The book on discipline closes with suggestions as to its method of 
procedure. It is the formation of character by the light of psychology. 
Special stress is laid on the importance of keeping the mind as a whole 
tranquil and clear, so that the esthetic judgments may form, and the 
character become moral. In proportion as the pupil has gained trust 
in his opinions and principles, discipline must retreat and allow room 
for self-education.

357. Herbart and Modern Psychology 
(Titchener, E. B., in Journal of Education. Boston, May 19, 1898) 
The following is not only a good brief statement of the origin 
of modern psychology, but also a good brief presentation of the 
larger stages in the history of the progress of science. 
The history of science is a history of differentiation. When the 
human race first began to reflect upon the universe, it took the universe 
in the large; early Greek ‘“‘science” is cosmic philosophy. Little by 
little, the sciences have split off from philosophy, far more recently 
than one is apt to believe. Descartes (1596-1650) included both medi- 
cine and mechanics under philosophy; Wolff (1679-1754) thought that 
physics was as much a part of philosophy as was empirical psychology. 
Even to-day we find physical apparatus catalogued under the title of 
“philosophical instruments.” 
The first thing that a science has to do, then, in order to be a science, 
is to shake itself free of philosophy, of speculation about the ultimate 
nature of the universe. It must assert its independence, and declare 
itself lord and master over a certain range of facts. But many a 
“science” has made this assertion, and yet fallen back again under 
philosophical dominion. If the revolt is to be successful, it must be 
carried out with method. Method, a definite and fruitful way of 
arranging and discovering facts, is the conditio sine qua non of a 
science. 
The nineteenth century has witnessed a long series of victories for 
science over philosophy. We have the new biology of Darwin; the 
new physiology of Ludwig; the new pathology of Virchow; the new 
chemistry of Liebig; the new physics of Maxwell and Helmholtz and 
Thomson. There are some bodies of knowledge — ethics, esthetics, 
sociology, for instance — that have not yet succeeded in freeing them- 
selves from metaphysical influence; but no one can doubt that they 
are well on their way to become sciences. And the place of philosophy 
has undergone a corresponding change. So far from dictating to sci- 
ence what it shall teach and what it shall refrain from teaching, 
metaphysics now follows in the train of the special sciences, and shapes 
its own doctrines in accordance with scientific results. 
Psychology has played its part in this revolution. At the beginning 
of the century it was an integral part of philosophy; at the end it is 
a science of the sciences, a “laboratory” science. Let us compare the 
two points of view for a moment, and see precisely wherein the differ- 
ence consists: 
The change from philosophy to science was mediated very largely by 
the work of one man — Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841). Her- 
bart dealt the power theory of mind its deathblow. So far, he may be        
   
                    
-P-A-G-E-671
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 645 
accounted a “new” psychologist. Nevertheless, he still based his 
psychology directly upon metaphysics. The system of competing 
ideas which he substituted for the older faculties is meaningless and 
unsubstantial unless it is backed by his metaphysical system. The 
“new psychology” proper, psychology as natural science, is the com- 
bined work of four other men: Hermann Lotze (1817-1881), Ernst 
Heinrich Weber (1795-1878), Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887), 
and Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1832). 
358. Froebel’s Educational Views 
(Marenholtz-Biilow, Baroness Bertha von, Child and Child Nature. 
Berlin, 1878; trans. by Alice M. Christie. London, 1879) 
Froebel’s writings are so mystical and religious in character 
that they convey but little idea of the kindergarten as it is to-day 
developed, and the best conception as to his educational theory is 
found in the writings of those who have interpreted him, rather 
than in his own books. His greatest interpreter and propagandist 
was the Baroness Bertha von Marenholtz-Biilow (-Wendhausen) 
(1810-1893), who expounded his ideas in the leading countries of 
Europe, and, after 1870, in a training college in Dresden. The 
following extract from her “Contributions to the Understanding 
of Froebel’s Educational Theories” gives a fairly good idea as to 
his educational ideas. 
“The purpose of nature is development. The purpose of the spiritual 
world is culture. The problem of this world is an educational one, the 
solution of which is proceeding according to fixed divine laws.” — 
Froebel. 
Epucation is emancipation — the setting free of the bound-up 
forces of the body and the soul. The inner conditions necessary to 
this setting free or development all healthily-born children bring with 
them into the world, the outer ones must be supplied through educa- 
tion. 
Law or DEVELOPMENT 
Everything in the kingdom of nature, however different the stages 
of progress may be, comes under one universal law, and development 
means the same as progress according to law, — systematic going on 
from the unformed to the formed, from chaos to cosmos. 
And as does the physical so also must the spiritual development 
proceed in systematic fashion, or education would be impossible. For 
what we call education is influencing the development of the child, 
guiding and regulating it as well in its spiritual as in its physical aspect.

    But how common a thing it is to hear people maintain that during the 
instinctive, unconscious period of a child’s life, it should be left to fol- 
low its impulses entirely, and no attempt made to deal with it system- 
atically. But, as the soul undoubtedly begins to unfold and form it- 
self in the period of unconsciousness in the same systematic manner as 
in later periods, any such assertion must be erroneous and based on 
false premises. Spiritual development must proceed in as regular and 
systematic a course as organic development, seeing that the physical 
organs are intended to correspond as implicitly to the soul, which they 
serve, as cause cofresponds to effect. Psychology has determined the 
order of the development of the soul, as has physiology that of the cir- 
culation of the blood, but the former science has chiefly concerned 
itself with the already more or less formed soul of the adult, which, 
through self-will and voluntary deflection from the path of order, is 
always to a certain extent the slave of arbitrariness and the growth of 
the soul in the period of childhood has been little studied or observed. 
Froebel used to say constantly when lecturing: “If you want to 
understand clearly the regular working of nature you must observe the 
common wild plants, many of which are designated as weeds: it is seen 
more clearly in these than in the complexity of cultivated plants.” 
For this purpose he grew different species of wild plants in pots. 
The same holds true of the human plant. The young child’s soul, 
while yet in its primitive and instinctive stage, without forethought 
and without artificiality, exhibits to the really seeing and understand- 
ing observer the systematic regularity, the logic of nature’s dealings 
in her development process, in spite of the variety of individual en- 
dowment. : 
   CorRESPONDENCES — INDIVIDUAL — THE RACE 
Froebel says: “There is a continuous connection in the spiritual life 
as a whole, as there is universal harmony in nature.” And certainly 
it cannot be otherwise: the eternal law of order, which reigns through- 
out the universe, must also determine the development of the human| 
soul. But the educator who would supply the human bud in right 
manner with light and warmth, rain and dew, and so induce it to eman- 
cipate itself from its fettered condition, and through the unfolding off 
all its slumbering forces to blossom into worthy life, must not onl: 
_ understand the law but must also possess the means of acting in accord 
ance with the law: i.e., his method of education must follow the sam 
systematic plan as nature does, and the outward practical means mus 
correspond. 
No onewill dispute the assertion that instruction is only worthy of th 
name when it is methodical. Instruction of such kind is a branch o' 
education: but branch and stem spring from the same root. Howeve:

much may have been done, from the days of antiquity up to the 
present day, to improve educational and instructional systems, and to 
adapt them more closely to the natural process of development, and 
thus attain the result aimed at — knowledge — in the best and quickest 
manner, the laws of development of the infant mind are, nevertheless, 
still veiled in obscurity. No infallible chart has yet been found, 
which, as the magnet to the mariner, will show the educator invariably 
the right direction to steer in, spite of all ebbs and flows, spite of all the 
thousand different courses that each vessel, each character, according 
to its individual destination, has to strike into. But so long as some 
such fixed method of education remains undiscovered, so long will even 
the best education be more or less an arbitrary work. 
It was also Pestalozzi’s chief endeavor to discover and apply that 
which he called ‘‘the principle of the organic,” and to him, and his 
educational forerunners, are we indebted for our first knowledge of the 
course of child development, and for the means by which education 
and instruction have been more systematically organized. Without 
their preliminary efforts Froebel might not, perhaps, have discovered 
the method whereby he built upon the foundations laid by them, and 
brought their, and especially Pestalozzi’s, practical endeavors to com- 
pletion. In like manner will Froebel’s successors be called upon to 
develop further what he has laid the foundation of. 
In one of his letters to me, Froebel says: “As motion in the universe 
depends on the law of gravitation, so do movements in the life of 
humanity depend on the law of the unity of life.” — And further: “As 
the laws of the fruit are developments of the laws of the flower, and 
the laws of the flower developments of the laws of the bud, and the 
laws of the bud, flower, and fruit, are at the same time one with the 
laws of the whole tree or-plant; so are the laws of the development of 
the spiritual life higher outcomes, or developments, of the laws of 
the solar and planetary system of the universe. Were this not the case 
man could not understand the latter, for he can only understand that 
which is homogeneous to him. And, according to this, the laws of the 
development of life, in the region of the spiritual, must be apprehended, 
demonstrated, and built upon, in the same manner as the laws of the 
formation of the world. It will be the work of the Kindergarten to 
point out the application of these laws, as one stage of progressive 
human cultivation.” 
Froebel’s aim and efforts may, I think, be summed up thus: he was 
striving to hit on a regular course or method of education, corresponding 
to the method of instruction long ago established by pedagogic science.   
Whether it has happened to Froebel by a lucky hit to give a new 
basis to education, experience and the application and carrying out 
of his method must show. A written exposition can do no more than

represent the matter in its general outlines, and thus awaken the desire 
to understand it better, and to test its merits by application. 
The most difficult of all difficult tasks is without doubt to give a 
universally enlightening definition to a new truth — great or small — 
for new truths always lie outside the general mental horizon. Even 
Froebel himself, therefore, has had little success in describing his edu- 
cational theory in its full compass, and he is, perhaps, even more 
justified than Hegel and other thinkers in complaining that he has not 
been understood. Far be it from us to pretend here to expound this 
idea in its whole breadth and depth — we would only attempt by 
means of the following short statements to open up the way to an 
understanding of it: 
The process of spiritual development goes on according to fixed laws. 
These laws correspond to the general laws which reign throughout 
the universe, but are at the same time higher, because suited to a 
higher stage of development. 
This system of laws must be able to be traced back to a fundamental 
law, however much the latter may vary in its formule. 
FROEBEL’s THEORY OF EDUCATION 
As a result of the foregoing we find the first general educational req- 
uisites to be: 
Assistance of spontaneous development which shall accord with the 
laws of nature; 
Considerations for the outward conditions of life of each epoch, and 
for each personality; 
Understanding and application of the universal laws of spiritual 
development. 
With regard to the special services rendered by Froebel, let me here 
repeat what I have already mentioned, that Froebel has discovered the 
method and practical means of disciplining, or of developing, body, 
soul and mind, will, feeling and understanding according to the sys- 
tematic laws of nature. 
In the practical application of the positive and individual portion 
of it, the simplicity and naturalness of Froebel’s method stand out 
markedly, and at once do away with any idea of its being pedantic or 
artificial, and in opposition to the natural free development of the child.

(Huxley, T. H., Science and Education, pp. 104-07. Collected Essays, vol. m1. 
London, 1803) 
The ablest English writer and speaker who forcefully supported 
the general line of argument advanced by Herbert Spencer, as to
-P-A-G-E-675

the importance of a revision of existing school instruction and the 
introduction of science teaching, was the English scientist, 
Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895). 
In an address delivered, in 1868, to the South London Working 
Men’s College on ‘‘A Liberal Education; and Where to find it,” 
Huxley stated so clearly the defects of existing educational condi- 
tions in England, and gave such a good definition as to what in his 
judgment constituted a liberal education, that this address may 
be taken as one of the most important expressions of the period of 
the new interest in England in educational reform. Contrasting 
the English and German universities, he said: 
I believe there can be no doubt that the foreigner who should wish 
to become acquainted with the scientific, or the literary, activity of 
modern England, would simply lose his time and his pains if he visited 
our universities with that object. 
And, as for works of profound research on any subject, and, above 
all, in that classical lore for which the universities profess to sacrifice 
almost everything else, why, a third-rate, poverty-stricken German 
university turns out more produce of that kind in one year, than our 
vast and wealthy foundations elaborate in ten. 
Ask ‘the man who is investigating any question, profoundly and 
thoroughly — be it historical, philosophical, philological, physical, 
literary, or theological; who is trying to make himself master of any 
abstract subject (except, perhaps, political economy and geology, both 
of which are intensely Anglican sciences), whether he is not compelled 
to read half a dozen times as many German as English books? And 
whether, of these English books, more than one in ten is the work of 
a fellow of a college, or a professor of an English university? 
Is this from any lack of power in the English as compared with the 
German mind? The countrymen of Grote and of Mill, of Faraday, of 
Robert Brown, of Lyell, and of Darwin, to go no further back than the 
contemporaries of men of middle age, can afford to smile at such a 
suggestion. England can show now, as she had been able to show in 
every generation since civilisation spread over the West, individual men 
who hold their own against the world, and keep alive the old tradition 
of her intellectual eminence. 
But, in the majority of cases, these men aré what they are in virtue 
of their native intellectual force, and of a strength of character which 
will not recognize impediments. They are not trained in the courts of 
the Temple of Science, but storm the walls of that edifice in all sorts of 
irregular ways, and with much loss of time and power, in order to obtain 
their legitimate positions. 
Our universities not only do not encourage such men; do not offer    
-P-A-G-E-676
  650 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
them positions, in which it should be their highest duty to do, thor- 
oughly, that which they are most capable of doing; but, as far as pos- 
sible, university training shuts out of the minds of those among them, 
who are subjected to it, the prospect that there is anything in the world 
for which they are specially fitted. Imagine the success of the at- 
tempt to still the intellectual hunger of any of the men I have men- 
tioned, by putting before him, as the object of existence, the successful 
mimicry of a Greek song, or the roll of Ciceronian prose! Imagine how 
much success would be likely to attend the attempt to persuade such 
men that the education which leads to perfection in such elegances is 
alone to be called culture} while the facts of history, the process of 
thought, the conditions of moral and social existence, and the laws of 
physical nature are left to be dealt with as they may be by outside 
barbarians. 
It is not thus that the German universities, from being beneath 
notice a century ago, have become what they now are — the most in- 
tensely cultivated and the most productive intellectual corporations 
the world has ever seen, 
The student who repairs to them sees in the list of classes and of 
professors a fair picture of the world of knowledge. Whatever he 
needs to know there is some one ready to teach him, some one compe- 
tent to discipline him in the way of learning; whatever his special bent, 
let him but be able and diligent, and in due time he shall find distinc- 
tion and a career. Among his professors, he sees men whose names are 
known and revered throughout the civilised world; and their living ex- 
ample infects him with a noble ambition, and a love for the spirit of 
work, 
The Germans dominate the intellectual world by virtue of the same 
simple secret as that which made Napoleon the master of old Europe. 
They have declared Ja carriére ouverte aux talents, and every Bursch 
marches with a professor’s gown in his knapsack. Let him become a 
great scholar, or man of science, and ministers will compete for his 
services. In Germany, they do not leave the chance of his holding the 
office he would render illustrious to the tender mercies of a hot canvass, 
and the final wisdom of a mob of country parsons. 
In short, in Germany, the universities are exactly what the Rector 
of Lincoln and the Commissioners tell us the English universities are 
not; that is to say, corporations “of learned men devoting their lives to 
the cultivation of science, and the direction of academical education.” 
They are not “boarding schools for youths,” nor clerical seminaries; 
but institutions for the higher culture of men, in which the theological 
faculty is of no more importance, or prominence, than the rest; and 
which are truly “universities,” since they strive to represent and em- 
body the totality of human knowledge, and to find room for all forms 
of intellectual activity.

360. Mid-Nineteenth Century Elementary Education in England 
(Husley, T. H., Science and Education, pp. 87-91. Collected Essays, vol. 11. 
London, 1893) 
Continuing still further on English education of the time 
(1868), Huxley draws the following picture as to the nature and 
value of the instruction then provided in the elementary schools 
of the people: 
. .. Consider our priraary schools and what is taught inthem. A 
child learns: 
1. To read, write, and cipher, more or less well; but in a very large 
proportion of cases not so well as to take pleasure in reading, or to be 
able to write the commonest letter properly. 
2. A quantity of dogmatic theology, of which the child, nine times 
out of ten, understands next to nothing. 
3. Mixed up with this, so as to seem to stand or fall with it, a few of 
the broadest and simplest principles of morality. This, to my mind, is 
much as if a man of science should make the story of the fall of theapple 
in Newton’s garden an integral part of the doctrine of gravitation, and 
teach it as of equal authority with the law of the inverse squares. 
4. A good deal of Jewish history and Syrian geography, and per- 
haps a little something about English history and the geography of the 
child’s own country. But I doubt if there is a primary school in Eng- 
land in which hangs a map of the hundred in which the village lies, so 
that the children may be practically taught by it what a map means. 
5. A certain amount of regularity, attentive obedience, respect for 
others: obtained by fear, if the master be incompetent or foolish; by 
love and reverence, if he be wise. 
So far as this school course embraces a training in the theory and 
practice of obedience to the moral laws of Nature, I gladly admit, not 
only that it contains a valuable educational element, but that, so far, 
it deals with the most valuable and important part of all education. 
Yet, contrast what is done in this direction with what might be done; 
with the time given to matters of comparatively no importance; with 
the absence of any attention to things of the highest moment; and one 
is tempted to think of Falstaff’s bill and “the halfpenny worth of bread 
to all that quantity of sack.” 
Let us consider what a child thus “educated” knows, and what it 
does not know. Begin with the most important topic of all — moral- 
ity, as the guide of conduct. The child knows well enough that some 
acts meet with approbation and some with disapprobation. But it has 
never heard that'there lies in the nature of things a reason for every 
moral law, as cogent and as well defined as that which underlies every 
physical law; that stealing and lying are just as certain to be followed 
 
-P-A-G-E-678
        652 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
  by evil consequences, as putting your hand in the fire, or jumping out 
of a garret window. Again, though the scholar may have been made 
acquainted, in dogmatic fashion, with the broad laws of morality, he 
has had no training in the application of those laws to the difficult 
problems which result from the complex conditions of modern civilisa- 
tion. 
Again, the child learns absolutely nothing of the history or the political 
organization of hisown country. His general impression is, that every- 
thing of much importance happened a very long while ago; and that 
the Queen and the gentlefolks govern the country much after the 
fashion of King David and the elders and nobles of Israel — his sole 
models. Will you give a man with this much information a vote? In 
easy times he sells it for a pot of beer. Why should he not? It is of 
about as much use to him as a chignon, and he knows as much what to 
do with it, for any other purpose. In bad times, on the contrary, he 
applies his simple theory of government, and believes that his rulers 
are the cause of his sufferings — a belief which sometimes bears re- 
markable practical fruits. 
Least of all, does the child gather from this primary “education” 
of ours a conception of the laws of the physical world, or of the rela- 
tions of cause and effect therein. And this is the more to be lamented, 
as the poor are especially exposed to physical evils, and are more inter- 
ested in removing them than any other class of the community. If 
any one is concerned in knowing the ordinary laws of mechanics one 
would think it is the hand-labourer, whose daily toil lies among levers 
and pulleys; or among the other implements of artisan work. And if 
any one is interested in the laws of health, it is the poor workman, 
whose strength is wasted by ill-prepared food, whose health is sapped 
by bad ventilation and bad drainage, and half whose children are 
massacred by disorders which might be prevented. Not only does our 
present primary education carefully abstain from hinting to the work- 
man that some of his greatest evils are traceable to mere physical 
agencies, which could be removed by energy, patience, and frugality; 
but it does worse — it renders him, so far as it can, deaf to those who 
would help him, and tries to substitute an Oriental submission to what 
is falsely declared to be the will of God, for his natural tendency to 
strive after a better condition. 
What wonder, then, if very recently an appeal has been made to 
statistics for the profoundly foolish purpose of showing that education 
is of no good — that it diminishes neither misery nor crime among the 
masses of mankind? I reply, why should the fe which has been 
called education do either the one or the other? .

361. Mid-Nineteenth Century Secondary Education in England 
(Huxley, T. H., Science and Education, pp. 92-101. Collected Essays, vol. m1. 
London, 1893) 
After describing English elementary education, as given in the 
preceding selection, Huxley proceeds, as follows, to point out the 
defects of English secondary education of his time. 
It may be said that all these animadversions may apply to primary 
schools, but that the higher schools, at any rate, must be allowed to 
give a liberal education. In fact they professedly sacrifice everything 
else to this object. 
Let us inquire into this matter. What do the higher schools, those 
to which the great middle class of the country sends its children, teach, 
over and above the instruction given in the primary schools? There 
is a little more reading and writing of English. But, for all that, every 
one knows that it is a rare thing to find a boy of the middle or upper 
classes who can read aloud decently, or who can put his thoughts on 
paper in clear and grammatical (to say nothing of good or elegant) 
language. The “ciphering”’ of the lower schools expands into elemen- 
tary mathematics in the higher; into arithmetic, with a little algebra, a 
little Euclid. But I doubt if one boy in five hundred has ever heard 
the explanation of a rule of arithmetic, or knows his Euclid otherwise 
than by rote. 
Of theology, the middle class schoolboy gets rather less than poorer 
children, less absolutely and less relatively, because there are so many 
other claims upon his attention. I venture to say that, in the great 
majority of cases, his ideas on this subject when he leaves school are of 
the most shadowy and vague description, and associated with painful 
impressions of the weary hours spent learning collects and catechism 
by heart. 
Modern geography, modern history, modern literature; the English 
language as a language; the whole circle of the sciences, physical, 
moral, and social, are even more completely ignored in the higher than 
in the lower schools. Up till within a few years back, a boy might 
have passed through any one of the great public schools with the 
greatest distinction and credit, and might never so much as heard of 
one of the subjects I have just mentioned. He might never have 
heard that the earth goes round the sun; that England underwent a 
great revolution in 1688, and France another in 1789; that there once 
lived certain notable men called Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Vol- 
taire, Goethe, Schiller. The first might be a German and the last an 
Englishman for anything he could tell you to the contrary. And as 
for Science, the only idea the word would suggest to his mind would be 
dexterity in boxing.

  654. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Now let us pause to consider this wonderful state of affairs; for the 
time will come when Englishmen will quote it as the stock example of 
the stolid stupidity of their ancestors in the nineteenth century. The 
most thoroughly commercial people, the greatest voluntary wanderers 
and colonists the world has ever seen, are precisely the middle classes 
of this country. If there be a people which has been busy making 
history on the great scale for the last three hundred years — and the 
most profoundly interesting history — history which, if it had hap- 
pened to be that of Greece or Rome, we should study with avidity — 
it is the English. If there be a people, which during the same period, 
has developed a remarkable literature, it is our own. If there be a 
nation whose prosperity depends absolutely and wholly upon their 
mastery over the forces of Nature, upon their intelligent apprehension 
of, and obedience tothe laws of the creation and distribution of wealth, 
and of the stable equilibrium of the forces of society, it is precisely this 
nation. And yet this is what these wonderful people tell their sons: 
“At the cost of one to two thousand pounds of our hard-earned 
money, we devote twelve of the most precious years of your lives to 
school. There you shall toil, or be supposed to toil; but there you 
shall not learn one single thing of all those you will most want to know 
directly you leave school and enter upon the practical business of life. 
You will in all probability go into business, but you shall not know 
where, or how, any article of commerce is produced, or the difference 
between an export and an import, or the meaning of the word ‘capital.’ 
You will very likely settle in a colony, but you shall not know whether 
Tasmania is a part of New South Wales, or vice versa. 
“Very probably you may become a manufacturer, but you shall not 
be provided with the means of understanding the working of one of 
your own steam-engines; and, when you are asked to buy a patent, you 
shall not have the slightest means of judging whether the inventor is an 
imposter who is contravening the elementary principles of science, or a 
man who will make you as rich as Creesus. 
“You will very likely get into the House of Commons. You will 
have to take your share in making laws which may prove a blessing or 
a curse to millions of men. But you shall not hear one word respect- 
ing the political organisation of your country; the meaning of the con- 
troversy between free-traders and protectionists shall never have been 
mentioned to you; you shall not so much as know that there are such 
things as economical laws. 
“The mental power which will be of most importance in your daily 
life will be the power of seeing things as they are without regard to 
authority; and of drawing accurate general conclusions from particu- 
lar facts. But at school and at college you shall know of no source of 
truth but authority; nor exercise your reasoning faculty upon anything 
but deduction from that which is laid down by authority. 
 
-P-A-G-E-681
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 655 
“You will have to weary your soul with work, and many a time eat 
your bread in sorrow and in bitterness, and you shall not have learned 
to take refuge in the great source of pleasure without alloy, the serene 
resting-place for worn human nature, — the world of art.” 
Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful people? Iam quite pre- 
pared to allow, that education entirely devoted to these omitted sub- 
jects might not be a completely liberal education, But is an education 
which ignores them all a liberal education? Nay, is it too much to say 
that the education which should embrace these subjects and no others 
would be a real education, though an incomplete one; while an educa- 
tion which omits them is really not an education at all, but a more or 
less useful course of intellectual gymnastics? 
For what does the middle-class school put in the place of all these 
things which are left out? It substitutes what is usually comprised 
under the compendious title of the “classics” — that is to say, the 
languages, the literature, and the history of the ancient Greeks and 
Romans, and the geography of so much of the world as was known to 
these two great nations of antiquity... . 
. .. What is to be said of classical teaching at its worst, or in other 
words, of the classics of our ordinary middle-class schools? It means 
getting up endless forms and rules by heart. It means turning Latin 
and Greek into English, for the mere sake of being able to do it, and 
without the smallest regard to the worth, or worthlessness, of the 
author read. It means the learning of innumerable, not always 
decent, fables in such a shape that the meaning they once had is dried 
up into utter trash; and the only impression left upon a boy’s mind is, 
that the people who believed such things must have been the greatest 
idiots the world ever saw. And it means, finally, that after a dozen 
years spent-at this kind of work, the sufferer shall be incompetent to 
interpret a passage in an author he has not already got up; that he 
shall loathe the sight of a Greek or Latin book; and that he shall never 
open, or think of, a classical writer again, until, wonderful to relate, he 
insists upon submitting his sons to the same process. 
These be your gods, O Israel! For the sake of this net result (and 
respectability) the British father denies his children all the knowledge 
they might turn to account in life, not merely for the achievement of 
vulgar success, but for guidance in the great crises of human existence. 
This is the stone he offers to those to whom he is bound by the strongest 
and tenderest ties to feed with bread.   
362. What Knowledge is of Most Worth? 
(Spencer, Herbert, Education, chap. 1. London, 186r) 
In the Westminster Review for July, 1859, Herbert Spencer 
(1820-1903) published an article under the above title which
-P-A-G-E-682
MK ee 
656 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
challenged in forceful terms the old ideas as to education. He 
had previously published three other articles on phases of the 
question of education — namely, on “Intellectual Education” 
(1854), ‘Moral Education” (1858), and “Physical Education” 
(1859), to all of which the July, 1859, article formed an introduc- 
tion. In 186r the four essays were published in book form under 
the general title of Education; Intellectual, Moral, and Physical. 
The book represented the best ideas of the sense-realists and 
educational reformers since the days of Francis Bacon, stated 
anew in clear and forceful English, and was of importance in start- 
ing anew a discussion of relative values. 
The following selections from the first 
chapter give a good idea of Spencer’s force- 
ful style, his fundamental educational 
theses, and the nature of the challenge 
he made to the educational practices of 
his time. 
It has been truly remarked that in order 
of time decoration precedes dress. Among 
people who submit to great physical suffer- 
ing that they may have themselves hand- 
somely tattooed, extremes of temperature 
  Fic. 89 are borne with but little attempt at mitiga- 
HERBERT SPENCER tion. Humboldt tells us that an Orinoco 
(1820-1903) Indian, though quite regardless of bodily 
comfort, will yet labor for a fortnight to 
purchase pigment wherewith to make himself admired; and that the 
same woman who would not hesitate to leave her hut without a frag- 
ment of clothing on, would not dare to commit such a breach of deco- 
rum as to go out unpainted. Voyagers uniformly find that colored 
beads and trinkets are much more prized by wild tribes than are 
calicoes or broadcloths. And the anecdotes we have of the ways in 
which, when shirts and coats are given, they turn them to some ludi- 
crous display, show how completely the idea of ornament predominates 
ever that of use. 
It is not a little curious that the like relations hold with the mind. 
Among mental as among bodily acquisitions, the ornamental comes 
before the useful. Not only in times past, but almost as much in our 
own era, that knowledge which conduces to personal well-being has 
been postponed to that which brings applause. In the Greek schools, 
music, poetry, rhetoric, and a philosophy which, until Socrates taught, 
 
-P-A-G-E-683
I _ EEE 
NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 657° 
had but little bearing upon action, were the dominant subjects; while 
knowledge aiding the arts of life had a very subordinate place. And 
in our own universities and schools at the present moment the like 
antithesis holds. 
We are guilty of something like a platitude when we say that 
throughout his after-career a boy, in nine cases out of ten, applies his 
Latin and Greek to no practical purposes. The remark is trite that in 
his shop, or his office, in managing his estate or his family, in playing 
his part as director of a bank or a railway, he is very little aided by 
this knowledge he took so many years to acquire — so little, — that 
generally the greater part of it drops out of his memory; and if he oc- 
casionally vents a Latin quotation, or alludes to some Greek myth, it is 
less to throw light on the topic in hand than for the sake of effect. If 
we inquire what is the real motive for giving boys a classical education, 
we find it to be simply conformity to public opinion. Men dress their 
children’s minds as they do their bodies, in the prevailing fashion. As 
the Orinoco Indian puts on his paint before leaving his hut, not with a 
view to any direct benefit, but because he would be ashamed to be 
seen without it, so a boy’s drilling in Latin and Greek is insisted on, 
not because of their intrinsic value, but that he may not be disgraced 
by being found ignorant of them — that he may have “the education 
of a gentleman” — the badge marking a certain social position, and 
bringing a consequent respect. 
This parallel is still more clearly displayed in the case of the other 
sex. In the treatment of both mind and body the decorative element 
has continued to predominate in a greater degree among women than 
among men.... 
In their education, the immense preponderance of ‘“accomplish- 
ments” proyes how here, too, use is subordinated to display. Danc- 
ing, deportment, the piano, singing, drawing — what a large space do 
these occupy! If you ask why Italian and German are learnt, you will 
find that, under all the sham reasons given, the real reason is, that a 
knowledge of those tongues is thought ladylike. It is not that the 
books written in them may be utilized, which they scarcely ever are, 
but that Italian and German songs may be sung, and that the extent of 
attainment may bring whispered admiration. The births, deaths, and 
marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to 
memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result 
from knowing them, but because society considers them parts of a good 
education — because the absence of such knowledge may bring the 
contempt of others. When we have named reading, writing, spelling, 
grammar, arithmetic, and sewing, we have named about all the things a 
girl is taught with a view to their actual uses in life; and even some of 
these have more reference to the good opinion of others than to im- 
mediate personal welfare.

The question which we contend is of such transcendent moment is, 
not whether such and such knowledge is of worth, but what is its rela- 
tive worth. When they have named certain advantages which a given 
course of study has secured them, persons are apt to assume that they 
have justified themselves; quite forgetting that the adequateness of 
the advantages is the point to be judged. 
In education, then, this is the question of questions, which it is high 
time we discussed in some methodic way. The first in importance, 
though the last to be considered, is the problem — how to decide 
among the conflicting claims of various subjects on our attention. 
Before there can be a rational curriculum, we must settle which things 
it most concerns us to know; or, to use a word of Bacon’s, now un- 
fortunately obsolete — we must determine the relative values of 
knowledges. To this end, a measure of value is the first requisite. 
And happily, respecting the true measure of value, as expressed in 
general terms, there can be no dispute. 
How to live? — that is the essential question for us. Not how to 
live in the mere material sense only, but in the widest sense. The gen- 
eral problem which comprehends every special problem is — the right 
ruling of conduct in all directions under all circumstances. In what 
way to treat the body; in what way to treat the mind; in what way to 
manage our affairs; in what way to bring up a family; in what way to 
behave as a citizen; in what way to utilize all those sources of happiness 
which nature supplies — how to use all our faculties to the greatest 
advantage of ourselves and others — how to live completely? And 
this being the great thing needful for us to learn is, by consequence, 
the great thing which education has to teach. To prepare us for com- 
plete living is the function which education has to discharge; and the 
only rational mode of judging of an educational course is to judge in 
what degree it discharges such function. 
Doubtless the task is difficult — perhaps never to be more than ap- 
proximately achieved. But, considering the vastness of the interests 
at stake, its difficulty is no reason for pusillanimously passing it by, 
but rather for devoting every energy to its mastery. And if we only 
proceed systematically we may very soon get at results of no small 
moment. 
Our first step must obviously be to classify, in the order of their im- 
portance, the leading kinds of activity which constitute human life. 
They may be naturally arranged into: 
1. Those activities which directly minister to self-preservation. 
2. Those activities which, by securing the necessaries of life, in- 
directly minister to self-preservation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-685
CC _<_£_£_£_—L ee 
NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION — 659 
3. Those activities which have for their end the rearing and disci- 
pline of offspring. 
4. Those activities which are involved in the maintenance of proper 
social and political relations. 
5. Those miscellaneous activities which fill up the leisure part of 
life, devoted to the gratification of the tastes and feelings. 
That these stand in something like their true order of subordination 
it needs no long consideration to show. 
Of course the ideal of education is — complete preparation in all 
these divisions. But failing this ideal, as in our phase of civilization 
every one must do more or less, the aim should be to maintain a due 
proportion between the degrees of preparation in each. Not exhaustive 
cultivation in any one, supremely important though it may be; not 
even an exclusive attention to the two, three, or four divisions of 
greatest importance; but an attention to all; greatest where the value 
is greatest, less where the value is less, least where the value is least. 
For the average man (not to forget the cases in which peculiar aptitude 
for some one department of knowledge rightly makes pursuit of that 
one the bread-winning occupation) — for the average man, we say, the 
desideratum is, a training that approaches nearest to perfection in the 
things which most subserve complete living, and falls more and more 
below perfection in the things that have more and more remote bear- 
ings on complete living. 
363. Spencer’s Conclusions as to the Importance of Science 
(Spencer, Herbert, Education, chap. 1. London, 1861) 
After classifying knowledge in the order of relative importance, 
as given in the preceding selection, Spencer enters into quite a 
discussion as to the question he has raised, and under the follow- 
ing headings: 
A. Knowledge for Guidance. 
I. Self-Preservation. 
II. Self-Maintenance. 
III. Parental Duties. 
IV. Good Citizenship. 
V. The Refinements of Life. 
B. Knowledge for Discipline. 
Under each he points out what knowledge is of most worth, and 
then summarizes his conclusions, as follows: 
We conclude, then, that for discipline, as well as for guidance, science 
is of chiefest value. In all its effects, learning the meanings of things 
   
-P-A-G-E-686
<<  hee 
660 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
is better than learning the meanings of words. Whether for intellec- 
tual, moral, or religious training, the study of surrounding phenomena 
is immensely superior to the study of grammars and lexicons. 
Thus to the question with which we set out — What knowledge is 
of most worth? — the uniform reply is — Science. This is the verdict 
on all the counts. For direct self-preservation, or the maintenance of 
life and health, the all-important knowledge is — Science. For that 
indirect self-preservation which we call gaining a livelihood, the 
knowledge of greatest value is — Science. For the due discharge of 
parental functions, the proper guidance is to be found only in — Sci- 
ence. For that interpretation of national life, past and present, with- 
out which the citizen cannot rightly regulate his conduct, the indis- 
pensable key is— Science. Alike for the most perfect production 
and highest enjoyment of art in all its forms, the needful preparation 
is still — Science. And for purposes of discipline — intellectual, 
moral, religious — the most efficient study is, once more — Science. 
The question which at first seemed so perplexed, has become, in the 
course of our inquiry, comparatively simple. We have not to estimate 
the degrees of importance of different orders of human activity, and 
different studies-as severally fitting us for them, since we find that the 
study of Science, in its most comprehensive meaning, is the best prepa- 
ration for all these orders of activity. We have not to decide between 
the claims of knowledge of great though conventional value, and 
knowledge of less though intrinsic value; seeing that the knowledge 
which we find to be of most value in all other respects, is intrinsically 
most valuable; its worth is not dependent upon opinion, but is as 
fixed as is the relation of man to the surrounding world. Necessary 
and eternal as are its truths, all Science.concerns all mankind for all 
time. Equally at present, and in the remotest future, must it be of incal- 
culable importance for the regulation of their conduct that men should 
understand the science of life, physical, mental, and social, and that 
they should understand all other science as a key to the science of life. 
And yet the knowledge which is of such transcendent value is that 
which, in our age of boasted education, receives the least attention. 
While this which we call civilization could never have arisen had it not 
been for science, science forms scarcely an appreciable element in what 
men consider civilized training. Though to the progress of science 
we owe it that millions find support where once there was food only for 
thousands, yet of these millions but a few thousands pay any respect to 
that which has made their existence possible. Though this increasing 
knowledge of the properties and relations of things has not only en- 
abled wandering tribes to grow into populous nations, but has given 
to the countless members of those populous nations comforts and 
pleasures which their naked ancestors never even conceived, or could 
have believed, yet is this kind of knowledge only now receiving a 
 
-P-A-G-E-687
BLS 
NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 661 
grudging recognition in our highest educational institutions. To the 
slowly growing acquaintance with the uniform co-existences and se- 
quences of phenomena — to the establishment of invariable laws, we 
owe our emancipation from the grossest superstitions. But for science 
we should be still worshipping fetishes; or, with hecatombs of victims, 
propitiating diabolical deities. And yet this science, which, in place of 
the most degrading conceptions of things, has given us some insight to 
the grandeurs of creation, is written against in our theologies and 
frowned upon from our pulpits. 
Paraphrasing an Eastern fable, we may say that in the family of 
knowledges, Science is the household drudge, who, in obscurity, hides 
unrecognized perfections. To her has been committed all the work; 
by her skill, intelligence, and devotion, have all the conveniences and 
gratifications been obtained; and while ceaselessly occupied in minister- 
ing to the rest, she has been kept in the background, that her haughty 
sisters might flaunt their fripperies in the eyes of the world. The par- 
allel holds yet further. For we are fast coming to the dénouement, 
when the positions will be changed; and while these haughty sisters 
sink into merited neglect, Science, proclaimed as highest alike in 
worth and beauty, will reign supreme. 
364. The Old and the New Psychology contrasted 
(Dewey, John, “The Psychology of the Elementary Curriculum”; in 
The Elementary School Record, pp. 222-25. Chicago, 1900) 
The foremost American interpreter of the social and industrial 
changes of a century in terms of education has been Professor 
John Dewey. His work, both experimental and theoretical, has 
stated a new social psychology for the educational process. 
While at the University of Chicago he conducted an experimental 
elementary school, the important results of which were published 
in 1900, in nine monographs, under the title of The Elementary 
School Record. In the last of the series he contrasted the old and 
the new psychology, as it applies to the education of the child, in 
the following words: * 
What, then, are the chief working hypotheses that have been adopted 
from psychology? What educational counterparts have been hit upon 
as in some degree in line with the adopted psychology? 
The discussion of these questions may be approached by pointing 
out a contrast between contemporary psychology and the psychology 
of former days. The contrast is a triple one. Earlier psychology 
regarded mind as a purely individual affair in direct and naked contact 
with an external world. The only question asked was of the ways 
in which the world and the mind acted upon each other, The en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-688
ncn 
662. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
tire process recognized would have been in theory exactly the same if 
there were one mind living alone in the universe. At present the 
tendency is to conceive individual mind as a function of social life, — 
as not capable of operating or developing by itself, but as requiring 
continual stimulus from social agencies, and finding its nutrition in 
social supplies. The idea of heredity has made familiar the notion 
that the equipment of the individual, mental as well as physical, is an 
inheritance from the race: a capital inherited by the individual from 
the past and held in trust by him for the future. The idea of evolution 
has made familiar the notion that mind cannot be regarded as an in- 
dividual monopolistic possession, but represents the outworkings of the 
endeavor and thought of humanity; that it is developed in an environ- 
ment which is social as well as physical, and that social needs and aims 
have been most potent in shaping it, — that the chief difference be- 
tween savagery and civilization is not in the naked nature which each 
faces, but the social heredity and social medium. 
In the second place, the older psychology was a psychology of knowl- 
edge, of intellect. Emotion and endeavor occupied but an incidental 
and derivative place. Much was said about sensations, — next to 
nothing about movements. There was discussion of ideas and of 
whether they originated in sensations or in some innate mental fac- 
ulty; but the possibility of their origin in and from the needs of action 
was ignored. Their influence upon conduct, upon behavior, was re- 
garded as an external attachment. 
The third point of contrast lies in the modern conception of the 
mind as essentially a process — a process of growth, not a fixed thing. 
According to the older view mind was mind, and that was the whole 
story. Mind was the same throughout, because fitted out with the 
same assortment of faculties, whether in child or adult. If any differ- 
ence was made it was simply that some of these ready-made faculties 
— such as memory — came into play at an earlier time, while others, 
such as judging and inferring, made their appearance only after the 
child, through memorizing drills, had been reduced to complete in- 
dependence upon the thought of others. The only important differ- 
ence that was recognized was one of quantity, of amount. The boy 
was a little man and his mind was a little mind, — in everything but 
size the same as that of the adult, having its own ready-furnished 
equipment of faculties of attention, memory, etc. Now we believe in 
the mind as a growing affair, and hence as essentially changing, pre- 
senting distinctive phases of capacity and interest at different periods. 
These are all one and the same in the sense of continuity of life, but all 
different in that each has its own distinctive claims and offices. “First 
the blade, then the ear, and then the full corn in the ear.”

365. Difficulties in Transforming the School 
Ping Wen Kuo, The Chinese System of Public Instruction, pp. 161-62. 
New York, 1915) 
The transformation of a nation’s schools from institutions for 
formal training in book knowledge to institutions which give real 
life experience and prepare for intelligent living in modern society 
has everywhere been difficult. The following description of the 
difficulties experienced recently in China gives a picture of con- 
ditions not particularly different from those in other lands. 
(a) Relating Education to Life 
There is at least one more educational problem of importance de- 
serving special mention, namely, the problem of effectively relating 
education to the life of those who receive it. In the western countries 
the conflict so long waged between formal book training and the 
newer, more practical forms of education centering in the social and 
industrial needs of children, may be said to have been settled theoreti- 
cally, at least, in favor of the latter, but in China the conflict has only 
just begun. For not until recent years has there been felt the need of 
bringing about a closer adjustment of school work to the changing 
social and industrial demands of the time, and of making the curricu- 
lum a means of preparing the pupils to solve the problems of their 
daily life. True enough, most of the modern school subjects, such as 
geography, civics, and the like, have been introduced into the regular 
course of study, but these subjects are often taught without much 
reference to the daily life of the pupil or that of the community. 
As a result, a serious doubt has arisen in the minds of many of the 
Chinese as to the efficacy of modern education in solving the perplexing 
problems of the country. There is a feeling on the part of some that 
both the subjects taught in school and the method used in teaching 
those subjects do little good to the children. Indeed,.a loud cry has 
already been raised against this form of education as failing to do'what 
is expected of it. The charge is made that from the moment a child 
enters school, he begins to alienate himself from the life of the family 
and that of the community, and that by the time he graduates he is 
fit neither to be a farmer nor tobea merchant. ‘This serious charge 
against new education, although it is not true of all schools, is yet not 
made without grounds. The root of the trouble lies, as already sug- 
gested, in the fact that much of the school work consists of merely 
imparting knowledge without reference either to the purposes which 
brought the children to school, or to the needs of the community in 
which they live. To remedy the evil something fundamental needs to 
be done, both in the selection of material for the curriculum and in the 
method of teaching the various subjects of study. Fortunate it is for

é " a 
the new republic that these two problems are beginning to receive the 
serious attention of her more progressive leaders in education. 
(6) The Old Teacher and the New System 
The facts that China went into this work of educating a quarter of the 
population of the globe without a sufficient body of teachers and that 
the growth of the new educational system has been probably more 
rapid than was anticipated, would not have made the problem of sup- 
plying teachers so serious had China been able to recruit teachers from 
the old schools. This she has not been able to do, although many of 
the old teaching staff did find their way into modern schools. Chinese 
scholars there were, and many of them too, but they lacked the knowl- 
edge and the skill demanded of the teachers of modern schools. Under 
the old educational system any one could set up as a school teacher, 
and a great many scholars who had attained the first degree in the 
examination, to say nothing of the host of others who had failed, made 
* this their chief means of obtaining a living. No certificate was re- 
quired for teaching, and no book or curriculum was compulsory, ex- 
cept that which was universally established by tradition or usage. 
The instruction was usually imparted either in the home of the children 
or in that of the teacher. Such private schools seldom comprised more, 
than twenty children. The kind of teaching tended to develop mem- 
ory rather than reasoning power. 
Under the new system of education, the situation which ‘ie teacher 
has to face is entirely different. He must know more than mere Chi- 
nese classics and composition. He has to teach students in classes in- 
stead of individually. Again, the teacher in a modern school is ex- 
pected to develop in the pupils the power of reasoning, instead of only 
mere memory. And the old-time teacher does not easily lend himself 
to the new order. He is by training conservative, inclined to cling to 
the methods to which he is accustomed. He is himself so wedded to the 
old that he confesses to a sort of intellectual awkwardness when he 
tries to use the new learning and new methods. In his fear of mak- 
ing mistakes, he confines himself closely to textbooks. Consciously or 
unconsciously he still over-emphasizes the value of memory. He him- . 
self is not trained to think, and of course is not inclined to adopt methods 
which quicken thought in his student. Modern pedagogy is to him so 
new a science that either he has little appreciation of its worth, or, if he 
is able to appreciate, he is not able to use it with facility and efficiency. 
366. Socialization of School Work illustrated by History 
(Dewey, John, “‘The Aim of History in Elementary Education”; in 
The Elementary School Record, pp. 199-200. Chicago, 1900) 
To illustrate how ‘Professor Dewey attempted to socialize the 
elementary school subjects, the following extract from his in- 
troduction to the monograph on History Teaching is given, 
 
-P-A-G-E-691
  NEW CONCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION 665 
If history be regarded as just the record of the past, it is hard to see 
any grounds for claiming that it should play any large réle in the cur- 
riculum of elementary education. The past is the past, and the dead 
may be safely left to bury its dead. There are too many urgent de- 
mands in the present, too many calls over the threshold of the future, 
to permit the child to become 
deeply immersed in what is 
forever gone by. Not so 
when history is considered 
an account of the forces and 
forms of social life. Social 
life we have always with us; 
the distinction of past and 
present is indifferent to it. 
Whether it was lived just 
here or just there is a matter 
of slight moment. It is life 
for all that; it. shows the Fic. 90. CONSTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY IN THE motives which draw men to- Srupy or History 
gether and push them apart, Dewey’s Experimental School, Chicago 
‘and depicts what is desirable 
~ and what is hurtful. Whatever history may be for the scientific his- 
torian, for the educator it must be an indirect sociology — a study of 
society which lays bare its process of becoming and its modes of organ- 
ization. Existing society is both too complex and too close to the 
child to be studied. He finds no clues into its labyrinth of detail, and 
can mount no eminence whence to get a perspective of arrangement. 
If the aim of historical instruction is to enable the child to appreciate 
the values of social life, to see in imagination the forces which favor and 
let men’s effective codéperation with one another, to understand the 
sorts of character that help on and that hold back, the essential thing 
in its presentation is to make it moving, dynamic. History must be 
presented not as an accumulation of results or effects, a mere statement 
of what happened, but as a forceful, acting thing. The motives, that 
* is, the motors, must stand out. To study history is not to amass in- 
formation, but to use information in constructing a vivid picture of 
how and why men did thus and so; achieved their successes and came 
to their failures. 
When history is conceived as dynamic, as moving, its economic and 
industrial aspects are emphasized. These are but technical terms 
which express the problem with which humanity is unceasingly en- 
gaged; how to live, how to master and use nature so as to make it 
tributary to the enrichment of human life. The great advances in 
civilization have come through those manifestations of intelligence 
which have lifted man from his precarious subjection to nature, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-692
  666 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
revealed to him how he may make its forces codperate with his own 
purposes. The social world in which the child now lives is so rich and 
full that it is not easy to see how much it cost, how much effort and 
thought lie back of it. Man has a tremendous equipment ready at 
hand. The child may be led to translate these ready-made resources 
into fluid terms; he may be led to see man face to face with nature, 
without inherited capital, without tools, without manufactured ma- 
terials. And, step by step, he may follow the processes by which man 
recognized the needs of his situation, thought out the weapons and 
instruments that enabled him to cope with them; and may learn how . 
these new resources opened new horizons of growth and created new 
problems. The industrial history of man is not a materialistic or a 
merely utilitarian affair. It is a matter of intelligence. Its record is 
the record of how man learned to think, to think to some effect, to 
transform the conditions of life so that life itself becomes a different 
thing. It is an ethical record as well; the account of the conditions 
which men have patiently wrought out to serve their ends. 
The question of how human beings live, indeed, represents the domi- 
nant interest with which the child approaches historic material. It is 
this point of view which brings those who worked in the past close to 
the beings with whom he is daily associated, and confers upon him the 
gift of sympathetic penetration. 
The child who is interested in the way in which men lived, the tools 
they had to do with, the new inventions they made, the transforma- 
tions of life that arose from the power,and leisure thus gained, is eager 
to repeat like processes in his own action, to remake utensils, to re- 
produce processes, to rehandle materials. Since he understands their 
problems and their successes only by seeing what obstacles and what 
resources they had from nature, the child is interested in field and 
forest, ocean and mountain, plant and animal. By building up a con- 
ception of the natural environment in which lived the people he is 
studying, he gets his hold upon their lives. This reproduction he can- 
not make excepting as he gains acquaintance with the natural forces 
and forms with which he is himself surrounded. The interest in his- 
tory gives a more human coloring, a wider significance, to his own study 
of nature. His knowledge of nature lends point and accuracy to his 
study of history. This is the natural “correlation” of history and 
science.

  CHAPTER XXIX 
NEW TENDENCIES AND EXPANSIONS 
THE Readings of this chapter have been selected with a view to 
illustrating a few of the more important new tendencies in educa- 
tional organization — political, scientific, vocational, and socio- 
logical — which have characterized educational progress in recent 
decades. 
The first (367), dealing with the environmental influence of the 
State, sets forth the new state needs and the different attitudes 
toward education which the State may legitimately assume. The 
second (368) is introduced to show how governments, interested 
in the promotion of national welfare, may turn the school into 
new directions the better to serve national ends. The third (369) 
states well the position of the university as the head and crown 
of the state’s educational system, and the relation of university 
thinking and teaching to national welfare and progress. 
The next three selections relate to applied science and voca- 
tional training in the schools. The first of the group (370) de- 
scribes the work of the Folk High Schools in Denmark, a little 
nation that had been made over by agricultural education since 
its spoliation at the hands of Prussia, in 1864. The second (371) 
describes the extended work done by the Germans in developing 
vocational training, before the World War. The third (372) 
states well the intimate relation existing, under modern industrial 
conditions, between the vocational education of a people and 
national prosperity. 
The three selections which close the chapter have been chosen 
to illustrate some of the new attitudes toward child care and child 
welfare which have characterized the late nineteenth century. 
From the first (373), one may obtain a good idea of the change in 
attitude toward child labor and child welfare. The second (374) 
states simply and clearly the new problem of child labor. The 
third (375) describes briefly the reasons for the school undertak- 
ing a better supervision of child health than parents are usually 
able to provide.

367. The Environmental Influence of the State 
(McKechnie, W. S., The State and the Individual, pp. 363-64. Glasgow, 1896) 
The duty of the State in the matter of training the young for 
citizenship in the State, and the positions toward such training 
which it may legitimately assume, are well stated in the following 
selection. 
The child comes into the world a bundle of undeveloped potentiali- 
ties, void of experience and thought. The environment and external 
circumstances necessary for the growth of his mind and body are all 
supplied by the State. This is true, although not all nor even the 
’ chief part of them are imparted to the child directly by the officials of 
the government or by the laws or other organs of the State. The im- 
mediate environment depends on the influence of the family and of 
other institutions and agencies included in and controlled by the State. 
The child may have “innate ideas” in the sense of that a priori element 
which is one of the prerequisites of all conscious existence; but the 
equally necessary a posteriori element can be got only from experience; 
and the sphere of the State, or of various parts of the State, is the 
only school where experience is possible for him. He is born into the 
commonwealth, and from the day of his birth the rights of citizenship, 
which he cannot actually enjoy till he has acquired full age, are held in 
trust for him by the State. It is true that it is the family whose in- 
fluences at first surround him, molding his earliest tendencies and as- 
pirations after its traditions, but the family itself would be empty of 
content except for what flows into it from society and the State. The 
community as a whole, then, is the environment of the individual. It 
is the State which fills him with its own ideas and molds him after its 
own pattern. The English youth grows up with habits and ideas quite 
absent in the Zulu or even in the Frenchman. Allowing all claims for 
heredity — though this too has been indirectly supplied by the State 
through ancestors who were themselves its members — his environ- 
ment has made him what he is. 
The State then — using the word in its widest sense — puts its 
stamp on the young individuality before he has reached manhood and 
acquired the ability to choose his own surroundings. Willingly or 
unwillingly, it educates the individual and so has a terrible responsi- 
bility thrust upon its shoulders. The young mind as well as the young 
body is thrown upon its care during the important and impressionable 
years fated to mold the development of an immortal soul for time and 
for eternity. This trust, burdensome and disquieting as it is, is yet one 
which the State dare not decline. 
Its duty to the young cannot be brushed aside or lightly treated. 
But it has also a duty to itself. In each helpless child lies a future

citizen who will form an organic portion of the commonwealth, and 
may exercise a deep and lasting influence on its destinies. All children 
cannot become great statesmen, but all great statesmen once were 
children. 
On these two grounds the State has both a right and a duty to include 
the education of the young within its proper province. Indeed it must 
educate whether it will or no. The only question is whether it will do so 
consciously or unconsciously, systematically or at random, well or ill. 
Government need not undertake the work of education, but the su- 
preme legislative sovereign is forced to assume some attitude towards 
that all-important question. 
There are three positions, any one of which Parliament may adopt. 
(I) It may repudiate all direct responsibility, leaving each child to 
scramble for itself. (II) It may compel parents to educate their off- 
spring at their own expense. (III) It may enforce education upon all, 
and pay for it out of the national purse. Each of these three courses

(Address of Emperor William II, at Berlin Conference of 1890. Translated in 
Report United States Commissioner of Education, 1889-90, vol. 1, pp. 359-63) 
In 1890, after some previous discussion, a call was issued for a 
conference on problems relating to the German secondary schools. 
At this conference the then young German Emperor, William IT, 
gave the main opening address, demanding that the instruction 
be changed to serve better the national ends. His speech created 
widespread discussion among German secondary schoolmasters, 
and is important as revealing new national conceptions as to the 
place and purpose of the secondary school. He said, in part: 
GENTLEMEN: I desire to address a few words to you at the outset 
because it seemed to me important that you should know from the 
first what I think about this matter. Naturally there will be many 
things discussed that cannot be decided, and I believe that many points 
will remain cloudy and obscure. I have considered it proper not to 
leave the gentlemen in doubt as to my own views. 
In the first place I wish to observe that we have to do here above all 
not with a political school question, but entirely with technical and 
pedagogical measures which we must adopt in order to fit the grow- 
ing generation for the demands of the present, for the position of our 
Fatherland and of our life in the world at large... . 
This cabinet order, which the honorable minister has had the good- 
ess to mention before, would perhaps not have been necessary if the 
chools had stood in the position where they ought to have stood. I 
ieee

should like to observe in the outset that if I should be somewhat sharp 
I have reference to no one personally, but to the system, to the entire 
situation. If the schools had done that which we demand of them, and 
I can speak to you as one who is initiated, for I have also attended the 
gymnasium and know what goes on there, then they would of necessity 
have taken upon themselves from the very outset the fight against 
sociai democracy. The teaching faculties would have taken firm hold 
of the matter unitedly, and would have so instructed the growing gen- 
eration that those young people who are of about the same age as my- 
self, that is to say, about thirty years of age, would voluntarily offer the 
material with which I could work in the State in order the more rapidly 
» to become master of the movement. This has, however, not been the 
case. The last period in which our school was still a standard for our 
whole national life and of our development was in the years 1864, 1866 
to 1870. Then the Prussian schools and the Prussian teaching facul- 
ties were the bearers of the idea of unity that was preached everywhere. 
Every graduate who came out of the school and began his voluntary 
military service or entered upon active life, all were united upon this 
one point: The German Empire shall be again established, and Alsace 
and Lorraine won back again. That ceased with the year 1870. The 
Empire is united; we have that which we wished to gain, and there the 
matter rested. 
Starting from the new basis, the school ought now to animate the 
youth and make clear to them that the new political condition exists, 
that it may be preserved. Nothing of this kind has been observed, and in 
the short time that the Empire has existed centrifugal tendencies have 
already developed themselves. I can surely judge that accurately, 
because I stand at the top and all such questions come to me. The 
reason is to be sought in the education of the young. Where is the lack 
there? The lack is surely in many places. The chief reason is that 
since the year 1870 the philologists as beati possidentes have sat in the 
gymnasia and have laid their chief emphasis on the subject that was 
taught, upon learning and knowing, but not upon the formation of 
character and the needs of the life of to-day. You, Mr. Privy Coun- 
cilor Hinzpeter, will pardon me — you are an enthusiastic philologist; 
but none the less in my opinion the matter has reached a height where 
finally it can go no farther. Less emphasis has been placed upon the 
can than upon the ken; that is shown in the requirements that are made 
in examinations. One proceeds from the axiom that above all things 
the scholar must know as much as possible; whether that is suitable 
for life or not is a secondary consideration. If one should converse 
with one of the gentlemen concerned and seek to explain to him that 
the young man must, after all, to a certain extent, receive a practical 
preparation for life and its problems, the answer is ever, that is not 
the task of the schools; the chief object is the gymnastics of the intel-  
-P-A-G-E-697
  NEW TENDENCIES AND EXPANSIONS 671 
lect, and if these gymnastics were properly pursued the young man 
would be in a condition to accomplish with these gymnastics all that 
was necessary for life. I believe that we can be no longer deluded from 
this standpoint. 
If I now return to the schools themselves, and especially to the 
gymnasium, I know very well that in many circles I am considered a 
fanatical opponent of the gymnasium, and that I have been represented 
in favor of other kinds of schools. Gentlemen, that is not the case. 
Whoever has been in the gymnasium himself and has caught a glimpse 
behind the scenes knows what is lacking there. Above all, the national 
basis is lacking. We must take the German as the foundation for the 
gymnasium; we ought to educate national young Germans and not 
young Greeks and Romans. We must depart entirely from the basis 
that has existed for centuries, — from the old monastic education of 
the Middle Ages, where the standard was Latin with a little Greek 
added. That is no longer the standard; we must make German the 
basis. The German exercise must be the central point about which 
all turns... . é 
In like manner I should like to see the national sentiment further 
advanced with us in questions of history, geography, and traditions. 
Pray let us begin at home. After, when we are perfectly acquainted 
with our own rooms and chambers, then can we go to the museum and 
look about there also. But first of all we must be perfectly at home in 
the history of the Fatherland. The great elector was only a misty 
specter in my school days; the Seven Years’ War already lay outside of 
all consideration, and history closed with the end of the preceding cen- 
tury, with the French Revolution. The wars for freedom, which are 
the most important for the young citizen, were not gone through, and 
only through supplementary and very interesting lectures of Mr. 
Privy Councilor Hinzpeter was I in a position, thank Heaven, to learn 
these things. But that is precisely the punctwm saliens. Why are our 
young people misled? Why do so many confused muddled reformers of 
the world appear? Why is our government continually growled about 
and foreign lands referred to? Because the young people do not know 
how our conditions have developed themselves, and that the roots lie 
in the time of the French Revolution; and therefore I am firmly con- 
vinced that if we explain to the young people in its chief traits this 
transition from the French Revolution to the nineteenth century, they 
will get quite a different understanding for the questions of to-day from 
that which they have hitherto had. They are then in a position to im- 
prove and increase their knowledge through the supplementary lec- 
tures which they will hear in the university... . 
These, gentlemen, are in general the matters I wished to bring before 
you, things that have touched my heart, and I can only give you this 
assurance. The innumerable petitions, requests, and wishes that I 
 
-P-A-G-E-698
  672 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
have received from parents, although we fathers were declared in the 
preceding year by my honored Mr. Hinzpeter to be a party that had 
nothing to say concerning the education of children, place me, as the 
common father of the country, under the obligation ot declaring it can 
go no further so. Gentlemen, men are not to look at the world through 
spectacles, but with their own eyes, and are to find pleasure in that 
which they have before them, their native land and its institutions. 
To this end you are now to help. 
369. The University and the State 
(Van Hise, Chas. R., Commencement Address, University of Wisconsin, 19r0) 
The following extracts from an able commencement address 
state well the position of a modern state university as the crown- 
ing feature of the educational system of a State. 
The strength of the state university lies in its close relations to the 
State. The State demands of it service; the university feels a peculiar 
obligation to the State in which it is situated. It is the duty of the state 
university to instruct young men and women; it is its duty to advance 
knowledge, and especially those lines of knowledge which concern the 
development of the State. It is the duty of the staff of the state uni- 
versity to be at the service of the State along all lines in which their 
expert knowledge will be helpful; it is their duty to assist in carrying 
knowledge to the people. 
These relations between the university and the State bind them 
closely together. The growth of the university is dependent upon the 
State. The State owns the university; and every citizen feels himself 
to be a stockholder in that ownership. 
It has been said that the university should be the soul of the State; 
this is not my phrase, but I shall be proud of the University of Wiscon- 
sin, just in proportion as it becomes the soul of the State. Every man 
of high ideals is a part of that soul. Every institution which works for 
the upbuilding of humanity, be it church or prison, is a part of the soul 
of the State. Every school and college is a part of that soul, and it 
should be the aim of each to be as large a part as possible. The 
university, the culmination of the educational system of the State, 
would be a miserable institution indeed if it could not justly claim to be 
a large segment of the soul of the State. 
The unrest which has characterized the first decade of this twentieth 
century has led to many new proposals in all fields. The conservatives 
have sometimes been disturbed because questions have arisen which 
in the past have been regarded as settled. 
With reference to such questions it has sometimes been said that the 
university should keep off; that it should take no part in their consider- 
ation; that it should let the battle be fought out by others without any    
-P-A-G-E-699
  NEW TENDENCIES AND EXPANSIONS 673 
attempt at leadership. This position the university authorities and its 
friends must firmly resist. At times of unrest when new and important 
issues are arising, when old convictions are being questioned, is a time 
when the men of learning who know history, who should know the facts 
broadly and who have no purpose but the greatest good of the greatest 
number, should be absolutely free. If at such times those who 
should be leaders do not throw their intellect and influence in the right 
direction, there is danger that demagoguery and passion may lead in 
wrong directions with resulting disaster. It is because of the present 
general unrest that I again formulate the principles in reference to a free 
university, well established for a hundred years, lest by any deviation 
from that at this critical time the University of Wisconsin shall fail to 
do its full duty to the State and to the Nation. 
The progress of the Nation and the State will continue. The old 
ideas and ideals will be modified. The human race is ever moving up- 
ward and onward; but such movement always involves vexation, strife, 
dissension, often pain on the part of those who are disturbed in their 
convictions. No advance has ever been made without suffering; such 
is the cost of progress. This is alike true of the labor-saving machine 
and of the forward intellectual or spiritual step. In order that the 
suffering and pain of advance shall be reduced to a minimum; in order 
that the benefactions of the advance shall be a maximum; and far out- 
weigh the cost, it is incumbent that the universities play their part in 
leadership. Times of unrest, of changing ideas and ideals, are above all 
the times when the university should be most effective in the guidance 
of public opinion. 
Times of unrest and change are not the times for the university to 
trim; they are the times to set every sail from the main course to the 
sky sails so that all may draw. If ata time of stress the university furls 
its sails the people will lose confidence in the institution that remains 
supinely in the harbor when the State is confronted with vital questions 
in reference to which assistance should be given. The State has a right 
to demand of the university expert service in valuing a public utility; it 
has equally the right to demand expert service in politics and so- 
ciology. 
370. What the Folk High Schools have done for Denmark 
(Friend, L. L., The Folk High Schools of Denmark, pp. 15-17. Washington, 1914) 
The following description of the work of the folk and agricul- 
tural high schools of Denmark gives an interesting sidelight on 
the work of these essentially democratic institutions, and of the 
services they have rendered in the regeneration of Denmark. 
Intellectually the Danes are the equal of any people in the world. 
The Danish peasantry is said by many to be the most intelligent in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-700
  674. READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
world. Agriculture, which is the principal industry in Denmark, has 
since the war with Germany in 1864 raised the nation from practical 
bankruptcy to a position of independence and self-respect, in spite of 
the fact that there are conditions in Denmark which make successful 
farming more difficult than in some other countries. This has been ac- 
complished by the intelligence of the Danish farmer. He is constantly 
a student of his task, experimenting, testing, trying always to get better 
returns from the soil and from his dairy, and endeavoring to improve 
the products of his farm so that more people in England and other 
countries that buy them will want them. He reads more newspapers, 
agricultural papers, and magazines than any other farmer in the world. 
For this intelligence and its consequent prosperity, the folk high schools 
and the agricultural schools which have grown from them receive a 
large share of credit from the Danish people. The folk high schools 
have given them inspiration, and the agricultural schools have given 
them definite preparation for their work. The work of these institu- 
tions in the education of their students does not end when they leave 
their halls, nér is it confined to their students alone. The high schools, 
in addition to their regular courses of instruction, maintain lecturing 
societies and hold annual high-school meetings for the intellectual im- 
provement of all the rural population. The agricultural schools, besides 
giving short practical courses for farmers and farmers’ wives, prepare 
specialists whose business it is to advise farmers and give them assist- 
ance in working out their experiments and agricultural problems. 
The influence of the high schools on the civic life of rural Denmark is 
easily discovered. They have raised the standard of intelligence of the 
people, and the people are therefore well informed in regard to ques- 
tions of politics and government and are able to do their own thinking 
on such questions. ... 
On the economic side of Danish life the influence of the high schools 
also stands out conspicuously. The higher standard of intelligence es- 
tablished by the high schools has improved the condition of the Danish 
farmer amazingly, and has made him the chief factor in Danish life. 
Though as a rule his farm is small, it almost invariably produces a good 
living for its owner and usually contributes something to the export 
trade of the nation. The export trade of Denmark consists chiefly in 
butter, cheese, bacon, and eggs. These go largely to the markets of 
England, and are produced and marketed usually under the direction of 
the Danish coéperative agricultural societies. Codperation is the 
watchword in all rural activities in Denmark. In coéperation in agri- 
culture this little country has become an example for the rest of the 
world. In 1912 there were marketed, through the codperative societies, 
eggs, butter, bacon, and meats to the value of $121,000,000.

371. The German System of Vocational Education 
(Report of the Commission on National Aid to Vocational Education, vol. 1, 
Appendix A. Washington, 1914) 
The following selection offers a very interesting description of 
the system of vocational education which the German Empire 
developed, after 1871, to enable the nation to overcome its handi- 
caps in natural resources and provide for a rapidly increasing pop- 
ulation. 
Vocational education in Germany undertakes to meet the require- 
ments of every occupation, however simple, in so far as these have been 
accurately determined, and to give precisely that instruction and train- 
ing which will develop in the worker the greatest efficiency. The vo- 
cational schools of Germany are, therefore, almost as diverse in char- 
acter as are the occupations of her workers, and this very diversity in 
character renders any detailed account of them impossible in a brief 
statement The object has been not simply to develop a national 
system of education, but rather to provide in each locality, and for 
each group of workers, schools adapted to the special needs of the 
locality and occupations of the workers. . . . 
The Industrial Schools. The system of vocational industrial schools 
embraces the following general types of institutions: 
1. The technical universities, which are similar to our best techno- 
logical colleges, and are intended to train students for leadership 
in industrial enterprises. 
2. The middle technical schools, which “aim to train managing offi- 
cers for the greater industries, and persons who initiate and man- 
age the lesser industrial undertakings.”. . . 
3. The lower technical schools. The requirements for admission to 
these schools are briefly summed up as follows: 
(a) A preliminary general education, such as is given in a good 
elementary school. 
(6) The training given in the continuation schools, or the 
preparatory course of the technical schools. 
(c) Several years’ practical experience in a trade, and generally 
the completion of apprenticeship. 
4. The industrial continuation schools. The requirement for ad- 
mission to these schools is completion of the elementary school 
course. The instruction in these schools commonly does not 
occupy more than 8 or ro hours a week, in the evening on week 
days and on Sunday afternoons, and is intended to “give all the 
workers in the industries and handicrafts, whether apprentices 
or journeymen, an opportunity to acquire, without giving up 
their practical work in the shop, a knowledge and skill in draw- 
ing, which is absolutely necessary for efficiency in their occupa- 
tions.” .... 
 
-P-A-G-E-702
  676 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
In some respects the most significant feature of the German system 
of industrial education is found in the systematic effort, through the 
continuation schools and other agencies, to rehabilitate the appren- 
ticeship system and to provide for the continued development of the 
boy during his period of, apprenticeship. The school retains for sev- 
eral years its hold upon the boy who has entered the factory or shop, 
and provides for him an open way for improvement in efficiency. . . . 
In general, the types of schools described above are found more or 
less clearly differentiated, in the field of mining and industrial pro- 
duction, covering the mechanical, the chemical, and the building 
trades, the art trades, and handicrafts. Recently the technical train- 
ing of women in industrial and commercial pursuits and in domestic 
economy has been undertaken. 
The control of these schools is commonly entrusted to the ministries 
of commerce and industry, or to commissions representing these min- 
istries, and the ministry of education. 
Commercial Technical Education. ‘The differentiation of the com- 
mercial technical schools is less well defined than it is in the case of the 
industrial schools, and the development of the commercial schools has 
come at a later date.. There are, however, excellent advanced com- 
mercial schools for the thorough training of business managers. The 
courses of study cover national economics, commercial law, foreign 
languages, commercial geography, and accounting. The middle and 
lower commercial technical schools and the commercial continuation 
schools, which give instruction of a lower grade, vary greatly in char- 
acter and efficiency, but in general render the services with reference 
to training for commercial pursuits which is rendered by industrial 
schools of corresponding grade for industrial pursuits. 
Results of Vocational Training. Relatively to other countries, the 
only conditions more favorable in Germany to industrial and commer- 
cial development, in 1871, were a greater poverty of her people, less 
abundant natural resources, and a greater necessity of providing at 
home for the employment and maintenance of a rapidly increasing 
population. France, with a richer soil, had not the stimulus of an 
increasing population, and England, with abundant supplies of coal 
and irén available for domestic manufactures, possessed in her colonial 
empire an outlet for her surplus population. While, however, other 
European peoples whose necessities and poverty were equally as great 
as were those of Germany have not found in their necessities a stimu- 
lus to economic advancement, Germany has risen, within the lifetime 
of the present generation, from a position of commercial and industrial 
insignificance to a position of dominance in the markets of the world, 
largely as a direct consequence of the work of her vocational, technical, 
and technological schools. 
At the close of the Franco-Prussian War, in 1871, not only were Ger- 
 
-P-A-G-E-703
      NEW TENDENCIES AND EXPANSIONS 677 
many’s manufactures and commerce relatively insignificant and poorly 
conditioned, but the habits and occupations of her people were domes- 
tic and agricultural. Her natural resources and the economic capacity 
of her people, who had given no evidence of possessing any peculiar 
genius for industrial activities, seemed inadequate to provide for an 
increasing population. Under these conditions the individual genius of 
Bismarck, through direction of the ministry of commerce and industry, 
undertook the achievement of economic prosperity, and in this work 
he relied principally upon the institution and development of a system 
of practical education which should embrace the entire working popu- 
lation of Germany. 
In the four decades which measure the period of her rise as an in- 
dustrial and commercial nation, Germany has demonstrated that 
nations which depend upon convention, established prestige, or su- 
perior natural resources, can not compete successfully against a nation 
which systematically develops the intelligence and efficiency of her 
laborers, and regards the farm, the shop, and the factory as labora- 
tories for the application of science to economic processes. “It can not 
be doubted,” declares a recent writer, “that under equal conditions 
the competition of German manufactured goods with English manu- 
factured goods would be impossible anywhere outside of Germany, 
owing to the unfavorable geographical position of Germany’s coal 
fields and industrial centers. Germany is competing largely on account 
of her system of industrial education.” 
While in other countries the development of science has been aca- 
demic, in Germany every new principle elaborated by science has 
revolutionized some industry, modified some manufacturing process, 
or opened up an entirely new field of commercial exploitation. In the 
chemical industries of Germany, it is stated that there is one university 
trained chemist for every forty work people. It is important to realize 
that the development of Germany’s manufactures and commerce has 
depended not upon the establishment of any monopoly in the domain 
of science, nor upon any advancement of science within her boundaries 
more aggressive and rapid than that which has taken place in other 
countries, but primarily upon the practical utilization of the results of 
scientific research in Germany and in other countries. In this whole 
process of bringing science into practice industrial education is an im- 
portant factor. 
372. Vocational Education and National Prosperity 
(Report of the Commission on National Aid to Vocational Education, vol.1, pp. 22-23. 
Washington, 1914) 
In this selection from the Report the Commission states well 
the new dependence of commercial and industrial nations on 
vocational education for their workers for national prosperity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-704
  678 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Our National Prosperity is at Stake 
We have become a great industrial as well as a great agricultural 
nation. Each year shows a less percentage of our people on the farms 
and a greater in the cities. 
Our factory population is growing apace. Our future as a nation 
will depend more and more on the success of our industrial life, as well 
as upon the volume and quality of our agricultural products. It has 
repeatedly been pointed out that the time is not far distant when our 
rapidly increasing population will press hard upon an improved agricul- 
ture for its food supply, and force our industries to reach out over the 
entire world for trade wherewith to meet the demands for labor of un- 
told millions of bread winners. 
In volume of output the United States leads the four great manu- 
facturing nations of the world. More than a billion and a half of peo- 
ple outside of these four countries are largely dependent upon them for 
manufactured articles. ‘‘The rewards offered in this world trade are 
beyond comprehension. They are to be measured in money, in intel- 
lectual advancement, in national spirit, in heightened civilization.” 
Yet we have only begun to invade this market, where we find our com- 
petitor too often in possession of the field and strongly entrenched 
against us. F 
It is true that we have a large foreign trade in manufactured articles, 
but of our exports a very large proportion consists of crude materials. 
German, French, and English exports represent on the average a much 
greater value in skill and workmanship than do those from our own 
ports. Less than one-third of the volume of our foreign commerce is 
made up of manufactures ready for consumption. A very large pro- 
portion consists of raw and semi-raw materials, such as lumber, cotton, 
meat, coal, oil, and copper bar, to secure which we have robbed our soil 
and the earth beneath our feet of the riches we have been foolish 
enough to regard as inexhaustible. The statistics of our foreign com- 
merce show that the proportion of these raw products, in the total 
volume of our exports, has been declining during the past three decades, 
and that the maintenance and development of our foreign trade is com- 
ing to depend each year to a greater extent upon our ability to compete 
with foreign nations in the products of skilled labor, — upon our ability 
to “sell more brains and less material.” 
The volume of our foreign trade has in the past depended upon the 
exploitation of a virgin soil and of our other natural resources. In this 
crude work we have had no competitors. Our profit has been the 
profit of the miner working in a rich soil. The volume and profitable- 
ness of our trade in the future, however, must depend much more 
largely upon the relative skill and efficiency of the vocationally-trained 
artisans of England, France, and Germany. Our products will find a
-P-A-G-E-705
  NEW TENDENCIES AND EXPANSIONS 679 
market in foreign countries only in those lines of industrial activity in 
which the labor is as efficient and as well trained as the labor of the 
countries with which we must compete. 
The battles of the future between nations will be fought in the mar- 
kets of the world. That nation will triumph, with all that its success 
means to the happiness and welfare of its citizenship, which is able to 
put the greatest amount of skill and brains into what it produces. Our 
foreign commerce, and to some extent our domestic commerce, are 
being threatened by the commercial prestige which Germany has won, 
largely as the result of a policy of training its workers begun by the far- 
seeing Bismarck almost half a century ago. 
France and England, and even far-off Japan, profiting by the schools 
of the Fatherland, are now establishing national schools of vocational 
education. In Germany, within the next few years, there will probably 
be no such thing as an untrained man. In the United States probably 
not more than 25,000 of the eleven or twelve million workers in manu- 
facturing and mechanical pursuits have had an opportunity to acquire 
an adequate training for their work in Iife. 
373. English Conditions before the first Factory Labor Act 
(Montmorency, J. E. G. de, The Progress of Education in England, pp. 66-68. 
London, 1904) 
The following extract describes the pitiable conditions sur- 
rounding child life in England after the rise of manufacturing and 
before the passage of the first factory control legislation, and gives 
the more significant provisions of this pioneer law. 
... Parliament, during the eighteenth century, had taken an in- 
termittent interest in education, and had created, at any rate, a certain 
distinct power to charge the rates with the education of the destitute. 
But the closing years of the century saw the gradual reopening of a new 
social problem. The invention and introduction of machinery into 
certain districts of the North of England, involved the aggregation of 
large masses of people in those districts. This broke down the paro- 
chial school system, and, moreover, in the end, did away with all educa- 
tion, for parents and employers rapidly discovered the value of child 
labour in mechanical production. Not only were all available children 
drafted into the mills, but the destitute children of the great towns were 
purchased, under a system of indenture, by the manufacturers from the 
poor-law authorities. Sir Samuel Romilly. declared, in the House of 
Commons, in 1806, that parish apprentices were-often sent by contract 
from London to the Lancashire cotton mills “in carts, like so many 
negro slaves.” Until the year 1816, pauper children under the age of 
nine years could be compulsorily apprenticed in pursuance of statute 43 
Eliz., c.2, s.5. It was not until 1833 that it became unlawful generally
-P-A-G-E-706
680 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
* to employ in mills children who had not completed their ninth year, and 
this age was actually lowered by a year in 1844. Moreover, the Stat- 
ute of 1833 reserved the case of silk mills, and until the yéar 1879 
children from the age of eight years could be employed in such mills. 
This seems almost unbelievable. But the fact remains, and through 
half of the nineteenth century the country was face to face with the 
knowledge that an immense number of children were growing up as 
parts of a great industrial machine, without any knowledge of either 
religion or letters, — human beings brought up as beasts of burden; 
housed, fed, and worked. Old Mr. Bonwick, in bis “ Reminiscences” 
before referred to, tells us that when he was a boy it was pitiful “to see 
the boy chimney-sweep, shivering and half-starved as a work-house 
apprentice, driven by a brutal master to clamber up the steep. What 
. dreadful stories I then heard of the poor factory children, forced, as 
mere babes in the wintry darkness, breakfastless, to the mill!” The 
intolerable character of the evil — an evil of so profitable a character 
that both masters and parents rejoiced at its existence — awakened 
the conscience of, at any rate, certain minds in Parliament. It was 
felt that a generation was growing up that had no knowledge or appreci- 
ation of the forces that bind society together, — no knowledge of home 
life, of religion, of morality. The future depends on the children of the 
present, and the outlook for the nineteenth century looked dark enough 
in the year of grace 1802. 
On April 13th, 1802, a Bill was introduced into the House of Com- 
mons “‘for the preservation of the health and morals of apprentices and 
others, employed in cotton and other mills, and cotton and other fac- 
tories.” This Bill, slightly amended and improved, received the Royal 
assent on June 22nd, 1802. The state of the factory children may be 
guessed from the provisions of the Act. It directed the mill rooms to be 
whitewashed twice a year, and to be ventilated; it ordered an appren- 
tice to have one suit of clothes a year, and 
hours a day, exclusive of meal times; it 
night and six in the morning; it provided 
tices should sleep in separate rooms, an not to work more than twelve 
orbade work between nine at 
that male and female appren- 
not more than two appren-     tices should sleep in one bed; it made medical attendance compulsory 
in the case of infectious disease; it directed the mills to be inspected 
by visitors appointed by the justices, and ordered the children to be 
taught the elements of learning and the principles of Christianity. 
The sixth section of the Act runs as follows: “Every such apprentice 
shall be instructed, in some part of every working day, for the first four 
years at least of his or her apprenticeship. .. . in the usual hours of 
work, in reading, writing, and arithmetic, or either of them, according 
to the age and abilities of such apprentice, by some discreet and proper 
person, to be provided and paid by the master or mistress: of such ap- 
prentice, in some room or place in such mill or factory to be set apart

for that purpose; and that the time hereby decided to be allotted for 
such instruction as aforesaid, shall be deemed and taken on all occa- 
sions as part of the respective periods limited by this Act during 
which any such apprentice shall be employed or compelled to work.” 
Section 8 provided that ‘Every apprentice or (in case the appren- 
tices shall attend in classes) every such class shall, for the space of one 
hour at least every Sunday, be instructed and examined in the prin- 
ciples of the Christian religion, by some proper person, to be provided 
and paid by the master or mistress of such apprentice.” Church of 
England children -were to be examined at least once a year by the 
clergyman of the parish, and presented to the Bishop for confirmation 
between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years. Moreover, divine 
service was to be attended every Sunday, and not less than once a 
month at an Established Church. 
This reformatory measure was petitioned against in the following 
year by manufacturers and parents, and it was never enforced. Many 
generations of little seven-year old slaves were to be worn away in the 
mills before effective relief came. 
374. The New Problem of Child Labor 
(Giddings, F. R., From an Address on “The Social and Legal Aspect of Compulsory 
Education and Child Labor,” before the National Education Association, at 
Asbury Park, in 1905) 
The following short extract from the above cited address states 
both simply and clearly the new problem of child labor, as it has 
arisen since the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the 
factory system. 
The educational problem and the industrial problem of child labor 
cannot be separated. This is true, whether every parent is permitted 
to deal as he will with his child, or whether he is compelled, as in most 
American Commonwealths, to withhold his child from gainful em- 
ployment and to keep him in a school, or otherwise to provide systema- 
tic instruction for him, during certain weeks of each year. Child labor 
itself is a kind of education which, according to its nature and extent, 
may be consistent or altogether inconsistent with other kinds. The 
labor that American boys and girls had to perform on the farm a gen- 
eration and more ago was often an invaluable discipline of mind and 
character, fitting them for self-reliant and useful careers quite as effec- 
tively as their meager school training did. Such labor did not neces- 
sarily unfit the child for the enjoyment of the highest educational ad- 
vantages. Exhausting confinement in stores, sweat-shops and factories 
is child labor of an altogether different sort. It is antagonistic to the 
child’s mental and physical development and it cannot be combined 
with any sound educational policy.

Compulsory education by the State and the prohibition of child 
labor are policies undoubtedly socialistic in character. They assert 
the supremacy of the State’s interest in the child as against any op- 
posing interest of the parent. The American people have never been 
afraid of socialism to this extent, and within the last ten years it has 
greatly extended both compulsory education and the prohibition of the 
labor of children. 
375. Health Work in the Schools 
(Hoag, E. B., and Terman, L. M., Health Work in the Schools, pp. 1-5. Boston, 1914) 
The following selection, taken from the introductory chapter of 
a standard text on health supervision as a phase of the work of 
public education, gives a good idea as to the spread of health work 
in the schools, and of the responsibility of society for such atten- 
tion to child needs. 
The health supervision of schools is not a passing fad. The conser- 
vation of the child is a problem which, like that of world peace, is 
bound to take possession of the minds of all humanitarian people. To 
the ethical principle of humanitarianism is added the stern counsel of 
biological laws, which teach us that an elaborate scheme of mental cul- 
ture which proceeds without regard to the needs of the body is but a 
house built upon the sands. 
It is significant for the future of the movement that, with minor ex- 
ceptions, all civilized countries have almost simultaneously taken it up. 
Its universal development is inevitable. Progress has been remarka- 
bly uniform in different countries, though naturally there are some 
differences in the details of procedure and in the points of emphasis. 
Germany has forged ahead with her dental clinics and open-air schools. 
France, with her school lunches and vacation colonies; while England 
has set the whole world an example in the earnest way in which she has 
_ undertaken to ameliorate the evils which medical inspection of schools 
has revealed. Our own country, on the whole, is behind most of the 
nations of Europe in the practice of school hygiene, but is making 
progress rapidly. But the doctor has not been brought into the school 
without opposition, and it is therefore desirable to inquire further into 
the justification for this new assumption of responsibility on the part of 
organized society. 
If all parents were wise in regard to health matters, it would not be 
so necessary for schools to make a special study of the physical condi- 
tions of the children entrusted to their care. All that could then be 
fairly required would be the guaranty of a healthful school environ- 
ment, correct methods of lighting and heating, sanitary plumbing, the     
-P-A-G-E-709
NEW TENDENCIES AND EXPANSIONS 683 
control of contagious diseases, frequent recesses, sufficient physical 
training, and the proper sort of health instruction. But it is a fact and 
not a theory that not all parents possess the special knowledge which 
is necessary for the hygienic supervision of physical and mental devel- 
opment. Even intelligent parents may be unable to detect the early 
symptoms of physical disorder, just as they may be unable to decide 
upon the best methods or texts for teaching history or geography. 
They do not see the defects in their own children because they are used 
to them. Many are so superstitious as to prefer to treat adenoids by 
suggestion, others so ignorant as to interpret pediculosis capitis as a 
sign of good health. Plainly, therefore, it becomes the duty of the 
school department to furnish not only a healthful school environment, 
but also a health guardianship over its pupils. 
The children of to-day must be viewed as the raw material of a new 
State; the schools as the nursery of the Nation. To conserve this raw 
material is as logical a function of the State as to conserve the natural 
resources of coal, iron, and water power. To investigate exhaustively 
the evils which exist, and to remedy all that may be remedied without 
transgressing unduly upon the jealous precincts of parental responsi- 
bility, is a plain matter of duty. Theoretically, it matters little how 
the State performs this duty, whether by a house-to-house census of the 
children, or in some other way. Practically, however, there is no effec- 
tive or convenient way except to d 
public schools. In many of our bes lo the work in connection with the 
t towns and cities the people them- 
selves are demanding such supervision on the principle that it is one of 
the important functions of the pub ic-school system. 
  The argument that the health supervision of schools invades the 
rights of the home has precisely the same value as the corresponding 
argument against compulsory school attendance and prescribed courses 
of study. The school does not claim anything more than the right to 
make an examination of the child’s physical and mental condition in 
order that the work of the school may be properly adjusted to his 
health and growth needs, and, further, to notify and advise parents 
regarding such defects as are found to exist. This is not an unwar- 
ranted assumption of power. The responsibility for remedial action is 
left entirely with the parents. The school has not undertaken forcibly 
_ to subject children to surgical operations, nor is there at present any 
legal method of compelling parents to perform their duty in this re- 
spect. We can invoke the law for wanton neglect of a broken bone, 
but there is no way to punish the neglect of discharging ears, adenoids, 
or astigmatism, any one of which may prove more serious in the long 
run than a fractured bone. 
It is interesting to conjecture how far present practice in this regard 
is likely to be modified. Compulsory public education itself is so 
recent that only a few decades ago it was considered by a majority of  
-P-A-G-E-710
684 READINGS IN HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
people as a species of meddlesome paternalism. According to the old 
conception the child was the parents’ child; if they questioned the 
value of an education there was no recourse in the child’s behalf. 
There are a million or more illiterate adults in the United States to-day 
who are victims of this mistaken social theory. The theory, happily, 
has been discarded. We know now that the interests of society de- 
mand an elaborate scheme of educational processes under social con- 
trol. Some time we shall understand, just as clearly, that the child’s 
physical growth also stands in need of more expert supervision than the 
average parent is capable of exercising.

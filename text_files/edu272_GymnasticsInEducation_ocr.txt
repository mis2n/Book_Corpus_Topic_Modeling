AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 
Puysicat Education by Gymnastics is the regulated and super- 
vised practice of muscular exercise, under conditions which tend to 
promote the health of the individual and to develop and discipline 
his motor powers. 
Educators of academic institutions throughout the country 
realize today more than ever before the truth of this statement, 
consequently physical education plays an important part in educa- 
tion. The recent World War demonstrated the fact that many 
of the young men were physically unfit, and this condition has 
stimulated a desire among school authorities to adopt required 
physical education in the curriculum. 
Twenty-three states have passed laws requiring physical education 
in their schools, and the movement is spreading. This means 
that thousands of teachers are needed. 
Every year our colleges and normal schools send forth as teachers 
hundreds of young men and women. They have received gym- 
nastic training as a student body, but, as individuals are not com- 
petent to instruct their pupils in a graded course. With this 
thought in mind the author addresses this volume to instructors 
in high, preparatory, normal and grammar, schools and colleges, 
who, not working under any given system, find themselves called 
upon to give instruction in such work. 
The author wishes to express his appreciation of the courtesies 
extended by Messrs. Jessie H. Bancroft, William A. Stecher, 
Henry Suder, the Macmillan Company, and the Y. M. C. A.

EDITOR’S PREFACE. 
A TRUSTEE of a state college once opposed the grant for the 
equipment of a gymnasium because as a boy when he wanted 
exercise he had sawed a cord of wood, saying that boys of today 
should do the same thing. The director replied with a demand 
for 1000 buck saws and 3000 cords of wood a week for the college 
term. Gymnasium apparatus was invented to meet such a 
situation. 
Our modern life takes from the youth the occupations and facili- 
ties for exercise that are essential for normal growth and development 
and gymnastics act as substitutes. Curiously enough the substitute 
sometimes passes the original. The complicated evolutions on 
the horse described in this book would be impossible on the living 
animal or on the beam from which the gymnasium horse evolved, 
and one has only to go to the circus to see the distance traveled 
by the modern horizontal bar from the branch of a tree. 
Modern gymnastics are merely an arrangement and classification 
of the natural movements of daily life and sport in an orderly pro- 
aught and practised by large numbers 
  gression so that they may I 
of students under the artificial conditions of school and city life, 
and when the unthinking refer to them as being in opposition to 
games and sports and inferior to them in educational value they 
ignore this fact. All exercise should be taken out of doors, so 
should all school work, all meals and all sleep. Unfortunately 
our customs and climate make this impossible and we must recognize 
the compressed and classified exercises of the gymnasium as part 
of the artificialities of our general life. 
The teaching of gymnastics is highly specialized educational 
work. It will never lose its place as a large part of the foundation 
Gy.)

  vi EDITOR’S PREFACE 
of all educational work and no course in Physical Education can 
slight it. 
The author of this book has here undertaken the task of bringing 
together under one cover a progression of exercises on the well- 
established gymnastic appliances, with class formations, tactics and 
free movements for the use of teachers of Physical Education. 
The difficulties of the teacher have long been familiar to 
Dr. Cromie whose eighteen years of experience at the University of 
Pennsylvania with daily classes of students numbering up to 
two hundred men has developed his genius for organization. The 
continuity of his work was interrupted by the war and he took a 
course at the H.Q., C.A.G.C., Ottawa, and instructed at the S.A.T.C. 
Staff School at Princeton, and had charge of the P.T. at Camp 
Eustis where he prepared thousands of men for active service. 
He is the Director of the Summer School in Physical Education at 
the University of Pennsylvania and has already written such widely 
circulated books as, “Keeping Physically Fit,’ “Group Contests 
for the Playground and School,” twelve booklets in the Spalding 
Athletic Library on Gymnastics and many articles on Walking, 
Gymnastics, and the Hygiene of Exercise for the young and old. 
This subject must occupy an important place in this series of 
books on Physical Education and takes its place naturally with 
the teaching of practical anatomy, athletic training and the history 
of the subject already treated.

  GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION. 
CHAPTER I. 
GYMNASTIC TACTICS. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tue perfection to which gymnastic tactics can be carried is 
seen in the troupes of so called Zouaves whose intricate and rapid 
evolutions form the attraction of many a theatrical program. 
In their marches they sometimes attain a trot of 180 paces to the 
minute, and the mazes they make and unwind are designed to 
bewilder the spectator. Students in high school and college could 
master a similar drill in the same or possibly less time, but such 
perfection requires too much preparation and is not suitable for 
ordinary gymnastic classes. 
Gymnastic marching tactics and class evolutions are performed by 
one or more persons according to a fixed law, or it is the art of 
handling classes on the gymnasium floor with and without apparatus 
after having mastered the evolutions in drill. Besides serving 
merely as a means of handling a class, tactics result in an erect 
carriage, and correct walk. Gymnastic marching differs from 
ordinary marching in its variety and versatility, and the tactics 
employed are much more complicated than in military training. 
Class evolutions thus become an interesting part of a gymnastic 
lesson. Marching tactics give the best opportunity for the teacher 
to correct faults of posture and carriage with the body in action 
and so have a high educational value. 
Concentration and power of attention, rapid and accurate response~ 
to command are acquired and developed by tactics as by no other 
means. The attention of the student in other parts of the gym- 
nasium lesson wanders, but in tactics undivided attention must 
be given. 
All teachers of physical training should include from two to 
three minutes of tactics to begin each gymnastic lesson, first to 
2 Ci)
-P-A-G-E-12
18 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
secure attention and general alertness, and again that the response 
may be accurate and prompt. 
The average student of physical education has more difficulty 
in mastering the teaching of tactics than almost any other part of 
the work. The more efficient he is in this branch of physical 
training, the better teacher he is likely to be, because he must him- 
self reach a high degree of efficiency and accuracy in commanding, 
which is so necessary in pedagogy. 
Military tactics are inadequate for school or college gymnasia 
with their years of graded work. They are no more suitable for 
educational institutions than is the army regulation setting-up 
drill sufficient to meet the varied need for physical education of 
primary, public, high school and college. 
Gymnastic tactics thus cover a much wider field. The greatest 
confusion has been with nomenclature. For example, in military 
tactics the quarter turn of the individual when standing is termed 
right or left face, but the moment the person is in motion, the com- 
mand is changed to “by right or left flank.” In the half turn while 
standing, the command is “about face” but is changed while in 
motion to the command, “to the rear, march.” It is much better 
for school purposes to call the movements by the same name, 
as long as they are similar, and to make them as nearly self explana- 
tory as possible. The following books will be found useful for 
reference and comparison of methods: 
Teaching Tactics by C. L. Schrader, Vol. XVII, American Physical 
Education Review. Gymnastic Tactics, William <A. Stecher. 
Chicago Public School Syllabus, Henry Suder. 
DEFINITIONS. 
Fall In!—Is the command given to bring a number who are at 
large into an organized formation. 
Break Rank! (or, Fall Out!) (or, Class is Dismissed!)—Is the 
command which orders an organized formation to be at large. 
Class, Attention! In Position, Stand! Atten-tion!—In response to 
any of these commands, one immediately assumes an exaggerated 
position of good form, viz: Chest out strong, chin and abdomen 
drawn in, heels together, feet turned out slightly, arms hanging 
naturally at sides, palms facing inward, thumbs behind the median 
line of the thigh, and the weight of the body resting upon the ball 
of the foot. *
-P-A-G-E-13
  GYMNASTIC TACTICS 19 
In Place, Rest!—Is a relaxation from the position of attention. 
One heel is kept in place. 
Class at Ease!—A self chosen relaxed position. 
Dress!—A command given to adjust the individuals to a straight 
alignment from end to end, and to close order. 
Guide!—A command given for a straight alignment. 
Close Order!—Where the individuals are in facing distance (14 
inches). 
Open Order!—Where the individuals are in more than facing 
distance. 
RULES AND METHODS OF TEACHING. 
Fall In!—The meaning of this command is learned by practice 
or doing. Line-up according to height, the smallest person on the 
left. Each one should observe beside whom he stands and should 
occupy that place whenever possible and with despatch. 
Break Ranks or Fall Out!—At this command the pupils are at 
largeagain. Alternate the commands “Fall in” and “Break Ranks” 
several times, so that in future lessons they will readily understand 
and execute promptly. 
Attention! Class Attention! Position! 
Class at Ease! —Stepping forward or sideward so that the weight 
is equally divided upon each foot. 
Rest!—This command is given after very strenuous work or when 
more detailed instructions are about to be given. 
Right Dress! Left Dress!—All except the person on the extreme 
right or left turn eyes in the direction indicated. 
Front or Attention! 
Guide Right or (Left)! : 
Cover or Take Distance!—Arms forward or sideward raise, and 
stand directly behind each other. Other methods and class 
formations. 
Facings.—The turn is made upon the heel corresponding to the 
direction toward which the facing is to be and is assisted by the 
toes of the opposite foot. The one-quarter turns in marching are 
executed thus: The command “face” is given as the right foot 
strikes the ground, the left foot advanced once more and the one- 
quarter turn right is executed while the right steps off in the new 
direction. In about face while marching from place, the command, 
“face” is given while on the right foot, the left advanced once more, 
and one-half right turn is executed on the balls of both feet, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
20 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
left stepping off in the new direction. Execute this in three counts, 
viz: (1) Left foot out; (2) turn; (3) left out in new direction. These 
turns may be executed right or left, one-eighth, one-quarter, one- 
half, three-eighth, etc. : 
Stepping.—For any number of steps taken forward or backward 
it requires one more count than the number of steps, for the side- 
ward stepping it takes double the number of counts of steps. Two 
steps sideward right four counts, etc. 
Halting.—With two counts following the command, “halt,” the 
halt is given as the right foot strikes the ground. While running 
in place or from place four counts are given after the command 
“halt.” 
Commanding.—The command should be issued distinctly in two 
parts; the first part of the command is explanatory, the latter part 
executive. The preparatory command is given slowly and dis- 
tinctly while the executive command is given in a firm sharp 
tone, thus, forward (pause)—march! mark time (pause)—mark! in 
place (pause)—march! ‘This is a definite exercise and there are sev- 
eral methods, viz: Raising knee forward, toes pointed downward 
and leg raised forward, toes in line with legs. The former has the 
advantage of keeping the weight forward on the ball of the foot, 
while the latter is more graceful in appearance. 
Wheeling.—In all wheelings forward the feeling is toward the 
pivot and the guiding toward the marching flank. Every quarter- 
wheel requires as many counts as there are units in the rank. 
Always begin with left foot. 
Facings.—(a) In standing position; (b) while marching in place; 
(ce) while marching from place. 
Commands: 
For one-quarter turn “right (left) face.” 
For one-half turn “right (left) about face.” 
For one-eighth turn “half right (left) face.” 
For three eighth turn “used in marching from place and 
command is: Obliquely backward right (left) march.” 
Forward—march!—At this command the left foot steps off first 
with the heel touching the ground before the ball of the foot and the 
toes pointing straight ahead. 
Counting.—From right to left count any given number, “count,” 
ete. The right end of a front rank begins the count and each in 
turn turns the head to the left while speaking the number, then turns 
the head to the front. ‘From front to rear, count” any given num-
-P-A-G-E-15
GYMNASTIC TACTICS 21 
ber, the first person in a flank rank, in order to divide into smaller 
ranks counts off to the person behind him and so on to the last one, 
' each turning the head while counting. 
Transformation of Ranks.—A front rank is transformed. 1. By 
facing (turning) to a flank rank by a one-quarter turn right or 
left, to an oblique rank by a one-eighth turn right or left. 
2. By marching, to a circle by the right and left leaders or ends 
going forward in a curved line, the other following until they meet 
opposite the center of the rank, or by the right or left leader going 
forward in a curved line until he meets the opposite leader who 
remains in place; to a half circle by the leaders going forward as 
above, but no closing, or the leaders remaining in place and the 
center going backward, the others following until a half circle is 
formed. To transform a flank rank to front, oblique, circle or 
half circle, go through the facings as above and march sideways 
in forming a half and full circle instead of front.

  CHAPTER II. 
GYMNASTIC FREE WORK. 
INTRODUCTION. 
ENJOYMENT is an important effect of exercise when well taught. 
The cheerful teacher will attract the attention of a class and firmness 
and discipline are never so necessary as in teaching gymnastics. 
Interest is maintained by the firm concise way in which commands 
are given and by the selection of exercises that are not meaningless 
and that progress in difficulty. 
The selection of exercises should be made taking into consideration 
the season of the year, the dress of the pupil, also sex, age and 
occupation. Running, striking, leaping, dodging, twisting and 
turning are the fundamental movements and should be selected 
and classified for use in a lesson, and performed as nearly as possible 
as they would be in actual use. Awkward, jerky movements are 
consequently to be avoided and the holding of fixed poses. These 
are unnatural, especially for young children who need constant 
variety to maintain their attention. Exercise for infants should 
consist largely of play. They should be quick rather than slow; 
free, not constrained; large and massive rather than fine; simple, 
rythmical and easily learned. 
The teacher should have every lesson well prepared. He should 
not give exercises requiring high coérdination to students, whose 
spirits have been more or less repressed during school hours. Exer- 
cises of this kind are, however, excellent for the young man in the 
shop or factory, whose mind has not been overactive. 
All symmetrical exercises should be given to the left side, then 
to the right. An assistant or leader should go among the class 
and correct faulty posture and criticise exercises improperly per- 
formed. If the instructor has neither assistant nor leader, then he 
should go among the students himself to correct errors. The 
proper performance of an exercise is as important as the exercise 
itself. Backward students should not be unduly criticized and the 
teacher should be competent to distinguish between inability and 
3 (33 )
-P-A-G-E-28
  34 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
carelessness. It is always a questionable practice to expose a pupil 
to ridicule. Other methods of correcting faults are: (a) While 
the class is doing an exercise; (b) while the class is standing at ease. 
The former for slight faults may be corrected by a command such 
as “heads up,” “body erect,” “both heels on the floor,” etc. A more 
lengthy explanation may be given while the class is resting, or ‘“‘at 
ease.” Corrective exercises also tend to eliminate faults. 
Commands should be given just loudly enough for all in the 
class to hear distinctly. Shouting is unnecessary, besides leaving 
the teacher no reserve for suddenly awakening the attention of the 
students. They should always be given in a cheerful animated 
manner. 
The Germans and Swedes both start an exercise to the left. 
As these great systems start all exercises to the left it is well to 
follow them for the sake of uniformity. 
The photographs in this book are posed to the right side because 
the instructor naturally illustrates the movement to the right 
in order to start pupils to the left. 
In this work no particular system of gymnastics is used. The 
terminology of the German system is followed because such explana- 
tions as “hips firm” (Swedish) means nothing to the uninitiated, 
whereas, “Hands on hips, place!’ (German) explains to the student 
what he is expected to do. The Day’s order and Progression of the 
Swedish System is used but in a modified form, because it is natural 
and physiological. This is explained under Arrangement of 
Exercises. 
The ideal place to conduct gymnastic classes is upon the play- 
ground or athletic field, but so few schools, colleges, clubs and 
institutions have access to these that the gymnasium and the class 
room must still be employed. Exercising in the schoolroom should 
be performed either between the seats, in the aisles or in the open 
spaces at the front and rear of the room. In any indoor room, 
hall or gymnasium the windows should be opened at the beginning 
of the class. 
METHODS—CONDUCT OF CLASS. 
The various methods of teaching exercises are: 
(a) By imitation. 
(b) By command. 
(c) In rythm.
-P-A-G-E-29
GYMNASTIC FREE WORK 35 
An exercise may be explained by two methods, viz: (1) Using the 
verb as the executive part of the exercise. Hands on hips (pause) 
place! Hands (pause) lower! (2) by using a sentence as the 
explanatory part. Raise arms sideward, (pause) one! Lower arms, 
(pause) two! After the exercise has been illustrated and explained 
by the teacher it may then be performed in rythm accompanied 
with music, counting, slapping hands, or the beat of a drum. 
In the Swedish system of gymnastics, the exercises are intended 
only to be given by command, although in this country it is some- 
what modified. Each exercise is given by command and the move- 
ment is held till the pupil is ordered to return to the starting position, 
or it is replaced by another exercise. 
FORMATION. 
The following figures are various forms for arranging a class on 
the gymnasium floor, (large or small) for mass or class-work. In 
a long narrow hall or corridor, the pupils may form a front rank 
and count off in threes, (Fig. 33), position A. At the command 
open rank, march! “ones, take two steps forward, threes, two steps 
backward” (illustrated in Fig. 33, position B) twos of course stand 
still.

For close order reverse the above, or “reform ranks.’’ 
From front rank A, count off in fours, fives, or sixes, and at the 
command “open ranks, march!’ each one takes double the steps 
of his number, making a diagonal formation, as in B. Fig. 33. 
Class in Two Ranks.—Command: Ones of the front rank two 
steps forward, twos of the rear rank two steps backward, march! 
(Fig. 34.) 
For close order reverse the above. 
In a Y.M.C. A. boys’ club or playground, where plenty of time 
can be used, march in a flank rank as in A (Fig. 35) until a given 
point is reached, the first person, No. 1, going to the right and the

second, No. 2, going to the left, as in position A of Fig. 35. In 
the second formation, the pupils march up the center in twos, 
No. 1 on the right and No. 2 on the left, until B is reached, Nos. 
1 and 2 going to the right, Nos. 3 and 4 to the left. This brings

Fig. 35. 
The opening of ranks from Fig. 35, position D may be accom- 
plished as follows: Command: Open ranks, right (left) sideward 
two steps distance successively, march! At the command “march,” 
the No. 1 rank takes two steps sideward right and continue marching 
till “halt” is given. On the count 3 and 4, No. 2 rank takes two 
steps, sideward, count 5 and 6, No. 3, and so on till rank 7 has taken 
two steps, when the class is halted. This opening may be performed
-P-A-G-E-31
GYMNASTIC FREE WORK 37 
in one-half the time by the command, “open ranks right and left 
sideward two steps distance successively, march!” In this opening 
Nos. 1 and 8 take steps sideward and the finish is done in the 
center by Nos. 4 and 5, who are halted on one step sideward. 
Another method is to give the command, “open ranks right (left) 
by raising arms sideward.” This way is not as orderly as the former, 
but is quicker. Still another method is: “Class, right face and open 
ranks forward two steps distance successively, march!” 
Fours, one-quarter wheel right (left) successively, march! Fig. 36.

At the command “march,” the first four make a one-quarter 
turn to the right (A), the others doing likewise in succession. 
Another mode of opening from Fig. 37 is: “Open ranks centers 
circling forward (backward) around ends, march!” In this opening 
Nos. 2 and 3 march forward or backward around Nos. 1 and 4 
taking eight steps to complete the maneuver. In going forward, 
the last two steps are made while turning to the front (B). 
The method employed for class arrangement for apparatus work 
in the University of Pennsylvania gymnasium. At the command 
“fallin! the class forms in two flank ranks in front of the instructors 
platform, the near rank being composed of Grade I students, and 
the far rank consisting of Grade II men. In one of the arrangements 
of apparatus there are 6 horizontal bars, 6 pairs of flying rings, 6 
vertical ropes, and 6 side horses. The formation is executed on the 
run, both grades being counted off in sixes by an assistant or leader 
as they pass a certain point. At the command “columns left 
march!” both grades run up the center and mark time in front of the 
instructor’s platform till the command “outward face” is given. 
At this order, the first 6 men in Grade I make a one-quarter right 
turn, Grade II one-quarter left turn, running to their respective 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
38 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
piece of apparatus, and so on until all have taken their places. 
The two squads are then divided; one half of Grade I go to the ropes, 
and the half of Grade II to the rings. One-half of the apparatus 
work period is spent on these pieces, then the bar workers change 
places with those on the rings, while a corresponding change is 
made on horse and ropes. This means that in every class lesson, 
each student uses an overhead and a floor piece of apparatus which 
tends to prevent or correct postural defects, due to the constant 
use of any one piece. After ten lessons, Grade I and II change 
apparatus, upon which they work for another ten lessons. This 
method for precision and despatch is the best apparatus arrange- 
ment, as 150 men form in two minutes.

Fie. 37, 
About the quickest way to form children, boys, or girls, in the 
gymnasium or playground, is to form two flank ranks (A), one boys, 
and the other girls. These lines should be a considerable distance 
apart in order to avoid congestion. Both lines counter-march 
outward, picking up a partner while making the “about face” (B). 
At the other end the first two boys and girls counter-march right, 
the next left, and so on until all have counter-marched (C). The 
class is then ready for opening order, which means one side step 
or one step away from partner (D). The boys are all on one side 
now, and the girls on the other. In order to avoid confusion, have 
the children take arms at (B).

Exercises. 
I. Introductory and breathing exercises. 
II. Arm and leg and foot exercises. 
Til. Trunk-bending forward and backward. 
IV. Balance exercises. 
V. Shoulder-blade exercises. 
VI. (Abdominal exercises.) 
VI. Trunk turning and bending sideward. 
VII. Marching, running, jumping. 
IX. Breathing exercises. 
I. Introductory exercises are necessary on account of their 
disciplinary value. They also prepare the scholar for the more 
difficult movements. A number of the simple movements under 
Group II may be added to this group, especially with the older 
students. 
II. Arm, leg, and foot exercises tend to expand the chest, they 
strengthen the muscles of the arms and legs, and make the joints 
flexible. 
III. Lowering and bending the trunk forward strengthens the 
back, corrects rounding of the back, and makes the body more 
supple. Backward bending of the trunk widens the chest, strength- 
ening the upper part of the body and the thorax. As it is a rather 
severe exercise, it should not be given to children under seven 
years of age, but children should not begin school life until seven 
years of age. The breath should not be held during this exercise. 
IV. Balance exercises assist the control of the brain over the mus- 
cles and body in general and help the performer to acquire con- 
centration of purpose. They are corrective, in that they strengthen 
the muscles which hold the body erect. The progression in this 
group is important, as these movements cease to be balance exercises 
when they are learned and performed without difficulty. They are, 
however, still useful in other ways. 
V. Shoulder-blade exercises must be differentiated from ordinary 
arm flexion and extension... The position in some exercises in Groups 
II and V may seem identical, but they are arrived at in a different 
manner. Often different combinations of muscles are employed, 
and the effects of the movements are also dissimilar. Shoulder- 
blade exercises expand the chest and flatten the shoulder blades, 
this correcting round shoulders and flat chest. They should
-P-A-G-E-34
  
40 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
especially be given during life in grammar and high school in order 
to counteract the tendency to a round back. 
VI. The abdominal exercises should be given between the VI 
and VII groups whenever possible. These are usually taken in the 
sitting, kneeling, and lying position, and require space which is not 
available in the schoolroom. Knee and leg raising and backward 
bending of the trunk also tend to strengthen the abdominal muscles. 
The strengthening of these muscles gives support to the abdomen 
and its contents. Abdominal exercising also augments the activity 
of the organs of digestion and excretion. 
VII. Trunk-turning or bending sideways develops the lateral 
flexibility of the spine and its power of rotation. These exercises 
increase the lower part of the chest’s capacity, strengthening the 
muscles of the thorax. 
VIII. Running, jumping and gymnastic dancing exercises exert 
a great influence on the circulation, respiration, digestion, and 
excretion. ‘These movements require high coérdination and impart 
alertness and agility. 
IX. Breathing exercises may be introduced between any of the 
above groups if it seems advisable. Many women breathe im- 
properly, using only the upper part of the chest. Deep breathing 
is necessary in order that the student may be taught to use all of 
the breathing space in the lungs, expecially to encourage a full 
expansion of the lower ribs. 
The progression of exercises in the four series is made: 
1. By altering the position of the feet and so making the “base” 
of a movement greater or smaller. Exercises are more easily 
performed with the feet astride, than when close together. 
2. By changing the position of the arms and thus altering the 
balance of the body as a whole. The balance is more easily main- 
tained with “hands on hips” (trunk bending) than when above the 
head. 
3. By altering the position of the body as in forward lunge, 
trunk lowered forward, etc. 
4. By a combination of arms, legs, and body. 
The following table will explain the meaning of the series and 
groups of exercises. The working out of the lesson, is left to the 
teacher or instructor, the tables from which they may be taken 
only being furnished. Most teachers prefer to use initiative, and 
thus be original in the exercises they give. The movements in 
Series 4 may be used for children from eleven years of age on, and

Movements and Direction.—1. Abduction.—A movement of any 
member of the body away from the median line of the antero- 
posterior plane, or away from the median line of the hand. (Raise 
arm sideward.) 
2. Adduction.—A movement of any line toward or across the 
median line of the body. (Lower arm from sideward position.) 
3. Cirewmduction.—A movement of trunk or extremity, wherein 
the farthest part from the center of motion describes a circle. 
Cireumduct head, Fig. 40, D. 
4. Flexion.—The bending of an extremity in the most natural 
direction. 
(a) Full: The member is flexed to its fullest extent. 
(b) Half: The member is flexed about 90 degrees. 
5. Bend.—The term bend is used to designate movement in a 
joint. 
6. Rotation.—Rotation is the turning of the head, trunk or ex- 
tremities upon its long axis (twist). 
7. Extension is the reverse of flexion. 
8. Direction.—Circles.—The direction for circles of the trunk 
or extremities is determined by the axis about, and the plane in which 
the movement is made in relation to the individual to a clock 
placed: 
 
-P-A-G-E-36

9. Other Movements of Direction.—The movements of direction, 
such as in striding, foot-placing and lunging are determined by the 
relation of the individual in the center of a circle to the points of a 
compass. The above also applies to the trunk and other parts of 
the body. Again there are movements of upward and downward.

CALISTHENICS. 
Calisthenics comprise all exercises with movable hand apparatus 
such as dumbbells, wands, indian clubs, single sticks, wooden rings 
and all “free’’ exercises, except tactics, figure marching, running 
and dancing. 
Free exercises are performed: 
1. From the fundamental standing position. 
2. From an assumed starting position of the arms, trunk, legs or 
a combination of these. 
The progression of movements is first forward, second sideward, 
third backward. (Fig. 39.)

CHAPTER VI. 
WANDS. 
Wands (Seventh and Eighth Grades). 
EXPLANATION OF TERMS AND POSITIONS. 
Carry Wands.—The wand is carried vertically at the right side, 
the lower end resting on the index finger, supported by the middle 
finger and thumb, the thumb is turned inward toward the thigh. 
Fig. 68. 
Starting Position.—The wand is brought from the “Carry” to 
the position “Wands low in front” or “Starting position” by raising 
the left arm sideward over head and grasping the end of the wand, 
knuckles backward at 1, at 2 the wand is lowered to a horizontal 
position in front of the thighs, arms extended. Figs. 68, 69 and 70. 
Over, or Ordinary Grasp.—The wand is held in the ‘‘over grasp” 
when the palms of the hands are turned backward. Fig. 70. 
Under, or Reversed Grasp.—The wand is held in the ‘Under 
grasp” when the palm of the hands are turned forward. Fig. 88. 
The over grasp is used for all exercises except the winding move- 
ments, where the under grasp is used. 
In such movements where it is necessary to release the grasp of 
one hand on the wand, follow this rule: The hand of the extended 
arm will release its grasp on the wand sufficiently to allow the wand 
to move easily through that hand. The hand of the bent arm retains 
a firm grasp on the wand. 
Horizontal Positions.—1. Wand Low in Front.—The wand is in 
front of the thighs, arms extended downward. Fig. 70. 
2. Wand Forward.—The wand is raised as high as the shoulders, 
arms extended. Fig. 71. 
3. Wand Fore-upward.—The wand is raised forward and upward 
until directly over the head, arms extended upward. Fig. 72. 
“Wand in front of the shoulders.” The wand is raised in front of 
the shoulders, arms bent. Fig. 73. 
4. Wand in Rear of the Shoulders.—The wand is raised forward 
upward and then lowered backward, resting back of the shoulders.

WANDS 95 
WINDING WAND TERMS AND POSITIONS. 
Winding exercises with the reverse or under grasp can only be 
accomplished when the hand that does the winding retains its hold 
or grip firmly on the wand and when the other hand releases or 
loosens its grip on the wand, in order to allow the wand to slide 
through the hand easily. 
Winding taken in parts: 
Starting Position (Fig. 88). —Wind Downward Right (Left.— 
Grasp end of wand with right hand. 1. Raise wand forward, 
Fig. 89. Grip tightly with right and loosen with left hand, and

CHAPTER VII. 
INDIAN CLUBS. 
INTRODUCTION. 
INDIAN-CLUB swinging, as an exercise, properly belongs to the 
educational class of gymnastics. It requires a high degree of 
coérdination while one is learning to swing clubs. On account of 
this constant mental attention, it is not the best form of exercise for 
young children. Club-swinging, should be included in every 
system of physical education on account of its attractiveness and 
its unlimited possibilities for the development of skill. 
It does not occupy the important place in class-work that it 
should. This is probably due to the fact that most instructors or 
teachers of physical training employ “straight” club swinging and 
make the movements too complicated for the novice. The move- 
ments should not be confined to arms and chest only, but the lower 
limbs and trunk should also be exercised. 
a

The clubs should be light, weighing not over one pound for women, 
and not over two pounds for men. In teaching club-swinging, 
I find that the pupil or student masters a movement more quickly 
by learning it with the right hand first. With most persons, the 
codrdination of the right hand is more highly developed than that 
of the left. This may be a reason for using the left hand first, 
but it takes too much time and time is at a premium in most 
gymnasiums. 
In club-swinging, keep the body erect, and do not allow it to sway 
forward or backward or to the side. Turning to the right or left 
( 106 )
-P-A-G-E-101
  INDIAN CLUBS 107 
should be avoided, unless absolutely necessary. The tendency of 
the novice is to shorten the swings and circles, which is incorrect. 
The wrists should be very flexible in circles made at arms length. 
The club should be held lightly during a circle, so that the momentum 
of the club will assist in describing a circle. The method of holding 
the club plays an important part in swinging. When at arms length, 
hold the index finger in a straight line with the club in order to 
balance it. Fig. 101. The club should slide between the thumb and 
index finger during a circle behind the shoulder as in Fig. 102, A. 
In a circle high or low in front, the knob of the club should be 
grasped by the thumb and two first fingers. Fig. 103. 
Fie. 103. 
NOMENCLATURE. 
1. General Terms.— Divisions of the body. 
2. Explanation of Positions.—The starting position for club-swing- 
ing may be with: (a) Clubs held in front of and close to the chest 
opposite the shoulders. (This is the key, or fundamental position. 
Fig. 104.) 
(b) Clubs held at side, horizontal in line with the forearm. 
Fig. 105. 
(c) Clubs held at side of thighs in line with forearm. 
(d) Clubs held over head in line with forearm. Fig. 106. 
(e) Upper arm held side horizontal, forearm vertical, clubs held 
in line with forearm. Fig. 107. This position is the best as a 
corrective exercise, but is very tiresome to hold. 
(f) Clubs held at front horizontal in line with forearm. Fig. 108. 
3. Direction of Circles.—A small or hand circle is one of which the 
hand is the center of motion. Fig. 117.
-P-A-G-E-102
  108 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
A large or arm circle is one of which the shoulder is the center. 
Fig. 109 and 111. 
A forearm circle is one between these two, where the fixed point 
is at the elbow, the forearm and club describing a circle. The upper 
arm is moved as little as possible. Fig. 114.

(a) Outer Circle.—When the right hand moves away from the 
right shoulder it begins an outer circle. R.R.,L.L. Left club to 
left. Fig. 109, A. 
(b) Inner Circle.—When the right hand moves toward the left 
shoulder, it begins an inner circle. R.L. Fig. 109 positions

(ce) Parallel Circles.—When both hands move to the right, 
parallel circles to the right are begun. This is a combination of 
the outer and inner circles. They may be double right or double 
left. Fig. 110. 
    
  Fie. 109. Fig. 110. Fig. 111. 
In the Antero-posterior Plane (about the Horizontal Axis). Fig. 111. 
(d) Forward Circles. —When one or both clubs pass forward they 
begin to describe forward circles. Fig. 111, A. 
(e) Backward Circles.—When one or both clubs pass backward, . 
they begin to describe backward circles. Fig. 111, B. 
(f) Outside and Inside Circles.—These are made by circling the 
clubs perpendicularly outside or inside of the arms, either forward 
or backward. Fig. 112. (Outside forward.) Outside backward. 
Outer and inner circles apply only to circles near the body in the 
lateral plane. Outside circles, Fig. 112. 
(g) Horizontal Circles.—When the clubs are extended horizontally 
circle them on a horizontal plane, to the right or left, above or below 
the arms. The clubs should revolve on their own axes in the 
direction the circle is made. It is impossible to make a circle on a 
perfectly horizontal plane under the arms. Horizontal circle to 
the right. Fig. 113, A, above arm. Left, B, beneath arm,

finger on knob, with the neck of the club lying over the outside of 
the wrist; at the same time rotating the forearm to the right, 
knuckles turned well to the left (Fig. 136, A). Bend forearm with 
right hand under right armpit. Keep the club as close as possible 
to the wrist, with wrist well bent, as in Fig. 136, B. Right to left 
swing of club under right forearm, with arm extended to side hori- 
zontal with strong flexion of wrist, as in Fig. 136, C. Bend forearm 
hand in front of chest, as in Fig. 186, D. Right to right hand circle

CHAPTER VIII. 
HEAVY APPARATUS: LOW HORIZONTAL BAR, 
INTRODUCTION. 
Heavy apparatus in gymnastics should play an important part 
in physical education. The low horizontal bar long ago was a 
fence or obstacle over which one vaulted. The high bar was once 
the limb of a tree. The horse is an evolution of the living horse 
while the climbing appliances compare with the rigging of a ship. 
Work upon heavy apparatus develops strength, skill, agility, 
judgment and courage. It requires strength and endurance to 
climb a rope hand over hand 20 feet in height. It takes nerve 
and courage to execute many of the flying circles forward and back- 
ward upon the horizontal bar. A high degree of skill and coérdina- 
tion is necessary in a complicated series of leg circles finished by a 
triple vault over the side horse. Speed and agility is demanded in a 
row of back flips and finished by a twisting somersault. In short, 
there is no other form of physical endeavor that compensates one 
so much as does a classical education in advanced heavy gymnastics. 
The instructor or leader should illustrate exercises upon the 
apparatus in the spirit of an artist; the movement should be model- 
like and perfect. Good form is as important as the exercise. 
Faulty posture should be constantly criticized, preferably by showing 
faults in an exaggerated form to the students without making them 
objects of ridicule. 
Squads on similar appliances should always move in unison to 
word of command or by numbers. Members may be held at any 
part of an exercise and criticized if numbers are used. 
Each succeeding lesson should increase in difficulty. A com- 
bination should be introduced using movements in the present and 
former lessons. It may be necessary to repeat a lesson for it is 
better to have one exercise properly executed than half a dozen 
slurred. 
The lessons on the low horizontal, vaulting and turning, lead up 
to workon the high bar. Hundreds of movements and combinations 
might be introduced if space permitted.

CHAPTER IX. 
HEAVY APPARATUS: PARALLEL BARS. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tue parallel bars as a method of development in the hands of 
a skilful instructor is almost a gymnasium in itself. The variety 
of movements may be arranged to meet the need of the weakest 
or most timid beginner, and yet test the strength and dexterity of 
the most classical gymnast. The various rolls, hand balance 
and turning (pirouette) require the shifting of the body from one 
position to another with the finest possible precision. The exer- 
cises outlined on this piece require no sudden or violent effort, 
and the most complex movement may be acquired by easy and 
gradual progression. 
Dangerous movements, such as hand balances at end, cut off and 
regrasp, somersaults forward and backward above the bars, and 
backhand springs at end have been omitted. Many lessons with 
work underneath the bars might have been added, but they are too 
similar to those of the low horizontal. Vaults, however, should be 
given on the parallel and horizontal bars, the side and long horse 
because vaulting, leaping and jumping are the movements used 
more or less throughout life. Those who wish to become proficient 
in hand balancing, pirouette, etc., will find the low parallel a useful 
aid, as there is no danger of falling from parallels which are only 6 
inches in height. The latest parallel bars are ideal for gymnasiums 
as they may be adjusted in width and height in a few moments.

CHAPTER X. 
RINGS. 
INTRODUCTION. 
EXERCISES upon the rings develop the upper part of the body 
and require strength, grace, equilibrium and in a lesser degree, 
agility. The muscular development of the chest, back and arms 
from ring-work is likely to become abnormal if not counteracted by 
practice upon some other apparatus. 
The various levers are typical ring movements but are too 
difficult for ordinary class-work. It is the desire of all advanced 
ring-workers to do these gracefully, together with the swinging 
discolates and hand balances. A few of these have been added for 
those who desire to advance on the rings. Dangerous movements 
such as the cut and catch at either end of the swing and the forward 
and backward ‘“‘fly away” have been omitted. Tallness is a dis- 
advantage in ring-work on account of leverage that must be over- 
come in movements such as the levers. The swinging hand balance 
on the rings is one of the most difficult exercises that is executed 
upon any gymnastic apparatus. 
Grave I.—Lesson I. 
The rings should be a few inches above one’s reach, so that the 
feet will not touch the floor while in the hanging position.

CHAPTER XI. 
HORIZONTAL BAR. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tue high horizontal bar may be considered the key to all sus- 
pended apparatus. Proficiency upon it renders work upon the 
rings, trapeze, rope, pole and ladder comparatively easy. It 
develops the shoulder, chest, abdomen and back muscles especially 
and requires physical courage. Advanced work upon it is an educa- 
tion in itself. Grace or form is the first essential, even in the most 
elementary movements. There is nothing in gymnastic work that 
looks more pleasing to the spectator, or imparts more gratification 
to the performer than the graceful upward sweep of the arms length 
circle (giant) to a hand balance, the easy shift of the hands in the 
pirouette, and the apparent abandon of the downward swing. 
When the arms length circle is alternated with feet circles where the 
intent appears suicidal, yet without effort, these and other similar 
movements render it popular and fascinating. 
Exercises upon this piece may be divided into three series: Those 
under the bar, those rising up to and above the bar, and circling 
around the bar. It is necessary to have strong abdominal muscles 
in bar work and these may be strengthened upon the stall bars or in 
ground tumbling. In the elementary lessons on all pieces, raising 
of the legs are given to strengthen the abdominal muscles in prepara- 
tion for the more advanced work. 
The best wooden bar is one that has a steel core. Steel bars 
should be kept polished with sand or emery paper so that the hands 
will not become sore. When the hands become blistered or torn 
they should be given a rest or else covered with adhesive tape.

HEAVY APPARATUS, GRADED LESSONS: SIDE HORSE 
AND _LONG HORSE. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tue side horse or vaulting horse is a very valuable piece of appara- 
tus on account of the many kinds of work that may be done upon 
it. All kinds of vaults may be performed, either with or without 
the pommels. Besides vaulting, various feints and circles which 
require perfect balance, as the weight of the body must be shifted 
in many directions, adds to its attraction and value. A high degree 
of coérdination is required in the proper performance of complicated 
circling. 
The tendency to “hump” or allow the body to sag is greater upon 
this piece than some of the others. Good form, then, should be the 
first requisite of work on the side horse. 
The long horse requires good judgment and daring in many of the 
long leaps. Both the side and long horse should be included in the 
Physical Department program.

  CHAPTER XIII. 
MAT WORK. 
INTRODUCTION. 
GROUND-TUMBLING is shrouded in the mists and uncertainty of 
antiquity ; in fact it is as old as the race itself. Illustrations showing 
movements we perform today have been found in the tombs of 
Egypt; also facsimiles on vases, made in ancient Greece prove that 
this form of exercise was in vogue centuries before the Christian era. 
Mat-work, tumbling or acrobatics will harmoniously develop 
every part of the body more quickly and better than most other 
forms of physical exercise. These will make one quick, agile, and 
sure-footed. They require a considerable degree of codrdination and 
selfcontrol. In short, no one has greater control of the body than 
the professional acrobat. 
Tumbling is a national exercise for boys and young men because 
it interests and attracts attention from the simple to the most com- 
plex movements. It should be included in all systems of physical 
education. 
The art of tumbling after school life is important as it has taught 
one how to fall with the minimum of danger to life and limb.

CHAPTER XIV. 
VERTICAL ROPE. 
INTRODUCTION. 
A KNOWLEDGE of rope-climbing is a necessary and useful form 
of exercise. The inability to ascend and descend a rope has cost 
many a life. Every boy and girl, then, should be thoroughly 
acquainted with rope-climbing. This instruction should be given 
in the higher grades and in the junior and senior high schools. 
To the uninitiated and weakling it is a very tiring exercise because 
the arms are used too much and the legs too little, so from the first 
teach the simple climb with one hand, continually leading with the 
rope clamped by the feet, then later hand over hand without the 
use of legs and feet. In some cases it may be necessary to start 
by chinning oneself on a bar until the arms are strong enough to 
climb. Such practice as standing and sitting on the rope, taking 
the rope up, the end held over the shoulder should be given later. 
Holding the body in an inverted position, descending head first and 
descending with objects like the medicine ball in the arms is an 
excellent preparation not alone for saving one’s own life, but for 
saving that of others. 
Rope-climbing forms a part of the first arrangement of apparatus 
in the University of Pennsylvania Gymnasium. In this arrange- 
ment there are four sets of apparatus, each set having six pieces. 
At the beginning of the term a test is given upon the horse and ropes, 
the rings and low horizontal bar. Students who fail in three or 
more of these four set exercises are called first or low grade. Those 
who properly perform three or more of the test movements are 
known as second grade. The third grade is composed of class 
leaders, of whom there are about one hundred, while the fourth 
grade consists of the gymnastic team. 
The test is a climb hand over hand without assistance of feet 
or legs, up the vertical rope a distance of 22 feet. For a 
series of years these tests were given before and after the gymnastic 
lessons for statistical purposes and again to measure the benefits 
derived from such a course. It was found in the initial rope-climb 
( 203 )
-P-A-G-E-198
204 GYMNASTICS IN EDUCATION 
that over 50 per cent failed to ring the bell or reach the requisite 
height while after 10 lessons in this art over 80 per cent passed the 
test. 
Many, during the first climb, overestimate their ability and are 
likely to slip and get burned hands. When the student appears 
spent he should be immediately ordered to grasp the rope between 
his feet and descend. 
The rope is superior to the pole and bar in chinning exercises 
because it is not fixed and allows a more natural movement of the 
body. Every gymnasium and playground, whether small or large, 
should have installed plenty of ropes. The best rope for both dur- 
ability and comfort is that made of cotton. It is better to alternate 
climbing movements with others as illustrated in the following 
lessons, a continuous series of climbing movements is too tiresome.

CHAPTER XV. 
CLASSIFICATION OF GAMES AND RELAY RACES. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tue playing of gymnastic games is one of the best forms of 
physical education. To treat this subject properly would require a 
complete book, so I have selected three reference books and allude 
to these in my classification. 
Games are divided into three groups, quiet and singing games 
for very young children, games of low organization such as dodgeball 
and group contests, in which few or many persons may play either 
in circle or file formation or in opposing groups, games of high 
organization like baseball, football, basket ball and captain ball 
in which each individual has a specific part to perform. 
The sense perceptions are quickened in the playing of games. 
The clumsy, awkward boy becomes agile and expert. The quicken- 
ing games used in the American Army during the World War were 
a potent factor in teaching men to think quickly and to act with 
precision and promptness. It was two former football players who 
by snatching away the pistol before a second shot could be fired 
frustrated the attempted assassination of President Roosevelt and 
Mayor Gaynor. 
Social development through games is quite pronounced. A boy 
can there learn how to take defeat without whimpering and to win 
without requiring a larger sized hat. The timid, bashful boy may 
learn to grasp opportunities while the bully should be taught self 
restraint. 
The most important training that comes through games is the 
development of the will. One must give a challenge or take risks 
in a game as in after life. In obeying the rules of the game one is 
laying the foundation for the better observance of civic and moral 
laws. 
Games should be well supervised or directed. The pedagog 
should understand thoroughly the games he teaches. The teacher 
should insist that boys and girls stop short of the point of exhaustion, 
( 208 )

CLASSIFICATION OF GAMES AND RELAY RACES — 209 
Again everything in play that is dangerous to life or health should 
be excluded as far as possible. Overanxiety to win should not be 
mistaken for courage, but should be restricted. In games of 
“follow the leader” boys may be compelled to do such feats as 
running across thin ice or diving or jumping from high places into 
deep water. Such tactics are always dangerous to life. Unregu- 
lated games have a moral danger. The vicious fighting element, as 
sometimes exhibited in games should be restrained. An honest 
coach will never allow his team to resort to brutality and underhand 
deception in order to win a game. Strategy, where intellect and 
movement are combatted against each other is necessary in games, 
but dishonesty and viciousness, never. The most simple play or 
game undirected may be dangerous and the only way to solve the 
problems of physical and moral pedagogy is to teach at all times in 
games the spirit of fair play.

Gymnasium,” Jessie H. Bancroft (B).

HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS. 
1. Have a perfect knowledge of the games taught. 
2. Explain the games thoroughly. Illustrate when necessary. 
3. Discipline is as necessary in games as in other forms of physical 
work, 
4. Insist on fair play, enforce the rules. 
5. Keep every one busy; check up the slacker and help the weak 
and awkward. 
6. Develop the spirit of play and have a good time yourself. 
7. Encourage the losing team. A winning team does not need it. 
8. Do not forget that most games may be modified to meet con- 
ditions or equipment at hand. 
9. Always assemble the class when games are finished. 
CLASSIFICATION OF GAMES AND RELAY RACES. 
Quiet Games.—These games are not necessarily noiseless or 
lacking in movement but are distinguished from the active games 
largely by the lack of chasing or other vigorous exercise. gely by

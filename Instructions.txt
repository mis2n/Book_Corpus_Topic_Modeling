Instruction for running NLP code

I have provided a bash script that install all dependencies except for Tesseract. Tesseract can be 
challenging to install on some systems and requires administrative permissions. This code has been 
tested and verified on the MTSU Azure system.

To install the dependencies, simply run the bash script as < ./setup.sh >

Once installation is complete, the topics.py program, found in nlp_code/nlp/ can be executed as
< python topics.py path_to_file >. I have included a sample file, test2.txt. Additional files are
available in the directory nlp_code/text_files/. I have also included a demonstrational Jupyter
notebook at nlp_code/nlp/Demonstration.ipynb. This notebook demonstrates each component of the NLP
process, as well as a demonstration of the hierarchical summarization technique. The summarization
code carries a warning as it does take a very long time to run (a few hours per book).
